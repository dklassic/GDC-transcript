00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:17,127
Hello. My name is Daniel Kelly. I'm the associate director of the Center for Technology and Society at the Anti-Defamation League.

2
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:29,633
And today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about what online games as digital social spaces can learn from the failures of traditional social media over the last 10 years or so.

3
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,374
So let's dive in. A little bit about me.

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,435
These are.

5
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:40,051
My identities, that's me at Sleepaway role playing slash computer game camp in 1999.

6
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:47,516
And there's me right before COVID-19 talking about online games and making them respectful

7
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:53,320
inclusive communities for all people. I don't work in the game industry, but I'm a lifelong gamer.

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,222
Shout out to Dark Sun Shattered Lands, a classic.

9
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:03,499
And again, I don't work in the game industry, but I am a game advocate and I do game advocacy

10
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,243
at an organization called ADL and in the department of ADL called CTS. So ADL is the

11
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:15,987
Anti-Defamation League, which is a nonprofit that was founded in 1913 with the mission to stop the

12
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:22,571
defamation of the Jewish people and secure justice and fair treatment to all. The mission of CTS,

13
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:26,153
the Center for Technology and Society, where I work, is that same mission.

14
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:31,766
but focus specifically on digital spaces. So traditionally, we've worked with social media

15
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:37,831
companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, YouTube on addressing hate on their platform

16
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:42,435
and making sure that their communities are respectful and inclusive for all people

17
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:47,899
and are made more so. And sort of around the time that the center was established at the end of 2017,

18
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,841
we started thinking and working on

19
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,212
games and specifically online games as digital social spaces and thinking about what we can

20
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:03,335
take from our work with social media and apply to online games as digital social spaces.

21
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:09,038
So we all know that online games are digital social spaces. I don't need to tell that

22
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:15,721
this audience that. And they have been that for years. This goes back to the games that

23
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:19,583
I played when I was younger like EverQuest and Ultima Online that were social.

24
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:21,002
and even back before that.

25
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:24,203
However, in recent years, we really seen an uptick

26
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:26,564
in the degree to which games are social

27
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:30,245
with the huge advancements in mobile gaming

28
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:32,745
with cross-play allowing people to play

29
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:34,126
across different platforms.

30
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:40,707
And in 2020, Newzoo, which is a data analytics firm

31
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,148
that tracks data in the game industry,

32
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:48,089
listed as their top sort of trend for the year.

33
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:53,029
and this is a quote from them, is increasingly difficult to find someone between the ages of 12

34
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:59,012
and 30 who doesn't play games, especially in Western and Asian markets. For these younger

35
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:04,814
generations, games are replacing social networks as the go-to digital destinations to meet and

36
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:10,897
socialize with friends. And so I put on the slide two examples of something that's happened just in

37
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:16,620
the last few months. We saw Animal Crossing be used as a space for protest. So this is a picture of a

38
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:19,297
Black Lives Matter protests in Animal Crossing.

39
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:22,438
We saw PETA use it for animal rights protests.

40
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:24,738
We saw a sitting member of the U.S.

41
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:29,119
House of Representatives use it to engage with supporters and constituents.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,320
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

43
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,961
And on the flip side of the coin, here we have Fortnite

44
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,802
being used as a concert venue.

45
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:42,823
So Travis Scott, through his concert.

46
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:47,579
turn this sort of battle royale shooter into a concert venue for 12 million people.

47
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:55,123
So it's a really exciting time for all different uses of online games as social spaces. But at the

48
00:03:55,163 --> 00:04:01,607
same time, it's at the same time that we're excited about the expansion of these spaces.

49
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,889
It's a time to be a little circumspect and ask hard questions.

50
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:10,043
about the expansion of online games as digital social spaces

51
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:12,704
and what that will mean for those who want to use

52
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:15,325
those spaces to harm others.

53
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,286
For example, in Animal Crossing,

54
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,866
it's being used for political protest.

55
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:21,787
But what is, you know, it may seem like a strange question,

56
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:24,729
but what is Animal Crossing's policy

57
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,929
about political disinformation, right?

58
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,711
If bad actors enter into Animal Crossing

59
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,612
and start spreading misinformation about when,

60
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:33,952
for example, election day is,

61
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:35,473
how does Animal Crossing deal with that?

62
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:47,011
Right? If users are organizing white supremacist events in Fortnite, what capacity does the team,

63
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:53,615
does the Fortnite team have to detect that? Right? What is Fortnite's responsibility to intervene and

64
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:58,679
educate young people who have started on the path to radicalization? Right? I don't think

65
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,282
these questions are answered yet. And

66
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:06,865
And these and many others, if game companies are not already

67
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:09,946
thinking through and working on these questions,

68
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:12,667
they will only become more urgent as time goes on.

69
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:16,588
And what we can see here, this is a survey

70
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:19,449
that ADL put out in 2019.

71
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,170
And what we can see in the survey

72
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,732
is that a lot of the phenomenon of digital social spaces

73
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:29,932
that social media is getting a lot of flack in the press

74
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:30,472
for now.

75
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:39,345
exists in really meaningful and expansive ways in online games already. So here we have,

76
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:46,409
this was a survey, a nationally representative survey of hate and harassment in American adults

77
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:53,493
in online games, and 74% of American adults experienced some form of harassment in online

78
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:59,537
games, and 65 experienced severe harassment, which is discrimination based on identity.

79
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:01,057
You can see the breakdown of...

80
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:10,348
of which identities were targeted on the right there, as well as sustained harassment, sexual

81
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:18,291
harassment, stalking and doxing. So these are really serious issues that I think it's pretty

82
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:23,052
clear that, you know, Facebook and the like are getting a lot of flack for not addressing these

83
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:30,734
kinds of harms, but they exist and they exist in large amounts in online games as well. Similarly,

84
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:35,991
we measured the extent that extremism, disinformation, and conspiracy theories

85
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:42,056
exist in online games. So, for example, we asked players, did they hear discussions about

86
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:49,122
the superiority of whites and the inferiority of non-whites, which is sort of textbook white

87
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:55,227
supremacist ideology. And 23 percent of American adults responded saying, yes, they had been

88
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:59,971
exposed to the conversation about that. Can we, we can't really extrapolate more from a,

89
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:00,912
from sort of a survey.

90
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:04,086
But in terms of like, are they recruiting?

91
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:06,567
Are they just hearing it?

92
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,449
Is it just being normalized in the conversation?

93
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:14,173
We can't really know from the sort of broad coverage

94
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:16,715
of a survey, but it is something to be concerned about.

95
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,257
It's something that the game industry should take notice of

96
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:22,119
that as we are seeing extremists

97
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,862
on traditional social media, so too there may be,

98
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:28,965
and we need more research and information and work.

99
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,581
to determine the true extent, but this is definitely an indicator that it's worth the

100
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:41,363
game industry turning their attention to. So I've sort of lumped together online games and social

101
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:46,524
media so far, but they are of course very, very different, right? And so how do we determine

102
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:52,505
sort of where in the life cycle of the digital social space online games are versus social media?

103
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:57,446
One way we can do that is to look at their terms of use, their code of conduct. So

104
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:06,075
In theory, digital social spaces are ruled by these, are governed by these sets of rules, right?

105
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:11,896
A company puts forth their terms of use of code of conduct, which a user agrees to do, you know,

106
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:18,057
to abide by on their service, and it is enforced. You know, in the cases of many sort of very large

107
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:23,539
platforms, it can be very hard to enforce code of conduct or community guidelines

108
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,999
consistently and at scale.

109
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:32,700
So it depends on the platform, whether these are rules that govern the platform in theory,

110
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,182
or are they actually the way in which the platform is governed.

111
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:42,867
But at the very least, these rules and these codes are a public expression

112
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:46,869
of that company's responsibility towards their players or users and their sort

113
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:50,272
of philosophical approach to the idea of content moderation.

114
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:55,955
So if we look at League of Legends in 2020, this is what's currently on their website.

115
00:08:56,474 --> 00:09:02,820
we can see a wide spectrum of different kinds of behaviors

116
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,443
sort of incorporated in one rule, right?

117
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:10,226
Offensive, harassment is included here,

118
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,609
sexual harassment, hate speech, right?

119
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,272
Racially charged speech or racial racism,

120
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,737
defamation, all sorts of different kinds of...

121
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,021
of hate and harassment is sort of all bundled into one rule.

122
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:33,862
And in order to sort of get a corollary kind of rule

123
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:36,323
in social media, you kind of have

124
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,123
to look back at Facebook in 2006,

125
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:44,324
which where we see these rules for all different kinds

126
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,805
of content bundled into one rule.

127
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:51,246
And if we look at Facebook in 2020, this is sort of...

128
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:58,529
an excerpt from one tier of Facebook's hate speech rules.

129
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,252
It is a portion of tier one of their hate speech rules,

130
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,813
which is divided into three tiers.

131
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,535
And this is one form of behavior, right?

132
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:11,837
And I'm not saying that Facebook is the example here, right?

133
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,199
They have a lot of problems,

134
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:19,442
but I think if we look between their 2006 rules,

135
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,603
which lumped all of these things into one,

136
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:36,054
And we look at 2020, we can see the degree to which they've been faced with a variety of different kinds of behavior and had to adapt their rules to address these kinds of behaviors on their service.

137
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:46,901
And we can see a similar kind of comparison. If we look at Fortnite in 2020, we have these sort of lumps of different kinds of content all put in one rule.

138
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:50,243
And again, if we look at Twitter in 2006, right, we have a very similar.

139
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,498
kind of lumping the rules.

140
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:58,880
And Twitter has also sort of in the past 10 years or so,

141
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:00,621
14 years or so,

142
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:08,224
and made their policies and the rule more granular over time.

143
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:11,766
And so if we think about Facebook and Twitter in 2006

144
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:13,867
and where they were, right?

145
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:17,268
That was the point at which Facebook was going

146
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:20,189
from being a service that was purely for college students

147
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,550
to a more open market.

148
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:30,906
That was a point at which, you know, the press was sort of marveling at Twitter and this sort of new incarnation of microblog, right?

149
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:46,397
I don't think anyone writing or working there was thinking that 10 years from this point, one of the main discussions of the 2016 US presidential election is going to be focused on these two services, right?

150
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:50,120
Facebook in 2006 wasn't thinking 11 years from now.

151
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,862
we're going to be implicated in genocide in Myanmar,

152
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:57,165
of the Rohingya Muslim community in Myanmar.

153
00:11:57,845 --> 00:11:59,306
They just weren't seeing that.

154
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:01,248
They didn't have the benefit of hindsight.

155
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:05,351
And so that's what I'm hoping to provide a little bit here

156
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,873
for the game industry and for online games,

157
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,436
to look at, OK, what did social media do?

158
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:13,577
What is the hindsight lessons that

159
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:16,119
can be learned from how social media has

160
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,081
failed over the last 10 years?

161
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:21,652
that can then be adapted to online games as we move forward.

162
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,013
So I'm gonna divide this into three sort of big failures

163
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:27,133
as we see them for social media.

164
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:31,534
One is that social media was designed for scale

165
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:35,895
and engagement first without centering the safety of users,

166
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:39,256
especially for vulnerable and marginalized communities.

167
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,397
So the motto of Facebook at its outset

168
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:44,397
was move fast and break things.

169
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:46,658
One of the big quotes from Twitter,

170
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,565
over their lifetime, I think this was from 2012,

171
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:53,527
was that we are the free speech wing of the free speech party.

172
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:57,749
So these are mantras and ideologies

173
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:02,890
that are centering the mass expansion of these platforms,

174
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,392
the engagement of users, and is not really thinking about,

175
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:09,293
OK, when we talk about free speech,

176
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:13,574
how are we thinking about the impact of speech?

177
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,575
When we're talking about breaking things,

178
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:16,715
are we talking about?

179
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,171
Are we talking about the experience of targets of harassment?

180
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:32,093
Do we feel comfortable breaking the society that we are a part of?

181
00:13:32,153 --> 00:13:34,894
I don't think these sort of large questions were being asked.

182
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:42,255
So for the game industry, we would recommend that they take responsibility for the experience

183
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:43,636
of players and incorporate

184
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:49,959
anti hate by design principles when creating online games. So this is just a small example.

185
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:56,261
When you're designing a new game or when you're changing an existing game, think about these

186
00:13:56,441 --> 00:14:02,484
couple of questions. What are the speech implications of design and policy choices in

187
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:08,227
your game? Whose speech will be most impacted by the choices that you're making? If you're trying

188
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,748
to address a disruptive behavior in an online game.

189
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,627
Is it best addressed through changing a product?

190
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:18,748
Is there a form of community moderation,

191
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:23,250
empowering users to enact the norms of the community

192
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,310
that you can work toward?

193
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:28,952
Or is there a need for a real global policy

194
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:31,393
that will state both for users and for the public

195
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,114
that this kind of behavior or these kinds of ideologies

196
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,355
are not welcome on our service?

197
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,436
And how do you go about resourcing

198
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,117
each of those different approaches?

199
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:46,776
And third, I'll say, what kind of research would be valuable as you are building these,

200
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:55,003
your game platform or changing your game? Who's doing that research? How can you connect with

201
00:14:55,063 --> 00:15:02,970
them? Making sure that all of your design and policy and moderation decisions are informed

202
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:08,975
by research that either you are finding or that even potentially that you are initiating and

203
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:09,936
conducting yourself?

204
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:17,577
So failure number two of social media is changes as crisis PR.

205
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:20,899
So we had these platforms that were built for scale and engagement.

206
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:25,582
And when we see the real world impact of these of these systems,

207
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:30,284
despite calls from ADL and other organizations over the years to change,

208
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:35,107
the time where we see real change on these platforms is in response

209
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:40,250
to real life tragedies that cost human life.

210
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:40,570
So.

211
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,234
There's three examples here.

212
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:46,457
One is in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017.

213
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:50,560
So ADL and other organizations had been telling

214
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,041
social media companies about the threat

215
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:55,704
of white supremacy for many years

216
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:57,805
and asking them to take it more seriously

217
00:15:57,825 --> 00:15:58,606
and take more steps.

218
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:02,889
But it was only when extremists got together

219
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:07,373
and rallied in August of 2017 in Charlottesville

220
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:11,496
and where we saw Heather Heyer lose her life.

221
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:19,361
that we saw internet companies really take significant steps to address white supremacy

222
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:25,904
on their platform and to really rethink their policies. The same was true of the Pittsburgh

223
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:33,689
Tree of Life shooting in October 2018. So before that, we were telling various internet service

224
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:40,112
providers that Gab is a bad actor platform that does not engage in content moderation, that does

225
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:40,332
not...

226
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:42,818
care about hate speech on his platform.

227
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,180
And it was only after the largest anti-Semitic attack

228
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,003
in American history that various internet service providers

229
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,543
cut off service to Gab.

230
00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:59,665
And the same is true of the Christchurch mosque shooting

231
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:02,426
in Christchurch, New Zealand in March of 2019,

232
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:06,688
the Muslim community in Christchurch, New Zealand was attacked

233
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:11,878
and the attack was live streamed on Facebook Live.

234
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:16,319
And it was only after the murder of many Muslims

235
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,800
in Christchurch, New Zealand, that Facebook did this

236
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,681
and that the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism

237
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:26,602
enacted a cross-platform collaboration

238
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:30,543
that was more expansive than previously.

239
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:34,765
In all these cases, social media,

240
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:43,608
responded to these, you know, was inactive and didn't listen to the recommendations of civil

241
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:50,612
society before these tragedies and used the national spotlight of these tragedies to make

242
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:57,556
the real substantive change after their platform had the tragic effect that, the tragic role in

243
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:59,658
each of these and many other tragedies.

244
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:05,844
So what should online games do to get ahead of this,

245
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:07,825
to make sure that they're not put in the same position?

246
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,546
So they should be proactive, they should be ambitious,

247
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:11,727
and they should be inclusive

248
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:13,728
in making changes to their products.

249
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:19,451
So think about problems that may either be starting

250
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:20,531
to appear on your service,

251
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,492
or may not even be on your service,

252
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,194
but you've seen them over the past in social media.

253
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:29,435
How does your team identify and address extremism

254
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:30,776
in your online game today?

255
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:35,935
How can your team support targets of repeated and campaign harassment in your online game?

256
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:46,301
And build these capacities internally and hand in hand, reach out to civil society organizations

257
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:52,225
like the ADL and others who work in this space and who have expertise on how these things manifest

258
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:58,509
in digital social spaces. We're here to help. Other groups are here to help and

259
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:02,235
and represent the experience of various vulnerable

260
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:05,196
and marginalized communities and how they operate

261
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:08,296
and the problems that they face in online games.

262
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:13,918
And so failure number three I'll talk about

263
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:18,118
is that, and this may seem a little wonky,

264
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:21,599
but there's no real transparency

265
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,619
from the social media companies

266
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,300
about the nature of hate on their platform

267
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,140
and the success they're having in combating.

268
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:34,151
So most social media companies at this point have produced something called a transparency report,

269
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:39,636
which reports on the actions the platform takes on various kinds of content in various kinds of

270
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:45,321
category, whether that's hate speech or harassment or violent content. But right now, all of the data

271
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:51,306
that is provided is unverified by any third party and it uses self-selected metrics. So one of the

272
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:55,369
stories that I tell is there's a major internet company who was talking to us at one point and

273
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:55,610
said,

274
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:58,875
You know, we did XYZ and harassment is down 7%.

275
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:02,738
So 7% of what, right?

276
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:06,941
And what does 7% mean in relative to the experience

277
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:11,785
of targets on your platform, relative to the scale

278
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:13,186
of the problem on your platform?

279
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:19,111
How is this compared to other attempts to reduce harassment?

280
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:22,253
So these kind of metrics and the data that's driving them

281
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:25,336
are fairly meaningless, to be frank.

282
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:30,735
No platform at this point can answer these three questions, which is how much hate is there on your

283
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:35,358
platform, what communities are being targeted, and is anything you're doing to address hate on your

284
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:41,042
platform working? Are things getting better or worse? We don't know for any social media company.

285
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:47,106
And so what we would recommend for online game companies is to create expansive, public, and

286
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:51,909
meaningful metrics of the problem of hate on your platform and how you are addressing it. And this

287
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:55,412
is one sort of concrete example of how you could start that.

288
00:20:56,193 --> 00:21:00,159
So most games have or should have a reporting form.

289
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,346
Add to the reporting form an option

290
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,030
that allows users to select which of their identities

291
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,315
were targeted when they are reporting harassment.

292
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,576
Use this data.

293
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:17,370
in aggregate, right, over the course of time, to inform how you build out and change your

294
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,354
platform based on the needs and experiences of different communities of users, and share

295
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:26,598
that data with civil society and the public to say, this is our, no, this is our platform.

296
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:32,062
This is the experience of the players on our platform, and this is what we're doing to

297
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:35,685
address this problem, and here's what's worked and here's what hasn't worked, right?

298
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:44,037
it's really clear that online games could really be a huge leader in this space if they provided

299
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:50,583
meaningful transparency about the nature of hate in their different game environments. Right now

300
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:56,467
there is no game company that I'm aware of that releases a transparency report

301
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:03,473
even at the level of social media. I think in doing so and in following these kinds of guidelines

302
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,715
and other support by civil society and others,

303
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,210
the game industry could really lead.

304
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:14,613
So in summary, be transparent,

305
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:18,235
make your transparency reporting expansive,

306
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:20,456
public and meaningful,

307
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:23,197
prioritize real change

308
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:26,038
and don't get caught in a cycle of crisis PR,

309
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:29,140
be proactive, be ambitious in what you're trying to.

310
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:36,529
achieve in terms of changing and incorporating into the design of your platform, and include

311
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:43,390
the perspectives of researchers and civil society. And then design for safety and inclusion first.

312
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:50,873
Take responsibility for what your players are experiencing in your game and seek advice on how

313
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:56,514
design and policy choices that you're making, excuse me, design and policy choices that you're

314
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:58,515
making are going to impact.

315
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:05,964
your players and especially those from vulnerable and marginalized communities.

316
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:13,867
So I talked a lot about how online games and social media are the same, but there are of

317
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:20,209
course unique opportunities and challenges for online games in and of themselves separate from

318
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:25,471
social media. So one of those is audio content moderation. Of course audio content moderation

319
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,492
is not unique to online games.

320
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:32,194
but it is a large and prominent part

321
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,054
of how people communicate in online games.

322
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:35,755
And currently there aren't really,

323
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:37,115
so there are a lot of tools and techniques

324
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:39,935
that are used for text chat moderation.

325
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:44,757
That's moderating comments in a text chat

326
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:46,357
like you would have on Facebook

327
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:50,718
or you would have on a chat box in an online game.

328
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:53,398
The tools and techniques to do that exist.

329
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:54,699
In audio content moderation,

330
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,379
they're virtually non-existent at this point.

331
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:00,490
and so there is a lot of work that the industry needs to do to address that.

332
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:07,153
We know as a fact that spaces which are not moderated end up becoming,

333
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,934
the disruptive behaviors in them end up becoming the norm.

334
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:15,616
And we really want to, you know, if the goal is to make online games respective

335
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:19,898
and inclusive communities for all people, then the industry, researchers,

336
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:25,621
all of society really needs to step up and invest more in audio content moderation.

337
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:33,547
In another vein, pro streamers and e-sports players are public figures with huge reach

338
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:40,210
and are used primarily for marketing at this point, but can really have an influence in

339
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,111
terms of setting norms for the community.

340
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:48,034
I know many great groups have done a lot of work on this, especially the good folks at

341
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:48,454
Annie Key.

342
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:58,077
I think there's a lot of room for thinking through how do we reach and influence pro

343
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:03,141
streamers and eSports players to help make online games respectful and inclusive for

344
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:03,561
all people.

345
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:11,446
So, in summary, I guess I'll say, or rather in closing, I'll say two things.

346
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:17,130
So, why action to address hate in games and to learn from the past 10 years of social

347
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,891
media is necessary?

348
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:20,618
There are two factors.

349
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:21,979
So the reason that we do this work,

350
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:27,262
there's a lot of sort of knee jerk reactions to games

351
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:31,044
and wanting to blame games for the ills of all society.

352
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,367
But I know, you know, from personal experience,

353
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:36,288
I grew up as a gamer.

354
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:40,370
I know that games can be powerful and good.

355
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,311
And one of the ways in which we framed the survey

356
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:44,172
from last year was to look at hate and harassment,

357
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,714
but to also look at positive social experiences.

358
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:47,774
So.

359
00:25:49,108 --> 00:26:02,380
88% of players experience some form of positive social interaction in online games, which include making friends, finding community, even finding a partner, or learning about themselves or others, right?

360
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:10,927
The reason why we fight hate in games and try to make them respectful and inclusive for all people is not because games are terrible and games are toxic,

361
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:15,811
because games are great and we want them to be accessible and...

362
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:24,819
We want them to be places where people of all kinds, where people can have these positive

363
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:31,742
social experiences and not feel harassed out of them or silenced. And it's super important for,

364
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:39,365
as games become larger and larger part of our social fabric, that we move to create

365
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:44,827
better spaces for all people. And the other, the less good side that I'll sort of close with

366
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:45,767
is that

367
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,411
The last 10 years, we've seen social media build up platforms

368
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:56,172
focusing on safety second, engagement and scale first.

369
00:26:56,812 --> 00:27:01,254
We've seen them disregard the requests of civil society

370
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:05,515
and use change only as a matter of public pressure

371
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:08,215
or when tragedy and the loss of life

372
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:09,736
implicated their platforms.

373
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:15,197
And third, we are totally in the dark about...

374
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,761
the nature of their platforms

375
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:18,882
and whether anything is getting better.

376
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:21,404
And so when lawmakers hear those three things,

377
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:28,088
they question the ability of social media companies

378
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,649
to govern themselves, right?

379
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,411
We've seen legislation passed in Europe.

380
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,953
We've seen, you know, we have a hearing coming up

381
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:37,715
at the end of July here

382
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:41,998
where tech CEOs are gonna be brought in front of Congress.

383
00:27:42,258 --> 00:27:43,459
I don't think the online games

384
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,580
or the game industry is there.

385
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:58,148
I think if we you know if the game industry doesn't learn from the past 10 years of social media, then I think we will get there and it's and I think neither us nor the game industry nor game players want to see.

386
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:10,872
game the game industry occupying the kind of space in the mind of legislators and and others that we are seeing right now so.

387
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,357
We want, we think games are good.

388
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:15,979
We want that goodness for all people.

389
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,661
And there is a real threat

390
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,483
which social media is experiencing now

391
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:24,646
of control of your platforms being taken away by government

392
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:27,589
who thinks that you're having a deleterious impact

393
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:28,189
on society.

394
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,334
So I'll end there and say, thank you very much.

395
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:37,417
My contact information is there.

396
00:28:37,997 --> 00:28:40,940
And I look forward to continuing the conversation

397
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,600
with many of you.

398
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:49,003
and making sure that online games are respectful and inclusive spaces for all people and that

399
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:54,408
we continue to work together to fight hate in games and learn from the failures of social

400
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:54,729
media.

401
00:28:55,349 --> 00:28:55,610
Thank you.
