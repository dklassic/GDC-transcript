1
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:12,507
All right. Let's get started. Thanks, guys, for all coming out. I hope this will be interesting

2
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:17,752
for you all. Make sure to silence your cell phones and fill out your surveys.

3
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:23,958
So I'm Josh Menke. I'm going to kind of go through some of the things I've learned and

4
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:28,062
some opinions I've created for myself and my own. You guys are free to adopt my own

5
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:30,805
opinions or adapt them to your own or completely reject them.

6
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:35,614
And this is based on experience I've had working for Blizzard

7
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:38,335
and on some of their games at 343 and Halo,

8
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,576
and now working at Activision in general.

9
00:00:40,936 --> 00:00:43,237
So that's kind of where I'm drawing my background from.

10
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:44,777
We all have different backgrounds that you can,

11
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:46,477
big part of my talk is like,

12
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:47,798
I'm gonna talk about some tools

13
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:49,838
and then you guys would adapt them to your own games.

14
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:52,279
Here's the outline.

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,760
I'm gonna start with a little bit of design philosophy

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,140
influenced by my background.

17
00:00:57,177 --> 00:01:00,838
give some definitions, and then just cover in order skill,

18
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,279
matchmaking, and ranking.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,720
There's some design philosophy.

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,802
It kind of starts off with this idea of easy to learn,

21
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:10,183
hard to master, which is a value probably a lot of you

22
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,544
have heard before, which is very similar to this game

23
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:16,546
design, at least for me, to a classic Stephen R. Covey,

24
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,727
like his second habit, if you've read Seven Habits of

25
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,688
Highly Effective People, which is begin with the end in mind.

26
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:24,250
So start designing, thinking about what are people going to

27
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,791
do when they finish the main part of your game or the

28
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:29,112
campaign or the progression system in your game.

29
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:31,533
How are you going to get them to keep playing, which is very

30
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:35,275
similar to something Rob Pardo said at AGC 2006, which is the

31
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,437
way Blizzard was designing their games was that they first try

32
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:39,757
to add years of replayability.

33
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:40,658
That's the first thing they do.

34
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:43,899
And one way to add replayability, at least in my

35
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,200
mind, is to add skill depth.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,162
You make it so there's still things for players to continue

37
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:50,463
to learn years and years into your game and to get better.

38
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:51,263
And.

39
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:54,787
that goes, kind of dovetails into skill and matchmaking

40
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:57,371
because good skill-based matchmaking allows you

41
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:00,795
to have skill depth in your game without making it

42
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,038
so you're hurting players that have not yet

43
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,421
gone into the depth of that and learned

44
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,265
all the amazing things about how to play that game.

45
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,574
And ironically, less skill depth can actually make it

46
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:13,375
harder to matchmake.

47
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:14,697
It makes your game less predictable.

48
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,719
It makes it harder to find who the good players are.

49
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,861
So they're still there.

50
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:18,782
They're still dominating.

51
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:21,606
But they're getting randomly beaten in cases that are

52
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:22,287
unpredictable.

53
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:23,388
And so it's harder to find them.

54
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:30,406
Another kind of design value I've cultivated over the years is even if your core audience

55
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:35,028
of your game is small, it's dangerous to ignore them because they have a loud voice, and the

56
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,970
mass audience, even if they don't play the same way the core audience plays, tends to

57
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,011
listen to the core audience and judge your game by their opinion rather than going to

58
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,212
your website and reading what you try to convince them of.

59
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:48,193
So it's important to engage your community and your core audience in that.

60
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:52,953
Another value, again, talking about audience, and this is

61
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,776
definitely an exaggeration, right? But it's the point that

62
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:58,339
you should consider your audience. And it's like I'll

63
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,043
present some tools and some ideas. And this is definitely

64
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:03,526
wrong, right? It's just a joke. But to stick with you in your

65
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:06,449
head, that this presentation contains some tools.

66
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,348
but you should really think about your own audience.

67
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,029
Like what I'm saying is based on my opinions

68
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,991
and my experience, but you all have your own games

69
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,052
and your audiences, and when I work with teams,

70
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:17,033
I make sure to really try to understand

71
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:20,176
and talk to your multiplayer designers

72
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,637
and figure out what your audiences are like,

73
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:23,318
because different gamers have different passions,

74
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:25,620
and so some of my stuff will be completely wrong for you,

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,102
but it's hopefully the way I'm thinking about it

76
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:30,303
and presenting it will help you to adapt it

77
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:31,204
to your own audiences.

78
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:33,653
All right, so here's some definitions.

79
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:36,956
And these are three overloaded terms probably,

80
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:38,817
skill, matchmaking, and ranking.

81
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,619
So I wanted to kind of go through how I define them.

82
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,261
To me, a skill system is simply any way

83
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,502
of figuring out how good your players are.

84
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:45,483
That's all it is.

85
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:46,403
That's the skill system.

86
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:48,425
Could be lots of different ways, and I'll talk about that.

87
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,930
Next is a matchmaking system.

88
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,871
That's just putting players into matches.

89
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,831
A lot of that is just really hard engineering

90
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:57,192
with dealing with larger, small populations

91
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:58,352
and getting them into the matches.

92
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:00,473
It may or may not use a skill system.

93
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,914
It may or may not need to know about your ranking system.

94
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:05,974
But definitely will influence your skill and ranking systems,

95
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:06,735
and I'll go over that.

96
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:09,715
So it's important if you do want to have skill systems

97
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:11,276
and ranking systems that you consider

98
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:13,977
your designers and your engineers that

99
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:15,557
are working on those systems should be communicating

100
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:15,977
with each other.

101
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:18,709
And then a ranking system is okay,

102
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,030
because I have a skill system

103
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,651
and maybe now I know how good my players are,

104
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,792
should I actually tell them how terrible they are

105
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,454
or do I tell them something else?

106
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:27,275
And this might use a skill system

107
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:28,436
and it might not use a skill system,

108
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:30,317
but they are three separate systems

109
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,098
and your audience is gonna tell you how to do that.

110
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:35,577
So now I'm going to go over each of these pieces

111
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,018
from my point of view here.

112
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,721
So first, the skill system.

113
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:39,061
What is it?

114
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:41,925
Again, like I said, it's any method you want to use

115
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:42,946
to measure player ability.

116
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:44,888
And ideally, it's predictive.

117
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:47,532
Ideally, this method you use to measure skill

118
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:50,255
lets you, in the future, predict what's going to happen

119
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:50,816
in your matches.

120
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:52,977
And why do you care about a skill system?

121
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:54,478
Maybe you're going to use it for matchmaking.

122
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:56,258
Maybe you're going to use it for ranking.

123
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,139
Or maybe you just want to understand your players

124
00:04:58,179 --> 00:04:59,639
and how skill is spreading out in your game.

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,740
And maybe you want to understand how deep your game is

126
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,921
and how much skill depth it has.

127
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,762
And that's something that being able to measure skill

128
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:07,622
in your game can help you with.

129
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,068
So let's talk about some skill systems.

130
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,289
So there's simple stats you can use for skill.

131
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,210
In like a shooter, there's kills per death,

132
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,751
there's score, things like APM,

133
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,872
to kind of measure, some are better than others

134
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:21,653
depending on your game.

135
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:24,634
And they can actually help you figure out

136
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:25,454
how good your players are.

137
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:27,636
Although, just as an aside,

138
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:29,396
before I get into the matchmaking section,

139
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:32,749
skill can have matchmaking interaction issues.

140
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,329
So if you find that, hey, kills per death

141
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:36,870
is a great way to matchmake in my game,

142
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,131
and also I really wanna rank on kills per death

143
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:42,332
so players can see themselves.

144
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:44,613
Well, it turns out if you matchmake really well

145
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,713
on kills per death, everyone ends up

146
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:47,974
with the same kills per death in the end.

147
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,534
And so now you can't really rank on it,

148
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:51,395
or very similar kills per death.

149
00:05:51,855 --> 00:05:53,356
So if you really feel in your game

150
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,796
that I want to show players their true kills per death,

151
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,743
Instead, you need to match make on a representative

152
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:01,487
cross-section of your population to make sure that

153
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,012
there are true kills per death ratios coming out of that.

154
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:08,873
Another type of rating system you might have heard of

155
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,435
are, or sorry, skill system or rating systems.

156
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,276
And this is where we put a magical number on the player.

157
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:14,958
And that's ideally predictive.

158
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,840
I can compare two players' magical numbers

159
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,182
and come out with some guess about how they're gonna

160
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:22,284
perform if they play against each other.

161
00:06:22,644 --> 00:06:24,626
This is where you see values like 1500,

162
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,888
or in other systems you may see values

163
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,909
that are really simple like minus 2.5, 3.2,

164
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,570
things like that.

165
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:32,793
So if you've heard of skill systems,

166
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:33,493
you may have heard of ELO.

167
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:38,786
In fact, ELO is not a skill system, it's a rock band.

168
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:41,387
Sorry, this is a pet peeve of mine.

169
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:43,328
It's a common misnomer.

170
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:45,629
I have heard of a guy, though, named Arpot Elo,

171
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,491
who was a physicist, a chess master,

172
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:52,193
developed a great rating system kind of before 1960,

173
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:53,133
good for its time.

174
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:55,034
I think the core model he used

175
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:56,195
is still a pretty good core model,

176
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:56,875
though it wasn't his.

177
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,256
Like, if you want to get really geeky,

178
00:06:58,296 --> 00:06:59,997
it's even older from some...

179
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:01,939
I'm going to get it wrong.

180
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,224
It's like cognitive psychologists back in the experimental psychologists back in like

181
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:05,344
the 1920s.

182
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:09,537
I think it's inefficient by today's standards.

183
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,098
I don't think it addresses all today's needs.

184
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:13,138
I know a lot of people shoehorn it into their needs,

185
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:15,299
and that usually makes it even more inefficient.

186
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:17,659
So what is a good skill system then?

187
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,860
I think it's one that finds players' skills super fast,

188
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,661
especially if you need it for matchmaking.

189
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,002
If in your game it is important to have good matchmaking,

190
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,122
then being able to separate the good players

191
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:29,463
from the bad players fast is important,

192
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:31,163
because the players aren't going to stay around too long

193
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:31,743
if that's the case.

194
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:35,037
And I also think it should predict match outcomes correctly.

195
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:36,881
So if you give me two players, A and B.

196
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,366
hopefully your skill system will tell you how often player A

197
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:41,367
will beat player B.

198
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:43,728
And hopefully not only will it tell you how often,

199
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:44,948
hopefully it's right.

200
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:48,630
If your skill system is saying 75% of the time,

201
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,531
and you have A play B 100 times,

202
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,412
then A should win 75 of those times.

203
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:56,513
It should give the right probability.

204
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:58,174
Some people get excited that their skill system

205
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:00,235
gives probabilities, but never go to look and see

206
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:01,855
that they're actually giving wrong probabilities.

207
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:03,696
And this is important because you should know

208
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,657
what your skill system is doing.

209
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,445
And this is what I mean by super, super fast.

210
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:11,129
So the state of the art that I built recently

211
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:12,611
has this type of comparison.

212
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:14,734
This is from actual, like, real data simulations.

213
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:17,923
This is the difference.

214
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:20,185
So the dotted line is this player's actual skill.

215
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:22,247
And then what I have on the bottom there

216
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:24,169
is how many games these players are playing.

217
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,510
So this is supposed to show you how fast it takes

218
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:28,072
the different methods to find out your skill.

219
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:30,334
So if you just naively grab something like Elo,

220
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:33,516
you're gonna have a gap of about this type of situation

221
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:35,538
where it's been 100 games and Elo still doesn't know

222
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,200
how good this guy is, whereas a state-of-the-art system

223
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,221
should get it within a few games.

224
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:42,063
That's just to kind of show that contrast.

225
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:43,804
Not that I hate Elo.

226
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,706
And then, the other thing I mentioned is it's important

227
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:49,746
to make sure it predicts correctly.

228
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:50,506
So how do you do this?

229
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,147
Well, you get a set of matches that were not match made,

230
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,487
because that actually biases it.

231
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,608
And I won't go into all that math and reason,

232
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:57,228
but I'm just telling you,

233
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:58,869
get a set of matches that were not match made.

234
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,710
Run your rating system, whatever one you picked,

235
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,650
after each match.

236
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,311
And then when you do that,

237
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:06,631
that rating system should provide you with a probability

238
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,852
that team A was gonna beat team B or whatever you have.

239
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:12,053
So you want to record that probability

240
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:12,993
for each of your matches.

241
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,242
And then for every little probability, you bin them.

242
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:18,183
Let's say just, and that might sound complicated,

243
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:19,984
but let's say you just pick every time I saw

244
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:23,846
75% chance of winning for the better team.

245
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:26,107
Plus or minus like some small amount,

246
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:27,688
.1 or maybe 1% or something.

247
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:28,528
Every time I saw that,

248
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:30,489
I'm gonna look at all the times I said 75%,

249
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:33,050
and then count up how many times

250
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,531
the better team actually won.

251
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:36,692
And that'll give you a percentage of,

252
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:37,833
there, there you'll get,

253
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,014
say there were a thousand times I saw.

254
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,532
I predicted 75%, and out of that,

255
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,533
749 times the better team won.

256
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:48,055
That means your system's kind of calibrated pretty well.

257
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,496
And so you do that for all percentages,

258
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,718
and then you plot those, what you predicted

259
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:54,899
against what you actually saw,

260
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,379
and hopefully you get something like this,

261
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
if it's a good rating system.

262
00:09:58,461 --> 00:09:59,661
And I'll tell you that this is possible

263
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,122
in almost every game, well, at this point,

264
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,064
every game I've worked on, which is a pretty broad range

265
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,605
of games and genres.

266
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:09,016
I want to know that my predictions are precise.

267
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,758
Maybe that's just me, but I want to know that if I'm saying 80%,

268
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:12,658
it is 80%.

269
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:14,840
And why?

270
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,642
Well, let's look at an example of when you're wrong.

271
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,983
So in this case, this is called, to me,

272
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:23,505
from my mind, overestimating how important the skill gap you

273
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:24,206
had in your game was.

274
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,728
My system is saying, in this case, hey,

275
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,049
there's an 80% chance that player A is going to win.

276
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,599
And so I'm not going to match make these two guys.

277
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,341
I'm going to make them wait and find somebody else.

278
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:35,624
But it turns out it was only a 65% chance.

279
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:37,866
So you're making them wait longer

280
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,788
than they really need to for this match,

281
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,370
at least if that's important in your game.

282
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,871
And you're going to lose players

283
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,033
because you're making them wait too long.

284
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:45,634
That's the danger of overestimating.

285
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:48,938
And arguably even worse perhaps is underestimating.

286
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:52,627
In this case, I'm saying, oh, it's a 55% chance

287
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,588
that A is gonna beat B, so it's not too uneven,

288
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:55,548
let's go ahead and let them match.

289
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,969
But it turns out it's actually an 80% chance.

290
00:10:58,429 --> 00:10:59,329
So now you're gonna lose players

291
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:00,669
because you're throwing them into lots of games

292
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:01,270
that they can't win.

293
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,110
You won't lose the other player

294
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,511
because he's winning a lot, but the one

295
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:08,352
that's getting beaten might not be too happy.

296
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:11,012
So that's why it's important to kind of get this right,

297
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,573
to know how your system's calibrated.

298
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:13,913
Don't just use the rating system

299
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,133
and actually understand what it's doing.

300
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,663
Now, another nice kind of aside about all this is it's kind of

301
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:22,264
nice if you go ahead and make a histogram of all your player

302
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:25,044
ratings, all these numbers you created, it's nice if it fits

303
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,905
like a bell curve, which is also called a Gaussian or a normal

304
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:30,525
distribution, because this tells you what skill looks like across

305
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,526
all of your players. And if it's normal, you can take little

306
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,907
cute shortcuts like I can tell a player's relative rank or what

307
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:39,387
percentile they're in just by knowing their number. There's

308
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:41,348
functions you can find in Excel for that. I won't go into all

309
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,088
that, but it's pretty easy.

310
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:45,153
I can also do interesting things like make fake players.

311
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:46,993
So I know what my player distribution looks like.

312
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:48,654
So I can make a bunch of fake players

313
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:50,414
by sampling from this kind of histogram.

314
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:54,035
And now that I have fake players,

315
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:55,956
and I know that my skill system does a good job

316
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:57,376
of predicting who would win matches,

317
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:58,777
I can create fake matches.

318
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:01,638
And being able to create fake players and fake matches

319
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:04,198
is extremely useful if you're wanting to test

320
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:06,179
ranking systems, matchmaking systems,

321
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,060
or just debug your rating system.

322
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,720
It's pretty helpful.

323
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:13,709
And this is an example of actually some real data of like

324
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:16,152
almost 2 million players, 2 million matches around.

325
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,597
And the black line is what the players actually looked like.

326
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:24,043
And the red line is what a true perfect normal distribution

327
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:24,503
would look like.

328
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:25,805
And it's pretty close.

329
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:28,770
Again, this is convenient.

330
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,631
It's not 100% necessary, but it is definitely convenient.

331
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,852
It lets you sample, lets you do lots of fun stuff.

332
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,552
And I'll say from experience again,

333
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,193
I've worked on a lot of different games

334
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:39,814
and I'm getting lazy these days

335
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:40,915
because it always looks like this.

336
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:43,296
It's not exactly this.

337
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:44,436
Sometimes you have to do a little bit

338
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:45,316
of shifting and scaling,

339
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,057
but it's so pretty close to this.

340
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:48,678
And so when I look out in the audience now,

341
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:49,998
I see a bunch of bell curves, I'm sorry.

342
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,711
And so now you're probably wondering,

343
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,393
well, how do I do this and get this amazing,

344
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:56,274
it's not that amazing,

345
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:57,976
but how do I get these skills off players?

346
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,399
The method I use, well, usually is like Elo's method,

347
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:01,960
it's just better.

348
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,441
So if you're used to what Elo did,

349
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:05,703
then you have some familiarity with it.

350
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:08,086
Ratings go up when you win, they go down when you lose.

351
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,929
The amount that you go up and down depends on the strength

352
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:12,430
of the opponent that he was playing against.

353
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:14,959
I think ELA is probably too slow.

354
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,961
Don't worry about the math on the side, it's just a picture.

355
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:20,603
But a good place to start reading is a paper called

356
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:21,763
Online Bayesian Ranking.

357
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:25,986
They do kind of a survey on different rating methods

358
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,587
and have some good proposals.

359
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,409
I wouldn't say read that paper and immediately implement it

360
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:30,929
into your game.

361
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:33,491
I would say make sure you or your engineers understand

362
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:34,811
how it works because there are subtleties

363
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:35,912
and there are constants to tune

364
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,273
that definitely affect that curve I was showing you

365
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:41,315
on how precise your method is and how calibrated it is.

366
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,236
But it's a great place to start reading.

367
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,894
So now let's go on from skill to matchmaking.

368
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:51,256
And like I said, matchmaking, a lot of it actually

369
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:53,037
really is just really good engineering.

370
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:54,618
There's a lot of really hard networking

371
00:13:54,658 --> 00:13:56,079
and plumbing problems that need to be solved,

372
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:57,360
depending on the size of your audience.

373
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,002
And it could be big or small audiences,

374
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:01,183
both bring their own unique problems.

375
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,024
And a lot of that's just putting these players together,

376
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:03,844
getting them to play.

377
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:06,726
And so like, I sometimes offend our engineers

378
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,147
when I'm like, this game doesn't have matchmaking,

379
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:09,668
when they just spent like two months

380
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,450
putting in like a really complicated system

381
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,771
to handle millions of players or whatever.

382
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:14,872
And I'm just meaning skill or something like that.

383
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,408
So design is still important though in matchmaking

384
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,709
because designers help decide how you prioritize

385
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,110
putting these matches together.

386
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,971
Is skill the important thing for your game?

387
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:24,551
Or is it veterancy?

388
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:27,873
Like players don't like to play against players

389
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:28,813
that have been playing for years.

390
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:31,454
Is it, are there social elements

391
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:32,975
you'd rather matchmake on so that players

392
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:36,297
create relationships and play your game longer

393
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:36,817
because of those?

394
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:39,119
Or is latency the main thing?

395
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:45,605
That your game is so twitchy or so reliant on having low latency that that trumps everything

396
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,266
else in your game.

397
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:48,308
It's just not a good experience regardless of skill.

398
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,260
Other things that design should be thinking about doing is,

399
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,621
what do you communicate to your players

400
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,582
while they're waiting for their match?

401
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:57,523
And this is actually,

402
00:14:57,544 --> 00:14:58,824
it turns out to be a pretty important thing

403
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:00,806
because if you show them absolutely nothing

404
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:01,566
and they're waiting around,

405
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:03,367
they're more likely to think something's broken

406
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,489
and quit out and actually it hurts your servers

407
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,330
and hurts matchmaking overall usually when you do that.

408
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,851
That's more of an engineering thing.

409
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:10,892
Engineers could tell you better what the problem with that is

410
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:12,753
but restarting searches over and over again.

411
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:15,004
And so, but if you can show them, hey,

412
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:16,606
it's gonna take about this much longer,

413
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:17,566
or this is how long you're waiting,

414
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,988
or hey, we're searching for players within the skill gap,

415
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,170
or we're searching for players, we found this many,

416
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,011
we're sampling through them,

417
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:24,072
all kinds of interesting things.

418
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:25,213
Players really like that.

419
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:27,055
It just shows them, you wanna show them something

420
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,636
all the time so they feel like something's going on.

421
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:32,780
And the other thing designers can help decide is

422
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,701
how long should players wait

423
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,203
for a given drop in match quality?

424
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:39,896
I think that's kind of an important thing for me, actually,

425
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,737
when designing matchmaking is, let's say, skills are the

426
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,278
important thing. If you're going to give a player a bad

427
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:47,080
skill-based match, then they should feel like they waited,

428
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,601
and they should get used to it. And they waited a long, sort of

429
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:53,203
a long time. And what that is for your game is different

430
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:56,144
across every game. For a shooter, it might be like 30 to

431
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,926
40 seconds. For like a mobile, it might be six minutes or

432
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:01,587
something like that, or a few minutes. But once you've

433
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,669
players, whatever it is for your game, once they feel that,

434
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,409
wow, I've waited, then it's probably okay to give them a

435
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,810
match. Because they know why.

436
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:12,327
So ideal matchmaking. The designer ideal is probably to

437
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,931
put players in games that are fun and maybe have some kind of

438
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:17,114
like planned experience with varying intensity. It's kind of

439
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:20,038
a classic design philosophy that don't just have all super tight

440
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,362
matches and all really whatever. Have some hard, some easy and

441
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:23,963
have it go up and down.

442
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,204
And you got this like business idea, right?

443
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,205
Like the holy grail would,

444
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:30,686
hey, can I put a long-term monetary value

445
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,707
on every possible match I'm going to make per player,

446
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:34,047
and then matchmaking the matches

447
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,388
that maximize that value over time.

448
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:37,929
And I don't think anyone knows how to do that yet,

449
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:38,649
but that'd be amazing.

450
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,250
And also to keep the most amount of players

451
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,551
in your game having fun.

452
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,453
Some realistic proxies we use are things like skill gap

453
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:48,113
and churn analysis and stuff like that.

454
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:51,695
The idea being like we don't necessarily know what fun is

455
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,015
or what it's going to be for this match,

456
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,096
but we kind of know what it isn't.

457
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,335
Another important thing is.

458
00:16:58,663 --> 00:17:00,865
One of the things that really hurts matchmaking in general is

459
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:03,767
if you have too many buckets, too many game modes, too many

460
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:06,649
ways to segment your population. So ideally you find

461
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,331
ways to not have too many ways to segment and break up your

462
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:13,955
population. It helps improve the matchmaking quality. And some

463
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:18,538
suggestions for ways to do this are, for example, if you're the

464
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:20,539
type of game that has a bunch of game modes players choose from,

465
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,423
instead of having a list for every mode, have like a main

466
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:29,113
list they pick from which has some of your main modes in it

467
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:31,495
that are the most popular or the way you define the way to play

468
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:34,037
your game. And then have maybe one or two of those. And then

469
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:38,440
have a couple of rotational modes, lists that you change

470
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,202
every day or every week. So players kind of know that that

471
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:43,223
one mode they really love and they're really mad you took out

472
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,825
is going to come back. And when it comes back, they jump in and

473
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:48,207
play it. But not only them. The players who usually wouldn't

474
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:50,508
play it, they'll play it because, hey, it's available

475
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,750
today. I've never played that mode. So they kind of have some

476
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,270
win-win there.

477
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,716
And then if you want to get crazy,

478
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:57,878
you can go with things like let players

479
00:17:57,898 --> 00:17:59,381
just thumbs up and thumbs down, whatever they like,

480
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:00,623
and let the matchmaker do the work,

481
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:03,208
and try to optimize some difficult function

482
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:06,314
over getting the player into sort of a match

483
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:06,896
he kind of likes.

484
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,600
Just as an aside, when you're working with your engineers on

485
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,840
this, I just give some advice that not to design a hard rule

486
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,321
system where like it's only this type of game mode or this type

487
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:21,542
of map all the time. It saves a little bit of heartache if you

488
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:25,783
let it be more of a soft value. So you can say, hey, there's a

489
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:29,024
50% chance capture the flag comes up next. And then if the

490
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:32,225
designers really want it to be 100% capture the flag, they just

491
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:35,485
set that to 100. It's just one of these ideas of not having

492
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,986
these hard rules and causing weird exceptions.

493
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,636
stuff like that. I get that from engineers, so that's what they

494
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:45,326
tell me. So it must be right. Another interesting point here

495
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:45,467
is.

496
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:48,077
So matchmaking has evolved over the years.

497
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:50,738
Like the old school matchmaking back when you used to play

498
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,699
on your PC and you fire up some game like Return to Castle

499
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,959
Wolfenstein or whatever.

500
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,501
And you would do the matchmaking.

501
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,922
You go to the server list, probably start by ping, pick

502
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:02,022
the top one, or maybe look at some of the settings, what

503
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,003
they call it, or whatever.

504
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:07,165
And so that evolved to kind of more modern online console

505
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:10,706
gaming, where instead your game says, hey, matchmaking

506
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:11,586
service, I need some games.

507
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,567
It sends like 50 of them, and it automatically sorts through

508
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,568
that list and tries to find one.

509
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:18,676
And then there is the evolution to no, I just say,

510
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,437
hey, matchmaking service, I need a match,

511
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:21,557
and it sends me back one match.

512
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:22,758
And that's what I'm talking about here

513
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:23,758
with global optimization.

514
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,059
Some games already use this,

515
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,280
so some of you this is like no duh.

516
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,541
For some of you it's like, oh, we've never tried this before.

517
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,670
I've been on a few games where we've shifted from the old way

518
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,691
to the new way, and it actually seemed to make a bigger

519
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:35,671
difference than I expected.

520
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:37,812
Because it's easy to do a little bit of envelope math

521
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:39,732
and figure out, OK, it's going to be a subtle improvement.

522
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:41,473
But actually, in practice, it was nicer.

523
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,753
I will make the comment, though, that it's kind of hard

524
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,334
to directly compare those methods.

525
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:48,535
Because people don't usually build both of them for a game.

526
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,775
There's not enough time to have both the old way and the

527
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,816
new way online in one game at the same time to compare,

528
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:54,516
because they're both expensive to build.

529
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:59,038
So I think it's better, but I really don't have a whole ton

530
00:19:59,058 --> 00:19:59,698
of data to show it.

531
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:03,187
So I mentioned this a little bit before,

532
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,488
but if you're doing, matchmakers are complicated systems,

533
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:09,249
so it's pretty good to QA them, to test them,

534
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:10,049
make sure they're working right.

535
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,129
And one way to do this is, again,

536
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,449
I have a model that I already know

537
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:14,429
is pretty good at predicting.

538
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,870
I already know what my player distribution looks like,

539
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,890
I can predict outcomes,

540
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,510
so make a bunch of fake matches again,

541
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:24,351
and matchmake, so put these players in with their skills,

542
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,232
matchmake them, and then run the model on them

543
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:27,692
and see if,

544
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:31,094
if your matchmaking system is working correctly.

545
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:32,515
And you can use that to test matchmaking,

546
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,317
which is more of a debugging thing.

547
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:36,159
But you can also use it to test ranking,

548
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,581
which means both testing the ranking model you picked

549
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:39,922
or comparing ranking systems.

550
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,364
And we'll talk about that in a minute,

551
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,145
but it's a good way to,

552
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,347
you can do a lot of things this way.

553
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:46,168
You can do both design and testing.

554
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:50,230
And so this leads kind of into measuring.

555
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:52,713
So you've got that, a few different parts of measuring

556
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:53,635
when you're doing matchmaking.

557
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,237
First, are you predicting right?

558
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,218
And I've discussed that already.

559
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:57,660
Make sure those probabilities make sense.

560
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:00,765
Because otherwise, who cares if we're using these values

561
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:02,007
in our matchmaker if they're wrong.

562
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,678
So second, okay, I know these ratings are right,

563
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,079
but are we actually using them the right way?

564
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,740
And this is mostly for debugging,

565
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,821
so this is just an example of one way,

566
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:13,242
a very simple way to say, hey, is my matchmaker

567
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:14,263
doing what I told it to do?

568
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,484
So let's say you're matchmaking on skill in this case.

569
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:20,006
So what I'm graphing here is a histogram of the skill gap.

570
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:22,648
that of every match I'm seeing in my system

571
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:25,090
and how many gains I've seen at that skill gap.

572
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,993
So if you're matchmaking correctly and tightly,

573
00:21:28,694 --> 00:21:30,435
this should be shifted, kind of like this is,

574
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,597
up close to zero.

575
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:33,939
The closer to zero, the better in theory,

576
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:36,221
if you think that super tight matchmaking is important.

577
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:37,743
I drew an arbitrary line here,

578
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:39,024
and I called this the point of which

579
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:41,326
matchmaking beyond this is a bad match.

580
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:43,949
And in this case, it's about 3% that are bad.

581
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:47,343
and this is to contrast with something like this,

582
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:51,205
where in this case 16% of the matches are bad.

583
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:53,586
It looks still a little shifted over to the left,

584
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:57,367
but that's because if players are normally distributed,

585
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,807
most of them are near the middle,

586
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,648
so just completely random matchmaking

587
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:01,628
actually isn't terrible.

588
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:03,729
But that 16% of the players,

589
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,230
if you have a type of game

590
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,950
where skill matchmaking isn't important,

591
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:09,151
they're gonna be pretty loud and pretty mad about it.

592
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,392
So it's not great.

593
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:12,652
You still don't wanna necessarily get away with this

594
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:13,773
if you feel it's important for your game.

595
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:18,563
So there's an interesting thing I've noticed, like, working

596
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,483
with a little bit alongside sandbox teams sometimes.

597
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:24,324
And by sandbox, like the guys that balance and design weapons

598
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:25,584
and abilities and things like that.

599
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:28,645
I've seen sometimes where they will create a new sweet ability

600
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:29,365
or some new weapon.

601
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:30,605
They'll go playtest it.

602
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:33,086
And then, like, the few of the awesome players that are in the

603
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,666
playtest just dominate everybody else.

604
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,087
And because they're getting dominated, the design will step

605
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,308
back and say, no, we can't have this ability because, like, good

606
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:42,508
players are just going to destroy all the weak players.

607
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:47,268
Instead, you can actually keep those sweet abilities in there

608
00:22:47,388 --> 00:22:48,609
if you're matchmaking correctly.

609
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:51,351
Because then the players that master those abilities

610
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,112
aren't going to get matchmade against players that

611
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:54,713
don't know what to do against them.

612
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:57,075
So you can have the players that have mastered those abilities

613
00:22:57,095 --> 00:22:58,736
having a great time using them against each other,

614
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,098
whereas those that haven't aren't going to get dominated

615
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:04,200
until they get good enough to play against those players.

616
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,002
So that way you don't need to remove stuff

617
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:07,062
that's going to add skill depth.

618
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:09,804
You can keep it in and embrace that instead for your game.

619
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:10,665
And.

620
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,435
Yeah, so that's again going to depend on you personally, the

621
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:16,436
type of game that you're making. But this is just an

622
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:19,557
aside that it enables this. All right. I'm going to move on a

623
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,558
little bit now to talking about parties because this comes into

624
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:26,840
playing a lot of games. Sorry. So usually we can't let you play

625
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,241
with friends. This is like a common idea. Because, hey, if I

626
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:30,981
let you play with your friends, you're just going to dominate

627
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,082
the people that aren't playing with their friends. So you've

628
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:35,503
got a party of four. You're just going to stomp over all the guys

629
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:36,343
that aren't in parties of four.

630
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:41,358
So then we say, well, okay, the solution to this is fine.

631
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,900
Instead of, we just won't let you,

632
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,961
when you play with your friends,

633
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:47,622
play against people that are not playing with your friends.

634
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:48,963
But then you get something like this.

635
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,144
You end up with much longer wait times

636
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:53,626
because there are less people playing in parties.

637
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,868
And if you're just getting together randomly

638
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:58,088
with a few friends that happen to be online,

639
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:59,669
you're gonna get destroyed by these players

640
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:02,131
that are usually playing as parties

641
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,292
and have a lot of experience doing it.

642
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:05,753
So that's not a great experience either.

643
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:08,854
So a common solution, not a common solution,

644
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:10,836
one of the solutions I've worked with in the past on this is

645
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,819
instead of tracking skill on each individual player,

646
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,042
when you're in a party, I put a skill in the party.

647
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:18,925
So now I know exactly how that skill's gonna line up

648
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:20,846
with a group of people who are not in a party.

649
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:22,468
And I've done this in games,

650
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:23,529
and it actually works out really well.

651
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,172
And you end up with really even matchmaking

652
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:26,953
between the two teams.

653
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:31,799
It doesn't solve the perception issue, so if people in your game really don't like the

654
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:34,623
feeling of having to go up against a party, it's not going to fix that for you.

655
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:38,388
But in a lot of games, it will make the matchmaking even.

656
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,051
Okay, so, and that's important because it opens your matchmaking pool.

657
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:48,452
It means that, hey, when a really poor team comes in but it's a party of friends, I can

658
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:51,833
matchmake them against a decent group of people who are not in a party.

659
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:56,974
And that way I have an even match, rather than having to try to make this party wait

660
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:57,294
longer.

661
00:24:57,594 --> 00:25:00,755
This party of friends, and playing with friends is almost always more fun than not, but I

662
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:04,676
don't want to make these guys that are having a good time together wait longer for a worse

663
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,536
match or things like that.

664
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,977
So you can, now you can play with your friends.

665
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:11,409
But now you can't play without your friends.

666
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,390
This is another problem you can run into

667
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,751
without that same solution is,

668
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:16,231
you play with your friends for a night,

669
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:19,372
your skill kinda goes up because you've actually played,

670
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,133
some people do, played better

671
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:22,033
when they play with their friends.

672
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:24,314
And then when they go to play the next night,

673
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:25,634
first it's not as fun

674
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:26,835
because you're not with your friends anymore.

675
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,115
That's usually much less fun.

676
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:30,956
And then when they play alone, their skill's been inflated

677
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:32,316
and we're giving them harder matches.

678
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:32,957
But they don't know this.

679
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:34,677
All they know is now they jump into matches

680
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:35,978
that are harder and they're having less fun

681
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:37,798
and they say, I'll come back when my friends are online.

682
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:39,899
And then you kinda lose people that way.

683
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:43,772
So again, the solution is to track the skill of your friends

684
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,313
together, so whenever a party jumps in for matchmaking,

685
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,793
you create a new skill just for the party.

686
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:52,314
Maybe you do something smart and kind of bootstrap that skill

687
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:54,015
based on some history you have of those players

688
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,515
and other parties when they play alone.

689
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,956
And you try to adapt quickly using your skill system.

690
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,777
And it fixes all of the balance,

691
00:25:59,797 --> 00:26:01,517
it usually fixes all the balance problems.

692
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:03,358
It doesn't, again, doesn't fix that perception.

693
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:05,718
All right, so now I'm gonna go,

694
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:07,899
I went and talked about skill, matchmaking,

695
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,760
now I'll segue into ranking systems.

696
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,231
So again, we know how good these players are,

697
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:12,896
what should we tell them?

698
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:17,992
And this is going to depend on the game. Like, depending on the

699
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,094
type of game you have, how competitive it is or what

700
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:23,097
systems it does or doesn't already have. And I'm going to

701
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:25,058
talk about three different types of ranking systems for now.

702
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,042
Progression systems, hybrid systems, and then straight up

703
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:32,344
skill systems. I'll make an aside that you may have a game

704
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:34,546
that you love the ranking system in and you just want to copy and

705
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:36,968
paste it into your game. And I would say don't just do that.

706
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:40,031
Take inspiration from that other game. But think hard about how

707
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:41,752
it should be adapted to your own game.

708
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:45,048
So let's start with progression systems.

709
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:48,670
So you've all seen probably a lot of progression systems.

710
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,031
I'm not an expert in progression systems.

711
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:51,832
There's a lot of awesome designers out there

712
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:53,433
that are great at making leveling systems

713
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:55,794
and unlock systems, usually based purely

714
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:56,855
on time investment.

715
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:58,236
Better players go through a little faster,

716
00:26:58,276 --> 00:26:59,656
but mostly time investment systems.

717
00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:03,219
And these are often for recreational play,

718
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:05,260
definitely not a measure of skill, it's veterancy.

719
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,261
I will say that there's something interesting about

720
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:11,264
these depending on how you design a loading screen. So

721
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:12,965
loading a screen is a screen that comes up while you're

722
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,786
waiting for your match to start and you see all the other

723
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:18,449
players. If your game only has a progression system and it's

724
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:21,811
not matchmaking on that progression system, some games

725
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:24,013
you see this in that you'll have this very disparate

726
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:28,695
ranks from this progression system in it. And players will look at those and wonder

727
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:33,438
why am I being match made. I'm a rank 2 and there's all these rank 35s or rank 70s in

728
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:38,981
this match. How is that an even match? You have to be careful about what you put on your

729
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:39,621
loading screen.

730
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:43,431
And my philosophy as a kind of a purist, if you guys haven't

731
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:46,496
gotten that view of me already, is don't put anything on there

732
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,499
that doesn't actually go into the matchmaking.

733
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,101
At least don't call it out clearly.

734
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:52,645
Some games have such messy loading screens

735
00:27:52,685 --> 00:27:53,787
that it's probably OK.

736
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:55,369
But.

737
00:27:56,538 --> 00:27:59,640
But some make it a little too obvious that you're not

738
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,140
matchmaking on the thing that you're showing me.

739
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,581
So this is as an aside.

740
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,922
And yeah, so you guys have seen these systems in RPGs,

741
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:07,743
in a lot of popular shooters.

742
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:10,564
But again, I'm not an expert on that.

743
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:12,865
But that's just one example of a ranking system.

744
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:23,549
Another is hybrid systems. This is where you're like, I want to get the feel, at least partly the feel of that progression system in my game where I'm kind of leveling up for a while, but I want to have a skill component.

745
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:30,690
And so these systems get pretty complicated because they're trying to kind of take two kind of different concepts and put them together.

746
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:37,591
They're usually pretty tunable. There's a range between ones that are kind of skill based and ones that are more skill based and more skill anchored.

747
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,472
Usually losses can move you down.

748
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:44,034
And by skill anchored, I mean there are some of these systems

749
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:46,335
out here that you can start at one and you move up to 50 or

750
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:49,196
whatever it is that will say, okay, but we won't let you get

751
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:52,638
any past rank four unless you behind the scenes really are

752
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:56,780
some skill. And so in my opinion, and some games don't do

753
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,421
that. They just say, nope, you can go as far as you want as

754
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:01,162
long as you can win matches, whatever. So in my opinion,

755
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:04,884
again, this is gospel according to Josh, is that these are good

756
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:07,265
for games that have no other progression system in them. So

757
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:10,547
you know, we're going to combine both. Kind of a cost analysis

758
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:10,867
type thing.

759
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:14,367
They're good for games where the competitiveness of your game maybe isn't known.

760
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:16,948
You kind of think it's going to be competitive, you want something in there though to get

761
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,589
them some ranks, so you go with that.

762
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:24,071
And also maybe for games that are, everything else in the game is an RPG, so this should

763
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:25,232
probably also be an RPG.

764
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:26,612
It should also feel like I'm leveling up.

765
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:27,693
That kind of makes sense.

766
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:32,034
I think it's questionable for a game that already has an amazing progression system

767
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:32,515
on one side.

768
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,212
and then you put this other progression system

769
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:37,894
on the other, because to me, those systems

770
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:38,835
become a little too similar.

771
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,276
And again, as a purist, I'm like,

772
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:41,698
if I'm gonna design a completely new system,

773
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:42,939
I like it to feel unique and different

774
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,080
than the already existing system.

775
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,922
Otherwise, I feel like it's just gonna become

776
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:48,744
another grind, and players will kind of forget about it.

777
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,727
So other issues that you'll run into with hybrid systems

778
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,649
is ranks end up being kind of meaningless,

779
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:55,170
except when you get near the top,

780
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,972
because everyone's starting at the bottom and moving up,

781
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:58,473
and they're not really separating much

782
00:29:58,513 --> 00:29:59,294
until they get near the top.

783
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,619
And with this type of system, you end up with both

784
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:04,523
pre-game kind of loading screen issues

785
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,229
and or matchmaking issues.

786
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:08,592
And I say and or because sometimes

787
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:09,494
you have to pick one or the other.

788
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,247
If you know a player's skill, for sure in the back end,

789
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,428
you might be tempted to just match make on that skill,

790
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:19,529
despite what your hybrid ranking system is currently showing.

791
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:21,709
It's showing him as a rank one, but I know he's actually

792
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:23,670
more like a rank 20, so I'll match make him against

793
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,451
rank 20s, because that's a fair match.

794
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:27,631
So that gives you good, better match making,

795
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:29,112
but now you get that loading screen issue

796
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:30,572
where I'm matching making a one against a 20,

797
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:31,912
and that's kind of weird.

798
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:35,834
Or on the flip side, you can say, no, I'm going to only

799
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:38,015
matchmake 20s against 20s, ones against ones, whatever.

800
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:39,636
But then in your early ranks, you

801
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:40,636
end up with matchmaking issues.

802
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,137
Because now, in the early ranks, you

803
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:43,037
have all kinds of players.

804
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:45,238
And if you're matchmaking all kinds of players together,

805
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:47,519
you're going to have mushier matchmaking.

806
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,161
And also just the idea that if you start off

807
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:53,222
in a progression system and at some point you hit a wall,

808
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,003
that can be, in some opinions, a little bit

809
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:56,884
confusing for the players.

810
00:30:56,964 --> 00:31:00,165
So these are just some of the issues with hybrid systems.

811
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:07,779
So, right, some hybrid systems, like I said,

812
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,061
will still have an actual skill on the back end.

813
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:14,064
And this slide's kind of about that loading screen issue,

814
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:16,907
where hey, I'm showing why am I at 1500 against a 2200,

815
00:31:17,147 --> 00:31:18,208
that doesn't make sense.

816
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:20,530
But on the back end, we're both at 3.0 in skill, so it does.

817
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:24,013
And so the 1500 is wondering about why he made this match.

818
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:24,914
It's kind of an artifact.

819
00:31:25,354 --> 00:31:26,935
And in past games I've worked on,

820
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:28,497
this problem has been kind of solved

821
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:30,418
by just showing the average.

822
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:32,640
back end skill rating of both teams.

823
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,421
So they see it is an even match,

824
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:37,043
even though the rank isn't even.

825
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:38,724
And in some games it works fine.

826
00:31:38,744 --> 00:31:40,806
It depends on how numbersy your game is

827
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:42,887
and how much players like engaging with that kind of thing.

828
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:44,849
But it is still a little awkward.

829
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:46,610
Alright, so now moving from hybrids

830
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,491
onto just pure skill systems.

831
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,373
So in this system, ranks are tied to skill.

832
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:52,774
If you want to get a rank, you need to actually have that skill.

833
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,036
There's no progression, moving up and down.

834
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:57,457
We focus more on your current ability

835
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:59,499
and your placement rather than progression.

836
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,237
And this is good for clearly competitive games,

837
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:04,978
e-sports focused games, or a part of your game

838
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:06,159
that's more competitive or ranked.

839
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,400
I think they're good for games that already have

840
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,640
a really rich progression system

841
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,601
and can use something unique and competitive

842
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:13,762
for the players that want to engage with that.

843
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:16,918
And the other thing I think that I like to do

844
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,499
in a skill system is make them transparent

845
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,121
because the audience that engages with this kind of system

846
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:22,482
really likes transparency.

847
00:32:22,923 --> 00:32:24,164
And the part of your audience that doesn't,

848
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:24,984
doesn't care anyways.

849
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,867
So make it transparent and don't worry about

850
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:28,928
the parts of the audience that don't.

851
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:31,650
And I'll say yes, ranking systems are always more stressful.

852
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,911
That doesn't go away.

853
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:36,093
But I don't know if I believe these days

854
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:39,496
that being kind of care bearish with your ranking system

855
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:40,677
is gonna save you anything.

856
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:42,538
Your game already is competitive and ranked at that point.

857
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,152
So, it'd be nice if we could actually look at

858
00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:50,253
what this looks like as a player experience,

859
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:51,274
these kind of different systems,

860
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:54,195
without having to actually ship a game with it first.

861
00:32:54,536 --> 00:32:55,736
And we can because, like I said,

862
00:32:55,816 --> 00:32:57,317
okay, I can create fake players now.

863
00:32:58,077 --> 00:32:58,878
I can match make them.

864
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:01,299
I can choose the outcomes of those matches correctly

865
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,340
because I know, you know, 75% chance team A's gonna win.

866
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,661
Well, I'll flip an unfair coin

867
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,362
and if it lands on 75 or whatever,

868
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:08,863
then the better team wins.

869
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,831
And then I can update the visible ranking system because the team just won a match and

870
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:15,591
some people just lost.

871
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:18,534
And I can gather those results and then I can graph it over time.

872
00:33:18,954 --> 00:33:22,116
So I can see where does your rank go over time by simulating it.

873
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:28,541
So let's say we decide to use a raw skill system, like just some pretty raw numbers

874
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:28,661
here.

875
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:32,083
You probably pretty this up as a designer, but this is what a simulation looks like in

876
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:33,524
general if you had a raw skill system.

877
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:37,020
This is showing different kind of archetype players that I

878
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,341
pulled out where I knew their skill because I created them as

879
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:43,282
fake players and then I ran them through the system. Each of

880
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:45,583
these lines does not represent a single player. It represents

881
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,024
the median experience across hundreds of players that were at

882
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:48,984
that skill over time.

883
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:53,025
And so you'll notice in a pure system like this,

884
00:33:53,585 --> 00:33:56,387
we immediately quickly tell the player how good they are,

885
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:59,850
separates right away, and we know right where

886
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,051
the good, average, and bad players are,

887
00:34:01,111 --> 00:34:02,632
and we can matchmake really effectively,

888
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:03,953
because there's no overlap here.

889
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,475
And so that's why I say there's 98% good matchmaking.

890
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:09,277
I picked some arbitrary line for that 98%,

891
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:10,818
but that's pretty nice.

892
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,200
Now let's contrast that with

893
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,942
an inflationary hybrid system.

894
00:34:16,895 --> 00:34:18,837
This is someone, everybody kind of goes up over time.

895
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:20,658
Some, there is a skill component.

896
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:22,940
And what you really want is the better players

897
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,821
to move up faster.

898
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:26,724
So if you make a system like this,

899
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:28,385
you get this kind of fun experience where like,

900
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:30,207
hey, I'm progressing over time, I'm making up.

901
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:31,248
This is kind of fun.

902
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,875
but you'll notice that the matchmaking quality went down

903
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:37,336
from like 90%-ish to like 69%.

904
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:39,537
And this is because of the effect I alluded to before.

905
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:40,998
So if you look at rank 10,

906
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:43,078
look at the type of players that are sitting at rank 10.

907
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,120
You've got good players that have played maybe 25 games.

908
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,381
You've got average players that are sitting at around 50,

909
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:49,602
and then you've got bad players

910
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:50,182
that are pushing 100 games.

911
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:51,983
But they're all at rank 10.

912
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:54,605
So if you match make on rank, which,

913
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:57,207
hey, if you're gonna make a complicated hybrid system,

914
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:58,167
you might as well make it,

915
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:00,749
because usually you do this for more kind of simplicity

916
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:02,630
and making it more clear to the players

917
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,091
what you're doing.

918
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:05,312
You're probably gonna wanna match make on that system.

919
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:06,893
So you match make on rank,

920
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,935
and then now you've got bad players

921
00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:10,876
playing against good players,

922
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:12,477
and of course the match making quality goes down.

923
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,354
So, and also you can see that also makes the ranks

924
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:19,696
at earlier levels less meaningful

925
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:21,458
because you've got everybody at those earlier levels.

926
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,281
So you might look at this and say,

927
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:25,583
hey, there's enough information here though

928
00:35:25,663 --> 00:35:27,545
to tighten up this matchmaking because,

929
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,207
well at the very least I can matchmake

930
00:35:29,247 --> 00:35:31,029
on the number of games played within a rank

931
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:32,471
and then I get really good matchmaking.

932
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:35,157
or maybe I keep a raw skill in the back end,

933
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:36,158
I know how good these players are,

934
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,699
so let's match make on that raw skill instead.

935
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,840
So I said, sure, let's simulate that,

936
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,462
let's see what happens if we just match make really well.

937
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:44,024
And the truth is, yes, you can get great match making.

938
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:45,845
But if you'll notice, what's happened now

939
00:35:46,386 --> 00:35:49,328
is all three types of players are winning just as often.

940
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,751
And because of that, good, bad, and average players

941
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:54,372
are all moving through your system at the same speed,

942
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:56,314
and you can't discern them apart anymore.

943
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,697
And this is kind of bad because now you've made this really

944
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:02,398
complicated hybrid ranking system, but your matchmaking is

945
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:05,600
completely undone it. This is also what happens, anecdotally,

946
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,981
if your designers go off and make an amazing ranking system

947
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:11,342
and your engineers go off and make an amazing matchmaking

948
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:13,883
system and they never talk to each other. Because your

949
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:16,364
engineers are going to make sure that you get tight matches,

950
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:18,605
your designers are going to make a nice progression system and

951
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,166
then this kind of thing can happen.

952
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,474
So I would say you kind of remove the point of your you don't have a skill based system anymore

953
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:29,379
If you think this is right for your game, don't make a really hairy hybrid system make another

954
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:35,486
Leveling system use your XP guy to help you out and progression guy and just tell the players. It's a ranking system

955
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:38,910
Maybe I don't know that might be like tricking them too much. They might catch on that

956
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,593
It's not really skill based, but this is definitely not skill based anymore

957
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:46,900
Okay, so I've talked a bit about what a progression system is.

958
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,720
I'm not an expert there.

959
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,041
Some of you guys probably are,

960
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:50,201
so I'm not gonna go much more into that.

961
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:52,222
A hybrid system is a mix of those.

962
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:56,204
So instead of going more in depth into those two,

963
00:36:56,224 --> 00:36:57,865
I'm gonna talk about what I think are good attributes

964
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:58,585
of a skill system.

965
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:01,026
And I'll leave hybridizing as an exercise for you

966
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:03,627
based on what you guys maybe know better than me

967
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:04,928
about what a good progression system is

968
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,449
and what I think, at least personally,

969
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:08,630
is a better skill system.

970
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:11,697
So again, my personal philosophy, you guys know this

971
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:14,219
really quick, I'm kind of a purist, for better or for worse.

972
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:16,341
Like when I work with game teams, I talk to them a lot

973
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:18,463
about what their audience is, whether or not this is right

974
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:20,826
for them, but my feeling is if you're going to go with skill,

975
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:21,346
go all the way.

976
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:24,269
Because like the players who like skill-based systems,

977
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:24,850
they're going to love it.

978
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,832
And the ones that don't, they're not going to engage

979
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:27,893
with that anyways, they're going to ignore it.

980
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:29,514
So like you don't want to cater to them as much.

981
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:30,715
So go all the way.

982
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:33,810
It's nice if your skill system has a link to the pro players.

983
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,932
If I can look at the skill system and see at least the pro

984
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:39,733
or kind of top amateur players near the top are the same as the

985
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:41,934
pros that are playing in the real tournaments and things like

986
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:44,916
that, live ones, then I'm going to know as a player what I need

987
00:37:44,936 --> 00:37:48,218
to do to get up there. I'll have a good feeling for that. Yeah,

988
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:49,858
sure, it's kind of fictional. Most people are not, of course,

989
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:52,260
not going to get there. But at least I can, you know, kids can

990
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,081
tell their mom, hey, I can win a million dollars if I buy this

991
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:54,761
game and play it enough.

992
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,302
It's also not about, it's about your current,

993
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:01,883
so I like skill systems that are,

994
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:04,084
players focus more on their current skill position,

995
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:05,245
not their progression.

996
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:06,906
So I like things like placement matches.

997
00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:08,447
So like instead of you starting at one

998
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,368
and moving your way up, I say,

999
00:38:09,668 --> 00:38:11,490
you know what, play 10 matches, play five matches,

1000
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,451
and afterwards I'll tell you what your skill is.

1001
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:15,632
And you've seen that in probably a few games I've worked on

1002
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:17,154
or games that have liked that concept.

1003
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,375
The interesting thing about this as an aside,

1004
00:38:20,996 --> 00:38:22,596
if you look, when we went back in these games

1005
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:23,537
that I played, looked at our data,

1006
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:25,837
players tend to play the placement matches.

1007
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:28,318
Players that you wouldn't expect to be as engaged

1008
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:30,759
in PVP in your game will also play the placement matches,

1009
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:31,840
because it's like opening a prison.

1010
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,140
I found out what my skill is.

1011
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,901
And they will tell you that the game they played

1012
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:36,742
after they finished their placement matches was amazing.

1013
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:38,102
It was way more tight than the one before.

1014
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:40,003
Even though usually, if you did your skill system right,

1015
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:40,943
it's probably no different.

1016
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:42,284
But that's a perception thing.

1017
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:44,445
So like, some of these issues

1018
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:45,745
are definitely perception driven.

1019
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:47,166
Okay, so.

1020
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:53,175
Moving on from placement and position. I like games that have

1021
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:57,413
broad meaningful ranks for relatability.

1022
00:38:57,933 --> 00:38:59,333
So instead of lots and lots of numbers,

1023
00:38:59,373 --> 00:39:01,254
I like when you have, so you guys have seen my systems,

1024
00:39:01,314 --> 00:39:03,454
I like things like bronze, silver, gold, platinum,

1025
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:03,954
things like that.

1026
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:06,735
And I like that because players can remember them better

1027
00:39:07,255 --> 00:39:08,976
and also because, I'll show you in a second

1028
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:11,196
what the skill spread usually looks like.

1029
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:13,477
It lets me spread out the skill of the players

1030
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:15,877
such that the difference in skill between

1031
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:17,578
one chunk and another chunk

1032
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,620
basically 3 to 1 odds if those guys play against each other.

1033
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,183
So a silver player will beat a bronze player three out of four

1034
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:27,766
times. And this is cool, I think, because those players

1035
00:39:27,786 --> 00:39:30,968
start to identify and feel what that means like, what that

1036
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:33,630
feels like. A silver player knows what it's like to play a

1037
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,232
bronze player and he knows how hard it is to play a gold player

1038
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:38,374
because you've designed the system with that in mind.

1039
00:39:38,494 --> 00:39:42,117
Because, again, going back to my skill slides, you know how to

1040
00:39:42,157 --> 00:39:44,219
predict the outcome of these matches based on your skill

1041
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:47,221
system. So I like those kind of broad, chunky

1042
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:53,520
gaps. But on the schizophrenic side, I like high personal

1043
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,983
granularity for each player to see movement. So when you

1044
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:58,905
compare yourself between players, I like the chunky ones.

1045
00:39:59,325 --> 00:40:02,448
But I also like to give players enough granularity so they can

1046
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,950
see themselves moving. And that's going to depend on your

1047
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,132
game. Some games, your players want to see movement every

1048
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,754
single game. Others will be every few games or whatever it

1049
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:09,874
is.

1050
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:16,957
So this is where you add things in like tiers within these chunky groups, numbers, some small sub-goals.

1051
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:21,239
They don't really, they're kind of meaningless to compare players within those chunky groups,

1052
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,119
but it's nice for the players to see something.

1053
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:27,221
Okay, another thing I like for Skill System is an endless ceiling for the pros.

1054
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:28,441
So at some point...

1055
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:31,313
You break out into raw numbers and they can go up forever.

1056
00:40:31,713 --> 00:40:33,354
They don't go up forever because in order to go up forever,

1057
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,815
you'd have to have someone who is infinitely good player.

1058
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:37,395
You definitely get players that are better,

1059
00:40:38,115 --> 00:40:39,176
but they're never infinitely better.

1060
00:40:39,756 --> 00:40:41,517
And what I mean by that is the very best player

1061
00:40:41,537 --> 00:40:43,477
in your system is gonna beat the next best player

1062
00:40:43,618 --> 00:40:45,438
some amount of time, three to one, four to one,

1063
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,159
whatever it is, that defines a skill gap

1064
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,060
and that player won't be able to push much past

1065
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,920
that skill gap if your system's calibrated right.

1066
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:53,388
And again, I told you I like transparency.

1067
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:56,310
Anyway, this is kind of how I design

1068
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,471
these school distributions to look.

1069
00:40:58,052 --> 00:40:59,193
Or this is one way I like to do it.

1070
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:01,595
If your audience is a bell-shaped curve,

1071
00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:03,717
you can slice it up, in this case I sliced it up

1072
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:05,458
by what's called a standard deviation.

1073
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:07,120
So if anyone knows about normal distributions,

1074
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,201
they're often talked about in terms of the number

1075
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:11,243
of standard deviations moving out from the middle.

1076
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:13,905
So the middle here is zero, and each line is one,

1077
00:41:13,966 --> 00:41:16,147
plus or minus one standard deviation away from the middle.

1078
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,092
And the nice thing about that is you can usually

1079
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:21,156
tune your system such that one standard deviation

1080
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,779
gives you that three in one odds that you want.

1081
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,205
So this is something you'll commonly see

1082
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:26,967
in games that I've worked on.

1083
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:32,288
and it gives you those broad, chunky ranks that players relate

1084
00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:34,089
to and they know what they mean when they play against other

1085
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:37,250
players. And if you kind of get all these things right and

1086
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:40,052
you're really lucky, you end up with a system that feels really

1087
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:43,013
good because it has integrity. Players trust the ranks in your

1088
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,974
system. They see where the pros are. They see where they are.

1089
00:41:45,414 --> 00:41:46,514
And you get this kind of thing here.

1090
00:41:47,315 --> 00:41:50,196
where like because as I play this game,

1091
00:41:50,236 --> 00:41:52,057
I'm getting genuine feedback about my improvement.

1092
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,338
So the stickiness now is competitive stickiness,

1093
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,339
which is I play a game, I go off,

1094
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:57,980
I learn something new about strategies in this game,

1095
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,181
I apply it and I actually see my rank go up because of it.

1096
00:42:01,962 --> 00:42:03,022
And that makes me excited.

1097
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:06,744
And usually you can go on YouTube and Google and search,

1098
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:09,445
like type in your favorite game, promotion reaction,

1099
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:12,166
and you'll see movies like this that are exciting

1100
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:13,987
and meaning that you kind of did the right thing.

1101
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:14,728
So.

1102
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,628
That actually is the end of my presentation.

1103
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:22,100
So we probably have lots of time for questions.

1104
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:32,712
I do.

1105
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:36,895
A quick question about comparing client-based matchmaking

1106
00:42:36,915 --> 00:42:38,076
versus service-based.

1107
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:41,017
You mentioned one model where the server sends you

1108
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:43,799
a list of games, and you pick one, the best ones.

1109
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:45,740
And the other model is a server.

1110
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,602
You just ask for a game, and it just gives you the better one.

1111
00:42:49,622 --> 00:42:50,383
Can you compare the two?

1112
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:52,684
You say you can do a direct comparison,

1113
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:55,446
because usually titles use one or the other.

1114
00:42:55,846 --> 00:42:58,528
But in your experiences, is it more?

1115
00:42:58,888 --> 00:43:01,650
Is it like, could you compare the two?

1116
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:05,865
Yeah, so in my experience, the server-based approach ends up

1117
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:08,532
being better because it's able to see a lot more matches.

1118
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:11,320
And it gets back to your bucketing situation, where

1119
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:17,623
giving a player only 50 matches to go through means you're kind

1120
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:21,046
of sharding your population already. Whereas the kind of

1121
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:24,028
global server that looks at all possible matches and makes its

1122
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:26,650
decisions has a lot more information to choose a better

1123
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,171
match for you. And that's why my experience has ended up in

1124
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:32,474
actually better matches than I would have expected. So, yeah, I

1125
00:43:32,514 --> 00:43:35,296
personally like that approach. It has its pros and cons

1126
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:37,277
depending on what is the important thing in your game to

1127
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:40,320
matchmake on. So if latency is important for you to matchmake

1128
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,480
on, ping between two clients.

1129
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:45,604
you need some pretty fancy ways for the server to be able to

1130
00:43:45,644 --> 00:43:48,387
quickly estimate what the ping is going to be between all these

1131
00:43:48,427 --> 00:43:51,710
players you have. But if it's skill oriented and not so much

1132
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:56,314
the other ones, then you can do some really good matchmaking.

1133
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:58,416
The server-based.

1134
00:43:58,476 --> 00:44:02,399
The fact that players can leave if there's a lot of churn.

1135
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,601
If there's a lot of churn.

1136
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:06,263
The server-based one.

1137
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,047
players can leave as you have the ranking so you really need

1138
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,829
to be fast with the scale.

1139
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,851
At scale can be enough trouble.

1140
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:14,712
Yeah.

1141
00:44:14,732 --> 00:44:17,395
So that's where the whole, a lot of matchmaking

1142
00:44:17,415 --> 00:44:18,376
is a hard engineering problem.

1143
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:19,798
I better move to Tony.

1144
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:27,974
Josh. Great presentation. Congratulations. So since you've been doing this for so long and

1145
00:44:27,994 --> 00:44:32,458
you've been solving these problems and probably talking to people who have maybe different

1146
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:41,147
goals, I'm curious as to if you've ever been privy to any goals or motivation to or particular

1147
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:43,809
models for not having a 50-50.

1148
00:44:45,295 --> 00:44:49,181
win, loss, goal. We kind of all just accept that. And I'm just

1149
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:51,484
curious if having been in it so long.

1150
00:44:51,865 --> 00:44:53,027
Yes, I've definitely seen.

1151
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:57,435
both really good suggestions on how not to do it, how to not

1152
00:44:57,555 --> 00:45:01,698
always be 50-50 and some very definitely biased reasons. So

1153
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:05,101
I've heard the like, but stomping noobs is fun approach

1154
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:07,623
to that. So let's not give 50-50 matchmaking all the time.

1155
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:13,468
Which depending on your game, it may seem really weird, but

1156
00:45:13,508 --> 00:45:15,830
there are some games where that is the right thing. Well, it

1157
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:16,211
seems to be.

1158
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,182
I've also heard, though, the approach where it's still kind

1159
00:45:21,202 --> 00:45:24,943
of 50-50, but you don't always give a 50-50 match. You give

1160
00:45:24,963 --> 00:45:27,544
like a variety of matches. So you give sometimes, you have

1161
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:30,145
some smart way of saying, no, for this match, I'm going to

1162
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:32,546
give him actually a hard match. For this next match, I'm going

1163
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,487
to give him an even match. For this next match, I'm going to

1164
00:45:34,507 --> 00:45:37,548
give him an easy match. And that was motivated somewhat by my

1165
00:45:37,588 --> 00:45:41,990
past experience where I got, I used to run Wolfenstein enemy

1166
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,030
territory service back in the day in college or whatever.

1167
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:48,829
and we got to the point where the matches were super even all the time and that actually after a while gets kind of tiring.

1168
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:55,933
And so I kind of came up with the opinion that it's okay to allow a little bit of a balance here and there and have a mix of even, hard and easy matches.

1169
00:45:56,293 --> 00:45:57,453
So I don't know if that answers your question.

1170
00:45:57,493 --> 00:46:00,175
We can just keep talking for the next half hour.

1171
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:01,436
Yeah, yeah, we can.

1172
00:46:02,356 --> 00:46:11,681
Hi, I have a question about using a, like so the matchmaking system you talked to, or I guess the skill system you were talking about.

1173
00:46:12,111 --> 00:46:15,792
but specifically just predicated on whether you win or lose.

1174
00:46:16,392 --> 00:46:18,333
Not quite, you know, but something similar to that.

1175
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:21,334
So my question is, have you thought much

1176
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:24,815
about using a more sabermetric style approach

1177
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:26,495
to ranking the skill of players?

1178
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:29,336
Because we have so much analytical data

1179
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:29,977
that we get back.

1180
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,601
from the game and I wonder in particular for,

1181
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:36,183
like, because the win-loss approach works really well

1182
00:46:36,203 --> 00:46:38,603
I think for 1v1 sort of games,

1183
00:46:38,683 --> 00:46:40,444
but when you have like a MOBA where there's

1184
00:46:40,524 --> 00:46:43,505
sort of different roles and different positions,

1185
00:46:44,126 --> 00:46:46,446
like, I guess, just what are your thoughts on sort of

1186
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:49,047
going to, because like an example is you could have

1187
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,708
a baseball player on a really bad team,

1188
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,249
but you can still like sort of analytically say,

1189
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,050
okay, this is a really good baseball player,

1190
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,390
even though their team's terrible.

1191
00:46:56,883 --> 00:47:00,565
Yeah, and there definitely are models that we use that account

1192
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:04,066
for that, too. A lot of that stuff I can't talk about as much

1193
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:07,347
because some of it works really well. But, yes, you can take

1194
00:47:07,387 --> 00:47:10,548
stats out of the game and if you're a data scientist or

1195
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:13,109
working with data scientists, you can come up with ways of

1196
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:17,550
either pushing that win-loss system along faster or measuring

1197
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,891
players in a different way. Yeah.

1198
00:47:20,892 --> 00:47:25,317
And so I work on a lot of smaller multiplayer online

1199
00:47:25,337 --> 00:47:25,638
games.

1200
00:47:26,379 --> 00:47:29,743
And I'm wondering if you've had any experience with that.

1201
00:47:30,343 --> 00:47:32,345
When does skill-based multiplayer,

1202
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:35,349
or skill-based matching, what is the size of the population

1203
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:37,451
that you need to have that be effective?

1204
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:40,006
It's going to actually depend somewhat on the game, which is

1205
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,067
why I talked a bit about simulations. So using this

1206
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:46,548
type, a good skill system, you can feed fake players into your

1207
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:49,089
matchmaking system of varying sizes and see if your skill

1208
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:54,112
system stays stable. One old rule of thumb I used to use is

1209
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:57,913
you want about like at a given time when you go to matchmake,

1210
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,890
this isn't actually just for the skill system. This is more for

1211
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,871
having pretty good matchmaking. And again, this is a rule of

1212
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:07,812
thumb I've used in the past. That may not even be true. But I

1213
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:16,653
did notice that when we had at least 40 players, 40 people per

1214
00:48:16,673 --> 00:48:20,254
the number of players you needed in the match looking for a match

1215
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,315
at any given time, you could end up with pretty good matchmaking.

1216
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:25,144
So if it's 1v1, that would be 80,

1217
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:26,685
because there's two players per match.

1218
00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:30,706
If it's 4v4, then that would be like 320 or whatever it is.

1219
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:32,367
So yeah.

1220
00:48:32,627 --> 00:48:33,407
Thanks.

1221
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:33,868
Yeah.

1222
00:48:34,568 --> 00:48:36,829
OK, so quick question about decay.

1223
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:39,490
What are your thoughts about that, and have you any data?

1224
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:42,011
So what I mean is you presented stuff

1225
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:44,972
that looks like new better systems, like TruSkill

1226
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:45,712
and that kind of stuff.

1227
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:48,593
There's also this approach of skill decay

1228
00:48:48,653 --> 00:48:49,834
with glyco, for instance.

1229
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:52,216
And is that helpful?

1230
00:48:52,736 --> 00:48:56,059
So you're asking about like, do you apply those systems?

1231
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:57,320
And what are your experiences?

1232
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,681
Should one apply for it?

1233
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,404
The idea is that the longer you don't play,

1234
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,305
the more skill you lose, right?

1235
00:49:03,385 --> 00:49:04,947
And it kind of makes intuitive sense,

1236
00:49:05,007 --> 00:49:07,389
because there's a meta game in, for instance, MOBAs.

1237
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:10,091
So the assumption is, if the guy doesn't play for a month,

1238
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:10,552
he's going to lose.

1239
00:49:11,023 --> 00:49:11,643
downgrading.

1240
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:15,767
Yeah, so I have actually worked with Decay in the past.

1241
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:19,111
He's asking about systems where if a player's not around for a while, you actually decay

1242
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:23,294
his rating or he makes an estimate that his skill has changed since he's been gone.

1243
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:28,914
It's pretty tricky to move a rating around in most of these

1244
00:49:28,954 --> 00:49:31,014
systems without really knowing what you're doing because the

1245
00:49:31,074 --> 00:49:34,075
algorithms are fairly complex and moving a rating manually

1246
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:36,275
requires some pretty good understanding of how the

1247
00:49:36,315 --> 00:49:39,636
algorithm works. So to go in a little extra math detail, most

1248
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:42,377
of these more state of the art algorithms keep track of not

1249
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:45,398
only a player's rating but what's called a variance or

1250
00:49:45,498 --> 00:49:48,538
uncertainty about a player's rating. That uncertainty is

1251
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:51,399
like, okay, I know he's like somewhere between 1,500 and

1252
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:53,639
2,000 but I'm not sure exactly what. And over time that goes

1253
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:53,859
down.

1254
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,963
So if you move a rating, you also need to move that variance.

1255
00:49:59,803 --> 00:50:01,945
And in the past I've moved the rating without moving the

1256
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:06,749
variance and that was bad. I've decayed ratings. I've made some

1257
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:09,851
mistakes decaying ratings. I think in hindsight the decays

1258
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:13,774
often worked out pretty well. It just needed more polish. If I

1259
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,975
were to go back and do that again, I would be more confident

1260
00:50:17,136 --> 00:50:18,798
given the math I know and understand a little better now.

1261
00:50:19,903 --> 00:50:22,485
moving the rating and correctly resetting the variance to the

1262
00:50:22,525 --> 00:50:25,767
proper value. Or not even moving the rating but increasing the

1263
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:28,669
variance. Which means the player comes back and loses his first

1264
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:34,192
match but he's okay after that. So, yeah. I'll follow up on

1265
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:38,715
that. It seems like the variance is there for is to account for

1266
00:50:38,755 --> 00:50:42,037
that. Why would you need to decay the rating? The math is

1267
00:50:42,297 --> 00:50:42,977
supposed to handle that.

1268
00:50:43,295 --> 00:50:47,039
So if you've done some data analysis that tells you

1269
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:50,362
something exact and you know that when a player's been gone

1270
00:50:50,402 --> 00:50:53,184
two weeks, I've observed when he comes back, he always drops

1271
00:50:53,225 --> 00:50:54,005
by this much rating.

1272
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:56,528
If you know that, then sure, go ahead and move the rating.

1273
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:57,649
Because that's the correct thing to do.

1274
00:50:57,669 --> 00:50:59,590
Or should you adjust the variance, part of the

1275
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:00,571
algorithm to account for that?

1276
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:01,392
Yeah, and you could do both.

1277
00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:03,274
You could drop his rating down and increase his variance.

1278
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:05,075
But increasing variance is tricky.

1279
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:06,977
I'm not going to go into how you do it right now.

1280
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:12,343
don't just do it blindly. Super quick question. When you match

1281
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:16,005
make on the skill thing, you do it in the chunks, right? You

1282
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:18,947
don't do it on the granular. If you're going to match somebody

1283
00:51:19,187 --> 00:51:21,368
in silver, you match them against anybody in silver or do

1284
00:51:21,568 --> 00:51:25,650
you do 2200 versus 2300? That's up to the designer. You said you

1285
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:30,292
like the chunky stuff. I like chunky for ranking. When I've

1286
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:33,414
done skill based match making, I've usually done tightly. It

1287
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:36,216
could be more exciting for your game to leave a little bit more

1288
00:51:36,256 --> 00:51:36,796
variance in there.

1289
00:51:37,351 --> 00:51:39,972
the real question was the hybrid system. We're going to go

1290
00:51:40,012 --> 00:51:41,953
through this progression system and then transfer over. We're

1291
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,115
sure you're ready. We don't want you to drop or bounce. Can you

1292
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,716
talk more about that? You were saying go skill. You're worried

1293
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:47,276
about people bouncing.

1294
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:02,938
I probably shouldn't talk about LOL because it's not a game I

1295
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:03,738
work on or anything like that.

1296
00:52:03,778 --> 00:52:06,160
But I'm perfectly happy with games that have amazing

1297
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,341
progression systems on the side.

1298
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:10,503
And then also have a skill system over here.

1299
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:12,744
And the game designers should know for their game.

1300
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:15,346
So if you're sitting in LOL, it takes a while before they let

1301
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:16,366
you play in the ranked, right?

1302
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:18,908
That means that the designers have made some smart decision

1303
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,269
that in our type of game, it's good to get them through some

1304
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,811
not as stressful stuff before we move them over here.

1305
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:25,832
And that, I think, is totally cool and awesome.

1306
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:26,253
Yeah.

1307
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:27,093
Thanks.

1308
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:27,493
Yeah.

1309
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:48,340
Hi. I was curious, especially if you have critical mass issues in games, how you sort of weigh the tradeoffs between giving people matches that may not be that great for them but get them in quickly versus having them wait a little longer but get a better match later and how you balance those factors.

1310
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,145
So again, my only rule of thumb I've used over the years for that is that the wait time should be like

1311
00:52:55,457 --> 00:52:57,199
Players should wait until they feel it,

1312
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:58,360
whatever that is for your game.

1313
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,421
You would understand that better than me.

1314
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:00,502
As soon as they feel it,

1315
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:01,964
it's kind of okay to give them a worse match.

1316
00:53:02,404 --> 00:53:03,806
So with smaller population games,

1317
00:53:04,026 --> 00:53:05,187
players are used to waiting longer,

1318
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:08,190
maybe like a bit longer amount of time.

1319
00:53:08,891 --> 00:53:10,372
And you design that by, usually,

1320
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,574
by having something in your matchmaking system

1321
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:16,218
that has a tolerance for a bad match that grows over time,

1322
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,000
that's kind of proportional

1323
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,481
to like the skill gap that you have.

1324
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:23,903
allowable skill gap starts at some point maybe small, maybe

1325
00:53:23,923 --> 00:53:25,964
big. If your game has a low population it has to start

1326
00:53:25,984 --> 00:53:28,765
bigger. And then it grows over some amount of time. And then

1327
00:53:28,785 --> 00:53:31,546
you have to have other interesting edge case things

1328
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:34,267
like now this guy's waited forever and what is forever and

1329
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:37,108
we need to match make him immediately. That's usually the

1330
00:53:37,128 --> 00:53:39,389
type of thing to work on. A lot of that has to be decided per

1331
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:41,150
game. It's kind of tricky.

1332
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:47,205
So for some games that have different roles, players might

1333
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,786
have different skill levels depending on what they end up

1334
00:53:49,846 --> 00:53:53,068
doing. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on how you can

1335
00:53:53,608 --> 00:53:58,090
match make and determine their skill based on what role they

1336
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:58,690
end up playing.

1337
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:02,652
So you're asking about match making. Are you talking about

1338
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,253
situations where you clearly choose the role or where the

1339
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:06,134
role needs to be inferred?

1340
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:10,776
Somewhat both. Like one thought would be like, well, like if

1341
00:54:11,296 --> 00:54:12,157
you're a really good

1342
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:16,588
carry but then end up being support because you don't, how

1343
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,810
things work with your team. But also just like if there's like

1344
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:25,092
hey I'm good at capture the flag and like how much does a loss

1345
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:27,673
on. Yeah so there's a lot of ways to handle that. The very

1346
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:30,734
dead simplest way is you put a separate skill on each one. The

1347
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:32,655
problem with that is it's going to take longer to learn each

1348
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:35,336
skill. You're going to need more games on each of those roles or

1349
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,857
in each of those maps or in each of those modes to learn that.

1350
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:41,213
other more complicated ways are you have something like a base

1351
00:54:41,253 --> 00:54:46,316
skill and then you have another skill for each of those modes

1352
00:54:46,376 --> 00:54:49,418
which sounds the same but having that base skill there makes it a

1353
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:52,319
lot faster to just learn the offset from that extra skill.

1354
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,261
Other ways to do it that may be simpler than that is

1355
00:54:56,282 --> 00:54:58,443
I have a skill for each of the modes,

1356
00:54:58,523 --> 00:55:00,444
but when I go to play a new mode or a new role,

1357
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:02,065
I kind of look at all my other ones,

1358
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:04,647
sort of take an average, raise that variance up,

1359
00:55:04,827 --> 00:55:05,687
and then bootstrap it in.

1360
00:55:06,247 --> 00:55:08,609
So that means I have at least a sane starting position.

1361
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,570
Those are the types of things I've done over time

1362
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,291
that seem more or less effective depending on the game.

1363
00:55:16,192 --> 00:55:16,872
Yeah, hi.

1364
00:55:17,373 --> 00:55:19,996
I'm interested in the dynamics of skill over time.

1365
00:55:20,056 --> 00:55:22,719
So you start off with a population

1366
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:24,461
with a given skill distribution, but you

1367
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:27,444
had this graph where you had a highly skilled player whose

1368
00:55:27,464 --> 00:55:31,328
skill was constant, but the bad player is creeping up

1369
00:55:31,388 --> 00:55:31,909
over time.

1370
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,752
So I'm wondering if you see the opposite effect where,

1371
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:36,434
so if everyone's normally distributed, then

1372
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,176
you know, if you're a more skilled person,

1373
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:40,677
you're more likely to face someone who's

1374
00:55:41,077 --> 00:55:43,679
less skilled than you, and vice versa.

1375
00:55:43,899 --> 00:55:47,442
So do you see over time that the variance of skill sort of

1376
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:50,764
narrows, or do you feel like the variance of skill

1377
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,486
sort of stays constant over the lifetime of a game?

1378
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,984
It's, if you're talking about like what the whole skill

1379
00:55:57,004 --> 00:56:00,067
distribution looks like, it depends on the game

1380
00:56:00,447 --> 00:56:03,830
and it depends on often the number of players

1381
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,072
that you have on the teams actually in my experience.

1382
00:56:06,953 --> 00:56:09,155
In a lot of situations, the variance actually goes up

1383
00:56:09,275 --> 00:56:10,977
over time because the model's wrong.

1384
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:14,840
So the 30 secret of statistics is all models are wrong.

1385
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:18,803
So there are going to be extra sources of variance that you

1386
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,004
didn't account for that are going to creep in and often

1387
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,545
cause your variance to increase and sometimes cause your mean

1388
00:56:23,565 --> 00:56:26,446
to move around. So most people that have dealt with these

1389
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,227
systems realize that they actually have to have some

1390
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:31,708
mechanism to shift and scale correctly over time. I have

1391
00:56:31,748 --> 00:56:34,089
also noticed, though, in games where you have like a whole

1392
00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:36,710
team and you're using the team average, whatever, or putting a

1393
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,411
skill on a team, you're not going to be able to do that.

1394
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:40,994
Or if you're taking a larger team and taking team averages,

1395
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,415
those situations tend to actually have

1396
00:56:42,976 --> 00:56:43,797
decreases in variance.

1397
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,419
So that still depends on the game.

1398
00:56:45,439 --> 00:56:48,342
So the short answer is you need to analyze your own game

1399
00:56:48,362 --> 00:56:50,605
and see what happens, and then decide how to deal with it.

1400
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:57,192
So I'd like to ask your opinion on how you think rank resets

1401
00:56:57,252 --> 00:56:57,593
affect.

1402
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,567
Models like this in a hybrid system for example so like in League of Legends

1403
00:57:01,987 --> 00:57:07,578
You were reset a rank once a year right and then all the good players are still getting like a better rank to start at

1404
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:09,181
For their you know their journey

1405
00:57:09,645 --> 00:57:13,566
and then the bad players are given, or like the worst players are just given a lower rank. So

1406
00:57:13,606 --> 00:57:16,747
they still have a discrepancy, there's a difference. But for instance, like in

1407
00:57:16,787 --> 00:57:23,048
Hearthstone, they reset it every month. So it causes a lot of, if you're a player who's, you

1408
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:27,029
know, legend and you'll get ranked at like, I don't know, 15 stars or something, and a bad

1409
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:32,230
player never, it's like rank 10, they get reset at like rank 20, but you'll end up having a lot

1410
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,791
of players, good players that just don't play for a few days, bad players who do, and then

1411
00:57:36,831 --> 00:57:38,751
they get caught up in the middle and it ends up with a lot of.

1412
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:45,249
discomfort for bad players. That gets to knowing your game.

1413
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:48,291
And those are problems that those are the type of problems

1414
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:51,733
we solve basically. We look at those effects and we try to make

1415
00:57:51,773 --> 00:57:55,695
decisions and those type of things are going to depend on

1416
00:57:55,735 --> 00:57:58,697
the ranking system you designed and how it works and type of

1417
00:57:58,717 --> 00:58:02,919
players you have and how often those players play, how many of

1418
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:03,399
them play.

1419
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:06,415
It's one of those problems you have to solve.

1420
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:09,098
Like my opinion on that, I mean, you guys have probably

1421
00:58:09,138 --> 00:58:10,079
noticed I'm kind of a purist.

1422
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:12,161
I'm not going to go too much more into detail on that.

1423
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:15,784
But yeah, those are tricky problems to solve.

1424
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:17,426
I think they can be solved.

1425
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:21,710
But yeah, with a hybrid system, those

1426
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,311
are the types of issues you run into in general.

1427
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:31,694
But do you think that maybe you would have just a larger difference in reset?

1428
00:58:32,014 --> 00:58:35,557
Like, so if I was a Legend player in Hearthstone and I got reset to rank 15,

1429
00:58:35,877 --> 00:58:39,460
maybe if I go lower and I set them to rank 12 or something,

1430
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,444
where they're unlikely to meet up with newer players or just bad players

1431
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:45,646
who never even get to rank 12 in the first place?

1432
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,908
Do you think there's different ways like that to...

1433
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:50,690
Yeah, so to make a decision like that, though, you'd want to closely analyze...

1434
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:53,318
and just so you know exactly what's going to happen

1435
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:55,319
and simulate and try to make your best guess

1436
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:56,599
that hey, if we make this change,

1437
00:58:57,139 --> 00:58:59,060
do we have that positive effect we wanted

1438
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,961
or does it actually in practice make things worse?

1439
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:04,722
But yeah, I don't have a strong opinion right now

1440
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:07,483
not because I'm not on the Hearthstone team, right?

1441
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,223
I can't be fair, I'm not going to be unfair to them.

1442
00:59:09,723 --> 00:59:11,524
I would talk gladly to Hearthstone,

1443
00:59:12,024 --> 00:59:12,744
we're in the same company.

1444
00:59:13,264 --> 00:59:13,784
But again.

1445
00:59:14,845 --> 00:59:20,066
that's your job at your own company, then right, those are

1446
00:59:20,707 --> 00:59:22,787
the type of decisions this type of talk is going to help you

1447
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:25,408
make. But I don't have a one size fits all, I guess is the

1448
00:59:25,448 --> 00:59:31,650
answer. Yeah. How would you deal with players that might

1449
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:35,231
intentionally lose to kind of like, they call it smurfing

1450
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:37,992
where you try to play against worse players. There's a couple

1451
00:59:38,012 --> 00:59:38,692
of ways to deal with them.

1452
00:59:40,295 --> 00:59:42,878
My favorite way, so I'll let you guys in on a secret.

1453
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,662
Back in the day, I actually worked at a company called eBay

1454
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:47,804
doing fraud detection, catching people

1455
00:59:47,844 --> 00:59:50,748
that were selling bad stuff or breaking into your account

1456
00:59:50,768 --> 00:59:51,088
or whatever.

1457
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,052
My favorite way is to get your data science team

1458
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:57,096
to build a sweet smurf detection algorithm

1459
00:59:57,497 --> 00:59:58,318
and just ban those guys.

1460
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:03,633
because you could try to, and a lot of times you can do it,

1461
01:00:04,654 --> 01:00:06,536
depending on the game, but there's some games where it's

1462
01:00:06,576 --> 01:00:09,198
as simple as, hey, the median length of,

1463
01:00:10,299 --> 01:00:11,980
median game length for these players is only a minute,

1464
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,001
where the median game length of most legitimate games

1465
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:14,782
is 15 minutes.

1466
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:19,225
So, other ways to try to deal with it if you can't do that

1467
01:00:19,345 --> 01:00:19,446
are

1468
01:00:20,637 --> 01:00:24,679
things like making sure the variance on the skill never

1469
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:27,601
gets too low, which makes the skill move around quite a bit,

1470
01:00:28,081 --> 01:00:30,382
which is kind of annoying if you're trying to really hone in

1471
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:33,324
on skill, on what a player's skill is, but it makes it so if

1472
01:00:33,364 --> 01:00:36,066
a player does smurf, when they start playing again, they get

1473
01:00:36,106 --> 01:00:39,528
out of there faster. It's tricky to try to solve it

1474
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:41,929
systematically. It's better if you can just detect them.

1475
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:48,502
I think I'm out of time. If anyone has more questions, I'll

1476
01:00:48,522 --> 01:00:52,306
go hang out a little bit at the West Hall overlook 2022 or

1477
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:58,552
whatever. And if no one shows up, I'll take off. And yeah,

1478
01:00:59,032 --> 01:00:59,773
thanks a lot for coming, guys.
