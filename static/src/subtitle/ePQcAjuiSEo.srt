00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,443
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Practical IP Law 301

2
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,285
for Indie Developers, Plain Scary Edition.

3
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:14,907
Before we get started, I just want to remind you,

4
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:17,950
this will be available in the vault like the previous two.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,432
And please fill out your session evaluations afterwards.

6
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:23,054
I really appreciate the feedback.

7
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:24,114
My name is Chris Reed.

8
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:26,176
I am the founder at Chris Reed Law.

9
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:29,558
We're a boutique law firm that works with developers and game

10
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:32,401
industry professionals on a wide range of legal issues.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,890
Before we get started, my co-counsel, Mr. Phoenix Wright,

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,371
would like to remind you that I am not your lawyer

13
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,092
and this is not legal advice.

14
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:44,492
When I did 101 and 201 in years past,

15
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:48,033
I kept underestimating how much time we would really need

16
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:51,774
to cover complex legal issues in detail.

17
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:54,475
Well, this year is IP, and that's as complex as they come.

18
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:57,715
So let's just, for safety's sake, about that much time.

19
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:59,836
And unfortunately, we only have enough time

20
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:02,257
for a game of PUBG, so let's get started.

21
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:09,303
My goal today is to teach indie developers how to protect and use their intellectual property.

22
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:14,544
What is intellectual property? It's real rights for intangible things.

23
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:21,066
That sounds abstract, so why should you care? Simple. Your game is IP.

24
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:26,788
For example, here are just some of the things in the game industry that are covered by IP.

25
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:29,168
So basically, everything.

26
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:35,410
To that end, we're going to cover the two big ones, copyright and trademark, for most

27
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,010
of this talk.

28
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,531
And then I'm going to spend a little bit of time on patents, trade secrets, and the right

29
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,991
of publicity, which sometimes come up for indies.

30
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:48,292
For each type of IP, I'm going to tell you what it is, how you can protect it, and when

31
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:52,413
and how you should enforce it, and how to avoid infringing it.

32
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:54,449
we're gonna start with copyright,

33
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,550
which is by far the most powerful

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,611
and important IP right for indies to understand.

35
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:03,012
I like to think of copyright as the pistol from Halo 1.

36
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:06,514
You get it instantly, it lasts almost forever,

37
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:08,535
it's useful in almost every situation,

38
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:11,716
and as you know if you played, it's massively overpowered.

39
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:18,178
So copyright will protect almost every individual aspect

40
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:18,558
of your game.

41
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:23,540
That means characters, code, art, music and sound assets,

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,762
animation, UI design, and writing.

43
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:28,703
All of these things are individually

44
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,084
protected by copyright.

45
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,326
And your completed game as a whole

46
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:35,727
is protected as an audiovisual work.

47
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:39,330
But there's one important exception for indies, and that is,

48
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,232
copyright does not protect abstract ideas.

49
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:45,934
And what that means for you is your game mechanics,

50
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:47,816
your idea, your theme.

51
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:50,337
That's why you can have a million match-three games.

52
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:55,301
It's why PUBG and Fortnite's Battle Royale mode can coexist.

53
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,383
If you need to protect your raw concept,

54
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:03,991
you want to use probably an NDA, like if you're, for example, pitching to somebody.

55
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,733
Because copyright is not going to do it.

56
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:11,722
What copyright will do is give you a host of exclusive and powerful rights.

57
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:15,287
The sole right to reproduce, to sell, distribute.

58
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:19,889
stream, and importantly, to make derivative works.

59
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,709
That means anything based off of your original content.

60
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,950
Sequels, prequels, DLC, merchandise of any sort,

61
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,511
adaptations to other medium.

62
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,431
So that sounds awesome, right?

63
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:33,471
How do we get some of that?

64
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:36,652
The basic rule, and if you remember one thing

65
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:38,512
about copyright, it should be this.

66
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:41,252
In the U.S. copyright, if you make it,

67
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:42,733
you own the copyright.

68
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:44,214
Period.

69
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:46,115
You do not need to register.

70
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:47,455
You do not need to file.

71
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:48,596
You own it instantly.

72
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,936
That's great if you're an artist.

73
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:53,077
But it's a problem for a game studio

74
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:56,058
because you don't want to have to have 10 people

75
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:58,338
with owning different pieces of copyright

76
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,699
that you have to get permission from to do anything,

77
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,339
like sell your game.

78
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,840
How do we solve this?

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,941
Contracts, contracts, contracts.

80
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:12,382
Written signed contracts are the single most important way

81
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,926
to guarantee the company's ownership over the copyright

82
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:19,689
and to effectively use and license it.

83
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:22,713
I went over a lot of these contracts in detail in 201,

84
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,056
but today we're just gonna cover

85
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,880
some of the specifics for copyright,

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,441
because

87
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:36,047
You cannot transfer the ownership of copyright without a signed, written agreement.

88
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:40,310
So, this is going to be important when we're gathering all the rights into the company

89
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,291
from people making the game.

90
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:45,814
Yes, the owners of the company, they need to sign contracts too.

91
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:47,956
It could be the operating agreement of the company.

92
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,097
It could be an invention assignment agreement.

93
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:50,998
But they need to do it.

94
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:58,015
all of the contractors and W2 employees, anyone who contributes to the game or material around

95
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:02,636
it, no matter how small, they should be signing a written agreement that provides that it's

96
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,598
work made for hire, that they're assigning that copyright to the company.

97
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:10,661
That means if you're an artist or someone working for a game studio, when you sign one

98
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,804
of these, you're saying, yes, my work is owned by the company, not by me.

99
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:20,488
Unless it's specified as a license, which does sometimes come up if, for example, you

100
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,450
have a musician and they're merely licensing the tracks to you.

101
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,191
That's fine.

102
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,273
But you need to know what the...

103
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,434
size of that licenses, what can you use it for.

104
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,635
In fact, while we're talking about licenses,

105
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:35,656
you should also note that if you're gonna use things

106
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:38,157
from the Unity Asset Store,

107
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:40,098
or if you are using open source software,

108
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,979
these things might be free for you,

109
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,380
but it doesn't mean they're not protected by copyright.

110
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,281
They're almost certainly subject to a license.

111
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,162
So you need to know what the terms of that are,

112
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:51,442
so that you know what you're allowed to use it for

113
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:52,343
and what you're not.

114
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:58,477
When you are using the rights you have and licensing them out,

115
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,698
your company is licensing the rights out,

116
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:03,080
you also need to pay attention to contracts.

117
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,583
So if your studio is doing a development agreement

118
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,484
where you're making a game for a client,

119
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,868
You don't want them to own everything.

120
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:14,611
They may own the completed game, but they shouldn't own

121
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:17,654
your core code libraries, your engine.

122
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,357
These sorts of things are things you want your company

123
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:22,378
to maintain copyright ownership over.

124
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:26,062
So instead, that contract should specify that these

125
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:29,465
developer tools are merely licensed to your client so

126
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:31,847
that you can use them in future projects.

127
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:36,553
If you're going to do a publishing agreement, that means that you're licensing one of those

128
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:40,197
cool rights to distribute and sell to a publisher.

129
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:43,561
But there's a lot of special settings that you need to think about.

130
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,983
Is that license forever?

131
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:46,665
Is it limited in time?

132
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:47,466
Is it exclusive?

133
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,968
Is it limited in time?

134
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:50,049
Is it exclusive?

135
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:52,435
Does it cover worldwide?

136
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:53,916
What platforms does it cover?

137
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,117
Are they involved in things like derivative works

138
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:57,737
and merchandise?

139
00:06:57,737 --> 00:06:59,398
Are they involved in sequels?

140
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:01,299
Is there any chance, based on this agreement,

141
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,640
that you might actually end up assigning your copyright?

142
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,100
All of these things are important,

143
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,122
and you need to pay attention.

144
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:11,043
But no contract, no matter how good,

145
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:13,824
is going to enforce itself and stop people

146
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,605
from infringing copyright.

147
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:19,527
Copyright infringement is when someone uses your stuff

148
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:20,447
without your permission.

149
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:27,487
It comes in the obvious bad form of people stealing your assets and using them,

150
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,608
pirating your game directly,

151
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:32,829
and some forms of cloning might also be copyright infringement.

152
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,010
But there's a lot of things that go on with

153
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,011
your content that most developers are pretty okay with.

154
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:44,173
So things like machinima, streaming, fan art, let's play videos.

155
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,594
Most indie devs are great about this stuff. They like it.

156
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,912
So how do we make sure that we can allow that while stopping the bad stuff?

157
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:53,533
Well, good news.

158
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:57,496
Copyright gives you a very powerful and arbitrary right

159
00:07:57,496 --> 00:08:00,157
to drop the hammer whenever.

160
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,405
and wherever you want.

161
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:07,169
So you can selectively stop just the stuff you want to stop.

162
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,672
For example, if someone is streaming your game

163
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:12,034
and that's awesome, and then you decide

164
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,096
maybe it's not so awesome,

165
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:19,901
then you can specifically enforce against just that person

166
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,462
and let everyone else keep going.

167
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:22,964
That's very helpful.

168
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:25,668
How do we do this enforcement?

169
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,872
Well, first off, a preventative measure.

170
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:30,795
Register your copyright.

171
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:33,658
I know, I said you don't have to do that to own it,

172
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:35,941
and that's true, but it's useful.

173
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:37,666
It is cheap, about $65.

174
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:37,966
It's fast.

175
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,847
You can do it online.

176
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:44,808
And when you do it, it upgrades your rights, especially

177
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:46,189
if you ever need to sue.

178
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:49,510
It means you can sue for ridiculous amounts of money.

179
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,590
And that is a very potent threat.

180
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,611
So do it within three months of launching your game

181
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:57,812
for the maximum coverage, or afterwards, as soon as you can.

182
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:01,453
And then we need to think about.

183
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,908
when people are actually infringing.

184
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:04,688
What do we do?

185
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:07,028
Well, the first step could be to decide,

186
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:09,109
hey, maybe what they're doing is okay

187
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:10,649
as long as I can control it.

188
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,170
And that means you might offer them a license.

189
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,870
Look, you can use this material,

190
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,551
but only under these certain terms.

191
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,071
It's on your terms.

192
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:19,711
But if you just wanna stop them,

193
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:22,472
the first step would be to send a cease and desist letter.

194
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:24,012
That's a formal letter that says,

195
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:26,293
look, you're infringing the following things.

196
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:27,673
You need to stop or else.

197
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:32,625
The next step would be to get that content pulled.

198
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:36,168
You might send a DMCA takedown notice to the content hosts,

199
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,830
so YouTube or Steam.

200
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,912
These companies take it very seriously.

201
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,674
They will comply almost immediately,

202
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,675
and they will pull that content.

203
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,857
It's a very potent tool to send a message.

204
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:49,820
And the final step, if you really are still

205
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,941
having a dispute, is to sue.

206
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:55,444
This is expensive, especially for indies.

207
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:57,965
It's gonna be thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars

208
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,407
to prosecute a federal trademark,

209
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:03,728
or a federal, well, trademark case as well,

210
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,069
but a copyright lawsuit.

211
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:06,250
So it has to be worth it.

212
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,592
But the damages you can ask for are enormous.

213
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:12,594
So it is a potent and scary threat,

214
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,555
which is why you need to avoid infringing

215
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:17,276
other people's copyright.

216
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:21,047
So I know it's nice to use other things to reference things,

217
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:24,832
but let's talk about a couple ways you can be relatively safe.

218
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:29,999
First off, we said that the same idea or mechanic is not protectable.

219
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:30,660
So go for it.

220
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,806
Feel free to be inspired by other people's mechanics that you see.

221
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:41,970
Anything that's really just generic is not specific enough to be protected by copyright.

222
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,353
So having giant swords in your game or huge shoulder pad armor, I mean,

223
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,075
that's not going to be protected by copyright.

224
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:53,881
There's the public domain, which means anything that never had copyright protection

225
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,303
or has already fallen out of copyright protection.

226
00:10:56,303 --> 00:10:58,725
Basically, it means old stuff.

227
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:04,451
Mythology, Alice in Wonderland, these are great sources of material because anyone is

228
00:11:04,451 --> 00:11:05,934
free to use them.

229
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:11,144
And then of course we have Fair Use, which you all know about, of course, from arguing

230
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:12,066
about it on the internet.

231
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:17,169
There is a core rule that I have for fair use.

232
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:21,370
Just because it's cool doesn't mean it's fair use.

233
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,492
Fair use is what we lawyers call an affirmative defense

234
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:25,672
to copyright infringement.

235
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:27,653
That means three things for you.

236
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,534
One, you're only gonna get to raise it

237
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,455
if you're already standing in court,

238
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:35,076
and that means you've spent a ton of money.

239
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:39,297
Two, you have to admit that you committed copyright infringement,

240
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:42,298
which you might not want to do, especially if you end up losing.

241
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:44,918
And three, you don't know if you're going to lose

242
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:49,319
because every case is decided differently

243
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:51,400
based on four factors by a judge.

244
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,381
It's case by case, and there is absolutely no way to be certain.

245
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:58,601
Do not buy into the myth.

246
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:06,343
that there are specific easy buckets you can fit into and you're totally safe.

247
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:07,003
Oh, it's parody.

248
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:08,204
No, that's not always a safe bet.

249
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:10,024
Don't buy the myths.

250
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:13,325
And finally, I know that was a lot.

251
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:15,005
Let's sum it up.

252
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:18,126
It protects almost all of your content.

253
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:23,507
But you want to show that ownership and gather it using contracts,

254
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,507
license your copyright using contracts.

255
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:28,325
Your enforcement ability is powerful,

256
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:32,490
and you can be selective, but you need to respect it,

257
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,352
and don't get cute using other people's stuff.

258
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,735
Let's move on to the second big area of IP

259
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:39,617
that I think is relevant for indie developers,

260
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:40,999
and that is trademarks.

261
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:46,224
Trademarks protect game and company names, logos,

262
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,306
and slogans.

263
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:51,411
It is the power of your brand in the minds of consumers

264
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:54,835
when connected with the goods and services that you sell,

265
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:58,399
but not when connected with unrelated goods.

266
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,481
I mean, unless you also sell bungee cords.

267
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:05,964
So trademarks give you the right to stop other people

268
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:11,546
from using the same or a similar mark, name, logo

269
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:12,927
for the same kind of goods.

270
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:15,688
This is pretty important because you don't wanna have

271
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:19,350
to change the name of your game at the last minute.

272
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,790
Air Brigade.

273
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,072
You also don't want to have to spend a lot of money

274
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,213
if you have it to buy the rights to a game

275
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,414
that was already there when you didn't notice.

276
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:30,535
This is because trademark law.

277
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:36,100
is based on first come, first serve.

278
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,520
We call this priority.

279
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,223
It means whoever gets trademark rights first

280
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:45,245
is able to stop anyone who comes afterwards

281
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:47,447
from using that name or that logo

282
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:48,988
for the same kind of goods.

283
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:51,435
How do we get that?

284
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:53,956
You sell your game.

285
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:57,278
If you remember one thing about trademarks, it's this.

286
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,701
You have no trademark rights until you sell your game.

287
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:06,624
That means that there's a lot of cool stuff you might do

288
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:08,765
that doesn't count as selling your game

289
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,146
and it doesn't give you any trademark rights.

290
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:14,348
For instance, registering social media accounts

291
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:15,709
or website domains.

292
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,471
running a dev blog where you talk about it,

293
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,013
having a hugely successful Kickstarter,

294
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,535
being reviewed glowingly in the press,

295
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:25,577
having a big closed beta.

296
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:28,640
None of these things count as selling your game.

297
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,183
None of these things give you trademark rights.

298
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:35,846
Maybe early access, but it's not exactly clear,

299
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:37,147
so I wouldn't rely on it.

300
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:41,969
So wow, that means there is a lot of time

301
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,750
when you're working hard on your game during development

302
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,372
and you've got no guarantee of your trademark rights.

303
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:51,633
If only there were a way we could call dibs.

304
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:52,253
That is what

305
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:56,480
filing a trademark registration will let you do.

306
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,182
It reserves that priority date from the moment you file the registration.

307
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:04,464
You still have to sell your game eventually.

308
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:09,007
That's when you get your rights, but it lets you reserve the date.

309
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:09,907
So to be clear...

310
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,852
If you haven't registered and someone sells a game for the first time three days before

311
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:19,893
you launch, you're out of luck if they're using the same name as you.

312
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:21,074
They beat you.

313
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:24,355
If you've registered months before, you beat them.

314
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,275
So how do we do this registration?

315
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,393
we go to the Patent and Trademark Office,

316
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:31,654
where you have to file an application.

317
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:34,375
It lets you reserve those rights for up to three years,

318
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,736
though you have to pay a fee every six months

319
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,137
and keep filing.

320
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,557
It is still not going to be final rights

321
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:41,798
until you sell that game.

322
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:44,319
So you do have to launch eventually, it's not forever.

323
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,580
The process will cost you around $1,500.

324
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,641
It's strongly recommended you use an attorney

325
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:50,701
to navigate the system.

326
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,582
Once you get the registration though,

327
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:55,363
it gives you some neat benefits.

328
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:59,819
Obviously, it's let us reserve that priority date.

329
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,641
So anyone who came after when we filed,

330
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,122
they're out of luck.

331
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:05,964
But the rights you do get are upgraded

332
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,406
from just normal trademark rights.

333
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:08,627
They're gonna be much stronger

334
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:10,348
if you ever need to sue someone.

335
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:11,749
It's much harder for other people.

336
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,291
to contest your trademark.

337
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,875
And that means that, yes, it's still worth

338
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,218
registering your trademark even after launch.

339
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:19,620
If you're seeing this now and you think,

340
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,062
oh, I didn't register before,

341
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:23,505
it's still worth it for the upgrade in rights.

342
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:25,648
And finally, of course, it lets you use

343
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:26,749
the cool R in the circle symbol,

344
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:27,831
which everyone loves that.

345
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,028
You can have a couple of things to consider during registration,

346
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:34,309
especially on a limited indie budget.

347
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:36,591
If you can only pick one thing to register,

348
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:39,172
I would go with your game name, especially early on.

349
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:39,432
Why?

350
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,273
Because that's your brand.

351
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:45,756
That's what it's more likely someone's going to beat you out to.

352
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,718
Later on, you can register your studio if you want.

353
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:51,540
You also have to choose, if you're only doing one,

354
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,803
between a word mark, which is plain text, or a design mark, which is like a logo.

355
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:00,579
The wordmark is almost always broader protection.

356
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:03,001
So start with that if you can only register one thing.

357
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,684
And besides, your logo may change over time.

358
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:10,008
But I know indies are usually strapped for cash.

359
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:12,570
At a bare minimum, if you don't register,

360
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,012
here's what you should do.

361
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:16,034
Google early, Google often.

362
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,694
Search the Patent and Trademark Database.

363
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:20,275
These things are free.

364
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:23,897
It's not going to guarantee that the name is definitely available.

365
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:25,378
There might be something you didn't find,

366
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,680
but it will certainly help you avoid obvious pitfalls.

367
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,843
Also, you can use the TM symbol.

368
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:35,664
Unlike the R in the circle, which you must be registered to use,

369
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:37,665
the TM symbol, anyone can use it.

370
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,546
It doesn't really have any legal force,

371
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:41,467
but it acts like a no-trespassing sign.

372
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:45,189
It lets the world know, hey, we intend to protect this name.

373
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,631
And that can keep people away in a practical sense.

374
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:52,032
Ideally, though, just register your mark as soon as you can

375
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,173
if the name is important.

376
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:53,473
And also.

377
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,783
protect against infringement.

378
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,705
Once you have those rights,

379
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,886
you need to stop trademark infringement.

380
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:04,387
What is trademark infringement?

381
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:08,290
It's when people use the same name or logo

382
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,411
or something confusingly similar,

383
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:12,693
doesn't have to be identical,

384
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,135
to sell the same kind of goods or services.

385
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,376
And before you get clever about it,

386
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:20,198
I'm really sorry, but trademark law is a...

387
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:26,021
filthy casual. It does not understand the difference between genres, meaning all

388
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:31,044
video games are the same product as far as trademark protection is concerned. So

389
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:36,667
if anyone is using the same name or a similar name as you are to sell a video

390
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:42,610
game of any kind, that's a problem. How do we do this enforcement? Well, we've got

391
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,633
some preventative measures. Register your trademark, as we said. That's helpful.

392
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,594
Puts people on notice.

393
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:54,964
When you need to stop someone or deal with infringement that's out there, you've got

394
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:56,285
a couple of steps.

395
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:00,951
First off, consider whether what they're doing is okay with you as long as you control it.

396
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:04,355
Similar to copyright, you can offer a license for them to use.

397
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:05,276
Use it on your terms.

398
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:06,838
That counts as enforcement.

399
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,815
You can send a cease and desist letter, just like with

400
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,895
copyright, to tell them to stop.

401
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:15,016
And you can send a takedown request to the content hosts.

402
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,557
Now, this won't technically be a DMCA notice, but most of

403
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,959
these companies also have trademark policies in place,

404
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,819
and they will respect trademark claims as well.

405
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:26,520
And finally, of course, you can sue.

406
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,921
It's still very expensive to sue for trademark infringement.

407
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,062
But if your rights are registered, you're in a very

408
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:35,183
strong position, and you're likely to win.

409
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:39,039
And I should note, you can enforce your rights

410
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,480
even if they're not registered.

411
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,422
So if you've started selling your game,

412
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:44,804
you have trademark rights in that name.

413
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,525
They're called common law rights.

414
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:48,747
The registration upgrades them

415
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:50,029
and makes it better if you have to sue,

416
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:52,251
but you can enforce either way and you should

417
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:57,716
because trademark law says that

418
00:19:57,716 --> 00:20:00,438
if you don't enforce your marks over time,

419
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:03,501
the protection that they give you narrows and could disappear.

420
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:05,881
Unlike copyright.

421
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:07,962
Copyright, you can sit on your copyright for 10 years

422
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:11,463
and do nothing and one day just enforce against one person.

423
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:14,123
With trademark, it shrinks over time,

424
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:17,084
can eventually disappear, you must enforce.

425
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:19,685
It doesn't mean you have to be a total jerk to everyone,

426
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,785
it just means you need to notice who's infringing

427
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:24,946
and you need to ask them to stop.

428
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:26,867
You need to maybe offer them a license.

429
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:31,078
And of course, you want to avoid infringing other people's

430
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,138
trademarks.

431
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:33,059
First step is easy.

432
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,460
Before you use a name, Google.

433
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,521
It's not that hard.

434
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:39,143
Make sure there clearly isn't someone already using this

435
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:41,164
name for a game.

436
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:44,046
As far as using trademarks deliberately, maybe you want

437
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:47,148
to reference someone, do an homage, whatever.

438
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,228
Just get permission.

439
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:50,630
Don't assume that they're OK with your use.

440
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:55,018
Yes, you can use people's trademarks in a comparative sense,

441
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:58,539
but if they don't like what you did,

442
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:00,660
they might decide that they wanna challenge it in court,

443
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,540
and nothing stops them from suing you.

444
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,261
That's an argument you're gonna make in court,

445
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:05,241
just like fair use.

446
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,061
That's expensive argument to have.

447
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:09,162
The safest, don't use it.

448
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:11,603
Without permission, if you're really gonna ignore me

449
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,603
and do it, at least put clear disclaimers

450
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:17,584
that say we don't own this, we're not endorsed by them,

451
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:18,865
we're not associated with them.

452
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:22,965
So to sum up trademarks, you should plan and search ahead

453
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:25,166
so that you know that name is available,

454
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,267
because you have no rights until you sell your game.

455
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:31,567
You can reserve that priority ahead of time by registering,

456
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,648
and you absolutely should.

457
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:36,629
And you need to enforce your rights to keep them strong.

458
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,530
So those are the two big ones.

459
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,530
Now let's cover a couple types of IP

460
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,571
that occasionally come up for indies,

461
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,311
but aren't nearly as relevant.

462
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:48,212
First, we're gonna start with patents.

463
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:54,759
Patents are a type of IP that protect novel, useful, and non-obvious inventions.

464
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,341
You can only get a patent by successfully applying to the Patent and Trademark Office.

465
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:02,863
It's going to cost you around $20,000 probably.

466
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,724
It takes about two to three years.

467
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:08,925
And when you eventually get it, you get 20 years of protection, but that protection's

468
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:13,528
really specific and narrow, and it might be really easy for people to design around it.

469
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:17,429
There are certainly examples of patents in the game industry.

470
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,851
Some kind of business methods, like monetization strategies,

471
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:23,652
certain parts of software algorithms might be patentable,

472
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:26,013
and of course, famously, some game mechanics

473
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:26,933
have been patented.

474
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,254
But, and of course, also Rock Band Guitar,

475
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:32,636
novel hardware interfaces, these things

476
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:34,077
can all be the subjects of patents.

477
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:38,501
But, first off, it's usually big companies that have them because of the cost, and you

478
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:42,765
don't know that they've actually been that helpful in enforcing.

479
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:46,149
So, for indies, is it worth it?

480
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,791
Nope.

481
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:51,835
It's just too much money and effort for not enough guaranteed protection.

482
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:54,538
Your time and your money are better spent elsewhere.

483
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:58,027
So let's move on to trade secrets, which are easily

484
00:22:58,027 --> 00:22:59,407
the coolest sounding type of IP.

485
00:22:59,407 --> 00:23:02,048
Trade secrets are any information

486
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,489
that you can keep secret and that

487
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:07,309
gives you a competitive advantage because you

488
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:08,309
kept it secret.

489
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:09,570
It's your special sauce.

490
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,431
So things in the game industry like customer mailing lists,

491
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:16,911
game design documents, a marketing strategy,

492
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:19,812
in-app pricing models, that sort of thing.

493
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,813
If you protect them, then the law

494
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:24,533
will let you sue someone who misappropriates them

495
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,333
without your permission.

496
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:27,174
How do we get that protection?

497
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:29,635
That's easy, you listen to Gandalf.

498
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:32,016
I mean, that's just good life advice in general,

499
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:34,796
but specifically that means you need to make

500
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:37,277
reasonable efforts to keep the information secret.

501
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:40,538
And you show this by limiting access to who can see it,

502
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:42,959
using technical security precautions,

503
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,059
you know, encrypted email,

504
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,500
don't just leave printouts lying around,

505
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,201
and by showing that you have contracts, i.e. NDAs,

506
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:52,262
with people before they get access to it.

507
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,568
That's how you keep your trade secrets safe.

508
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,910
But you also need to be careful about not being exposed

509
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,992
to other people's trade secrets.

510
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:04,595
It sounds great to learn what your competitors are doing,

511
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:07,117
but if an employee or a new contractor

512
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:09,519
tells you trade secrets from a previous job

513
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,041
and they don't have permission to do that,

514
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,142
they've dragged you into a fight.

515
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:17,645
You're now liable for misappropriation of trade secrets.

516
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:19,106
You don't want to hear that.

517
00:24:19,106 --> 00:24:21,128
So you tell them not to share it.

518
00:24:21,812 --> 00:24:23,617
You don't look at it if they try to share it.

519
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:27,026
And you have a contract in place that makes sure that

520
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:29,313
they are obligated not to share these things if they

521
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:30,135
don't have permission.

522
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:34,877
Finally, we have the right of publicity.

523
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:38,741
This is a right that individuals all

524
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:42,704
have in the commercial use of their name or their likeness.

525
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:44,746
In the game industry, we have some famous examples.

526
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:49,731
NCAA student athletes sued EA for their use of their name

527
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:50,752
in some of the sports games.

528
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:56,217
Lindsay Lohan sued Rockstar for the alleged use of her likeness

529
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:57,618
in some marketing materials.

530
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,584
It's also a messy kind of right because it's different in every state, it's different in

531
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:07,208
every country, so you don't know exactly what's going to apply.

532
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:13,854
And that's all the more reason why the core rule is simple, just get permission or don't

533
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:17,958
reference people, don't use their name, don't use their image.

534
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:24,124
Because while it's true that you can use a public figure's name or likeness for

535
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,210
newsworthy purposes or for historical purposes,

536
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,451
that's one of those arguments

537
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:30,912
you're gonna be making in court.

538
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:32,873
And that's right, you spent a lot of money.

539
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:34,835
And guess who's gonna have a lot more money

540
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:36,436
and a lot more lawyers than you?

541
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,197
The celebrity.

542
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:40,399
If they wanna sue, they will.

543
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,161
So if you absolutely feel that you must

544
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:45,122
be parodying a public figure,

545
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:48,144
You know that you're taking a risk,

546
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:50,186
and make sure that your reference to them

547
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:51,987
is as far away as possible,

548
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:54,369
so that you can plead deniability.

549
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:57,772
And never, ever admit in writing or out loud

550
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:58,733
that that's what you're doing.

551
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:01,415
That is a surefire way to lose a lawsuit

552
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:02,636
if they want to bring it.

553
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:05,078
Maybe just stick to original characters.

554
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:07,920
And that's it, we made it.

555
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,261
So, are you scared?

556
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:12,314
You don't have to be.

557
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:14,717
Remember, your product is IP.

558
00:26:14,717 --> 00:26:18,180
The rights are powerful, but they're complex.

559
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,664
That means you need to gather the ownership with contracts

560
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,545
and protect it with registration,

561
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:27,629
and use those contracts to license those rights,

562
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,692
and remember that your rights don't enforce themselves.

563
00:26:30,692 --> 00:26:33,735
You have to be vigilant and diligent about enforcing.

564
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:35,508
And that's the end.

565
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:36,709
I wanna thank my paralegal for all his hard work.

566
00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:38,550
And please, please fill out your session evaluations.

567
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,612
I really, really appreciate the feedback.

568
00:26:41,612 --> 00:26:42,632
Now I am happy to take some questions

569
00:26:42,632 --> 00:26:44,694
as long as every single one is not about fair use.

570
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:45,294
Thanks.

571
00:26:45,294 --> 00:26:45,654
Thank you.

572
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:46,115
Thank you.

573
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:46,675
Thank you.

574
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:47,195
Thank you.

575
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:47,836
Thank you.

576
00:26:47,836 --> 00:26:48,516
Thank you.

577
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:48,936
Thank you.

578
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:49,196
Thank you.

579
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:50,117
Thank you.

580
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:50,417
Thank you.

581
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:50,717
Thank you.

582
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:50,978
Thank you.

583
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:51,278
Thank you.

584
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:58,342
Thank you.

585
00:26:58,342 --> 00:26:59,423
Thank you.

586
00:26:59,423 --> 00:26:59,743
Thank you.

587
00:27:00,598 --> 00:27:02,459
I really enjoyed it as a fellow lawyer.

588
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:03,720
I learned a lot of good things.

589
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,781
Thankfully, we were doing things correctly.

590
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:07,323
I just didn't understand the technicalities.

591
00:27:07,323 --> 00:27:12,166
But my question to you is, can you have trade secrets sort of

592
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,528
in something that doesn't belong to you?

593
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:17,610
Like if I'm working within Sony's hardware, my company

594
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,812
makes themes, and we do things that other people don't.

595
00:27:20,812 --> 00:27:24,895
Can I have trade secrets when that software maybe doesn't

596
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:25,515
belong to me?

597
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:30,103
So are you asking if you personally, so you're asking...

598
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:34,648
Can our company protect our sort of techniques via trade secrets?

599
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:38,452
If they're in other people's material because you're working for them.

600
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:38,893
Yes.

601
00:27:39,513 --> 00:27:44,939
interesting. Yes. In fact, that's that's one of those places where you want to protect trade secrets. Right. And

602
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:50,785
that's going to be taken care of in the contract. That might actually get lumped in when I said the developer

603
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:56,471
tools were important. Right. If you do work for someone else. I was talking about copyright there. But oftentimes

604
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:57,853
that clause in a contract.

605
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:00,375
will cover more than just copyright.

606
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,518
You kind of broadly define any of our special things,

607
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:06,642
proprietary techniques, we do not assign ownership

608
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:10,045
over them, and you make sure that later in that contract

609
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:11,987
there's probably confidentiality, so it says,

610
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:14,049
look, we're gonna use some of our special trade

611
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,212
secret techniques, you can't disclose them

612
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:19,494
and you don't own them, but you have a license

613
00:28:19,494 --> 00:28:22,197
to use them inside this product that we're making for you.

614
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:25,360
So if I'm working with a larger company that has their own

615
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,523
sort of terrifying giant contract, is this something

616
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:31,765
that I need to insist that we just have in there?

617
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:34,227
Because there have been some people that have tried to

618
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,028
sneakily be like, we need this code.

619
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:39,591
And usually we've gotten around it like, no, you can

620
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:42,113
just have the package.

621
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:45,035
I think it's probably a good idea.

622
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:47,477
So there's the practical world and the legal world, right?

623
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,279
Practically, not giving them the code is a good way

624
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,100
for them not to steal it.

625
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,902
Legally, you're basically giving yourself a right,

626
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:55,483
A, you're scaring them by saying,

627
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,405
hey, you're promising in writing, you can't disclose this.

628
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,427
So that's a good idea to say you can have it,

629
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:03,149
but you need, if they don't already have that feature,

630
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:06,052
then maybe have an NDA specifically for it.

631
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:07,913
But also, it gives you recourse.

632
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,695
If they do end up stealing it, you can at least sue,

633
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:11,616
you can ask for an injunction, yeah.

634
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,097
Thank you.

635
00:29:12,273 --> 00:29:13,034
Yeah, no problem.

636
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:13,414
Thank you.

637
00:29:13,414 --> 00:29:15,054
So in order to enforce trademark,

638
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:17,935
you have to have sold the game.

639
00:29:17,935 --> 00:29:19,375
Does it matter?

640
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,295
Is there a certain number of copies?

641
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:25,216
Or can you just have one copy sold with a receipt?

642
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:28,557
So you're asking, in order to get your trademark protection,

643
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:30,797
does it matter how many copies you sell?

644
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:31,717
Or can it just be one?

645
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:34,238
If you are truly selling it, and you've released it,

646
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:37,658
and it's out on Steam, then from the moment of the first copy,

647
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:39,499
that's when you get your rights.

648
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:41,459
Your rights are dated as of that.

649
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,343
If you haven't registered, those rights are going to be what are called common law rights.

650
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:50,606
So the more you sell, the more powerful your brand, the better the enforcement ability.

651
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:55,710
If what you're asking is, hey, I really want to reserve the date, can I just like sell

652
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,391
a copy to my friend?

653
00:29:56,391 --> 00:29:57,471
No, no, it has to be like a...

654
00:29:57,702 --> 00:29:59,964
Trademark law definitely does not let you do that,

655
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,625
and they know that people try to do that,

656
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,187
and there's all sorts of case law about not being,

657
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:07,629
that's why I said that early access is kind of a maybe,

658
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:10,131
like if it's early access where the game's basically done

659
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:11,412
and you're selling a finished copy,

660
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:13,373
and maybe you'll make some tweaks.

661
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:15,494
that you have a good argument.

662
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:19,456
If it's like a really early unstable alpha or beta

663
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:20,656
and it's totally gonna change,

664
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:22,117
they're not gonna see that as selling the game.

665
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:22,937
Right, so it just has to be on a store

666
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:24,458
where they're freaking ordering it.

667
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,759
Yeah, yeah, it has to be launched, yeah, available.

668
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,919
And also, by the way, it can be free.

669
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,180
I said sell, but it needs to be just available

670
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,022
in the normal channels of trade, whatever that means.

671
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,943
So if it's free on GOG or whatever,

672
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:37,884
as long as it's out and it's finished

673
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:40,105
and you're distributing it in the same place

674
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,205
that you would normally sell,

675
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:42,986
if the price is zero, that's okay.

676
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:43,186
Okay.

677
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:44,288
Thank you.

678
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:45,709
Yeah, no problem.

679
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:46,609
Hello.

680
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:46,910
Hello.

681
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,471
I had a question about submitting a copyright

682
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:50,952
claim for your game.

683
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:52,393
So when you're doing that.

684
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,514
To the copyright office?

685
00:30:53,514 --> 00:30:55,315
Yes, that's correct.

686
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:57,577
How much material do you have to submit to them?

687
00:30:57,577 --> 00:30:59,879
So do you need to provide your entire code base and all

688
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:00,459
your art assets?

689
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,941
So this is why we often, even though I

690
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:05,503
say it's fairly straightforward, a lot of clients

691
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:08,405
end up doing it with us just to avoid the headache.

692
00:31:08,405 --> 00:31:10,766
They do have instructions on there.

693
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,908
I think with the code, they want the first.

694
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:15,331
I want to say first 20 and last 20 of the source code.

695
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:18,736
And by the way, linking it up to trade secrets, they

696
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:20,598
actually have a thing where they say, look, if your code

697
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:23,202
involves what you consider trade secrets, you can redact

698
00:31:23,202 --> 00:31:24,223
those portions.

699
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:27,187
And they've got pretty good instructions.

700
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:28,970
It's just not fun to read through them all.

701
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,310
Thank you.

702
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,991
Oh, and by the way, a pro tip.

703
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:37,195
If you're submitting the finished game along with art

704
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,718
assets and the code and all that, it's a pretty good idea

705
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:42,699
to also submit some footage of gameplay.

706
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:46,383
This has come up in some cases where judges do not

707
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:47,303
understand video games.

708
00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:51,664
So you need there to be stuff for them to look at.

709
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:56,025
So the fact that the registration had some gameplay,

710
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:58,966
the judge was able to look at it and say, oh, I see.

711
00:31:58,966 --> 00:32:00,626
This looks pretty similar to this.

712
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:03,007
So it's not a bad idea to put like 30 seconds of core

713
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:04,247
gameplay in there.

714
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:05,327
Just doesn't hurt.

715
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:05,567
Thank you.

716
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:06,247
Hi, Chris.

717
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:06,847
Hey, how you doing?

718
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:07,508
Nice to see you again.

719
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,128
So a quick question, or hopefully quick question,

720
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:10,888
regarding

721
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:16,817
the protection of trademark abroad as far as different countries and also potentially

722
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:22,905
different languages, especially if you have a title that doesn't necessarily transliterate

723
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:26,349
into other languages and just let you go with that.

724
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:28,312
Okay, so two questions.

725
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:30,395
One, what do you do about...

726
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:34,577
protecting your trademark in other jurisdictions, and two,

727
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,339
what if your title doesn't really translate into the

728
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:39,621
other language in a meaningful way.

729
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:43,804
So first off, I should just make doubly clear that this

730
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:45,766
presentation is based mostly on US law.

731
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:47,927
I mean, there's some general principles that are good.

732
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,188
I mean, contracts are always good.

733
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:53,852
But especially the IP law is country by country.

734
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,174
you can use a trademark registration in the US

735
00:32:57,174 --> 00:33:00,116
or in another country as the basis

736
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:02,357
for grabbing that priority date

737
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,698
and applying it to other countries.

738
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:04,718
Now, that gets expensive.

739
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:07,420
You have to find attorney counsel

740
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,961
in every individual jurisdiction to do it for you,

741
00:33:09,961 --> 00:33:13,543
but there is a treaty that allows for a process

742
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:15,564
where you can kind of use it to apply elsewhere.

743
00:33:15,564 --> 00:33:16,425
I mean, you're not gonna do it

744
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:18,686
unless you really think you're gonna be launching

745
00:33:18,686 --> 00:33:21,107
in those places.

746
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:27,010
As far as translation, I'm not sure how it works in all the many other jurisdictions,

747
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:35,414
but in the US we have a principle that basically says if the name of your game is totally fine

748
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:40,016
except that it means something else in a foreign language, and if you translated it, it would

749
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:42,957
totally be infringing something that already exists, right?

750
00:33:42,957 --> 00:33:46,859
It's a foreign word and there's nothing in the database with that name except that it

751
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,140
means something and there's definitely someone there.

752
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,305
They actually have a principle that generally they will assume that it infringes.

753
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:57,190
They assume that people would stop and translate, because I guess they assume everyone speaks

754
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,711
every language.

755
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:59,873
But that's just, yeah.

756
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:03,077
So there's a lot more detail there, but that's...

757
00:34:03,077 --> 00:34:03,258
Great.

758
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:03,498
Thanks.

759
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:03,598
Yep.

760
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:04,359
Thank you.

761
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:04,559
Hello.

762
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:04,659
Hello.

763
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:09,294
Hello. I don't have all the right terms, so I hope I can get this across.

764
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:10,915
Sure. No problem.

765
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:18,358
The Trademark Office rejected our request because they said the name was too close to a general term.

766
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:21,820
Yes. But there was some secondary list that we were able to get on.

767
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,580
And I'm wondering what the difference in protection is.

768
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,763
Yeah. And secondly, can we use the R because we're on the secondary list?

769
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:29,003
Yeah.

770
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:33,543
I don't believe you can use the R in the secondary register.

771
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:40,465
This is, you got a rejection, and I didn't have time to go into this, but you shouldn't,

772
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:45,627
you can't infringe on other people's existing rights, but you also have to have a name that's

773
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,548
not what they call generic or descriptive.

774
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:55,371
So if your game is too descriptive, or the title is too descriptive of what the goods

775
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:57,712
are like, if Apple were a...

776
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,253
you know, fruit, apple company,

777
00:35:00,253 --> 00:35:03,775
that would be, they would probably reject that trademark.

778
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:06,116
You can say, look, we still want to use it,

779
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:07,277
we know we can't get protection now,

780
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:08,478
they put you in a secondary list,

781
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:10,139
and you can come back in a number of years

782
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:12,360
and say, look, we've been so successful

783
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,601
that even though it initially was generic,

784
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:16,242
people have really started to associate

785
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:19,544
and you'd have to prove it with all this stuff.

786
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:21,025
I'm not 100% I'll look, but I don't believe

787
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:25,068
you can use the registered symbol for the secondary register.

788
00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:28,007
And the difference in level of protection,

789
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:31,330
I mean is there less protection if you're on a secondary list?

790
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,551
Yeah, I mean it's not a registered trademark.

791
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:35,593
It's something that you're basically,

792
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,574
you're there so that you can come back later

793
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:39,756
and prove that you've acquired distinctiveness.

794
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:42,618
So you're just alerting people that you're using it basically.

795
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:43,058
What's that?

796
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,580
You're just alerting people that you're using it?

797
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,721
Yeah, and you're planting a flag

798
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:49,242
so that you can upgrade it later

799
00:35:49,242 --> 00:35:50,383
with the Patent and Trademark Office.

800
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:50,883
Thank you.

801
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:51,284
Yeah, no problem.

802
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:51,924
And I think we're done.

803
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:52,705
Thank you so much.

804
00:35:52,705 --> 00:35:54,566
I've got time in the overflow room if you want.

805
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:55,026
Thank you.

806
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,039
Thank you.
