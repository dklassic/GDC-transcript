1
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,846
So I'm Ryan Kaufman, I'm the VP of Narrative at Jam City,

2
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:12,468
and this talk is titled Narrative Nuances in Mobile Games.

3
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,309
I do have two caveats.

4
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,572
First of all, it is early, I realize it's only 10 a.m.,

5
00:00:18,572 --> 00:00:20,773
but I do swear a lot, so just so you know,

6
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:25,596
don't be shocked, there are cusses in this presentation.

7
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:28,177
And I am sorry, I will do my best not to do that shit.

8
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:31,939
And second, it is totally okay to laugh

9
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:33,380
at my shitty graphics.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,541
I am a writer, I am not a graphic designer.

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,922
And so there's some stuff in there that you might think

12
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:41,123
maybe a child got a hold of my presentation

13
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:43,004
or a chimpanzee or something like that

14
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,564
and it's okay to laugh.

15
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:48,326
I do like a really cheesy Google Slides transition,

16
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:49,566
so enjoy.

17
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:58,186
A bit about who I am, just briefly, I started at LucasArts back in 6000 BC when we made

18
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:01,447
games out of sticks and rocks and it was really cool.

19
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:06,770
And I was in QA and then a designer and then I started to write.

20
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,072
So I do come to writing from a design perspective.

21
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:12,613
So interactive story is something that's...

22
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:17,295
It's always been in my head, how do we make stories that people can play?

23
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:21,956
After that, I was at a place called Planet Moon and we did some sort of co-op and kids

24
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,957
games so I started to broaden what I thought of as the audience.

25
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:30,238
It wasn't just Star Wars people with lightsabers and pew-pew anymore, it was like kids and

26
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:33,578
parents and playing together and having a story experience together.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,144
After that, I was at Telltale Games for eight years.

28
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:39,705
I worked on The Walking Dead.

29
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:43,429
I was creative lead on Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones,

30
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:47,593
in addition to being the narrative director there.

31
00:01:47,593 --> 00:01:49,595
And so, you know, making those games

32
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:52,558
really helped hone the craft of what is interactive story?

33
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:53,999
What does choice mean?

34
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,241
How do you play something?

35
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:58,464
How do you feel these emotions that the character's feeling?

36
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:02,505
And I developed sort of a curriculum about that,

37
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,906
and I gave these seminars to the writers and the designers.

38
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:08,927
And a lot of that is in this presentation.

39
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:11,507
So these are not just theoretical things,

40
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,968
but these are actually some battle-tested techniques

41
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:17,449
that you can take away from this presentation and use,

42
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:19,569
because I know they do work to some extent.

43
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:23,188
And then most recently I came to Jam City,

44
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:26,810
and that's been really interesting

45
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,871
to be engaged with a totally new audience.

46
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:30,332
So in addition to like Harry Potter,

47
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:32,633
we also have games that are super casual

48
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:35,495
like Panda Pop and Cookie Jam,

49
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:38,896
and our audience is comprised

50
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:41,158
of all sorts of different people.

51
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:42,618
So it's been really interesting

52
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:45,920
to develop stories for people I'm not used to developing,

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,961
and that games sometimes ignore.

54
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,102
So that's been really great.

55
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:55,861
For this presentation, I did a lot of research.

56
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,446
And by research, I mean I spent a lot of time

57
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:01,432
looking at Twitter, because that's easier than researching.

58
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:06,540
And at one point I came across this quote and I thought,

59
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,160
this really encapsulates I think

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,401
what our struggle is right now.

61
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:14,642
And that is, we have to deliver all this information

62
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,122
and we've only really got to the point

63
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:18,343
where we can dress it up a little bit about with,

64
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:20,523
we really need to get across,

65
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:23,024
give me 12 ram horns for a plus three sword,

66
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:25,265
but we can kind of gild the lily a bit

67
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:28,486
with the gravid plane and the codicils and realm voids

68
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:29,306
and all that stuff.

69
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,010
But is it any better?

70
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,792
I mean, that's the question.

71
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,493
Boom, look at that.

72
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:36,974
Pretty cool.

73
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:45,560
This is the question I want to address in this presentation.

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,142
We're gonna talk about why it hasn't gotten

75
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:50,423
that much better on the whole.

76
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:53,726
And I think to start with,

77
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,847
maybe it's something to do with how we view our jobs.

78
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,400
So I think we often start with this assumption

79
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,723
that we, the writers, need to transmit the story

80
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:07,124
to the player, who is essentially like a reader.

81
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:10,666
There's a lot of information to cover,

82
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,368
and we need to include backstory and plot,

83
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,469
and more backstory and characters,

84
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,590
oh, you should have those locations, yes.

85
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,091
Critical D, why not more backstory?

86
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:22,013
We're all building A plots, B plots, Z plots.

87
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:27,056
A whole bunch of stuff needs to get shoved into our story.

88
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:32,205
And the experience can be very unequal

89
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,006
on either side of that arrow.

90
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,188
And on our side, we're like sitting there thinking,

91
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,449
we're like Mary Shelley, we've invented a new genre.

92
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:43,051
Because we've given all this amazing lore.

93
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,453
But on the other side, on the player side,

94
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,394
it can be different.

95
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:50,776
It can be kind of like, what, who?

96
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,417
And we have to be careful about that.

97
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,158
And there's some techniques I'm gonna cover

98
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:56,439
to help connect people to that information

99
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,340
we're trying to give them.

100
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:03,054
we labor under maybe a fantasy

101
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,035
that if you pair a well-written story

102
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:07,176
with a reasonable player,

103
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,938
you're gonna get this love affair,

104
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:11,999
and this love affair is gonna last forever.

105
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:14,241
Like these two crazy kids.

106
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:16,662
I think it's gonna work.

107
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:17,083
But all too often,

108
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,985
because we're making them drink from the fire hose,

109
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:23,006
the reaction is more like,

110
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:24,307
yeah, okay, I don't get it, bye.

111
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,889
I'm not connected to this game.

112
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,574
So I see instead of an arrow,

113
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:33,356
I see it more like a virtuous circle.

114
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:38,800
And it starts with the things that we are going to give.

115
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,281
We're going to give emotional story,

116
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,943
we're gonna give character relationships,

117
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:44,485
participatory art, compelling choices,

118
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:47,607
and that the players are gonna come back with,

119
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,589
when they experience their emotional story,

120
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,731
they're gonna come back with emotional investment.

121
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,352
They react to the character relationships

122
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:57,034
with their ships and their memes and all that cool stuff.

123
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:59,022
And the art becomes cosplay.

124
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:02,024
And the choices become tears and loyalty,

125
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:04,545
and I'm coming back and I'm playing season two or whatever.

126
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:07,067
But we have to sustain this circle

127
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,108
because that's how we create the connection.

128
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:12,630
And the connection is extremely important.

129
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,151
The connection is what brings people back.

130
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:19,734
The connection is what builds loyalty or builds investment.

131
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,675
And even monetization.

132
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:28,454
And if you come away from this talk with one idea in your head, if everything I babble

133
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,241
about just like goes completely in one ear and out the other.

134
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:38,328
Remember this, connection is better than information.

135
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:40,469
Information is just data.

136
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:43,231
Your job as writers is to form a connection.

137
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:44,651
You are artists.

138
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,233
You are looking inside of your own heart

139
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,254
so that you can connect with someone else's heart.

140
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:52,675
Information is just, that's for robots.

141
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,116
You're not robots.

142
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:57,098
The people playing these games are not robots.

143
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:59,599
We have to strive for something deeper than that.

144
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:05,275
Information will take care of itself if people feel connected to what you're trying to get at.

145
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:11,581
So this is the big takeaway. You can leave now if you want. I just gave it all away.

146
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:18,307
I just wanted to underline this. I'm really sorry I couldn't make it blink.

147
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:21,582
I'll do better next time.

148
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:24,403
All right, so now that I've established

149
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,503
kind of my large goals,

150
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:28,104
let's talk about actual techniques.

151
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:31,685
And I'm gonna drive through about six proven things

152
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,725
I know can work and that you can take away

153
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,566
and apply to your own games and your own narratives.

154
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:39,246
First, there's right story for right audience,

155
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:43,707
crafting payoffs, something I call writing for the triangle,

156
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:46,288
compelling choices, and sharing is caring.

157
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:49,596
And I realized that I said there were six,

158
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:54,085
and so I'm gonna include a bonus, there will be a cat.

159
00:07:56,288 --> 00:08:01,732
This comes because when I used to give these seminars for the writers and designers at Telltale,

160
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:07,556
the only time we could do it was at lunch, and I knew that they were sitting out there angry that I had taken away their lunch.

161
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:16,062
So I would always promise them, hey, no matter what boring stuff is in my slideshow, I will include a picture of a cute kitty.

162
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:23,587
And that tended to mollify them. So I continue to use that, and it might work on you, too. Hopefully.

163
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,348
Oh, God, I love transitions.

164
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,048
So right story for the right audience.

165
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,209
This is where it often begins,

166
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,170
and it can go wrong right from the start.

167
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,011
You have to know who your audience is,

168
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,292
and you have to know what they care about.

169
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,153
I think sometimes we assume we know.

170
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:48,172
I was in a room recently with some devs who were kind of like blue sky brainstorming

171
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:53,336
What is our game gonna be like and they were throwing out references. They were like I love you know

172
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:56,898
Mario Kart, and I kind of want to be like that and like

173
00:08:56,898 --> 00:09:02,343
Super Smash Bros. and playing a lot of that so they were drawing in all these like really credible references

174
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:05,263
mainly from sort of those Nintendo products.

175
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:10,426
And I said, well, okay, so who's our audience?

176
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:13,207
And they said, oh, it's like women age 50 to 60.

177
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,749
And I went, it's totally possible

178
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:18,030
that these women would get those references,

179
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,392
but we didn't ask anybody and they just assumed they knew.

180
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:22,993
And I think that's where it often goes wrong

181
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:25,334
is that it needs to start with a conversation.

182
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:26,655
You need to go to your audience,

183
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:28,436
first of all, identify your audience.

184
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:32,220
Second, go to them, ask them, what are you into?

185
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,060
What do you value?

186
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,621
Or what are you looking for in a game?

187
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:38,503
Because it's totally possible that you could come

188
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:41,124
to the table with some really credible pitch

189
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:43,066
that included a lot of high quality references,

190
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,087
like, it's gonna be like True Detective,

191
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:46,848
wrapped in the best parts of Jessica Jones,

192
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:49,809
and in a gritty fantasy setting with real political intrigue

193
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:51,810
and like, that sounds really cool.

194
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,892
But what if your audience is like,

195
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,582
They don't get those references,

196
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,463
those values are not important to them.

197
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:01,224
So you sort of wasted everybody's time

198
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:05,866
and it's easy to get caught up in what you love,

199
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:11,629
but remember, there's a second part of that equation.

200
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,070
And what can help you with this are,

201
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,351
for a long time we talked about demographics,

202
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:17,532
and demographics

203
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,437
are now seen as kind of limited, like males 18 to 35.

204
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,580
Well, a male 18 to 35, an 18-year-old male

205
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,164
could be just getting out of high school,

206
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:30,070
and a 35-year-old male could be like,

207
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,712
have kids and own his own house.

208
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,875
And their values and what they're looking for

209
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,776
are not really aligned.

210
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,464
So now we talk more about segmentation,

211
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,205
and there have been a couple of great talks,

212
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,985
so I won't go over segmentation too much,

213
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:44,246
but it's really more about thinking,

214
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,827
slicing through that entire demographic

215
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:48,428
and looking more for personality traits

216
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,648
or like play styles or goals,

217
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:52,529
what your audience is looking for.

218
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,462
So like as an example, we did for Panda Pop recently,

219
00:10:56,462 --> 00:11:00,807
we were thinking about what if we had a more robust story

220
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,669
in Panda Pop, because there kind of isn't a story,

221
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:03,830
it's very suggested.

222
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,613
So we went to the audience and we talked to a lot,

223
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:09,496
you know, we talked to men, we talked to women, all ages,

224
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:12,439
and we sliced sort of one demographic.

225
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,862
and did a little deep dive on like, what do you like about this game?

226
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:19,685
Like, what are you looking for when you when you get into Panda Pop?

227
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:23,109
And there were three groups. And first of all, it was a skill group.

228
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:26,712
And these women were really interested in they wanted high scores.

229
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:29,755
They love to discover strategies. So like how to bank the,

230
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:34,539
you know, like the bubble and understanding the mechanics and using all the various

231
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:37,562
like weaponry on stuff. They were super skill based.

232
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,699
And then there was a second group,

233
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,761
and they were more resonating with the content.

234
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:45,443
They liked the cute pandas, they liked the magical world.

235
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:48,025
That's what was getting them back into the game.

236
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:51,528
And then the third group was the escape group,

237
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:55,530
like the, this is my stress relief, this is my me time.

238
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,673
It was a little place they could go to get away from it all.

239
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:04,895
And that was really instructive for thinking about the story

240
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:08,397
because it automatically gives you a sense of

241
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,098
who your story might appeal to.

242
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:12,540
And or, even better, we started to think about

243
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,983
how could we include some of these elements in the story

244
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:19,245
so that players could feel they were reflected somehow.

245
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:21,867
Like, could some of the pandas be very,

246
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,029
like, skill-minded pandas who take pride

247
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:25,130
in how well they do.

248
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,531
And...

249
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,516
we're not the only people who think about this.

250
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,877
I mean, Netflix, oh, this is interesting.

251
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,877
They talk about taste communities.

252
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:36,778
And you can see it in their ads right now.

253
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:39,298
I have a bunch of ads where a bunch of really

254
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:41,699
disparate looking people are all sitting around

255
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:42,899
watching Umbrella Academy.

256
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,380
And I think that's really real.

257
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,480
I mean, both my daughter and I really enjoyed that show

258
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,901
for completely different reasons.

259
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,122
But when you think more about segmentation

260
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,762
than demographics, it opens up.

261
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,336
Again, avenues for connection.

262
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:58,497
You're trying to connect with people,

263
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:02,481
you have to know what they're looking for.

264
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,942
So the ideal way to conceive a story.

265
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:07,869
This is a graphic you can laugh at.

266
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:10,251
I do that with my finger, guys.

267
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:13,394
So, it should start with the stuff you love.

268
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,035
I don't want you to come away from this talk

269
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:17,217
thinking, Ryan told me I can't do what I love.

270
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,279
Please, start with what you love.

271
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,801
It has to start from something real,

272
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,042
and that something is probably in your heart

273
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,604
or from your life.

274
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,487
But don't forget to include the stuff they love, too,

275
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:30,548
and know what that is.

276
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:31,929
Don't guess at it, go ask.

277
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:37,328
And the sweet spot is the pink squiggly bit.

278
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:40,229
And pink squiggly bit is so important to know

279
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:45,130
because that's where your game story should live.

280
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,111
And I would love for that quote to get taken out of context.

281
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:50,131
Pink squiggly bit.

282
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:53,432
So now that you have pink squiggly bit

283
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,212
and you kind of know what the values are,

284
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:58,153
what kind of story should you tell?

285
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:01,375
why don't we go to the old hoary chestnut?

286
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,796
What about the hero's journey?

287
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:05,958
Okay, incredible story template.

288
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,840
You have, you know, what does it look like?

289
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,601
Well, it's got a call to action, there's an arc,

290
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,242
you know, there's shenanigans in the middle

291
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,964
where you have adventures and fight monsters

292
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:16,086
and stormtroopers, and then there's a resolution

293
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:18,808
where there's a big conflict

294
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:22,210
and the hero learns something about herself and changes.

295
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:26,589
And that works really well because it maps really well

296
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,570
or has mapped really well to like triple A,

297
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,171
single player type of games

298
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,212
where you're gonna start with a tutorial.

299
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:34,213
It's like, how do I get involved?

300
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:35,753
And then there's gonna be a mid game

301
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:37,915
and that's all your levels.

302
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:39,695
And then there's the final boss who comes in

303
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:42,937
and you fight and the game ends and boom,

304
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:46,399
it kind of maps nicely over the top.

305
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,820
But we're in a different era now.

306
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,861
So free to play kind of looks more like this, doesn't it?

307
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,600
You have your fatui and then there's like,

308
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,844
you start churning through those levels

309
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,987
and you get like level 500 and level 1000,

310
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:01,954
but it just keeps kind of pointing out infinitely.

311
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:04,958
So that doesn't look like the hero's journey.

312
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,521
There's no arc, there's no resolution.

313
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:13,821
So then what? What kind of story is this? I say consider the humble sitcom structure.

314
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:20,042
I mean sitcoms are built like this. They start with a cast of characters and they don't know

315
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:24,803
how many seasons they're going to go. So they really have to build the story to be

316
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:31,624
somewhat pliably infinite. And their structure looks more like this. We have all these ups and

317
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:35,105
downs. And they're way more frequent, which

318
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,907
we know suits a mobile environment a lot better.

319
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:41,389
So I'm not saying you have to.

320
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,290
I'm saying consider.

321
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,330
This is a really interesting possibility.

322
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,311
And I'll make one more play for it.

323
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,971
I'm not being paid by the sitcom industry

324
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:48,831
or anything like that.

325
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,012
I just really see that there's potential here.

326
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:54,353
First of all, sitcoms are based on characters

327
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,973
with unresolvable dilemmas.

328
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:59,034
Like Leslie Knope is always going to be naively optimistic.

329
00:15:59,034 --> 00:15:59,874
She's not gonna change.

330
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:02,535
Joey's never gonna turn into a rocket scientist.

331
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:06,016
Ron Swanson is never gonna believe in government.

332
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:10,859
But that's fine. That's what we want out of that entertainment.

333
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:16,923
And putting those characters in conflict is how you generate stories over and over and over.

334
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:18,704
And it can scale infinitely.

335
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,386
They also have clear act breaks.

336
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:24,649
So every sitcom, if it's a half an hour, it's got three act breaks.

337
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,031
And that also gives you a really nice rhythm.

338
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:30,393
And it's something that you can map onto your own stories.

339
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,666
They're smaller, producible arcs.

340
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,787
It's not like a gigantic 60-hour mega arc.

341
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:39,311
You can do smaller iterations on that.

342
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:43,095
And the scenes tend to be character-based.

343
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:45,738
I mean, you could do most sitcom scenes in a room,

344
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,440
an empty room with two chairs and two characters.

345
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,902
That could be a sitcom scene.

346
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:50,763
It's totally doable.

347
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:53,665
And that's way closer to

348
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,830
how we need to produce things in mobile.

349
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,853
It has to be somewhat cheap,

350
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,876
somewhat easy to produce, and quick.

351
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,819
We have a lot of content to put out.

352
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:04,461
And so if you look at sitcoms,

353
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,324
there's a nice parallel there.

354
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:08,728
But don't forget.

355
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:11,354
do fit your content to its format,

356
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:13,976
especially if you're working with a big IP.

357
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:16,258
So for example, what I mean is,

358
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:18,779
in Harry Potter we have like the books

359
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,061
have these amazing set piece adventure things,

360
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:24,923
you know, the lake of fire with a million zombies

361
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,864
coming out and attacking them.

362
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:27,705
The movies do this too,

363
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,326
because they're visual medium

364
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:30,726
and movies have to be a spectacle.

365
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,095
However, with Hogwarts Mystery,

366
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:40,517
we knew we needed to be somewhat more contained and smaller,

367
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,458
but still feel very meaningful and connected.

368
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,359
So Hogwarts Mystery is all about characters.

369
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,440
There's a million characters and you meet them all

370
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,740
and they have different personalities

371
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,401
and putting those personalities into a room together

372
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:54,662
is how we drive the drama.

373
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:57,202
We don't do it with giant set pieces,

374
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,223
we do it with character drama.

375
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:02,024
And that's because we're fitting the content to the format.

376
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,319
All right, number two, crafting payoffs.

377
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,422
Okay, so now that you've got your audience in the door

378
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,784
and you're telling them the right story,

379
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,246
how do you keep them there?

380
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:17,588
Regular narrative payoffs bond a player to a game.

381
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:19,550
What you wanna do is establish a habit

382
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,753
or establish an expectation of this payoff

383
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:24,414
that's gonna come.

384
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:30,511
And you need to do that by starting with emotional storytelling, not informational storytelling.

385
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:35,315
You will never hook anybody with a bunch of data about, here's some plot points and a

386
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,157
list of planets you're going to visit.

387
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:38,698
Nobody cares.

388
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:40,939
They just don't.

389
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:43,401
Remember what I said, connection is better than information.

390
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:45,143
Start with a connection.

391
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:50,907
And that means starting with a theme, because themes are what people feel.

392
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:53,849
Theme is a really easy way to explain to people how they're supposed to feel about your game

393
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:54,530
or feel in your game.

394
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,240
And you have to know what it is.

395
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,182
I can't tell you how many devs I've talked to

396
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:00,223
that they would explain their story.

397
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,384
You go here, you go there.

398
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:03,145
And I'm like, okay, that sounds cool,

399
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:04,206
but what's your theme?

400
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:06,568
What's the theme of the game?

401
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:09,350
And just, look, I just haven't thought about it.

402
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,832
So think about it.

403
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:12,713
Examples of themes are like.

404
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:15,409
When we were doing Game of Thrones,

405
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,872
we talked with some people who knew George R.R. Martin,

406
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,853
and we talked a lot about this idea

407
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:22,534
of your passions will destroy you.

408
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,635
And that's a theme that runs all the way

409
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:25,576
through Game of Thrones.

410
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:28,938
And we see characters who, like Robb Stark, spoilers,

411
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:33,821
his passion for his father, that loyalty,

412
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:37,324
drives him to pursue revenge, which leads to his death

413
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,145
and the death of a lot of people he loves.

414
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,567
And that kind of thing you see all over the place.

415
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,529
And in mobile, it kind of, I was trying to think of examples of this in mobile, and I

416
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:53,313
thought of Donut County, and it kind of tickled me because I think it's applicable to what

417
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:53,573
we do, too.

418
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:55,554
Romance is always a good one.

419
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:57,295
Romance is something we all understand.

420
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:04,479
At some point in our lives, we engage with it personally, and it's a really powerful

421
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,660
driver for players, too.

422
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:10,160
And there are a lot of games out right now that engage in romance.

423
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,901
And even in Potter, we're sort of starting to explore that, too,

424
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,202
as the kids get older.

425
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,542
We just did our celestial ball.

426
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:20,745
So that was and that was well received by the fans.

427
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:24,007
Redemption, especially Redemption, interrupted.

428
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:27,409
So with Walking Dead, we had Lee and that whole first season

429
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,190
was all about Redemption interrupted.

430
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,651
And it's very tragic and sad and it makes you cry.

431
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,732
And actually, sadness is a powerful theme,

432
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:37,732
and it's something that I think,

433
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:41,174
especially in mobile, we're scared of.

434
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,715
Mobile is traditionally very conservative

435
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:44,635
when it comes to content,

436
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:46,056
because we don't want to scare anyone off.

437
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:51,278
However, I've seen it work in games like Lily's Garden,

438
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:51,658
where

439
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:57,312
I take a pretty common trope of the kind of homescapes like builders.

440
00:20:57,312 --> 00:21:01,415
And that is that a relative has died and left you this giant estate.

441
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:05,258
And the story ends up being about like the estate that you renovate instead of

442
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,259
like, wait, somebody died.

443
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,041
Like, did I love them?

444
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,343
Does, am I sad about that?

445
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:14,845
And I think Lily's garden does a great job of bringing that grief back in a way

446
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:18,748
that's not oppressive, but it feels real and three-dimensional.

447
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:19,469
So props to them.

448
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,822
Now that you have theme, you have to think about cadence.

449
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:28,465
Like I said, you want to establish a habit.

450
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:31,669
And you don't want to give them the extended edition

451
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,110
with the beards that go to the floor,

452
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,253
when all they want is like Seinfeld.

453
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,695
You want a quick experience.

454
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,618
They might, because you've done your research

455
00:21:39,618 --> 00:21:41,400
and you know what your audience wants.

456
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:48,446
So for Telltale, just quickly, we had sort of a 90 to 120 minute experience,

457
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:51,667
and every episode ended with a big cliffhanger.

458
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:57,288
And it was followed by a next time on, which was essentially a tease for the next thing.

459
00:21:57,288 --> 00:22:00,709
So we knew we would have at least one big emotional payoff.

460
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:04,110
And then interspersed, we had what we called the big five.

461
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,091
And those were like smaller payoffs.

462
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,131
And those would happen about every 15 minutes or so.

463
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:10,747
So, excuse me.

464
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:14,791
So this is kind of like what the cadence looked like

465
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,812
for a typical Telltale episode.

466
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,475
And every 15 minutes worked for that format

467
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:21,018
because we knew people were probably sitting on their couch.

468
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:24,021
They were pretty dedicated to trying to finish the episode.

469
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:27,104
We weren't competing for their attention as much.

470
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:35,145
With Potter, we have these things called time-limited side quests, and those tend to be for one

471
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,427
big theme that is chopped into maybe six to eight chapters, and each chapter takes place

472
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:42,248
in a location, and they're about 10 minutes each.

473
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:44,048
So it's a smaller time slice.

474
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,009
And each chapter is a mini cliffhanger

475
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:46,990
about halfway through.

476
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,631
And that mini cliffhanger tends to come

477
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:50,553
in the form of a question.

478
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:52,914
It's usually they're trying to do,

479
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,396
solve some mystery or figure out ingredients

480
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:57,117
for a potion or something like that.

481
00:22:57,117 --> 00:23:00,059
So it's like a what is question,

482
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:00,720
like what is ingredient X?

483
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,301
And then they go and they work on it.

484
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:05,423
And this is where the player spends their energy.

485
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:08,505
And that always ends with a payoff,

486
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:11,608
which is the, okay, now we know, we figured it out.

487
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:17,234
and that pivots the scene to what's next.

488
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:18,874
And each chapter usually has a choice

489
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:20,775
and it's often a role play choice.

490
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:24,417
So you get at least one moment of forming a relationship

491
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:25,817
or changing a relationship with a character

492
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,778
and then it ends with a hint of what's next.

493
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:31,240
So in some senses, it is kind of like a mini version

494
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,720
of the Telltale Cadence

495
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,842
or like most dramatic episodic format.

496
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:39,643
So kind of looks like this.

497
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:44,655
And there you go.

498
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:46,814
And I drew that with my finger, too, so I'm very proud of it.

499
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,681
So you can see this actually if you blew it up and copy pasted it,

500
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,542
it would kind of look like that telltale thing.

501
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:58,144
But what's important about both of those examples is that was

502
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:01,526
very much codified by the teams.

503
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:03,606
These are like rules.

504
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:06,008
They were always something we would evaluate and say,

505
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:07,909
do we have our big payoff for Potter?

506
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:10,890
It's like, do we have the scene pivot and do we have

507
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,672
something to send players off to the next location?

508
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:16,913
So making it more of a formal.

509
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:25,799
Structure is really important to make sure you're not missing that and that you're creating that habit

510
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,962
And remember that this is a retention tool like once you form a habit

511
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:34,805
Don't don't let it go like that's really tough. So be consistent and

512
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:42,351
Deliver on the promise of your theme. It's important to deliver on that promise and speaking of promise. Hey, what about that cat?

513
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:45,913
You told us there was a cat and frankly, I don't think you deserve the cat yet

514
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,870
That's just me, that's how I'm feeling.

515
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,031
You can't force me.

516
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:54,633
All right, so now that we've got our audience,

517
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:57,615
we've got some sort of cadence,

518
00:24:57,615 --> 00:25:00,516
now let's talk about this notion of writing for the triangle.

519
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:02,657
And this is a really easy technique to take

520
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:04,638
and use yourself, or at least be aware of

521
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,599
when you're doing it.

522
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,740
A lot of times we have...

523
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:10,773
dialogue between two NPCs.

524
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:11,994
And they can be really cool NPCs.

525
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:13,855
They can be very well-written, of course they are,

526
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:17,597
because you guys are great writers.

527
00:25:17,597 --> 00:25:20,299
And you got Cersei, and she's very interesting and evil,

528
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:21,900
and she's gonna say something cool.

529
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,501
And Tyrion is super funny and witty,

530
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:25,021
and he's gonna say something cool.

531
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:26,943
So we spend all our dramatic energy

532
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:30,184
in that conversation between these two characters,

533
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:33,647
because we know it's gonna be fun and fireworks.

534
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:38,186
What we forget about, though, is the player.

535
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:41,388
The player's sitting there and it's now non-interactive.

536
00:25:41,388 --> 00:25:44,330
I mean, and that's fine for TV, that's fine for movies,

537
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,671
that's what we expect.

538
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,472
But if they're sitting there with a phone in their hand,

539
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:51,074
they do want a little bit of that interactivity.

540
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:52,895
So are we forming a connection?

541
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:56,938
No, this is information, this is one way.

542
00:25:56,938 --> 00:26:00,040
So even the best dialogue then becomes,

543
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,102
kind of lands in that information bucket.

544
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:04,163
So how do you fix this?

545
00:26:05,873 --> 00:26:07,495
This is a really common way to do it,

546
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:08,496
and we did it in Harry Potter.

547
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:10,457
This is an example of how it works.

548
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:13,520
This is Penny, and Penny's currently engaged

549
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,423
in a project to create decorations.

550
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:18,904
And her teacher, Professor Flitwick,

551
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:21,326
has told her you are not to use magic

552
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:24,148
to create these decorations, and she follows rules.

553
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:28,311
So she is of the opinion we shouldn't use magic

554
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,132
to enhance the decorations.

555
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:31,514
So character one states an opinion.

556
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:33,846
Then you have character two,

557
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:37,507
and character two usually has the opposite opinion,

558
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:40,047
or at least a different opinion.

559
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:42,448
This is all well and good.

560
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:46,749
Then the two characters turn to the main character,

561
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:48,769
the player, and ask an opinion.

562
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:52,730
They solicit participation, they solicit the opinion.

563
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,371
And I want you to note the positions of these characters

564
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:58,531
because that's what I'm talking about.

565
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:00,892
We're starting to form that triangle physically.

566
00:27:00,892 --> 00:27:01,892
You're telling the player.

567
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:05,064
that they are part of what's going on.

568
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:07,566
And the camera work here reinforces that.

569
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:13,571
And then we allow for actual input.

570
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:15,974
So here's the interface and the choice then becomes

571
00:27:15,974 --> 00:27:19,077
let's use magic or don't use magic.

572
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:21,539
And here's the most important thing

573
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,641
that I think people forget about a lot.

574
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:33,923
feedback. So the narrative solicits your input and then gives you feedback to say,

575
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:36,987
I heard what you said. I saw what you valued.

576
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:40,785
Your opinion matters, and now the narrative

577
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,565
has changed somewhat because of that.

578
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:43,846
We're acknowledging it.

579
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:46,446
And in this sense, it was done nicely

580
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,006
through the narrative itself.

581
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:52,267
There wasn't an on-screen UI or anything like that.

582
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:55,908
This is actually one of the characters saying,

583
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,788
oh yeah, because Hermione told us not to.

584
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:02,369
So what we're really doing there

585
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:04,109
is we're taking some of that dramatic energy

586
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:07,050
that we usually invest in an NPC dialogue.

587
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,492
and using some of that energy to solicit player input.

588
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:13,714
And then we're using some more of that energy

589
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:16,055
to create narrative feedback.

590
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:18,337
So you can call that branching or whatever,

591
00:28:18,337 --> 00:28:21,219
but you're forming that triangle with the player.

592
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:26,082
They are involved in this conversation.

593
00:28:26,082 --> 00:28:28,623
And so that's where the triangle comes from.

594
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,445
And that's where you get that connection

595
00:28:30,445 --> 00:28:32,846
because now they're invested in this conversation.

596
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:34,107
They had some input.

597
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:36,628
They're interested to see what happens next.

598
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:44,880
So now that we've got them talking to the game,

599
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,161
how do we create those choices that are compelling?

600
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:48,762
Because not all choices are created equal.

601
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:55,927
I'll tell you this, good choices are a sleight of hand.

602
00:28:55,927 --> 00:28:57,908
What you're really doing as devs, as creators,

603
00:28:57,908 --> 00:29:01,911
is you're implanting ideas in the player's head.

604
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:07,274
And then at a key moment, you ask them for their opinion,

605
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:08,054
and you put those

606
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:15,741
those topics on screen as if the player thought of them themselves. What? That's the best form of

607
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:23,126
a choice because it feels like the player is like, oh yeah, this is what I was thinking of anyway.

608
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:27,689
And they should feel like they are organically arise from the player's own mind.

609
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:31,686
And you can contrast this with choices that arise externally,

610
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,908
like from an author.

611
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:34,070
So for instance, if I said,

612
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,736
guys, what's your favorite flavor of ice cream?

613
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,301
And then I listed your options and I said,

614
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:42,925
pistachio, chunky monkey, and banana.

615
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:48,632
Like those are technically ice creams, but it's probably not what you were thinking.

616
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:52,196
It's probably not even close to the range of stuff you were thinking about.

617
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:56,742
And that can feel very much like an authored choice or an inorganic choice.

618
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,565
And what I should have said was probably something like chocolate, strawberry and vanilla,

619
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:02,809
like fairly safe, like probably something that was in your head.

620
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:07,419
So setting that context and setting the parameters

621
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:09,663
for what that choice could look like is really important too

622
00:30:09,663 --> 00:30:12,768
because that's how you narrow the field to something

623
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:15,693
that you can control and use that sleight of hand magic

624
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:17,436
to make it all seem very seamless.

625
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:21,413
And the last thing to do is to strive to find room

626
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,073
for personal expression in the choices.

627
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,535
So remember, you're not conducting a survey.

628
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:26,795
You're really trying to elicit

629
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,736
some kind of personal expression,

630
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,557
some sort of emotion from the player,

631
00:30:30,557 --> 00:30:32,778
because again, that's where your connection

632
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:34,178
is gonna come from.

633
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:36,179
If the answer's coming from their heart,

634
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,180
you're probably in a really good place.

635
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,701
You've really connected with them.

636
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:44,223
And by the way, so monetization and premium choices

637
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:47,204
fuck all this shit up, so I will get to that later.

638
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:50,589
Let's just put that to one side for now.

639
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:54,652
Anyway, I want to illustrate kind of what I'm talking about.

640
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,193
It's fairly subtle, and so we'll do a fake case study.

641
00:30:57,193 --> 00:31:00,015
This does not exist anywhere, but I made it up for this,

642
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:03,958
and it's called the Draco Malfoy Beatdown.

643
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,560
So let's say we're in a Harry Potter game,

644
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,882
and we get a prompt from the game as players,

645
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:13,825
and it says, Draco Malfoy is coming down the hallway.

646
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:15,006
What do you do?

647
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:15,606
There he is.

648
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,460
And your choices are duck into a broom closet,

649
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,344
take out your wand and attack, and make friends.

650
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:28,131
Now, these are all choices that don't break reality.

651
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:29,713
But do they feel organic?

652
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:35,062
I say no. I think there is a lot wrong with this range of choices.

653
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:38,804
First of all, like the detail of the broom closet came completely from me, the author.

654
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:44,428
Like I didn't say anything about the broom closet when I said Draco Malfoy is coming down the hallway.

655
00:31:44,428 --> 00:31:50,472
So in order to introducing that into the choice space is bizarre, like not what you were thinking, right?

656
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:54,383
Taking out your wand and attacking, I guess so,

657
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:56,805
but is he doing anything aggressive?

658
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:59,567
Why would a player be reacting that way?

659
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:00,488
They wouldn't.

660
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:02,630
It's totally a suggestion from me, the author.

661
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,163
And also the parameters are completely wide open.

662
00:32:06,163 --> 00:32:08,565
The question is, what would you do?

663
00:32:08,565 --> 00:32:09,926
Or what do you do?

664
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:11,767
I mean, there's a million things I could do.

665
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:14,449
I could run away, I could like run up and kiss him.

666
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:16,350
Like, why aren't those represented here?

667
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,171
So the choice piece is really, really problematic.

668
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,693
And finally, there's no personal expression.

669
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:23,654
Why would I be expressing any of these?

670
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:26,156
And what does it have to do with how I'm feeling?

671
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:27,657
There's no prompts for how to feel

672
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:30,238
about Draco Malfoy coming down the hallway.

673
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,799
It's too neutral, it's too wide open.

674
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,561
So this choice is super problematic in a lot of ways, but we can fix it.

675
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:42,023
First of all, let's give a little more context and a smaller

676
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:44,384
parameter to the prompt.

677
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:47,746
So here he is, he's looking a little more aggressive.

678
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:53,368
Let's change it to Draco Malfoy challenges you to a duel in the hallway, but you

679
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:56,349
know, dueling is against the rules.

680
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,050
What do you do?

681
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,051
Accept the duel, refuse the duel.

682
00:33:01,335 --> 00:33:04,016
or tell them I'll meet you later at the bike racks.

683
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,658
We'll go out behind Hagrid's Hut and, you know,

684
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:10,700
off school grounds and I'll kick your ass there.

685
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,760
So we're closer.

686
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,301
This is more organic.

687
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:15,663
It's probably, when I said challenges you to a duel,

688
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:17,724
you were probably thinking something like,

689
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:20,605
oh, we're gonna fight, or I'm not gonna fight.

690
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:23,747
So that binary is more organic.

691
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:26,008
But it is also very philosophical

692
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:27,449
because the whole thing of,

693
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:29,039
you know, it's against the rules.

694
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,761
Well, rules didn't come from you.

695
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,703
Rules aren't inside of your heart.

696
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:35,807
Rules are something that are, again, external.

697
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,351
And there might be moments when following the rules

698
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:40,694
is something emotionally engaging, but not here.

699
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:46,185
The parameters are closed, so we really narrowed the field

700
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:47,666
by saying you challenge to a dual.

701
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:50,527
So the choices do feel a little more natural.

702
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:52,469
The deferment choice is not great.

703
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:54,450
Really, the meet later at the bike racks

704
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,111
is just a way of saying,

705
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:59,513
let's return to this exact same choice later.

706
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:00,934
And that doesn't really do anything

707
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:02,135
for your story or for the player.

708
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:05,156
So the final suggestion would be,

709
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,238
how could we make this a more personal,

710
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:09,179
player-centric question?

711
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:12,266
And here's my attempt to do that.

712
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:13,426
So now we can change this to,

713
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:18,228
Malfoy challenges you to a duel in front of your new crush,

714
00:34:18,228 --> 00:34:22,110
who then offers to defend you.

715
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,231
And your choices are, fight Malfoy yourself, I got this.

716
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:31,394
Leave without fighting, way of the peaceful warrior.

717
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:32,554
Let your crush defend you.

718
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:35,684
And then it does sort of suggest a fourth one,

719
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:37,005
which is beat his ass together.

720
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:41,168
So like, this is how couples bond sometimes.

721
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:46,432
So what I did was to create a more personal version

722
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:47,352
of the same question.

723
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,014
So now instead of asking about rules,

724
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:51,195
we put a little romance in there.

725
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:53,417
So this is probably something more close

726
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:56,579
to how you think and feel and your worries and anxieties,

727
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:58,921
because that all comes out when we introduce romance

728
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,201
or someone you want to impress.

729
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,203
So the parameters in the context are more clear.

730
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,003
What's going on?

731
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,084
Who's there?

732
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:07,344
What's your relationship to them?

733
00:35:07,344 --> 00:35:09,425
It's your crush.

734
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:10,445
It's Draco Malfoy.

735
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:11,205
He's being a dick.

736
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:16,247
So, and finally, the personalization is stronger

737
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,248
because now at least there's an implied relationship outcome.

738
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:21,489
Like if your crush says, I'll defend you,

739
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,249
and you say, don't.

740
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:29,372
There's maybe some implied relationship change there, or you let them do it. Again,

741
00:35:29,372 --> 00:35:33,553
implied relationship change. And this is how to get closer to maybe what the player

742
00:35:33,553 --> 00:35:38,215
really feels and thinks inside. And when they give the game that kind of input,

743
00:35:38,215 --> 00:35:42,837
they're sharing personal information. And that's how you create a connection and a bond.

744
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:48,348
So again, so monetization, just so you know,

745
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:51,030
we do survive on monetization and I'm not like down on it,

746
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,552
but I think it's worth calling out

747
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:56,134
that it activates a different part of the brain.

748
00:35:56,134 --> 00:36:00,637
And it's like an acquisitive part of the brain.

749
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:02,278
It's the brain, it's part of the brain

750
00:36:02,278 --> 00:36:03,239
that like wants something.

751
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:08,235
And you can see it's often kind of staged that way.

752
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:11,176
So here's an example from choices.

753
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:11,856
And I like choices.

754
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:13,316
I mean, I'm not down on choices or anything.

755
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:16,517
But this is a good example of how they have to bend over

756
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:17,597
backwards to make this work.

757
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:21,178
So the first frame, your boss is asking you out to dinner.

758
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,078
Like, so far, so good.

759
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:23,499
Relationships are clear.

760
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:25,339
Stakes are clear.

761
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:28,640
Then you notice that the game itself has to introduce a

762
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,720
piece of meta text to actually tell you what

763
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,601
this choice is about.

764
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:33,801
And it's not really about.

765
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:40,062
your love life, it's like you need access to your new boss.

766
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,583
And then that's followed by,

767
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,864
okay, now do you want to buy that access?

768
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:48,764
The implication is you're gonna miss something if you don't.

769
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:49,704
And so that's different,

770
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:51,845
and it just works in a different part of the brain.

771
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:57,046
And be conscious of when you mix them together,

772
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:59,927
sometimes the gears can grind, sometimes it can work,

773
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,507
but I just wanna throw that out there.

774
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:08,525
So finally, sharing is caring.

775
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:12,666
And when I mentioned participatory art earlier,

776
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,727
I was talking about characters and dialogue

777
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:17,228
that lend themselves to sharing.

778
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:21,769
And what I mean by that is fan art and memes and cosplay.

779
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:24,509
And these are a big part of games now.

780
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:28,370
And fostering that community is really important too.

781
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:35,825
you want to give people something that survives really well outside of the game.

782
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:41,208
Like, are your characters too visually complex to make any sense to somebody who hasn't played them?

783
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:46,531
Or do you have like a cool, you know, a catchphrase that like totally works outside of the game?

784
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,793
If someone took a snapshot of it and sent it to their friend who never played it...

785
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,554
how well would that person kind of understand

786
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:54,175
what this game was getting at,

787
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:57,657
either in terms of humor and tone

788
00:37:57,657 --> 00:37:59,198
or just some funny concept.

789
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:02,319
It's absolutely worth thinking about at a very early stage

790
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,881
so that you can create something shareable.

791
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,962
One example of this is like

792
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:10,984
using really distinct costume or visual designs,

793
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,445
something that's actually easy for someone

794
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:15,486
to caricature or cosplay.

795
00:38:15,486 --> 00:38:16,607
I mean, break it down to like,

796
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:20,301
we introduced this character, Diego Caplan, into Hogwarts.

797
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:23,727
And he was designed with this bright yellow Hufflepuff scarf.

798
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:26,312
And like, that's something you can draw.

799
00:38:26,312 --> 00:38:27,514
And the blue jean jacket.

800
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:31,100
And sure enough, when people went to create fan art,

801
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,290
This is a totally different art style.

802
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,011
They're not trying to draw Diego Caplan in a way

803
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:37,472
that you recognize him from the game.

804
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:40,293
They've picked up on those visual elements.

805
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:41,534
And that's what I'm talking about

806
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:43,054
in terms of shareability.

807
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,875
If you can do it in a few lines,

808
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,037
it's more powerful because you've widened the audience

809
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:51,078
of people who can then do fan art about your characters.

810
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,092
Again, so for Marula Snyde, she's one of the main characters,

811
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:59,712
she's got this highlight in her hair.

812
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,893
And guess what?

813
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:03,713
When people started to do fan art of Marula,

814
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:05,054
that was the go-to element.

815
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:06,654
Everybody picked up on it.

816
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:09,515
Once you get that, you know who she is.

817
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:11,016
And it transfers into real life too.

818
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,216
So this young lady was doing the cosplay

819
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:17,298
and she got the wig and did the bright highlight

820
00:39:17,298 --> 00:39:18,358
and boom, she's Marula.

821
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,419
And that's the kind of thing that...

822
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:28,680
lowers the barrier to entry for fans who might otherwise be like, I can't replicate this costume.

823
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,442
Well, now you can. This is easy. This is simple and it's accessible and go out, do it, cosplay,

824
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:41,945
and spread the love for Marula. And it's not just Harry Potter. I remember when we were

825
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:46,347
at Telltale, we were talking to Gearbox about Tales from the Borderlands, and I asked them,

826
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:48,938
about the relationship with the fans,

827
00:39:48,938 --> 00:39:49,998
and they were telling me that,

828
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:52,459
even at the concept art stage,

829
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:56,581
they think about their characters as being cosplay.

830
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:59,422
Like, what body type is this good for cosplay?

831
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:01,923
Or what visual element on this character

832
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:03,224
is appropriate for cosplay?

833
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:03,864
Can we simplify it?

834
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:07,466
Can we heighten something so that people can do this,

835
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:08,746
and that the fans can go out there

836
00:40:08,746 --> 00:40:10,847
and really celebrate the game,

837
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:13,068
instead of making it so, I don't know,

838
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:15,970
maybe visually complex that it's hard to cosplay?

839
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,211
So you can see it right here.

840
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:21,037
This is Maya, and she's got those three really strong

841
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:24,341
visual elements, the hair, the yellow one piece, and this big

842
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:24,942
old tattoo.

843
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:30,630
And sure enough, someone goes out to cosplay, she nailed it.

844
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,773
You would know who she was if you were even a casual fan of

845
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:33,374
Borderlands.

846
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:36,802
And you can also take it to the next level.

847
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:39,343
Like this is not to exclude people

848
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,705
who really want to go bananas on the costume.

849
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,065
But you can see there's a range here

850
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,947
and somewhat accessible range for people at the lower end

851
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:48,448
who just like maybe are more casual fans.

852
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:49,569
Well, now she's a cosplay fan.

853
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:52,851
I don't actually know anything about this woman.

854
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,411
She could be a totally dedicated cosplayer.

855
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:59,094
But my point is creating something simple to replicate.

856
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,283
Another thing is inclusive and representational characters and relationships inspire fans.

857
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:14,407
So addressing and engaging underserved communities.

858
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:16,489
We can do this.

859
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:22,774
Like we just came up in Avengers Academy where there's a relationship between Niko and Carolina

860
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:27,377
that's in the comics and they sort of have an on again off again thing.

861
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:31,794
they wouldn't really touch this in the Avengers movie.

862
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:33,676
You know, I think there's some media

863
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:36,637
that feels it's too big to go for this type of thing.

864
00:41:36,637 --> 00:41:41,300
But we can work in the so-called margins of larger IP

865
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,702
and create and address these communities

866
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:49,665
and say like, look, you're part of this and draw them in.

867
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:51,806
And that I got this off of a Tumblr

868
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:54,147
because someone found it in the game and was so excited,

869
00:41:54,147 --> 00:41:55,748
they posted the whole sequence

870
00:41:55,748 --> 00:41:57,729
where Nico asked her out on a date.

871
00:41:58,554 --> 00:41:59,974
She says, I have a weird question.

872
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:04,917
And it's just a really cute moment

873
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,658
that we were able to put into the game.

874
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:10,381
Someone saw it, felt like included, posted it,

875
00:42:10,381 --> 00:42:12,182
and then that went out to all their friends.

876
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:15,384
And we saw it again with Walking Dead,

877
00:42:15,384 --> 00:42:18,065
where we introduced the possibility, the choice

878
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:19,726
for a player to start a relationship,

879
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:22,228
that Clementine and Violet could have a relationship.

880
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:24,609
And we put this scene in where they have their first kiss.

881
00:42:25,365 --> 00:42:27,486
And of course, the community picked up on it.

882
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:28,927
Immediately, the fan art started coming.

883
00:42:28,927 --> 00:42:30,828
And they really ran with it,

884
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:32,709
to the point where they even created

885
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:34,910
their own name for it.

886
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,932
So, these communities,

887
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:41,034
especially if they haven't been well-represented in the past

888
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:42,855
can be extremely passionate

889
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:45,776
if you represent them in your games and address them.

890
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:51,610
Encouraging community response is key.

891
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,211
And we do have a place in, you know,

892
00:42:54,211 --> 00:42:56,673
Hogwarts Mystery has a Facebook page,

893
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:58,955
and occasionally they ask fun questions for the fans,

894
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:00,996
like, what do you think of Diego?

895
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,457
And people just love to pop off.

896
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,919
And they just wanna have that outlet to say,

897
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:07,594
you know, got a crush on this character,

898
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:09,915
or no way, he's totally not my crush.

899
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:12,276
Like, they want to sound off,

900
00:43:12,276 --> 00:43:15,198
and you should give them the space to do that.

901
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:17,339
Not only is it just fun for the fans,

902
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:20,100
but we look at these responses,

903
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,161
and we think about, well,

904
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:24,363
how do we include Diego in future episodes?

905
00:43:24,363 --> 00:43:24,963
How should we use him?

906
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:26,084
How are people feeling about him?

907
00:43:26,084 --> 00:43:29,285
Even if sometimes it's negative.

908
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:30,326
They're like, well, we don't like him,

909
00:43:30,326 --> 00:43:32,207
so then our job is to say,

910
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:33,988
oh, we should probably make Diego more likable.

911
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:34,748
What's wrong with him?

912
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:43,598
And starting with that fan response, again, it's that circle. It informs new content.

913
00:43:43,598 --> 00:43:49,465
So finally, as a sort of a cap on this, don't explain your story to death. I know it's...

914
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:52,717
We all get very passionate about the stories we want to tell,

915
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:54,638
but I've found over and over again,

916
00:43:54,638 --> 00:43:57,500
it's actually really important to leave space.

917
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,521
Don't say everything you think you need to say.

918
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:02,342
Because the fans need to have space.

919
00:44:02,342 --> 00:44:06,105
They need to have a void that they can fill

920
00:44:06,105 --> 00:44:08,266
with their enthusiasm and with their imagination.

921
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:11,507
Because they can't imagine any more about your characters

922
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:13,609
because you've said literally everything.

923
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:17,572
Again, that's not the circle, that's information.

924
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:22,297
You're downloading data and they're not robots and you're not robots.

925
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:23,118
And especially shippers.

926
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:23,438
Shippers will...

927
00:44:23,438 --> 00:44:28,744
If you have two characters who have any kind of sexual chemistry, don't be tempted to have

928
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:30,866
them kiss and have a relationship.

929
00:44:30,866 --> 00:44:33,409
You will get so much more mileage out of a wink or a look.

930
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,150
I guarantee it.

931
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,187
And give people space to tell their own stories.

932
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:39,387
Could be on forums.

933
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:42,509
You know, fan fiction is really powerful.

934
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:44,871
But give these communities a place to talk.

935
00:44:44,871 --> 00:44:47,113
Because remember, you can tell one story.

936
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:50,755
You have time to tell one story, then you ship it.

937
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:52,756
But they can tell a million.

938
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,538
And let them tell a million.

939
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:57,059
Build your stories to be accessible in that way.

940
00:44:58,088 --> 00:44:59,589
And I found this really cool graphic.

941
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:00,730
Look at this.

942
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,131
Look at this thing.

943
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:04,073
It explains exactly what I'm talking about.

944
00:45:04,073 --> 00:45:09,957
I didn't even need to say anything.

945
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,180
So yeah, back to the circle.

946
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,702
It starts with you, it starts with emotional stories,

947
00:45:15,702 --> 00:45:19,345
character relationships, participatory art,

948
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:21,987
compelling choices, and then on the other side,

949
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:24,249
you've got the players, and they're gonna give back to you.

950
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:27,391
You have to give to them and make it the circle.

951
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:35,042
because you're going to get that connection and you want to build to this relationship.

952
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:41,366
Over time, you want to build up to this relationship. And of course, you want to build

953
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:53,314
to the payoff cat. So important. So that is my presentation. And thank you.

954
00:45:56,073 --> 00:45:58,274
We have some time for Q&A.

955
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:00,014
And so I'm happy to take questions.

956
00:46:00,014 --> 00:46:00,755
You guys, thank you.

957
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:08,756
First off, thank you so much for this talk.

958
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:11,357
This was one of the more pragmatic

959
00:46:11,357 --> 00:46:15,958
and how-to sort of work in this space conversations I've seen.

960
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:18,999
I'd love to hear more about how do you balance choices

961
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:20,519
and sort of character payoffs and dramatics

962
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,320
alongside energy systems

963
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,580
or upsells that might be in your game.

964
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:29,707
where you know you have to be serving some sort of premium economical sort of

965
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:34,950
aspect through your choices and how do you balance making sure that both choices feel appropriate

966
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,892
but for the character and that players don't feel like they're being funneled away from

967
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:41,554
something because they can't necessarily afford the energy at that time? Yeah, I mean that is

968
00:46:41,554 --> 00:46:46,516
the tough question, right? How to do that? I think we're figuring it all out and there's

969
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:52,179
a couple of different modes. Choices sort of has an aesthetic where

970
00:46:54,386 --> 00:46:59,030
you kind of buy up front as opposed to along the way.

971
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,192
And I think that is easier to handle narratively,

972
00:47:02,192 --> 00:47:03,153
like as a chunk.

973
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,856
I think we're used to consuming media in chunks,

974
00:47:06,856 --> 00:47:11,920
whether it's a book or a movie or something like that,

975
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,744
where that payment is more for unlocking a content.

976
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,002
And formats where you sort of are interrupted

977
00:47:24,002 --> 00:47:26,003
with a sudden choice that comes out of nowhere

978
00:47:26,003 --> 00:47:27,243
and it's a monetization choice,

979
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:30,084
you didn't see it coming, can feel really abrupt.

980
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:31,665
Now, obviously, they're still profitable.

981
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:33,406
I'm not saying it doesn't work.

982
00:47:33,406 --> 00:47:35,286
I'm just, I'm wary of those

983
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:38,667
because I think they break the immersion

984
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,868
that we're trying to create and that over time,

985
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,390
you start to churn people out because they're just like,

986
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,050
well, I just don't believe the story anymore,

987
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,490
I'm not into it.

988
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,431
You know, you do have certain hardcore fans

989
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,972
who just push through anyway,

990
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:55,373
but I much prefer something that feels more like

991
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,814
how we consume media like now in this world,

992
00:47:58,814 --> 00:48:01,035
where we kind of pay for a chunk of it

993
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:04,696
and the chunk tends to have a resolution included in it.

994
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:05,557
That's my opinion.

995
00:48:05,557 --> 00:48:08,017
But that's the toughest question right now.

996
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:08,818
Thank you very much.

997
00:48:13,074 --> 00:48:15,196
Also, thank you very much for the talk.

998
00:48:15,196 --> 00:48:16,817
My work at Choices, personally.

999
00:48:16,817 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, okay. Wow. Well, I love Choices, by the way.

1000
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,382
I hope I wasn't, I didn't mean to call anybody out.

1001
00:48:23,382 --> 00:48:24,923
It is very distinct,

1002
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:28,186
the trying to acquire something versus a narrative choice.

1003
00:48:28,186 --> 00:48:30,048
So I already answered some of that question,

1004
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:31,569
but I have more of a question on.

1005
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:35,491
stories with grief as a primary component to them.

1006
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:39,834
We've worked on a lot of stories dealing with romance, adventure, excitement, horror,

1007
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:44,357
all across the spectrum, but we're really starting to go into grief coming up, and I'm curious how

1008
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:52,323
you have any suggestions for that. I'm making stories with grief as the main motivation for the player.

1009
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:58,247
Grief is a really hard one, and that's why I was so impressed with Lily's Garden, because grief is

1010
00:48:59,785 --> 00:49:02,327
Grief is often seen or felt as very personal.

1011
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:04,988
And if you're looking at a character and they're grieving

1012
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:08,490
and you didn't know who they're grieving for,

1013
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,132
which is often the premise of these games,

1014
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:13,173
you can't feel much more than empathy.

1015
00:49:13,173 --> 00:49:14,934
You don't ever get to like true compassion.

1016
00:49:14,934 --> 00:49:15,855
You don't feel what they feel.

1017
00:49:15,855 --> 00:49:20,938
So grief is, like in Walking Dead,

1018
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:23,720
we were able to build over five episodes to grief.

1019
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,300
You got to know the character,

1020
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,222
you invested a significant amount of time in that character

1021
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:29,243
and then they were killed.

1022
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:36,949
So if possible, I think that's the best way to introduce it,

1023
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:42,150
because otherwise you are facing a very steep climb

1024
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:46,132
to get people on board.

1025
00:49:46,132 --> 00:49:47,912
The portrayal in Lily's Garden is interesting

1026
00:49:47,912 --> 00:49:51,453
because it isn't the overriding concern of the story.

1027
00:49:51,453 --> 00:49:53,754
She is trying to rebuild and it's more like a...

1028
00:49:54,936 --> 00:49:57,277
It's very clever. She'll find these little pictures and stuff.

1029
00:49:57,277 --> 00:49:58,378
And that's like a reminder.

1030
00:49:58,378 --> 00:50:02,421
And I feel like that at least is recognizable to a lot of us

1031
00:50:02,421 --> 00:50:06,343
who have grief for someone or lost someone that your life returns to normal,

1032
00:50:06,343 --> 00:50:07,244
which is how the game feels.

1033
00:50:07,244 --> 00:50:09,025
The game feels like life is normal.

1034
00:50:09,025 --> 00:50:11,726
And then you'll find something, you know, you'll pull a drawer open

1035
00:50:11,726 --> 00:50:15,969
and it'll be something of theirs and and it just floods back.

1036
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:17,430
And they don't linger too long on it.

1037
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:21,012
But it is that rush of like sadness.

1038
00:50:21,012 --> 00:50:22,753
And then it fades again. And.

1039
00:50:23,705 --> 00:50:24,625
That seems to work.

1040
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,006
I don't know if that works for you.

1041
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:28,148
Everything is so context dependent, right?

1042
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:32,450
Like every story is completely different.

1043
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,532
But those are the two things I've seen work.

1044
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:39,235
Hope that helps.

1045
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:39,815
Yeah.

1046
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:42,197
I heard, or basically there's an author

1047
00:50:42,197 --> 00:50:44,418
that I am a big fan of that once said

1048
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:49,381
that when you're building a world or essentially a story,

1049
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:58,627
that it's kind of like an iceberg where the amount of information you know as an author

1050
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:04,192
is huge, but what you actually want to tell the audience is very minimal.

1051
00:51:04,192 --> 00:51:07,334
How do you approach knowing where that line is?

1052
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:10,198
A great question.

1053
00:51:10,198 --> 00:51:12,220
And I think that's completely true.

1054
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,482
I think that the amount of effort that it takes,

1055
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:17,823
you know, it takes you eight hours

1056
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:19,044
to write one line sometimes,

1057
00:51:19,044 --> 00:51:21,505
where you're just like, I have to think about it that long

1058
00:51:21,505 --> 00:51:23,527
to make sure that it makes sense

1059
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:26,729
and that it feels authentic and real.

1060
00:51:26,729 --> 00:51:31,452
Knowing how much to say is so...

1061
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:36,971
It's for me as a former designer,

1062
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:39,393
I put almost everything I do into the game

1063
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:43,095
and let it play because I never trust myself on paper.

1064
00:51:43,095 --> 00:51:45,777
I have to see how it plays and I have to feel.

1065
00:51:45,777 --> 00:51:50,399
And I do feel my way through how much information

1066
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,420
and where it needs to sit.

1067
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,682
And it drives people crazy because I iterate constantly.

1068
00:51:56,077 --> 00:52:00,100
That's my personal method, and it comes from being a designer.

1069
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,061
And the same way I approach level design,

1070
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:05,823
which is just build, scrap, build again

1071
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,944
until it kind of feels right.

1072
00:52:07,944 --> 00:52:12,387
Hey, great talk.

1073
00:52:12,387 --> 00:52:16,689
So you mentioned some techniques like the triangle

1074
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:19,451
and meaningful player choice that

1075
00:52:19,451 --> 00:52:20,872
apply in narrative-driven games.

1076
00:52:20,872 --> 00:52:23,794
But if you're talking about games like whether it's

1077
00:52:23,794 --> 00:52:25,435
or Tycoon, like Simpsons Tapped Out.

1078
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:28,615
or a team RPG like Marvel Strike Force,

1079
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:30,355
they have a lot of narrative in those games,

1080
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,056
but you really don't have that player side of the triangle

1081
00:52:33,056 --> 00:52:34,877
where the player's really represented.

1082
00:52:34,877 --> 00:52:38,799
So in that situation, where do you lean and what do you do?

1083
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:40,800
In games where the player doesn't have a voice,

1084
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,880
those are really tricky.

1085
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,302
I think the best you can do is reflect the choices

1086
00:52:46,302 --> 00:52:49,223
or allocations that they might've made.

1087
00:52:49,223 --> 00:52:53,205
You can still get the sense of your impact

1088
00:52:53,205 --> 00:52:54,485
and that there is maybe an,

1089
00:52:55,005 --> 00:53:02,389
unspoken conversation, depending on where you're allocating, you know, whatever assets, or in the case of PandaPop,

1090
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:06,331
the conversation is extremely simple,

1091
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:12,413
but it is, if you start fucking up, Mama Panda begins to cry because she's worried that her babies are not going to get rescued

1092
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:13,894
because you suck, so like,

1093
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:18,256
that's a conversation that you can still have and no words are spoken.

1094
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:20,757
And that really comes down to feedback,

1095
00:53:20,757 --> 00:53:22,558
and it's not the kind of feedback we usually think of

1096
00:53:22,558 --> 00:53:24,398
where it's like, pull the trigger

1097
00:53:24,398 --> 00:53:25,659
and the gun does a muzzle flash.

1098
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:26,659
It's narrative feedback.

1099
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:30,841
It's the same concept, but it's with words or story

1100
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:31,602
if you can't use words.

1101
00:53:31,602 --> 00:53:35,683
So just thinking about maybe where you might insert feedback

1102
00:53:35,683 --> 00:53:37,904
that might be a little bit conditionalized

1103
00:53:37,904 --> 00:53:40,385
or some feedback that might be more personalized,

1104
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:44,367
even though maybe there's no dialogue to accompany it.

1105
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:44,727
Excellent.

1106
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:49,058
Hey man, thanks for the talk.

1107
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:49,258
Uh oh.

1108
00:53:49,258 --> 00:53:50,700
How's it going?

1109
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,500
Good, man.

1110
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,642
I just had a question.

1111
00:53:53,642 --> 00:53:57,005
In games like Hogwarts that have a lot of different characters,

1112
00:53:57,005 --> 00:54:00,008
and they all have unique traits that you said drive the story,

1113
00:54:00,008 --> 00:54:02,270
do you have any strategies to share in introducing

1114
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,013
these characters to players that allow them to be rememberable

1115
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:06,975
and not overwhelm the player with names or like?

1116
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:15,604
Who dis again? Yeah. Yeah. I mean for Hogwarts, we rely pretty heavily on archetypes

1117
00:54:15,604 --> 00:54:18,847
So like if there's a character who is gonna be hard to get to know like

1118
00:54:18,847 --> 00:54:26,133
First of all, he's gonna be drawn so that he's like really sullen looking right and they're gonna communicate everything in much the same way

1119
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:27,214
that a sitcom or like

1120
00:54:27,754 --> 00:54:30,315
what is it, the old Italian, like, Commedia dell'arte

1121
00:54:30,315 --> 00:54:33,816
or whatever, like, wear those archetypes on your sleeve,

1122
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:34,837
so that's your hook.

1123
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:37,198
And then, even if the player goes,

1124
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:40,119
oh yeah, I think I know what that archetype is,

1125
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:41,239
or I know what that stereotype is,

1126
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:44,281
then you can like, build the layers,

1127
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,281
or subvert the expectation later,

1128
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:48,642
but at least you got a hook where they can kind of remember,

1129
00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:51,283
oh yeah, that guy, he's like a sullen guy

1130
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:53,624
who likes to be alone, you know?

1131
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,485
Gotcha, thanks man.

1132
00:54:54,485 --> 00:54:55,005
Sure.

1133
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:57,106
Hello.

1134
00:54:57,738 --> 00:54:58,131
Hey.

1135
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:00,604
So I was curious on what you were talking about

1136
00:55:00,604 --> 00:55:03,406
with the monetization in the narrative games, right?

1137
00:55:03,406 --> 00:55:05,608
Because I've seen it before in narrative games

1138
00:55:05,608 --> 00:55:08,130
where you have two choices, and one of them

1139
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,452
is very clearly better because it's locked behind a paywall.

1140
00:55:10,452 --> 00:55:13,955
And I know that that seems often like the most obvious way

1141
00:55:13,955 --> 00:55:18,178
to do monetization, but it does really break immersion.

1142
00:55:18,178 --> 00:55:21,220
What are your preferences, I guess?

1143
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,541
Like, what do you think works better

1144
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:24,923
for getting monetization in the game,

1145
00:55:24,923 --> 00:55:27,365
but not breaking players and reminding them

1146
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,306
that you're in a product, pretty much?

1147
00:55:29,024 --> 00:55:33,686
This is a weird answer, but it just came to me the other day.

1148
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:37,668
I was watching a talk about Fallen London, and I've always admired that game from afar,

1149
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,129
but I haven't actually played it.

1150
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:46,572
Olivia Wood was speaking about how they do premium content for their players, and just

1151
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:52,214
the way they're approaching it seems so respectful, but also like you really got your value for

1152
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:53,014
your money.

1153
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:54,898
This is my non-answer.

1154
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:58,400
I want to go play that game because it seems really interesting and I'm very curious how

1155
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,263
they did it as opposed to kind of what I've seen out there where I don't think we've hit

1156
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:05,604
on the perfect solution for it quite yet.

1157
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:12,898
Hey, so I noticed that a lot of the examples

1158
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:14,980
for building connections used romance

1159
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,581
or some elements of romance.

1160
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,282
So is romance kind of the be all end all

1161
00:56:19,282 --> 00:56:20,343
of building connections?

1162
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:23,905
Is there any other theme that even comes close to romance

1163
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:25,506
in terms of like just staying powers

1164
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:26,427
of building connections?

1165
00:56:27,235 --> 00:56:30,117
Yeah, I mean, romance is the most accessible

1166
00:56:30,117 --> 00:56:34,901
because it encompasses so many ages and stages of our lives.

1167
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:37,022
You start when you're 13 or whatever,

1168
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:39,924
and those early crushes, and then you

1169
00:56:39,924 --> 00:56:42,226
can get all the way into old age,

1170
00:56:42,226 --> 00:56:43,727
and you still have romance.

1171
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:47,490
So it's really accessible and really easy

1172
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,150
to adapt into a story.

1173
00:56:50,816 --> 00:56:54,257
But also, I mean, you'll see themes of parentage.

1174
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:56,218
Like, God of War just came out, and it's

1175
00:56:56,218 --> 00:56:58,959
a really strong parenting story.

1176
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:02,980
And Lee and Clementine, really strong sort of parenting theme.

1177
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,521
That can often be a thing that really resonates with people,

1178
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:07,461
whether they see themselves as the child

1179
00:57:07,461 --> 00:57:10,082
or they see themselves as the parent.

1180
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:14,353
And best friends can also be a really strong theme

1181
00:57:14,353 --> 00:57:19,757
as making a new friend and trying to help that person

1182
00:57:19,757 --> 00:57:20,657
and have them help you.

1183
00:57:20,657 --> 00:57:23,439
But yeah, romance is the obvious one

1184
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:25,561
because it really lights up a whole bunch

1185
00:57:25,561 --> 00:57:28,323
of parts of our brain.

1186
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:31,365
So I think that's why you see it so often.

1187
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:35,328
Thank you.

1188
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:35,648
All right.

1189
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:39,973
Well, thanks again guys for showing up here

1190
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:41,500
on a 10 a.m. on a Thursday.

1191
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:41,861
Appreciate it.

1192
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:42,182
Thank you.
