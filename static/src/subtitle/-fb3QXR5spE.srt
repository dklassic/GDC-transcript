1
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:09,537
So today I am going to talk to you about luscious colors,

2
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:12,419
which is totally a pun because I love puns.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,722
So this is about color grading in games.

4
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,244
And I know HDR is a thing, and look up

5
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:21,325
tables are being updated.

6
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:25,768
But I'm hoping to explain some of the theory

7
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:27,089
behind a lot of color grading.

8
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:35,171
Hi, my name is Izzy Graham, and I'm a photographer and games developer, and I unashamedly love

9
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:35,591
color.

10
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:40,813
But I particularly love color grading because of its subtleties.

11
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:46,155
This talk today is to run you through my personal color grading process and show how research

12
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:48,395
can help inform color grading decisions.

13
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,616
There's an overwhelming aro-

14
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:55,265
There's an overwhelming amount of tools for color grading,

15
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,086
which is why for this talk,

16
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,107
I've tried to aim more in a theory direction.

17
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:02,208
However, if you do want to geek out about Photoshop,

18
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:04,909
Lightroom, or even Unity post-stack stuff,

19
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:06,610
please, please at me on Twitter.

20
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,150
I've tried to give more,

21
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,591
some, a couple of tool tips throughout this talk,

22
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:14,152
but it is very much a one-on-one

23
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:15,893
and how to understand color grading

24
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,114
and helping you trying to define the look.

25
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,133
So, the second thing to know is there's a huge difference between color grading and color editing.

26
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:30,295
Color editing is often balancing the colors, so you're making the image look decent,

27
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:35,257
but then there's also color grading, which is more of a look for a set of scenes or images,

28
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:39,338
and it tends to be more creative and can very much focus on the storytelling.

29
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,050
So, I really love telling stories.

30
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,172
The first time I realized this difference was in 2014.

31
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,715
I was quite depressed, and I happened to be doing

32
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:52,056
a two-week course on photography.

33
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:55,678
The lecturer told us you could take any photo you wanted,

34
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:57,720
but it had to be with a purpose.

35
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,722
As part of the course, we went to go to Daylesford,

36
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:03,323
which was supposed to be a happy place,

37
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:06,805
full of happy people, which was cool, great, mm.

38
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:09,347
But when we got there, it was dark and foggy.

39
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,352
Like really dark and foggy.

40
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:16,597
And honestly, I had the best time making the photos

41
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:18,259
look as depressing as possible.

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,103
So that's when I realized that you could grade things

43
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:22,844
how you feel.

44
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,068
For this look, I called it Sad Wes Anderson

45
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:30,373
because who knew how much fun it was to revel in your misery?

46
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:35,919
So, since then, I've had a grand old time grading things and how I want them to feel.

47
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,384
I love coming up with different grading styles for different moments in my life and taking

48
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:42,605
on colors to remember them by.

49
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:49,946
I'm also an indie games developer, and I'm working on a game called Intergalactic Space

50
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:50,486
Princess.

51
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:55,670
It's a narrative adventure game, and when I started making games, I came from a programming

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,310
background.

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,013
I joked a lot that my art was kind of glorified programmer art, and I was too lazy to use

54
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,094
anything but a touchpad.

55
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:03,315
However...

56
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:09,319
I kind of hid behind color to make my assets look maybe semi-decent,

57
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,021
even though I was very bad at drawing.

58
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:14,443
So I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the game later on,

59
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:17,145
but for first, let's go into tools.

60
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:22,309
So color grading in games sadly isn't spoken about all that often.

61
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,491
It's my first time speaking here,

62
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:28,554
so I hope that I give you a broad overview of what color grading is.

63
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:29,775
And it's...

64
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:35,891
And turns out the games industry is really good at producing tools.

65
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:39,574
But when you're faced with too many, it's easy to get overwhelmed by them.

66
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:43,245
So I decided to focus my talk today

67
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,347
isn't about explaining every single one of these sliders,

68
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:48,529
but it's about coming up with your own ideas,

69
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,471
breaking them down, what you want,

70
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:52,172
and then diving into these tools

71
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,453
to give you exactly what you want.

72
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:56,736
Think of it like picking out candy in a candy store.

73
00:03:57,216 --> 00:04:00,378
It's chaotic and it's so much fun to try all these things,

74
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,201
but if you try too much, you kind of get sick

75
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,522
and lost and lost sick,

76
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:06,643
and then you're stuck in some kind of slider hell.

77
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:09,586
So it's good to go in with a purpose.

78
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,463
It's the way I do this for myself is to make my own rule set.

79
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:16,644
Think of it this way.

80
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:20,028
When you create a lookup table, you're creating the rule sets

81
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:21,789
telling how the colors how to behave.

82
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,513
Why not use the same logic and create some rules for yourself?

83
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,656
So let's go into color history.

84
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,559
So before these nice tools and sliders were a thing,

85
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,962
color grading was actually called color timing.

86
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:41,038
What timers used to do was a chemical process that tried to predict the film and grade it all the same.

87
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,479
This meant that they had to knew exactly what they wanted before they went in.

88
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:52,820
This film here is a is a road to position. While Sam Meadies did spend a lot of time and effort

89
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,062
with cinematographer and lighter Conrad Hall, he considered using a bleach bypass on the film.

90
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:03,703
However, he opted instead to keep the lighting in and to instead subtly remove the pinks and

91
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:05,283
to saturate the film overall.

92
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:10,065
Color timing was never a replacement for good lighting, weather conditions and mood.

93
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:13,207
They simply used it to enhance what was already there.

94
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:19,009
Once tools, especially color timing versus grading, started developing,

95
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:21,890
color could start to give films a lot more distinctive looks.

96
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,752
Jean-Pierre Jure, I'm very bad at pronouncing names,

97
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:30,654
spent two years coming up and experimenting with a look for Emily.

98
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:34,257
So the other thing about color grading

99
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:36,619
is you can use it to quote different things.

100
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,382
So this is the movie Stalker by Andrei Tarkovsky,

101
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:42,544
and this is the film Annihilation.

102
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:45,186
So films often quote other films,

103
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:48,428
referencing the things before them.

104
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,411
Tarkovsky said he hated color,

105
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,353
however I think Stalker has some of the prettiest colors,

106
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,455
and he used a film called Ektachrome,

107
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,057
which is like a three-step technicolor process.

108
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:03,440
It's quite easy to see how Alex Gallin tried to do a similar process

109
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,761
in achieving a three-strip color look,

110
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:08,383
giving off similar green tones and powerful reds,

111
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:13,826
despite reds not existing much in the source material,

112
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,589
which I think that's the thing I love most about grading.

113
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:20,831
It's so easy to quote things and give off similar vibes,

114
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:24,613
and color grading is really, really powerful

115
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:25,954
because it's all subconscious.

116
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:28,536
So this is an experiment I tried.

117
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:33,680
So all my learning in photography has been through films.

118
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,561
The way I started photography was getting inspired through cinema.

119
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:41,803
And then through other mediums, and then eventually more abstract things.

120
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:44,384
Because who says grading has to be realistic?

121
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:48,325
So one thing about grading is you can't polish a turd,

122
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:51,547
but you can absolutely roll it in glitter.

123
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,601
So these two shots were taken about 20 seconds apart,

124
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,883
but I have graded them two completely different ways.

125
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,705
So you can really define a look

126
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,807
just by tweaking, tweaking, tweaking the colors.

127
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:08,368
And if that's all you do,

128
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:11,990
you end up having a really easy way to get a look.

129
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:18,979
So for this one I was kind of like trying to go for like those like late 80s like posters

130
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:26,088
have like the cool sci-fi stuff um and then for this one I kind of went for like the full

131
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:29,993
trash kind of 80s and galaxy leggings because just because.

132
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:37,475
So, for grading, it's important to know what exactly it is you want before you go in.

133
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:43,797
I once got told my work was a little bit too postcard-y to ever do well in photo competitions,

134
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:49,539
and like an absolute normal human being, I was like, whatever, I like postcards, and

135
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,539
then completely leaned in.

136
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,403
One day when I was in LA, I felt like taking some nice postcards for myself.

137
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:59,006
Like, you know the super old vintage ones that you find in the back of your drawer?

138
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:03,089
Like, oh Cheryl, there's a reason why I haven't talked to you in 10 years.

139
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,611
So I kind of decided to upgrade it like that.

140
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:09,673
So, the first step I usually do is to put together a mood board.

141
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:14,675
I did a little bit of research and I had a look at the old 60s postcards.

142
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:21,537
I was particularly interested in how postcards faded rather than whatever film stock was used.

143
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:28,120
I noticed particularly that the deeper blues had increased in saturation and the lighter blues would fade out.

144
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,641
This is because of the printer technology and the ways the dyes stuck.

145
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:36,503
So I started developing a rule set for myself.

146
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:39,305
The dark blues would become deep and saturated,

147
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:42,366
however the light blues would be faded and murky.

148
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,587
The greens would be more desaturated

149
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:45,828
and more towards mint.

150
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:50,270
Reds lean in, so that means that if it's a standard red,

151
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,931
it would either become very pink

152
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:53,392
if it had any kind of pink hues,

153
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:56,374
or it'd become orange if it had any kind of orange hues.

154
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:58,755
And the rest of it kind of just faded away.

155
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,919
So with the example image that I showed before,

156
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:05,404
this is what a grading process might look like

157
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:06,926
if I put in those rule sets.

158
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:11,667
And then this is the process that I came up with

159
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:13,408
for making the little postcards.

160
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:16,370
I definitely tried to,

161
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,612
I did actually tweak a lot of the colors

162
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,093
to make them look a little bit more refined

163
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:22,914
than some of the dyes,

164
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:26,016
but I still tried to keep the minty green tones

165
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:28,677
and the deep blues as well as the faded lighter blues.

166
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:32,560
So it's important to know exactly what it is you want

167
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,500
before you go in there.

168
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:36,112
Still don't want to photocop.

169
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:40,414
So the other thing about color grading

170
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:45,296
is it's good to understand colors, and especially

171
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,136
how to get there.

172
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,997
So when I was driving in a road trip with a couple of friends,

173
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:50,277
I was staring out the window.

174
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,618
I really love my friend Emmy Spicer's work,

175
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,679
who uses a lot of disposable cameras.

176
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,080
And I kind of felt like it was just

177
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,781
this disposable fleeting moment.

178
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:06,008
So I put together a bit of a mood board and had a look at some of her work and I found that disposable

179
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:11,755
cameras are generally made from plastic. They have an incredibly low dynamic range. That means that

180
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:18,302
the blacks get crushed and the highlights get blown out incredibly easily on a really bad curved shot.

181
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:20,856
which I had really fun making,

182
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:22,117
it would kind of look like that.

183
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:24,259
So everything kind of would exist in the middle

184
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,302
and there would be no highlights and no shadows.

185
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:29,404
And if you just wanted a quick way to do it,

186
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:31,005
you just kind of draw like a weird S

187
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:34,068
and that way you can just like clip your highlights

188
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,971
and crush your shadows and you'll be right to go.

189
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:41,175
So for the research, I started breaking down

190
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,458
by what exactly disposable cameras are.

191
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:49,044
it's easy to kind of like slap on a fielder and be like yeah nostalgia

192
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:54,586
but for this I was like well I kind of want to work out how disposable cameras

193
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:57,368
work because a lot of the scans that you get

194
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:01,570
of disposable cameras are incredibly unreliable and incredibly inconsistent

195
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,592
so I did some research and broke down exactly what I was trying to quote

196
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,753
And I did some research on the properties of the cameras.

197
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:13,595
For example, how often disposables have wacky light

198
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,375
meters and use cheap films.

199
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,957
That meant that I could deduce what film stocks are used, but

200
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:21,678
also that they're likely to be either

201
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,359
underexposed or overexposed.

202
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,926
So, once I figured out what kind of film they used, I know that there's a lot of film stock

203
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:33,690
online that can teach you exactly how the colors behave.

204
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,717
I find this research really interesting, and if you're, say, doing an 80s film, you can

205
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:41,979
look up what kind of films they were using.

206
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,463
or if you're doing like a 60s film or even like a 1920s film, you can really break down the research

207
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:53,626
and find out exactly how they achieved the colors they did. And then if you can't find reference

208
00:11:53,686 --> 00:12:01,070
material, you're able to look at color charts to be able to work out exactly how they behave.

209
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:07,670
The other thing that I was looking at was how plastic versus glass lenses.

210
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,792
So what are the, how does that affect the image?

211
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:16,235
So I know how cheaply disposable cameras are made,

212
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:19,597
but my research suggests that the cameras and Holgers are quite similar.

213
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:24,320
So then I looked at colors behaving on plastic lens and finger smearings.

214
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,921
Once I've done the research in this,

215
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,062
I begin to create a rule set and understanding

216
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:30,243
of what colors I want to use.

217
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,104
There's a lot of different tools for the job.

218
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:34,065
And while this isn't a tool talk,

219
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:38,427
maybe hopefully the next few process slides might be useful.

220
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:43,249
So the broad overview is sunset creates very pink tones

221
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:44,450
for a lot of the cheap films.

222
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,150
So that's a pink overlay.

223
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,332
The blacks and shadows get crushed to green.

224
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,813
So you can have green shadows.

225
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:52,433
You want murky colors.

226
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,214
So you add a brown overlay.

227
00:12:55,615 --> 00:13:01,462
Greys come to purple, blues go to grey, which you can just use using hue and saturation meter.

228
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:10,351
And it's really about like experimenting and working out these rule sets and then working how to get the colors and then going through your own personal sleigh to hell.

229
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:15,635
So this is a quick step-by-step of that process.

230
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,896
So first, I had a pink overlay.

231
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,198
If you're using something like Unity,

232
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:22,559
you can add a color tint over the top.

233
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:23,920
That works really well.

234
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:26,281
I then crushed the curves.

235
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:29,404
That's creating that little S shape.

236
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:31,685
I then created green shadows.

237
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:33,866
You can either do this through curves or those three

238
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:34,007
will.

239
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,367
I've just had a mental blank.

240
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:48,579
And then you can add browns, desaturate the blues, and usually add like a dehaze and reduce

241
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,080
the clarity.

242
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:53,366
And you thought color grading was based on feel.

243
00:13:56,082 --> 00:14:01,544
The other thing about color grading is it doesn't have to be realistic.

244
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:04,705
What if you want to just pick out something out of the blue?

245
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:08,067
You don't have, like, how do you do the data set from...

246
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:13,889
What if you have a very limited data set to be inspired from

247
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:16,750
and trying to work out how the colors work?

248
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:16,810
So...

249
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:21,981
If you are using a reference image

250
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:27,265
and you don't know what colors exist,

251
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:30,527
you can pick it out and isolate the colors

252
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,289
using a grayscale overlay.

253
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,492
So the first thing I do is easily isolate the colors

254
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:38,453
with a gray overlay.

255
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:41,175
I tend to do this a lot and break down the properties

256
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:42,316
of something I want to quote.

257
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:45,859
I definitely know there's a lot of purple and orange in there

258
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,967
but I'm trying to uncover what the other properties are.

259
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,677
By doing a saturation map, it's super fast,

260
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:56,139
and hopefully I don't have time to explain it,

261
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,640
how to actually do it, but it is very Googleable.

262
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,122
You can work out exactly what colors are used in an image.

263
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:07,183
This is very useful when you're trying to break down exactly

264
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,385
how something looks the way it does.

265
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:13,546
So when you're doing reference boards for color grading,

266
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:16,107
you can really see what colors are used.

267
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:23,406
Essentially, you basically create a map of where the most saturated bits of the image

268
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:29,852
are, which I was white, and the least saturated images, and then you have an overlay of the

269
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,213
original image over the top.

270
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:33,436
So it makes it really easy to read.

271
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:39,421
This gives me a colour scheme to work from, and I love using data like this because occasionally

272
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:40,382
your eyes will lie to you.

273
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:46,257
The, sorry.

274
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:49,259
So I worked out that the colors must be

275
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,101
purple, blue, or orange.

276
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:54,043
When you are color grading, it's important to make sure

277
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:55,905
that you have at least three colors,

278
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:58,567
otherwise an image can start to look monochromatic.

279
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:02,411
For example, this image here looks a little bit nicer

280
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,653
than this image here where I took out the orange.

281
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:10,236
I also wanted to, I spent a lot of time tweaking the temperatures of these images.

282
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:18,340
And you can really work out how color grades behave with each, when you have a rule set and then you adjust the temperature.

283
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,562
It's interesting to watch how all the other colors relate to that.

284
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,124
I completely underexposed it because that gives it

285
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:29,566
its flat and moody look, so if you look at a histogram,

286
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:33,788
it's like all in the left part of the histogram,

287
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:38,110
and it gives a very underexposed tint feel.

288
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:41,612
So with this in mind, I used those same rule sets

289
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:44,414
to create a simplistic color scheme for the next three

290
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,174
images, and then the three after that.

291
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:49,056
Seeing how a rule set can behave in different light

292
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:52,278
and applying subtle changes is always incredibly interesting.

293
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:56,520
you don't have to base your grading on something

294
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,760
that already exists.

295
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,181
All you need to do is create a consistent rule set

296
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,382
to work out how your colors behave.

297
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:08,083
Honestly, there is so much more to grading than this.

298
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:10,704
Some of the things that I haven't Googled

299
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:12,745
are secondary grading, masking,

300
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,866
transitional grading, consistency.

301
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:17,846
There is so much to talk about,

302
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,408
but for now I'm gonna get onto video games.

303
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:27,654
So, one of the cool things about, even though this is not a video game, it's Steven Universe, which is great,

304
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:35,002
but one thing that I love looking at animation is how they get inspired by other things.

305
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:40,449
So, Steven Universe and Being Puppycat clearly took a lot of inspiration from Sailor Moon.

306
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,995
There's been a lot of really fantastic color grading examples in games already.

307
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:53,861
So like Leave a Mar by Florian is an amazing example of how you can do an incredibly awesome

308
00:17:53,881 --> 00:18:01,928
color scheme. Dead Static Drive by Mike Blackney is also a really good example of how he uses a

309
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:06,412
lookup table throughout the game to create an inconsistent look. Mirror's Edge was one of the

310
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:13,679
AAA games that really did do a very expressive color grade

311
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:16,180
and had a very clean-looking city.

312
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,181
And Firewatch is another game that

313
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,642
is very good at color grading.

314
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:23,023
So I'm going to show you my dang game.

315
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:26,164
So this is my game, Intergalactic Space Princess.

316
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:28,745
So the protagonist is Malene, who's

317
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:31,646
a 14-year-old girl with opinions on things.

318
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:35,408
The colors reflect said opinions and communicate to the player

319
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,368
how she feels about the environment.

320
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:43,842
Her hometown is beige-y and dusty and she finds it incredibly boring, but when she does

321
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:48,947
find somethings interesting, like the fridge or falling down the intestines of an interdimensional

322
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:50,288
worm, it's colourful.

323
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:55,282
So when I was making assets for this game I ran into a problem.

324
00:18:55,922 --> 00:19:01,644
I had done an asset pass in the milk bar and I wanted the milk bar to feel clinical,

325
00:19:02,044 --> 00:19:06,666
kind of like that gross plastic tarp that you have on those barbecue tables outside.

326
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:08,086
Mmm, chemicals.

327
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:14,411
So I chose the color scheme of mint, red and beige to convey that look.

328
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:17,333
However, it really didn't go with the rest of the game.

329
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:21,557
Malene had the same opinion of the milk bar as she did with the house and the street.

330
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:29,503
But luckily, as of my experience with photography, I knew a little bit about color grading.

331
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:31,545
So I decided to...

332
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:38,267
tackle solving this. So the color scheme for Lane's house was beige, yellow, and blue. The color scheme

333
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:43,409
for the street was just like 50 shades of beige, which is awful. And I like to think that color

334
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:48,450
grading is the bow. And all of there's all the presents in front of the Christmas tree. You know

335
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,932
which presents you got from Auntie Sandra because she uses the same bow and despite them all having

336
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:57,833
different wrappings, you can tell that they're from Auntie Sandra because she uses the same ribbon.

337
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:02,754
So I wanted to give the whole town a feeling of past nostalgia,

338
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:06,735
kind of like those bad phone apps that make your phone look like those toy pictures.

339
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:11,976
I also wanted to make sure that the accent colors didn't get lost, especially Marlene.

340
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:15,437
So I started developing a rule set for myself.

341
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:19,218
I wanted there to be an overwhelming amount of brown,

342
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,258
but not the realistic, gritty, video game brown,

343
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:24,939
but a cute, kind of animated, fun, steppier brown.

344
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,395
So I did a lot of tweaking to the saturations.

345
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:32,057
I also wanted the game to be desaturated

346
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,420
without looking as desaturated as a lot of other games.

347
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,603
I also wanted the accent colors

348
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,445
not to get affected so much by the brown,

349
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,407
but still stand out as accent colors.

350
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:49,930
So the image on the left is the one that is the new grade,

351
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,551
and the image on the right is the old grade,

352
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:53,532
where basically a lot of the characters

353
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,413
are kind of getting lost.

354
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,010
So the Milk Bar is still standing out.

355
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,292
I'm using Unity for this, but honestly,

356
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:01,873
there's a lot of stuff doing the same.

357
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:05,795
You can use Photoshop to grade a lot of your things

358
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:08,577
and then import them as a lookup table into Unity.

359
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:10,219
And I really recommend doing this

360
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,400
because it's really easy and really cheap

361
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,722
and I really like grading in Photoshop,

362
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:15,922
but I'm really biased.

363
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:20,005
So this is where a lookup table can come in really handy.

364
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:21,446
So instead of defining

365
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,368
So it yeah

366
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:29,429
So first off I wanted to make it look like late afternoon

367
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:35,251
I had a go at putting the initial lights in that I wanted to give it a yellow ambient light and a very subtle blue

368
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:36,511
filter for the character

369
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:40,673
Once I did that I started to work on the post-processing stack

370
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:44,374
It was still very yellow and it still really didn't go with the rest of the game

371
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:51,061
So one thing about grading is it's generally good to grade neutral.

372
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:57,445
My game is small enough that I know that I can do a lot of bespoke grading through lighting

373
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,686
and then tweak it to get it exactly how I want.

374
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,747
However, if you want your game to be fast and consistent,

375
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:07,807
it's incredibly important to have a neutral base

376
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:09,688
to work on when color grading.

377
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:12,489
This is where lookup tables come in really handy.

378
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:14,449
Because they have a low dynamic range,

379
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:17,830
it means any kind of overblown highlights or shadows

380
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,451
will get lost because they are a low dimension.

381
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:23,132
I can't words.

382
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,056
It's important to keep the scenes quite desaturated as

383
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:27,396
well.

384
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,097
Well, not too desaturated, but make

385
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:32,060
sure your saturations don't get crushed either.

386
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:37,144
So yeah, just grade neutral of Log C.

387
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:39,667
So I wanted to make it look like late afternoon,

388
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:41,068
so put in the initial lights.

389
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:43,830
And then after that, I really started

390
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,171
to work on the color grading.

391
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,014
So that's where I put in.

392
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:52,718
like a lookup table that was a Fuji-based film filter.

393
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:55,259
I edited the curves to make it, like,

394
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,661
give that contrast that the rest of the town had.

395
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,723
And I really started overlaying

396
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:03,085
and tweaking the color balance

397
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:04,746
to make it go with the rest of the game,

398
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,989
but still being able to keep

399
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:10,110
the colors of the characters the same.

400
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,493
So this is the before and this is the after.

401
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:18,919
So the final steps for, so the summary for color grading is,

402
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,802
so the step one is to figure out

403
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,443
exactly what you want to achieve.

404
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,205
Do you want to make it look like the 80s?

405
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:25,427
Do you want to have a clinical look?

406
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,329
Do you want to go for a sad indie band cover?

407
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:32,540
It's up to you, but it's important to decide what exactly it is you want.

408
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,400
The second step is to put some research together

409
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,201
as to why you want the thing for your game.

410
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,522
Do you want to make it look like it's from the 80s?

411
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:42,982
Research the film stock they use.

412
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:44,583
Do you want to make it look like Blade Runner?

413
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,623
Start researching how tungsten film behaves.

414
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:49,944
You don't have to go by research,

415
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:52,665
but research helps a lot when you're trying to be consistent.

416
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:57,448
And the step three is to establish an internal rule set

417
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:58,008
for yourself.

418
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:02,071
So this is coming up with rules to be consistent,

419
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:05,554
and it's okay to be inconsistently consistent

420
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:09,277
as long as you just have to decide that's what you want.

421
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:12,900
Oops, I'm just, ah, there we go.

422
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,602
So research makes things easier in the long run,

423
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,783
which is one of the tips.

424
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,866
Grading doesn't have to be realistic, just consistent,

425
00:24:21,566 --> 00:24:22,547
and grading neutral.

426
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:25,701
So, that's the talk. Thank you.

427
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:32,791
APPLAUSE

428
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,577
Any questions?

429
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:39,961
We have to go up to the mic.

430
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:48,173
Hi, I had a question.

431
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,273
Thanks for the talk.

432
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:54,095
So you covered a lot about 2D games it looked like.

433
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,536
But if you have any thoughts on doing 3D,

434
00:24:57,716 --> 00:25:01,337
if you plan to do a lot of color grading and a lot of color

435
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,518
post-processing, would you recommend maybe doing

436
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:05,959
less color in the lights that you're placing in the scene?

437
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:07,079
I guess, what are your thoughts on that?

438
00:25:07,752 --> 00:25:11,392
Yeah, so the question was, if you're doing 3D color grading,

439
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:15,293
what do you do about a lot of the lights and that?

440
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:19,454
Yeah, so when I was recently helping out a friend

441
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:25,095
grade his game, and he had a lot of overblown stuff in Unreal,

442
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:28,416
and it was really hard to kind of come back down from that.

443
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:33,297
So when he made the things a lot more neutral,

444
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:34,677
that's when it was a lot easier.

445
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:40,260
and the lookup tables that we were kind of creating

446
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,961
really started to stick for the rest of the scene,

447
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:43,242
so I'd definitely go neutral.

448
00:25:43,802 --> 00:25:44,343
Thank you so much.

449
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:51,187
Thanks for the talk.

450
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:52,548
I have a question.

451
00:25:52,588 --> 00:25:55,089
How would you deal with HDR?

452
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,071
As you talked about a lot of lookup tables,

453
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:02,093
low dynamic range, but now I want to do an HDR.

454
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:03,474
What do you do for color grading?

455
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:11,934
Um, so I don't have that much experience in HDR because I am using a lot of like my

456
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:20,740
game is for mobile so but it I guess it's similar to the way you use raw colors in photography.

457
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:28,305
Um yeah I'm so sorry I'm so flustered at the moment. Sorry.

458
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:30,756
Oh, great talk.

459
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:33,178
I was curious if you have any hardware calibration

460
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:35,359
that you do and any process to check

461
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:38,521
your colors across different platforms, different monitors?

462
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:44,106
Yeah, so what I always do for this is I tend to color space

463
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:45,146
is incredibly important.

464
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,948
So what I tend to do is in Photoshop,

465
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:54,093
I tend to have a big canvas and make screenshots and paste

466
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:55,654
all of the different color spaces.

467
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:59,815
And I know it's not the most accurate,

468
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,816
but it is kind of like a way to see like,

469
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,736
oh no, is anything getting crushed?

470
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:07,717
Like are any of the tones getting like dead?

471
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:09,857
The other way that I always do it as well

472
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:12,538
is to view things on my phone

473
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:15,919
and I have this really crappy monitor at home

474
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,019
and that's great to tell if something is like really bad

475
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:20,580
because you can just tell it straight away.

476
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,400
So I don't ever try and get true color,

477
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,601
but I do try and get, try and.

478
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:29,624
get, what's the word, I try and get edge cases

479
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:31,746
to make sure that all the colors look okay.

480
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:33,128
Cool, thanks.

481
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,321
Hi, my name is Danny.

482
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:38,442
That was a beautiful talk.

483
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:38,822
Thank you.

484
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:42,905
My question is, I work on a VR game.

485
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:46,207
And especially when working on mobile devices,

486
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:48,648
I can't actually do any post-processing.

487
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,110
So I'm wondering if you have tools

488
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,932
to do color grading without using post-processing a lot.

489
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,454
The ones I could think of is doing color grading

490
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,177
on my baked lighting or directly adjusting the textures.

491
00:28:01,337 --> 00:28:02,497
Is there anything else out there?

492
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:07,128
Yeah, oh man, so I was actually having this conversation

493
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:08,889
like two days ago.

494
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:13,251
So Ted Denola, he works for Oculus,

495
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,292
he's a great person to contact

496
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:18,473
because I'm having a lot of mental planks at the moment.

497
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:23,035
But he had some really great advice about that

498
00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:25,576
because yeah, I think he was saying bacon lining

499
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:26,416
and everything like that.

500
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:30,160
I'm so sorry for just having a biggest brain freeze.

501
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,263
But he's a really good person to contact, Ted Denola.

502
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,305
And he works at Oculus.

503
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:42,971
I think that is it.

504
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:44,472
Thank you.

505
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:45,073
I'm so sorry.
