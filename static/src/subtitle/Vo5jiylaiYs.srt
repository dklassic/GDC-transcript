1
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:07,706
It's OK?

2
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:12,127
Well, it's a pleasure to be here.

3
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,767
Please turn off your cell phone sounds.

4
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:18,168
They asked me to tell you.

5
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:22,889
Let's start.

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:25,229
Good afternoon.

7
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:28,070
I am Jaime Gonzalez Vallejo.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,570
I am 3D artist at Tequila Works.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,951
And I'm here on behalf of the art team.

10
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:36,311
And I've come to tell you.

11
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:41,512
Our experience in this unannounced VR project that we are currently developing.

12
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:49,518
Tequila Works is a game developer studio located in Madrid and established in 2009

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,082
by some of the former employees of Blizzard Entertainment,

14
00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:58,985
MercurySteam, Pyro Studios or Sony, between others.

15
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:04,519
2017 is going to be a remarkable year for Tequila Works,

16
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:08,420
due to Sexy, Brutal, and Rhyme releases.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,641
And now with GameStop as partner, GameTrust,

18
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:17,023
the company is developing its first VR project.

19
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:21,564
The team has been very small since the beginning,

20
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:23,585
and nobody had previous experience in VR.

21
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:29,991
And this is the whole team last summer visiting the local museum and taking references.

22
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:33,052
Madrid, the Museum of Romanticism.

23
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:36,854
And this is the current team last week.

24
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:42,176
The game core is developed in the studio as well as the environment and concept art.

25
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,578
Characters, motion capture, animations and audio, they are all outsourced.

26
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,714
These are the tools that we use, and those three on the right side are the platform targets.

27
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:03,199
In 12 months we have to quickly create an island, a big mansion on top of it, and a

28
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,181
lot of furniture elements and assets, all without outsourcing support.

29
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:12,745
Our age and previous experiences are quite different, as well as our workflows.

30
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:17,164
and on asset creation in general.

31
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:20,846
But the good thing about the small teams is communication

32
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,588
and something that we need a lot on this revolutionary challenge.

33
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:30,331
My previous experience based on games with hyper realistic

34
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:34,193
visual style. In Homefront 2 I learned how to build

35
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:37,395
first-person shooter environments with a high level of

36
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:39,656
detail and physical based textures.

37
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:48,752
I was lucky to be part of the cinematic team at Remedy, so I could work close to the drama

38
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:53,274
directors and the animators and go through the motion capture process.

39
00:02:54,415 --> 00:03:01,599
In Years of War 4, I worked on the multiplayer map, some of them, and I faced several optimization

40
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,522
tasks in order to run the game at 60 frames per second on Xbox One.

41
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:16,033
So I arrived to Tequila and they told me that I will be working on a VR experience that

42
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:22,235
is a first-person shooter but without weapons and a higher immersion with characters based

43
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:27,737
on real actors and motion capture animations and environments that aim to be running at

44
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,718
60 frames per second on a PS4.

45
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:34,899
I was happy and excited to join this team and this particular project.

46
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:39,046
A project that is not a game.

47
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:44,667
The player's goal is not about participating on the story, it's about discovering it.

48
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:54,009
This is an immersive VR theatre experience directed by Raul Rubio and written by Rob

49
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:54,449
Jescom.

50
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,830
As I said, a mansion at the beginning of the last century with an American neo-colonial

51
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,031
design avoiding a Victorian Baroque approach.

52
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:11,331
These are the first sketches while the story script was in progress still.

53
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:18,175
And later the environment gets saved from the script, both of them untouchable since

54
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:20,476
motion capture sessions finished.

55
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:26,059
The layout never changed, so pre-production was harder than usual.

56
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,202
Here a comparison of an old concept and the current state of the environment.

57
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,810
We try hard to respect the original ideas and focus only on the addition of details.

58
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:47,693
Here an example of the layout. First, the concept art and the first pass of the lighting in-game.

59
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:55,917
We used several paint-overs on pre-production because they give us a quick and refreshing idea of how the environment is going to look.

60
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:01,539
And everything evolves slowly, iteration by iteration.

61
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:06,408
Final result here, richer in details and lighting.

62
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,571
The art direction.

63
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,874
Here we have two early 3D concepts used from the demo.

64
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,616
We consider our chosen art direction

65
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:17,736
to be placed in the middle of.

66
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,221
It's a cartoon and realistic.

67
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:26,464
So the project aimed for a concise look with real shapes and colors, lighting.

68
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:33,668
This physical lighting is the most valuable element on the final art since material and

69
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:39,191
texture support this rendering method but the level of detail are not actually realistic.

70
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,489
We want to create comfortable and calm atmospheres,

71
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,332
and we just prompt the player to be focused on the character.

72
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:52,473
These VR experiences ask and deserve

73
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:55,275
nice, immersive environments.

74
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:01,599
This chosen art direction is not only artistic.

75
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,320
It's also a consequence of VR constraints.

76
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:10,784
60 FPS on PS4 gives us a lot of limitations and headaches.

77
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:15,698
So the process starts stylizing the textures and shapes,

78
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:18,781
getting lower resolutions, times, and triangle cone.

79
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:23,425
I correct physical base lighting and materials to the rest,

80
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,787
and we achieve the desirable atmosphere.

81
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,853
In the project, we qualify the noise as annoying.

82
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:36,017
You can easily get dizzy with VR,

83
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:38,459
and one of the main reasons is that noise.

84
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,052
And our art direction asks to delete it in every single texture.

85
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:50,637
This decision was easier to take at the beginning since performance was not allowing us to use

86
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,758
any anti-aliasing method.

87
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:57,621
But recently we could add at least the temporal anti-aliasing so we are less worried about

88
00:06:57,661 --> 00:06:58,122
this issue.

89
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:01,984
Concept art.

90
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:06,907
Oscar Cuesta, art director and lead artist, was the first member of the team.

91
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,841
Well, not the first member of the art team.

92
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,363
And he was the only artist during several months

93
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:17,405
working on concepts and the layout of the environment.

94
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:23,689
He used sometimes this isometric perspective on his artworks.

95
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,471
And I think that in a very successful way.

96
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:31,515
Our concept artist, Elias Sanchez,

97
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:35,317
he feels comfortable with paint overs on top of screenshots.

98
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:40,073
And his ideas are many times necessary for us

99
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,653
in order to progress on the rooms' iterations.

100
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:47,975
He also enjoys the use of 3D code and its scope

101
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:49,756
and rendering features.

102
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:55,058
He quickly creates 3D shapes, applies smart materials,

103
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:56,719
and paint overs are even easier.

104
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,380
As demonstrated on all these concepts,

105
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,701
we are facing high contrast between the different locations

106
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:05,062
in the map.

107
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,221
And now the environment art.

108
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:11,963
My first task was the development

109
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,645
of the assets creation pipeline.

110
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:15,766
And this is an example.

111
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:19,209
From real picture references, we design an asset

112
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,172
with softer shapes, noiseless, and optimized.

113
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:30,409
As you can see on the textures, we aim to use horizontal or vertical tiling information.

114
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,734
And if required, we work with non-square files.

115
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:41,159
The goal at the end is to use the minimum textures resolutions, always keeping a balance

116
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,540
and proper texel ratio.

117
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:48,220
between 512 and 256 pixels per meter.

118
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,483
That's, I think it's very important for us.

119
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:55,047
Base color textures are clean

120
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:58,150
with correct video values and low contrast.

121
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:00,352
Roughness is richer on information,

122
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:03,736
but always avoiding that pixel grainy noise.

123
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:09,133
And normal maps take an important position

124
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:12,517
with clean height values on surfaces

125
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,860
and baked information on small objects.

126
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:17,904
You can see all the small objects that they are

127
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,186
packed on the top left corner.

128
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:24,499
And on important narrative objects,

129
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,582
we pushed the quality and time effort of the textures,

130
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:29,083
trying not to use styling textures.

131
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:32,265
This time, I decided to use overlapping UVs,

132
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,688
symmetrical pieces, so I could work on the worn edges

133
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:38,670
and contact areas without big texture resolutions.

134
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,654
The curvature map, baked map, is a big support.

135
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:46,216
And here, the visibility of these details

136
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:50,058
must be subtle to keep a balance with the other assets

137
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:50,679
and environments.

138
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:57,483
You can see for yourself that roughness, metalness and ambient occlusion,

139
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:01,184
they are packed on a single texture, a colorful one.

140
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:08,007
We decided to add the ambient occlusion here since we will not have any real-time ambient occlusion in-game.

141
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:12,810
Therefore, we always use a neutral gray as a specular.

142
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,492
And you can finally check that the mesh corners are rounded.

143
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:21,333
But the normal map doesn't have any hypo-information vector.

144
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,294
This is because I used on this asset the medium polyworkflow.

145
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:33,422
This workflow has been used on Island Isolation and Star Citizen, between others.

146
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:37,066
They are all games with big objects, big assets and surfaces.

147
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:44,394
It's based on the creation of soft bevels for the corners, avoiding the hard edges and the low poly look.

148
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:49,434
And we realized that we are not only saving textures here

149
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:52,296
and draw calls with this method, but also getting

150
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,937
a better pixel resolution.

151
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,461
We have this way less seams, more tiling textures,

152
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:03,603
better silhouettes, and faster modeling times.

153
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,064
Medium poly workflow on the left,

154
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:10,507
and the typical high poly baked on the right side.

155
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:14,539
After all, this high poly normal map is not needed.

156
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,761
With a slight movement ahead of movement in VR,

157
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,284
you can easily spot the LODs that they are swapping.

158
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:25,966
Although we have higher amount of triangles,

159
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:30,309
we decided not to use LODs, resulting in memory savings

160
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:30,710
at the end.

161
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:39,196
Here, one of my favorite assets, a big one that I made with only a 1K texture and a good

162
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,156
texture density.

163
00:11:41,557 --> 00:11:46,040
From my point of view, the best workflow is the mix of both low poly and medium poly

164
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,420
workflow.

165
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:54,025
I spent the minimum time possible modeling high poly parts and used chamfers and edited

166
00:11:54,085 --> 00:12:00,029
normals as much as you can on big elements, like the support of the telescope here.

167
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:05,520
And this typewriter was made by one of the artists, Jose Grandal.

168
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,562
On these cases where the object is small and full of tiny details, the medium poly workflow

169
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:15,483
is not suitable due to the triangle count.

170
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:21,365
Besides, without using LODs, we get another challenge for the GPU.

171
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:24,606
A lot of triangles in a single pixel.

172
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,887
So this workflow must be used with caution.

173
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,550
And this is related to lighting, more or less.

174
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,392
Without LEDs, we also save memory

175
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,093
with less lightmaps to bake.

176
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,155
Proper lightmaps are crucial if we

177
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:48,317
want beautiful environments and with all these limitations.

178
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,158
So we take them seriously.

179
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,539
We create a second UV channel manually,

180
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,341
and we give them the maximum quality possible.

181
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,431
Here, the light complexity view.

182
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,792
The lighting artist was Nightmare.

183
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:08,773
And dynamic lights are maybe the most expensive feature

184
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:09,513
on this project.

185
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,674
But they are necessary for the character lighting.

186
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,515
These kind of lights work on a different channel

187
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:18,035
than the environment.

188
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:22,617
And it's a challenge for Andres Jimenez, our lighting artist,

189
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:25,738
to place them all around the map without overlapping

190
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:26,658
one each other.

191
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,589
So character art.

192
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,392
There are several main characters in the game.

193
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:35,754
And our direction needed to be clear enough

194
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:39,197
to there were an in-depth study of all of them.

195
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,820
These are the oldest concept designs.

196
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,884
It's unbelievable how they have evolved.

197
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:49,767
I'll show you the progress of this particular character.

198
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:55,291
First, the concept art based on the original idea.

199
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:00,335
There were also some 3D concepts and tests in Zebras.

200
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:04,996
And at the end, after knowing the actors involved

201
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:08,057
on the motion capture sessions, the final design

202
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:09,277
based on them.

203
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,438
This was possible thanks to these concepts

204
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:15,899
and the references and continuous feedback

205
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,839
from Oscar, the art director, and Solide Anim,

206
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,940
the company in charge of the capture and the animations,

207
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,060
a French company.

208
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:31,254
The actors were also scanned in 3D to help a lot in the design process.

209
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:37,920
And with motion capture we are dealing with realistic body and facial animations.

210
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:43,704
The models and textures were outsourced.

211
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:46,766
Three talented character artists from different parts of the job,

212
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,029
different parts of the world, did the job.

213
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:57,489
Any video game production that deals with these working methods, they face a common issue,

214
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,450
that is the uncanny valley.

215
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:08,815
In VR, this is even a more relevant issue due to the immersion.

216
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:15,380
The player is there, is close to the character, looking at he or she from different angles and distances.

217
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:19,195
So we need to avoid the player to feel uncomfortable.

218
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:23,259
Well, this stylized art direction

219
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,081
relieves this problem, achieving a balance

220
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:26,842
with the environments.

221
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:32,587
Something I want to mention here is the use of the Unreal

222
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:33,908
Engine tool sequencer.

223
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,692
It's a good choice for us because we can easily

224
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,193
check the animations on the viewport

225
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:41,195
and how they are working with environment.

226
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:45,538
of the player.

227
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,380
We are developing an experience.

228
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,023
We have to focus on the narrative, animations,

229
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:52,724
and characters.

230
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:55,486
But this time, we also have a different player,

231
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:57,427
one that will be intriguing.

232
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,851
The VR device, Vibe, for example, goes everywhere.

233
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:03,992
You can hide anything.

234
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:11,208
What if the player decides to jump or what if he or she decides to lie on the floor?

235
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:18,673
If the player tries to see what is inside a wardrobe, a closed wardrobe for example,

236
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:21,455
we show him the darkest black.

237
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,737
For this feature we need to make collisions for every asset

238
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:28,500
and this collision will also be related to the teleport feature.

239
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:34,986
We need to be in constant communication with the game designer, Pablo Calatayud.

240
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:44,075
Well, here you can check the teleport feature, how it's working, and clearly the moment the

241
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:50,820
character is crashing into the player, the view turns softly to black, as you can see.

242
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:58,105
It's for this kind of issues that the corridors tend to be thicker than usual.

243
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:02,027
So I'm talking now about the scale.

244
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,854
It has been an interesting element on this adventure.

245
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,478
We checked the asset size many times before it's done.

246
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:12,459
On the editor, you can appreciate

247
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,341
that the environments are huge.

248
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,664
Then you put on the glasses, and the proportions

249
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:18,765
are now almost OK.

250
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:22,969
At the end, the main objective is not to bump up

251
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,491
against the characters.

252
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:33,396
We have lately some good examples of games with incredible cinematic sequences,

253
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:36,539
no matter if they are first-person shooters or third-person shooters.

254
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,224
In our gameplay, we don't have cameras or singular points of view.

255
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:48,430
The player is free to go and decide from where he would enjoy the story.

256
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:54,235
So as well as in theaters, we need to create larger environments, even exaggerated.

257
00:17:56,323 --> 00:18:00,566
And we aim to create comfortable spaces without obstacles.

258
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:05,909
Another VR-related concern, the textures.

259
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,011
As environment artists, we are worried about

260
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:11,453
those tiny details on the assets.

261
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:16,396
But it is a point that when the VR blurriness

262
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:20,939
and low resolution don't let you appreciate the props

263
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,101
when they are too close to the camera, well, to your eyes.

264
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:32,949
We have to decide what is worth it and to find more pleasant designs.

265
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:41,152
We are all glad of using the Allegory Smith tools for the textures creation.

266
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:46,614
With Perforce linked to them we can share all the new materials and effects in seconds.

267
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:54,377
And on stylized games like this, sharing base materials between the artists like a wood generator.

268
00:18:55,756 --> 00:19:01,118
We believe it's suitable for achieving a good consistency between the different assets.

269
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,002
The rain, a feature created by Norman Scar, a technical artist.

270
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,964
The rain is made out of a single static mesh.

271
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,126
I guess you don't appreciate the...

272
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,889
Well, you have a better representation on the right side.

273
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:28,311
Pivot point positions for each raindrop are stored as paired attributes.

274
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:32,772
And the shader makes sure that they follow the camera properly.

275
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:38,834
Everything is handled in the GPU to free up the CPU from updating the raindrops every frame.

276
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:46,336
And a depth texture is also used in order to avoid the rain to clip indoors.

277
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:55,156
We take that depth texture to reposition the tree leaves on the exterior floors.

278
00:19:57,637 --> 00:20:00,337
This tool was created by Mario Palmero, lead programmer.

279
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:06,898
I'm glad you're here on this talk because he's currently having another talk in another room.

280
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:07,899
He's also another speaker.

281
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,600
Well, the rain came with some consequences.

282
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,140
For example, the water drops on the glass.

283
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:21,916
But before, the technical artist found another issue.

284
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:27,198
At the time, Unreal for glass solution was very expensive

285
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:33,001
and it requires to compute the entire PBR shader to achieve some reflection in the glass.

286
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:38,043
That reflection, however, was a cubemap with no parallax correction

287
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:42,705
and a less physically correct but way cheaper.

288
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,703
A better looking solution was to completely drop the PBR shader,

289
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,304
sampling the cubemap in an unlit shader,

290
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:51,764
and do the parallax correction there.

291
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:54,164
Technical stuff.

292
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:57,905
Having more control over this also

293
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:02,206
allow us to sample two different cubemaps for the glass window.

294
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:06,707
So a different cubemap was seen depending

295
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,307
on which side of the glass you were looking through.

296
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:16,988
One more time, Substance Designer allowed me to create a procedural texture to extend

297
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:17,869
the water drops.

298
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:26,455
The rain is one of the special effects we have in-game, but all the performance issues

299
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:33,340
and limitations make it impossible to use real-time simulations or particles.

300
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:37,465
So both two FX artists working on our project,

301
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,328
Simon Trampler and Simon Remes, two Simons,

302
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:44,211
choose the vertex shader animations

303
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:45,452
in almost every situation.

304
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:50,476
For example, the fire sparks and how the rain is affecting

305
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:53,678
the character temporarily, not only the hair, also

306
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,100
the skin or the clothes.

307
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:02,605
And more limitations, this time with the expensive volumetric

308
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:02,845
lights.

309
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:07,049
The effects artist managed to use planes with transparency

310
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:11,409
at a fade assort instance.

311
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:13,950
But we have dense shader complexity issues

312
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,310
that you can see on the right side.

313
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,611
That's why we environment artists avoid and almost forget

314
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:23,532
about the using of alpha on all our textures on the assets.

315
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:27,433
The platforms.

316
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:31,514
Something we enjoy a lot was designing the controllers

317
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:33,314
for the different VR platforms.

318
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:43,268
That was the Vive one, here's the Oculus one, all of them with a soft cyberpunk influence and all materials.

319
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:56,382
And as you can see, we added more functional features to them, like a clock or a laser emitter, related to the teleport feature.

320
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:08,971
Well, the artists, this is an announced project and I'm not allowed to show more stuff or talk about the story,

321
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:16,616
but I can say that the story is full of science fiction and this has been a very fun experience for us, the artists.

322
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:24,862
You catch the objects with your hands and you can easily get hypnotized by the light reflections.

323
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,745
This is also appropriate for the inclusion of aesthetics,

324
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:30,325
so you can hide them on the assets

325
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:33,707
and challenge the player to find them.

326
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:37,589
Well, as conclusion, VR is a beautiful experience

327
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:42,671
and a perfect place for admiring and showing our own creations.

328
00:23:44,652 --> 00:23:45,232
Thank you very much.

329
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:55,137
If you have any questions.

330
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:09,437
Hi.

331
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:10,257
Hi.

332
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:11,698
So thanks for the talk.

333
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,059
So I noticed you talk a lot about optimization,

334
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,001
but you seem to have soft shadows on your characters.

335
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:22,682
Isn't that quite heavy for VR?

336
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:25,589
Yeah, yeah.

337
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,830
Well, he was asking about the soft shadows

338
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,293
and the dynamic lighting on characters.

339
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:33,975
When I was talking about them, I said

340
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:37,618
that it was maybe the most expensive feature in-game.

341
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:42,602
And as you can see on that particular slide,

342
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:48,866
I'll show you here.

343
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:55,506
Those three on the left side, you have all those overlapping dynamic lighting.

344
00:24:55,566 --> 00:25:01,432
It was just for this demonstration, but that's impossible for VR to handle.

345
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,056
And yeah, it should be all like the right side, green.

346
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:12,943
And yeah, that's why I said that it's the nightmare for the lighting artist because...

347
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:21,294
In the moment everything has very soft light maps, soft lighting, and in the moment you

348
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:27,898
don't put any dynamic lighting on every single light emitter, you see that the character

349
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:32,501
is too dark and it's not fitting on the environment.

350
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:41,467
So can you predict roughly where the player will be at some point in the story?

351
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:50,765
Yeah, exactly. I was not talking too much about the mechanics or how the game design was, but

352
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:57,187
the characters, they were all, well, the actors were all recorded on this motion capture session

353
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:59,769
and they were all following the story.

354
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:07,950
Yeah, we know exactly in every minute where they are,

355
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,110
they are not moving with any AI.

356
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,671
That's why this is an experience,

357
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,351
and this is a theater experience.

358
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,312
We know exactly where are they going,

359
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:19,293
and what are they saying, how much time

360
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:20,333
they are staying in every room.

361
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:24,935
So yeah, we are always using this sequencer,

362
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:27,775
and we are checking where to put all the lights,

363
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:28,976
all the dynamic lights.

364
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:31,296
Thank you.

365
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:32,997
Very nice art style.

366
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:34,177
Thanks to you.

367
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:39,095
Any other questions?

368
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,842
Well, thank you very much.
