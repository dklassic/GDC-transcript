1
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:06,204
Hello.

2
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:11,146
Hi. Oh, God, I got a hi.

3
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:12,066
Thank you.

4
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:14,948
So ice is wonderful.

5
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:18,109
There's a lot of people here to kind of listen to me,

6
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,770
which is awesome, because this was actually just something that.

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,634
I kind of, some friends were doing and it was something I got really passionate about

8
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:29,634
and I started spending a lot of time thinking about it and so I'm delighted you're kind

9
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,295
of all here to see this.

10
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:32,915
So my name's Nick Button-Brown.

11
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:38,636
The idea for this session came from a friend of mine was writing a book about different

12
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:43,378
career structures and I ended up having a chat to her and my half hour chat became a

13
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:47,959
three hour chat which went over two days which became about the games industry and how the

14
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:49,699
games industry is so different toâ€¦

15
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:53,521
all the other industries around and it was all really exciting and it was like,

16
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,083
you know, so it's really excited.

17
00:00:57,564 --> 00:01:00,706
Thank you for coming along and thank you for listening to this talk.

18
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:08,071
What she did when she was talking was she presented this idea to me of a career lattice.

19
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,312
Has anybody heard the term career lattice before?

20
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,234
A couple of people.

21
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:12,554
Okay.

22
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:19,298
And it did this thing where it just, it almost made sense of the things that I'd done.

23
00:01:20,988 --> 00:01:26,914
I hadn't done it deliberately, but all of a sudden it was like, yeah, okay, that kind

24
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:27,014
of...

25
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:30,738
I wasn't completely insane in the decisions that I made.

26
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,582
But to be honest, I do need to start with a disclaimer.

27
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:40,047
I didn't know this theory, I didn't know this structure when I started crafting my career.

28
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:46,412
You know, generally my career choices have been on the basis of opportunism, self-confidence

29
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:50,976
and whim and can be looked at at best as a series of ill-conceived and accidental events.

30
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:55,961
But I'm going to talk today about the idea of career lattice and I'm going to explain

31
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,644
some of the benefits and then look at a little bit on how to build it.

32
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:07,576
Okay, I've got to start with my own career.

33
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:10,979
I think that's a reasonable place to look.

34
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:15,522
And I did, when I thought about this speech, I forgot that this was going to be streamed

35
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:16,643
and would be on YouTube.

36
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,566
So I have various humiliating pictures of me.

37
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,730
I started off, I was brought up in a theatre family.

38
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,333
I was brought up in a theatre family in the seventies and eighties which results in

39
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:32,255
some horrendous fashion faux pas.

40
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:37,339
And trust me, nobody can carry off a gold lame jumpsuit at the age of fourteen.

41
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,202
I was one of Ken Dodd's diddy men.

42
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:44,325
Prize is for seeing which one I was. Anybody get it?

43
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:50,350
I'm the guy dressed as the British police officer on the front on the right.

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,584
I appeared in pantomimes every year.

45
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:59,129
But at the same time I was kind of really good at maths.

46
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,652
Okay, anybody guess this one?

47
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:04,456
Yeah, okay, that one's a bit easier. I'm the tall guy.

48
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:09,408
I trained to be a dance teacher.

49
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,749
I appeared regularly on a TV show,

50
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,290
which must be one of the longest running

51
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,950
glow points of the television arts

52
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,030
called The Hitman and Her.

53
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,190
It was terrible.

54
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,711
It ran between two and four on a Saturday night,

55
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:25,252
and nobody ever watched it sober.

56
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,333
I joined a boy band.

57
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:30,353
I used to perform alongside Take That,

58
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,474
way before they were famous,

59
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:34,414
when they were just kind of getting started.

60
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:35,534
But still, Take That.

61
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:41,483
I kind of gave that up to go to study maths at Oxford.

62
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:48,605
The last thing I did before I went to university was I auditioned for a family soap, a daytime

63
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,666
family soap, and I got down to the last two and I lost out, because I lost out, I went

64
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:53,327
to university.

65
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,887
The guy I lost out to was Jude Law.

66
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:57,668
So I was that close to being Jude Law.

67
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:01,169
Yeah, that close.

68
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:08,414
What I ended up doing was I became an accountant.

69
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,436
I became an accountant because I didn't really know what to do.

70
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,940
I became an accountant because they were the people hiring when I left university and nobody

71
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,320
else was.

72
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:23,404
I realized I wasn't a very good accountant because I thought anything under seven figures

73
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:24,225
was a rounding error.

74
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:27,225
And so perhaps it was best for me to move on.

75
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:30,468
I was lucky enough not to get hired in the record industry,

76
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:31,869
which was what I was trying to get into,

77
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,351
and ended up going into games, which was my passion,

78
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,212
but it just didn't seem like a proper career.

79
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:41,557
I then joined, ooh,

80
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:44,780
I then joined EA, I joined EA as an accountant,

81
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,162
and I ended up moving across and helping set up

82
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:55,255
A partners so any a partners I worked with dice and where the kind of insane

83
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:58,938
German developer that was about to launch an FPS up against in 3.

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,444
That was far cry. I ended up liking them so much and I love the insanity I

85
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:09,648
joined them spent 5 years there I was managing their studios we had 700

86
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,430
people working on games.

87
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:19,763
I then left that to join an insane startup in England,

88
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:22,945
which was developing distributed servers,

89
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,288
and it was living in a Silicon Valley world,

90
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,710
and I can assure you that Silicon Valley

91
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,672
is a documentary, not a comedy.

92
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,584
From that I was elected onto the board of trustees at BAFTA.

93
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,245
I'm now head of games at BAFTA.

94
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:42,408
I did my absolute passion project,

95
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,730
which was a VR game with a film studio,

96
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,491
and I loved it, and it got killed.

97
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,554
From there, I now work with a few different companies,

98
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:53,795
including Sensible Objects,

99
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:58,218
which is a wonderful physical, digital, smart toy.

100
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:01,720
Do we have Alex in?

101
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,909
No, okay.

102
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,230
All right, so the career ladder.

103
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,452
I didn't really follow a traditional career ladder.

104
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:11,932
I think that's kind of clear.

105
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,113
The career ladder assumes everybody's

106
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:15,093
gonna progress upwards,

107
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:17,414
and it seems they're getting better at what they're doing,

108
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:20,376
that the industry you're in is the same in 20 years

109
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:21,536
as it was 20 years ago.

110
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:23,517
Ultimately, this is based on the kind of world

111
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:24,978
where you're loyal to one company.

112
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,136
Games industry, we're definitely not spending,

113
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:30,177
there are a few, but most people don't spend

114
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,358
all their lives at one company.

115
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:33,239
And the problem is it doesn't work so well

116
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,020
if people are different.

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,941
Industries live and die very quickly

118
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:37,262
and you have to evolve to compete,

119
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:41,345
but the way you do, you change jobs,

120
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:43,586
or you find better ways of doing something,

121
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:45,447
or the new tech exists and makes the way

122
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,289
that you were working before redundant,

123
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,671
and to be honest, we don't want to have the same jobs

124
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,672
as anybody else anymore.

125
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:53,193
We wanna have our own jobs, we wanna have our own,

126
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:55,294
we wanna do something which is individual to us.

127
00:06:56,604 --> 00:07:00,648
So, the career ladder, I really can't read that on my screen,

128
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,992
it relies on a traditional hierarchy,

129
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,956
it relies on this kind of singular path upwards,

130
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:10,240
it relies on low workforce mobility,

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,103
and your loyalty is based on promotion and salary.

132
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:18,075
Which takes me to the idea of the career lattice.

133
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,537
It's a better model for today's flexible

134
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:23,058
and fast-changing work markets,

135
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:25,639
where you need to be self-reliant and agile.

136
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,421
Ultimately, you should set about acquiring skills

137
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:29,921
that are strategic to what you want to do,

138
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,502
or what you might want to do,

139
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,104
as well as dealing with the skills,

140
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:36,665
the lack of which is a career blocker.

141
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,085
Everybody know what a career blocker is?

142
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,987
If you don't know it, you've probably got one.

143
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,088
It's a skill that stops you progressing.

144
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,815
Yeah, I mean you need to build the experiences that you can base future work and decisions on.

145
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:54,662
You need to get the technical skills, of course, but really importantly is you need the networks.

146
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:57,306
You need the networks of people that will help you.

147
00:07:57,326 --> 00:08:00,991
This is not necessarily to get another job, but people can give you advice, people that can give you support.

148
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,040
So what does the career lattice work better for?

149
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,641
I mean, it's more conducive to this flatter, more matrix

150
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:11,901
structure we have within games.

151
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:13,501
You can have multiple paths.

152
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,862
You can choose your own route.

153
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:19,083
And it adjusts as your needs change over time.

154
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:23,144
It relies on high workforce mobility.

155
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:27,265
And your loyalty is based on opportunities, rather than

156
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:28,165
being tied to something.

157
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:29,926
It's based on a new opportunity that allows you to

158
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:30,526
do something else.

159
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,426
So, what's the theory?

160
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:38,488
The career lattice is a more creative way

161
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:39,308
to look at your career.

162
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:43,870
It's a diagonal framework that braids lateral experiences,

163
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,331
adjacent skill acquisition, and peer networking.

164
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,232
Don't worry, I'm gonna talk about this a little bit more.

165
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,274
It allows you to move to a variety of positions,

166
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,516
which you are now able to do

167
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:56,557
because you have gathered these skills.

168
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:00,238
It's about evolution, it's about evolving,

169
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:03,760
it's about changing, and it allows you to grow all the time.

170
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:08,508
You're always growing, you're always finding some new skill,

171
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:10,168
always finding some way to improve yourself.

172
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,830
Okay, so you saw what I did.

173
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,031
What did I get from my career lattice?

174
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:20,752
I worked on The Hitman and Her.

175
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,312
It taught me about confidence,

176
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,393
taught me about the power that confidence has.

177
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:30,375
It also gave me a far too detailed working understanding

178
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:30,915
of hot pants.

179
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:34,615
Working in a boy band.

180
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,636
Okay, I'm not being flippant here.

181
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,458
Working in a boy band was all about egos.

182
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,459
Managing fragile egos.

183
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,001
I was the one that learned to manage everybody else's egos.

184
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:47,383
That's probably the greatest lesson you can ever learn

185
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:49,004
is how to manage other people's egos.

186
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:52,126
You know, studying math taught me how to think laterally

187
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:54,187
and kind of pick up problem solving.

188
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,849
Being at Eidos taught me the fallacy of success.

189
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,351
Do you know what the fallacy of success is?

190
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:03,629
The idea that because you've been successful,

191
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:04,630
you knew what you were doing.

192
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,633
It's great, they were really successful.

193
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,514
It was all fantastic.

194
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,975
We're gonna carry on doing the same thing.

195
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,759
Then they went bust three times, got bought out.

196
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:16,021
You know, it is a fallacy.

197
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,503
Often, you're just lucky.

198
00:10:19,524 --> 00:10:22,287
You can do good things, and you can make yourself lucky,

199
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:24,108
but you can't rely on the luck.

200
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,627
I did my MBA, it taught me how to think differently.

201
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:31,229
It really taught me how to work on my people skills as well.

202
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,270
You know, most people don't do an MBA for that,

203
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,832
but actually the way of thinking,

204
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:39,395
how I interact with a team, the way of constructing teams.

205
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:40,996
Working with EA partners taught me

206
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:42,257
about managing relationships.

207
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,198
You know, I was working with developers,

208
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:45,379
great developers around the world.

209
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,520
How are you doing that remotely?

210
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,801
How are you doing it face to face?

211
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,084
Crytek taught me to make a game from end to end.

212
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:55,305
That's a big thing.

213
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:58,087
I covered every part of making a game.

214
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,452
Improbable taught me just working with a bunch of

215
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,914
really, really smart people.

216
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:10,037
I was used to being one of the smartest people in the room.

217
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:13,060
I go there and, well, yeah, I'm still one of the smartest

218
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,580
people in the room.

219
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,781
And actually, Sensible Objects is an interesting one,

220
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:21,723
because it's taught me about making my own decisions.

221
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,164
Every other company, I've had somebody else there,

222
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:25,745
and I want to do this.

223
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:26,625
No, you can't do that.

224
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,006
Oh, well, if I'd done that, it would have been fantastic.

225
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:30,807
And I go to the smaller company.

226
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:31,548
I want to do this.

227
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,069
And everybody's looking at me going, all right then.

228
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:35,770
Oh, OK.

229
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,111
What if I get it wrong?

230
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:38,412
That's what you have to learn.

231
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:43,935
So what would be a good lattice rule?

232
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,387
You want access to best practices.

233
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,369
You want to learn things that you can take

234
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,890
and kind of carry on using for many years.

235
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:58,112
You want to add technical skills.

236
00:11:58,152 --> 00:11:59,553
You want to add life skills.

237
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,995
I'm going to talk about life skills are really important.

238
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,675
Life skills are the most important thing

239
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:04,816
you can learn within a lattice.

240
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:07,938
You want to learn how to make decisions.

241
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,400
And I mentioned it before, you want networks.

242
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,882
Networks, networks make everything work.

243
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,314
So, best practices. Can you work with an expert?

244
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,996
How would you find a job that would help you with best practices?

245
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:28,199
Who are the people that do what you're interested in the best?

246
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,099
Can you get to them?

247
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,100
Can you learn from them?

248
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,921
Can you find a well-run company?

249
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:35,684
Can you do things well in all areas of their business?

250
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:38,106
Or could you look at a completely different industry?

251
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,347
You know, you're really interested in creativity.

252
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,189
Well, God, go and spend a year at Pixar.

253
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,791
You're going to learn a huge amount about creativity.

254
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:46,912
But maybe you're really interested in commerce.

255
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:48,693
Can you work really closely with Amazon?

256
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:51,255
You know, they do so many wonderful things.

257
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,112
This one's the most dangerous.

258
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,293
Work with people who don't agree with you.

259
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,375
You learn so much from them,

260
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,297
but it could really piss you off.

261
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:11,278
I've done this, it's difficult.

262
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,699
I'm glad I did it, but I wouldn't do it again.

263
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,129
But I definitely learned a lot.

264
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:20,652
I mean, ultimately, you've got to think creatively

265
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:22,413
and don't necessarily take the easy option.

266
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,175
The easy option is always the one in front of you.

267
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:27,098
But actually, sometimes you need to go off

268
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:27,818
and do something else.

269
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,101
Life skills.

270
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:34,965
So, oh no, sorry, technical skills.

271
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:41,331
You do need to pick up technical skills, but it's not just the technical skills that make you a great artist.

272
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:44,995
Actually, there are a bunch of technical skills that may help you in doing other things.

273
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:47,457
Just understanding project management is a wonderful thing.

274
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:49,880
Anybody that understands project management is so much stronger.

275
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,543
You know, theoretical science, the background of doing this,

276
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:55,846
you want to improve your existing skills.

277
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,980
But don't just focus on your best skills, you want to make sure that your worst skills

278
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,401
aren't stopping you from developing.

279
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,921
That's back to the career blockers idea.

280
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:08,323
You can't make your worst skills into your best skills, but you can make them not that

281
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:08,623
bad.

282
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,004
Stop at not that bad.

283
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:11,864
Not that bad's okay.

284
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:15,165
So life skills.

285
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:19,774
I, this, you know, this is really important to me.

286
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,935
You've got to, you can learn to work

287
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,776
in a rapidly changing situation.

288
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,437
It's kind of hard if you don't know

289
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:26,717
what you're going to be doing from day to day.

290
00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:28,558
You come in and everything's changed again.

291
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:29,879
And, you know, you come back the next week

292
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,039
and everything's changed again.

293
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,600
You've got to learn coping mechanisms to deal with that.

294
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:37,042
Influencing skills, hugely important.

295
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:40,443
You know, how you're managing internal relationships

296
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:42,144
and external relationships, they're all the same.

297
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:43,345
They're just relationships.

298
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:49,940
But if you can get people to come along with you without having to shout at them, that's pretty powerful.

299
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:53,883
I mean, you need to deal with lots of different kinds of people.

300
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:56,845
If you've always been an artist, that's great. You talk to lots of artists,

301
00:14:56,865 --> 00:15:01,769
but you've kind of got to learn how to negotiate with a coder that's going to help you do the thing that you really want to do,

302
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,351
that's going to make the difference, that's going to make your work fantastic.

303
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:09,104
And you can go with management skills or leader skills.

304
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:10,765
They're two different kind of things.

305
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,145
You choose whether you want to be a manager,

306
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,546
you choose whether you want to be a leader,

307
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:16,868
but you do need to build those skills.

308
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,109
And dealing with difficult people.

309
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,110
Difficult people are hard.

310
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:26,192
One of my worst ever times at work

311
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,693
was the first time I fired somebody.

312
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:29,354
Destroyed me.

313
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:31,795
Got easier after that.

314
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:33,876
I'm not certain that's a good thing.

315
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,781
Yeah, I'm going a bit dark now.

316
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:44,665
So making decisions.

317
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:49,349
There's a theory of decision making called thin slicing.

318
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,132
Thin slicing says that decisions made quickly by an

319
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:56,595
experienced person are generally better than

320
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:59,617
decisions made by the same person after weighing up all

321
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:02,539
the evidence and balancing it out and arguing it out in

322
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:02,879
their heads.

323
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,641
It's the epitome of the gut instinct.

324
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:11,666
Now, to make that work, you have to have those experiences.

325
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:13,387
You have to have seen the situations before.

326
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,110
So if you can start to build those experiences,

327
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,751
then you're going to be much better at doing that.

328
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,232
You're going to be much more efficient at it,

329
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:20,674
and you don't have to do the agonizing.

330
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,456
If anybody's interested in that, there's a bunch of stuff

331
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:24,297
about thin slicing.

332
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:28,381
It's really, you know, it's subconscious processing.

333
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:36,067
You need to learn how to analyze the situations.

334
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:38,008
You need to build cases.

335
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:39,568
You need to build arguments.

336
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:42,068
You need to construct them for a variety of different people.

337
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,269
Not just people who know what you're doing,

338
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,829
people that have no idea what you're doing.

339
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:46,549
You need to learn to pitch.

340
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,870
Everybody needs to pitch.

341
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,851
Not just people that are talking to other companies.

342
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:53,871
You need to pitch.

343
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:55,711
You need to pitch the work that you're doing

344
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,712
because you need to tell people how awesome it is.

345
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:02,765
You need to recommend the decisions, but again, I kind of came back to this.

346
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,107
You need to learn how to implement your own decisions.

347
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:08,470
It's really easy to say, you should have done this, until the moment where

348
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,691
you kind of go, oh, I have done this.

349
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:13,374
And you get it wrong.

350
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:14,395
That's OK.

351
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:15,335
That's not a bad thing.

352
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,251
Yeah. Networking. Networking within the company.

353
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,992
Most people, you know, everybody here wants to network.

354
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:29,653
So whenever you have a few minutes, talk to somebody.

355
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:32,874
Before you leave here, talk to the person that's sitting next to you. Find out their name.

356
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:34,555
You never know. It might be somebody really cool.

357
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:38,536
But working for your networks is very different to that.

358
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:42,437
You take a job because it gives you great relationships with talented people.

359
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:46,038
And over time, those people move into different companies and do different things.

360
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:48,533
Never piss off people in your company.

361
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:57,257
I was lucky enough to work at EA in the early 2000s, which is the most fantastic network

362
00:17:57,297 --> 00:18:00,779
of people scattered all over the industry in very senior positions, partially because

363
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:05,842
most people earned quite a lot on the share options and were able to make easier choices.

364
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:09,864
Build that group of people.

365
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:15,129
asking someone for a favor is actually more powerful

366
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:16,770
than offering someone a favor.

367
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,451
Don't do it the first time you meet somebody,

368
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,211
that's just creepy.

369
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:23,512
So that's just so clear,

370
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:25,593
so not everybody comes at the end and asks me for a favor.

371
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,555
There's a lot of, there is research that shows

372
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:35,296
that asking someone for a favor binds them much closer to you

373
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,497
than doing something for them.

374
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,998
That's kind of counterintuitive, but it works.

375
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:42,757
You know, build that group of people.

376
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:44,798
The best kind of connections are the people

377
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:45,598
that get things done.

378
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,660
What you want to be is one of the people

379
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,460
that gets things done.

380
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:50,781
That would be great.

381
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,002
But get to know the people that get things done.

382
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:56,944
To be honest, in a big company,

383
00:18:56,964 --> 00:18:58,384
there's not always that many people

384
00:18:58,424 --> 00:18:59,445
that do get things done.

385
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:01,906
Don't be an arse.

386
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,227
We all know them.

387
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,468
Because we're talking about the power of networks.

388
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:08,649
If you're an arse.

389
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:11,007
then everybody knows you're an arse,

390
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:13,048
and everybody's gonna tell everybody else you're an arse.

391
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:15,489
It's really difficult to come back.

392
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,710
I know some people who are actually genuinely nice people,

393
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,911
but they just, they messed up,

394
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:22,752
and it followed them around for kind of 10 years.

395
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:28,335
One interesting thing, beware the whiz kid syndrome.

396
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:31,637
So don't just mix with smart young people.

397
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,919
You need networks of kind of,

398
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:40,930
of other people that have done other things, that can open doors, that have experience,

399
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,692
that can do other things. And similarly, don't not mix with smart young people. You know,

400
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:49,254
if you're an older person, just make sure you're getting some of that energy and you're

401
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:54,956
seeing different people. Don't just mix with people like you. I've spent too much time

402
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:57,698
talking to games people. I've been lucky enough in the...

403
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:06,198
Last week I was at a think tank, which was kind of film and government and military and

404
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:07,579
it was wonderful.

405
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:14,881
I got to sit talking to the lady that proved that Einstein's theory of gravitational waves

406
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:19,083
was actually correct, when Einstein himself didn't think it was provable.

407
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:22,964
Admittedly, I'm talking to them and then I'm kind of going, yeah, I make games.

408
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,605
We make things run around and stuff.

409
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,154
But yeah, still, it was awesome.

410
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:35,295
Let's start talking about a couple of examples now.

411
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:37,315
When I started this session, what I was going to do was

412
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,056
pick the great and the good of the games industry and say,

413
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:42,156
let's have a look at how they develop their careers and the

414
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:43,556
skills they picked up as it went along.

415
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:45,537
It wasn't really working.

416
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:49,458
And as I was walking around the show, people were seeing

417
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:51,078
my speakers badge and coming up to me and going, what are

418
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:51,718
you talking about?

419
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:53,879
And I kind of talked to them and they go, oh yeah, that

420
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:54,759
kind of, yeah.

421
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,979
And what I'm instead going to talk about is those stories,

422
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,260
people that came up to me.

423
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,380
I'm Clive Downie.

424
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,500
It's CMO at Unity.

425
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:08,085
He was a rising star at EA. He was stratospheric. Everybody loved him.

426
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,127
But he was interested in marketing.

427
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:14,789
Fairly early on, he decided to leave EA and go to Mattel.

428
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:20,232
Because EA was a product-led company. Mattel is a marketing-led company.

429
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,594
He went off. He learned a bunch of best practices.

430
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:25,315
Two years later, he went back to EA.

431
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:29,557
That set him up. If you ask him, that was the most important thing he ever did.

432
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:36,118
I bumped into a guy yesterday, Eugene Harton, and

433
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:40,440
he'd just come into the games industry, but the job that he'd come into gave him

434
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,502
massive amounts of exposure to loads of different things. He got to work in loads of

435
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:45,982
different areas really quickly.

436
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,364
And so he got up to speed on what the games industry was.

437
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:53,645
He saw loads of people, he interacted with loads of people, he did loads of different things.

438
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,064
I'm actually, I'm gonna ask for a speaker from the audience.

439
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:01,286
So, Oliver is one of the smartest people

440
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:02,287
I've ever worked with.

441
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,711
He, in fact, Oliver, do you wanna stand up

442
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:07,894
and just share some of your insights?

443
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:11,418
Thanks Nick, that's also a terrible introduction.

444
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:13,759
I know, I did that deliberately, did you like it?

445
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:15,000
I did like it, thank you.

446
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,101
You mentioned networking alone can be a role.

447
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,522
So I spent a decade as a British diplomat

448
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,403
and oftentimes got billed, because I was young,

449
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:27,064
as being the guy leading on innovation and creativity,

450
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,745
which being in this room is obviously a bit rich.

451
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:34,526
So decided instead to leave for a bit

452
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,088
and go into Improbable, where Nick and I met.

453
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:43,110
And that was about suddenly being not the guy known for innovation and creativity,

454
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,993
but the guy arguing for paperwork, writing things down, and a bit of process,

455
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:52,076
which was at times galling, but a necessary different experience.

456
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:58,239
And Nick also put up there new skills, new experiences, new abilities, new networks.

457
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,162
From my experience of jumping from academia to government, now into tech,

458
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:06,865
each of those jobs may not give you

459
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:11,888
something, some output from all of those four categories.

460
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:14,929
So certainly my skills were developed with the British Army.

461
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,611
Most of my abilities were developed in the Foreign Office.

462
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,893
The experiences I've had that have been much more diverse

463
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:22,974
have been in this role.

464
00:23:23,554 --> 00:23:27,716
So in a tech startup, learning how to report to people

465
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,077
who are much younger than me,

466
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:31,058
when I've only ever reported to old white men.

467
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:36,332
And that's a challenge because they may be phenomenally intelligent,

468
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:39,232
but they're often inexperienced and perhaps immature.

469
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:42,973
So stuff I took for granted, I had to suddenly redress.

470
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:48,974
Similarly, the types of experiences that jobs in the foreign office

471
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:52,775
prepare you for are wildly different to experiences in a tech startup.

472
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:57,256
So being shot at or blown up in Afghanistan is an episodic trauma.

473
00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:00,236
It's really shit for a really short period of time.

474
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:03,306
Whereas being in a young tech startup

475
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,547
is a persistent low level of constant anxiety.

476
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:10,548
And that's something that it's really difficult

477
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:11,729
to learn how to control.

478
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:13,310
And you can only really do it

479
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,270
with phenomenal people around you.

480
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,392
And Nick was certainly one of those strong supporters.

481
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,933
I mean, the interesting thing is Ollie could always kill you

482
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:22,153
in a room because you kind of,

483
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,434
oh no, I had a really hard day.

484
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:25,895
And he'd like, yeah, when I was in this other job,

485
00:24:25,935 --> 00:24:27,815
the Jeep next to me blew up and everybody died.

486
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,697
Okay, yeah, that's a bad day.

487
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:32,558
Thank you, Ollie.

488
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,383
My CEO at my current company working on this,

489
00:24:38,683 --> 00:24:41,486
he first of all did an experiential games

490
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,709
and he built a team that was used to being able to

491
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:47,791
prototype incredibly fast because that's all he had.

492
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:51,455
He took that to then make this new company, which is smart toys.

493
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:56,479
He built a set of experiences that

494
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,181
made him able to do the next thing.

495
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:02,262
So, you know, a modern career is just a collection of skills.

496
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:06,643
Your career lattice is a slightly different way of looking at the career progression.

497
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:12,085
But to remind you, it's about collecting varieties of experiences.

498
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:16,887
It's about picking up and being able to evidence that kind of wide variety of skills.

499
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:19,988
And it's about building the useful networks. Those are the three things.

500
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:25,470
So every job that you look at, you should be able to tick huge numbers of things in those boxes.

501
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:31,415
I can't not just throw in a couple of random things.

502
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:33,736
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

503
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:38,039
You can step sideways, you can step down, you can do something different, you can

504
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:38,679
take a risk.

505
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,361
Most of you in here have got loads of years to play with.

506
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,583
Unfortunately I'm reaching the stage where I'm counting down the number of games I've got left.

507
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,179
That's a terrible thing. I'm less than double digits now.

508
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,100
You've got to have, you know,

509
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,621
it is about repetition, it's about doing things better and better. It's not the first time you do something.

510
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,241
You've got to have endurance.

511
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:05,202
You've got to recognize that failure is learning. And this is the one thing if I can ever tell you,

512
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:07,103
don't work with arseholes.

513
00:26:09,143 --> 00:26:10,903
It's hard work and they're arseholes.

514
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:17,492
I mean, and so if it isn't working out, do a different job.

515
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,333
As long as you don't do it every six months,

516
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:21,873
nobody's gonna look at that badly

517
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,294
because you're in an interview and you kind of go,

518
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:24,654
yeah, it just wasn't very good.

519
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:29,156
So I'm gonna, got a couple of minutes left.

520
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,816
I'm gonna throw it out for questions.

521
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,737
Anybody got any questions or anybody wanna share

522
00:26:33,077 --> 00:26:35,598
any of their own experiences, what they got from a job?

523
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:37,958
Yeah, please.

524
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:45,138
I served in the United States Army from 2010,

525
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:47,140
right after I graduated high school, until 2015.

526
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:52,303
And one of the major skills I got

527
00:26:52,423 --> 00:26:58,087
was not only dealing with people all over the chain of command,

528
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:00,249
whether that's an officer or a sergeant,

529
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,392
that kind of carried over into project management.

530
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:09,255
And even though I turned that career into...

531
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:14,707
being an artist, that project management skill carried over,

532
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,970
and I'm able to run projects from the ground up,

533
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,371
and that's been pretty beneficial.

534
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:21,734
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of a great skill,

535
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,096
and that skill will do whatever job you do.

536
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:25,237
That's a great skill to have.

537
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:28,720
Anybody else got a question or wanna throw something out?

538
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,439
So I'm an academic, so much like you,

539
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,999
having that kind of background.

540
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,660
And I'm struck by your discussion about the career lattice,

541
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,760
about how much that reflects

542
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,641
a very traditional liberal arts education.

543
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:43,742
And I'm wondering if you have any comments about that

544
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:46,783
in terms of preparing people for that sort of mentality,

545
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:52,625
right, in universities or other sorts of higher education

546
00:27:52,685 --> 00:27:54,046
so that we don't railroad people

547
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,866
into thinking that it's just the latter?

548
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:57,707
That's an interesting question.

549
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:15,076
Not something I particularly thought about, but I mean, what you want to do is try and create that kind of lattice structure within the university, the projects that you're doing, getting people jumping between projects, taking different roles. It's the one time in your life when you can do that, when you're not risking too much by doing that.

550
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:28,145
Yeah, so you always just want to kick people to do something different. And if they're doing the same thing again and again, just try and stop them. But that's a really good question. That's really interesting. And you're right, it is a kind of liberal mentality here as well.

551
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:30,469
But we're in games, you know.

552
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:33,531
Okay.

553
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:36,694
I think we've got time for one more.

554
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:37,274
Is that okay?

555
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:38,435
Yeah.

556
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:40,756
When you're about to make a career transition,

557
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:45,079
what's the best way to convince other people

558
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,641
that your past skills are transferable

559
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,162
if they're from a different part of the industry

560
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:51,563
that isn't directly applicable to the job you're looking for?

561
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:53,485
That's a hard one.

562
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:55,686
In a lot of cases, I've done that within companies.

563
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:59,897
So because they have an understanding for you, often they'll let you move around.

564
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:01,037
I did that a lot within EA.

565
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:03,419
I did a lot of different things at EA.

566
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,102
It's actually, so it's not just about, I mean, we're talking about jobs, but it's actually

567
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,483
about the other things you're doing around it.

568
00:29:09,503 --> 00:29:10,864
It's the things you're supporting.

569
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:12,165
It's the hobbies that you've got.

570
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:16,328
I, you know, I work with Oli on the near future forum, which is.

571
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:24,181
That's a networking thing, but that allows me to take a certain set of skills, and it's not necessarily my job that's taking me to the next one.

572
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,543
It's the other things that I'm doing, so you can kind of package it up and do that.

573
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:33,968
Yeah, you use the other things that you're doing to provide that transition as well.

574
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:35,049
Thank you.

575
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,652
I wasn't quite certain whether I could get away with a Trump joke.

576
00:29:41,754 --> 00:29:43,536
So I looked at Trump's career lattice.

577
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:46,958
And basically everything always told him how awesome he was.

578
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:51,267
Have I got away with a Trump joke?

579
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,510
Alright, alright, we'll see.

580
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:59,717
Too soon, is it too soon? Sorry, I'm a Brit, we're just laughing about Brexit because that's hilarious.

581
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,964
Anyway, look, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate you coming along.

582
00:30:06,024 --> 00:30:09,148
Please fill in the feedback. If you've got any questions, I'm hanging around. Thank you.
