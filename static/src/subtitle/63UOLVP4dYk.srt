1
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:13,592
And I suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder as well as depression.

2
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:18,057
Now, I don't know how many people identified as OCD.

3
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:19,799
Sometimes people say,

4
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:23,783
Oh, I just got the Pokemon game and I gotta get all the Pokemons

5
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:27,346
or I'm not gonna be happy or something.

6
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:29,248
That's not really OCD.

7
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:37,268
It's not just being anal retentive. It's a dark and troubling illness and

8
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:42,569
It's been a real struggle for me. I have a clinical diagnosis for both

9
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:46,811
I've seen a therapist and have been for over 10 years and

10
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:52,592
In all my therapy, I've discovered. I don't think there's a cure. I'm never gonna be

11
00:00:53,594 --> 00:01:02,207
fixed. But therapy helps with gaining tools to deal with my illness. And I was dealing

12
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:08,055
with it pretty well before I started 24 karat games, and not so much during the development

13
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:08,616
of retrograde.

14
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:11,857
So, a little bit about Retrograde.

15
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:13,819
We released last August on PlayStation 3.

16
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:19,365
We spent about four years on the PlayStation 3 version.

17
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:23,029
We just released a PC port on Steam last week,

18
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:25,371
and I did that basically by myself,

19
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:27,293
part-time for six months.

20
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,390
The team was roughly three.

21
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,810
I did the game design and gameplay programming.

22
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,091
Justin Wilder did the engine, special effects, and tools.

23
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:40,012
We worked with art contractors for the project.

24
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:42,013
But we had trouble finding a good match

25
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,893
until about the latter half of the project,

26
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:45,754
when we started working with Joe Grabowski.

27
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:49,135
And then we contracted him full time

28
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:51,315
for the remainder of the project.

29
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:54,557
On average, I worked about 80 hours a week

30
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:59,600
for the four years of the PlayStation 3 version.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,664
The game has about three quarters of a million lines of code.

32
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,945
Let me just let that sink in.

33
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:10,788
Three quarters of a million lines of code, and there's two programmers.

34
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:12,248
That's insane.

35
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:16,027
According to the Game Developer Magazine,

36
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,028
the post-mortem of LittleBigPlanet,

37
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:21,388
they said they had about half a million lines of code

38
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:24,009
and 37 developers.

39
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:27,330
So lines of code is difficult to measure,

40
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,050
and it's hard to compare.

41
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,551
And it depends on the standards used.

42
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,351
We used Code Analyzer.

43
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,912
And the actual number is not really important.

44
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:36,472
I'm not trying to say I'm better than you.

45
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:38,613
I have so many lines of code.

46
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:40,973
In fact, it's been a bit of a curse.

47
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:47,683
The thing that's significant about it is that we had a huge project.

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,542
Why did we have so many lines of code?

49
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:51,463
I wish I knew.

50
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,707
But no, we tried to create a reusable engine that

51
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:58,309
would be modular and support different projects.

52
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,411
And all this adds complexity.

53
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:05,095
So 46% of the code was the engine in quotation fingers.

54
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:07,337
Because really, it's just a game, right?

55
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:08,338
What is the engine?

56
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:11,481
It's not like we're selling it, you know, Unreal,

57
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:12,762
retrograde, whatever, no.

58
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:16,685
38% is the game-specific code, at least in our minds,

59
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,506
and 16% was the tools,

60
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:21,128
but they shared a lot of engine components.

61
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:22,729
We had a good amount of tools.

62
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,551
There are several different features

63
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:26,833
that had quite a bit of lines of code

64
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,954
when we were trying to do procedural art.

65
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:31,476
We had these animated signs for the menus,

66
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:34,438
the Octaboard boss, which I'll talk more about later,

67
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,401
and this procedural city background.

68
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:38,762
And each of those things

69
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,923
had 5,000 lines of code by themselves.

70
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:46,263
So when we first started 24K Games, we didn't plan on

71
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:47,424
self-funding a project.

72
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,385
We just started working on a demo.

73
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:52,587
The idea was we were going to pitch ourselves to publishers.

74
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:57,716
Unfortunately for us, the economy soon crashed,

75
00:03:57,716 --> 00:03:59,337
right after we started 24Karat,

76
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:01,718
and game projects were getting canceled left and right,

77
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:04,258
so it seemed unlikely we could get a gig.

78
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:08,220
We decided to start self-funding a small project

79
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,421
targeting Xbox Live and PlayStation Network,

80
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,722
and we thought we could do it in 6 to 12 months.

81
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:17,323
Seems like a reoccurring theme in the other IGS talks.

82
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:21,851
But we figured that our project might not be a big money winner,

83
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:24,934
but we can make a name for ourselves as a company,

84
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,355
as a quality developer.

85
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:32,160
So the concept of Retrograde is that you're playing a game backwards

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,641
to the beat of the music.

87
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,603
So it looks like a side-scrolling shooter,

88
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:37,084
but it's actually a rhythm game.

89
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,867
We were doing our own indie project,

90
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:43,410
so we wanted to do something interesting and fun that would stand out.

91
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,871
The Xbox Live and PlayStation Network space way back in 2008

92
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,112
was really not as competitive as it was now.

93
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,752
We thought that even with a simple design,

94
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:55,393
we were in good shape relative to the other games

95
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:56,713
on the market at that time.

96
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,674
We saw our main competition as Boom Boom Rocket.

97
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,835
And I'm not sure if anyone even remembers Boom Boom Rocket.

98
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,035
But I mean, it was an enjoyable rhythm game,

99
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:06,556
but it was very small in scope.

100
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,156
So after about a month and a half of work on Retrograde,

101
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:12,618
we submitted our demo to IGF in October,

102
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:15,780
and we were very fortunate to be nominated

103
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,382
for excellence in design and excellence in audio.

104
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:22,765
We lost our artist co-founder at the beginning of 2009

105
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:25,847
since he couldn't afford to self-fund the game.

106
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,960
At the IGF, it was really nice, because Sony came around,

107
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,882
and they were interested in getting us on PlayStation Network,

108
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,523
which we were really excited about,

109
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,406
because we wanted to make a console game.

110
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:40,108
But at this point, the bar for console indie games

111
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:42,950
had really been raised by Braid and Castle Crashers,

112
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,632
which came out after we started 24Karat.

113
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:47,594
We scrapped our schedule completely

114
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,216
and wanted to try something more ambitious.

115
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:50,817
Big mistake.

116
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,696
We originally designed the game's graphics so we could

117
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:58,099
scale down to mobile, but now we're on PlayStation 3, so we

118
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:01,102
wanted to redo our art style to take advantage of its

119
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:03,204
graphical horsepower.

120
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:06,246
So by October of 2009, we finished the gameplay pattern

121
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:06,667
for all 10 levels.

122
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,830
The art wasn't really where we wanted it, and we were having

123
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,292
trouble finding a good contractor.

124
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,520
We decided to do another pass completely on the music

125
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,900
and make it better and design it,

126
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,741
the music in conjunction with the gameplay patterns.

127
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,901
And we were adding more complicated bosses,

128
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,282
a new player and enemy fire types.

129
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:29,963
So Retrograde became like a spoiled child

130
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:33,263
and I couldn't say no to it.

131
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:36,444
Things changed in 2009 when I met my wife, Joanne.

132
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:39,585
It was during a lull in the project.

133
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:42,165
So I was only working 60 hours a week.

134
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:47,769
Unfortunately, after a few months, I felt the pressure on retrograde again,

135
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:51,671
and I resumed working 80 hours a week and spending less time with Joanne.

136
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:56,853
In 2010, we spent a lot of time on procedural art generation,

137
00:06:56,853 --> 00:07:01,775
since Justin and I, the founders, lacked artistic talent,

138
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:05,017
and we had difficulty finding good contractors.

139
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:09,659
We had a pseudo-realistic art style, which really makes procedural generation

140
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:10,500
difficult.

141
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,601
It's a lot harder than something abstract.

142
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:17,780
We had an obsessive attention to detail, which really hurt us.

143
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,842
At this point, we were already in perpetual crunch.

144
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:22,923
We wanted to get the game out as soon as possible,

145
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:25,584
since we were burning through our savings.

146
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:29,565
But we never looked for ways to simplify the game

147
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,346
or shorten development time,

148
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:33,167
which, obviously, would have been a good idea.

149
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:37,690
So this is a video of our procedural cityscape, which I talked about before.

150
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,353
The buildings have little lights on the windows, and they go on and off based on time of day.

151
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:49,017
So during night there's more windows on, and see now most of the windows are off,

152
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,659
and then we have the lens flare and the sunrise.

153
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,039
Oops, wrong button.

154
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:58,263
So, in 2010, I knew I wanted to marry Joanne.

155
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:01,404
When she was visiting her family in the Philippines,

156
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:04,444
I made a co-op video game to propose to her.

157
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:06,745
I basically placed the wedding ring

158
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:08,845
in a battery pack of the controller,

159
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:10,326
and then I sort of tricked her into playing it,

160
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:12,486
because I'm like, oh, I'm playing this IGF game,

161
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:15,767
and it's co-ops, I really need your help playing it.

162
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,567
And then at the end of the game, I put in a fake message

163
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:21,328
saying like, hey, you know, player two out of batteries.

164
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:23,569
Luckily, she didn't know what the Xbox battery icon

165
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,069
looked like, so I just had some.

166
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,955
in there. Anyway, I got down on one knee to fiddle with the USB cable and I told

167
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:33,821
her to look at the batteries and so she popped it out and found the ring. So

168
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:38,707
fortunately she said yes, although I did program in a response for no. It's

169
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:42,112
pretty cool.

170
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:54,418
There's actually, I invented a pixel particle system, so there's just like tears streaming down,

171
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:59,361
but it's all pixels aligned to the grid, so...

172
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:05,465
I recorded her reaction too with a webcam, and I put it up on YouTube, and you can find it,

173
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:10,349
and I think it's pretty cool, I don't know, and I think I put up the losing crying as well.

174
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:15,556
But the bad part is because of my financial investment

175
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,800
in retrograde, I couldn't afford a nice wedding.

176
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,841
Joann was very understanding, and we

177
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:24,725
decided to just get married right away without a ceremony

178
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:28,509
and delay our church wedding until I finished retrograde.

179
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:29,910
Or at least that was the plan.

180
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:34,498
So in 2011, my motto was release or die trying.

181
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:39,241
I spent a lot of time on detailed animations

182
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,543
for the bosses and complicated attacks and behavior.

183
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:46,125
So this is the Octoborg boss I mentioned earlier

184
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,046
that's 5,000 lines of code.

185
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,989
He has all sorts of procedural attacks and animations

186
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,109
and complications.

187
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,414
We also redesigned our entire pipeline at this point,

188
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:59,679
so the artist could animate the backgrounds as a Maya scene,

189
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,303
and then we export all the keyframes for the objects.

190
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,326
And so this video is also a good example of that.

191
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:07,491
You can see all the crazy animated stuff.

192
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:12,508
As the year progressed, I felt like we could finish by the end of the year,

193
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:17,335
but we'd be in the holiday season, which is a bad time to release for an indie game,

194
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,780
so we might as well spend extra time on it.

195
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,366
Of course, this is after three years, over three years of development.

196
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:30,637
I was really terrified to release the game for fear of failure.

197
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:34,439
I felt like the more I worked on it, the better the game was,

198
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:37,380
which would increase our chances for success.

199
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,342
However, the longer development meant it was a bigger risk,

200
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:44,143
which made me even more terrified to release.

201
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,585
In the back of our minds, I think we really knew

202
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:51,367
the game would never be profitable for the amount of time we put into it,

203
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,768
but we never changed the way we developed, despite that.

204
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,827
So Joanne wanted our church wedding in fall of 2011.

205
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:02,374
And even earlier in the year, I was beginning

206
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:05,520
to think that I might not finish retrograde before then,

207
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,965
which of course makes things very difficult.

208
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:12,296
I managed to pick up some work on the side to help make ends meet and pay for a church

209
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:17,981
wedding, but I didn't put retrograde on hold, so I doubled my workload, which of course

210
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,524
meant even less time with my wife.

211
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:25,929
For our wedding celebration, I only took off Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and I think

212
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:28,331
I actually worked a half day on that Friday.

213
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:35,986
I made so many personal sacrifices for Retrograde, I felt like I had to make the game amazing

214
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,667
to justify those, which really compelled me to keep working hard on it, even if it was

215
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,748
my swan song.

216
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:46,149
So at the beginning of 2012, I was really depressed.

217
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,871
It didn't feel like the end would ever be in sight.

218
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:56,613
I felt like I'd be working on it forever, and I wanted to quit game development completely.

219
00:11:57,313 --> 00:12:01,975
The only reason I kept working on Retrograde was because I felt an obligation to the fans

220
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:06,497
who played the game at PAX, IGF, and IndieCade, and who were really looking forward to its

221
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:08,338
release.

222
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:13,700
Even still, we refused to make compromises to get the game out of the door earlier.

223
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,162
For example, we ran out of memory, and instead of downsampling textures or having loading

224
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:21,883
screens, we redesigned the engine to support streaming.

225
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:26,173
We also had unnecessary polish.

226
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:30,394
We created the challenge mode map, which you saw at the beginning of the video,

227
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:34,035
which is like Super Mario World and has secret passages.

228
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:38,236
We added alternate ships with characters from other indie games,

229
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:39,936
like Octodance, Super Meat Boy.

230
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:44,357
And we have a DJ deck-based music player, which on PlayStation 3

231
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:48,218
is actually controllable with the DJ Hero controllers.

232
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:49,058
And then we have.

233
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:54,980
unlockable concept art, cheats, and more than I can even list.

234
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,621
So for my wife's 2012 spring break,

235
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:01,322
she wanted to go on a trip with me.

236
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,122
She works for the LA school system,

237
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:05,663
so she likes to do something fun when she's off.

238
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,104
And so her original plan was a night at a bed and breakfast.

239
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:13,597
Of course, one evening at a bed and breakfast doesn't seem like a big deal,

240
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,818
but it was right before PAX East,

241
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:18,680
and we were nearing release, at least in my mind,

242
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,421
so I was really noncommittal.

243
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:23,663
She ended up settling for an entire day out,

244
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:26,964
and eating out, and going to museums,

245
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:29,146
and these are just things we always wanted to do,

246
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:33,008
but never got a chance to because of my work schedule.

247
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:35,089
At the end of the day, she was so happy,

248
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,531
and she thanked me for such an amazing day.

249
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:43,919
At that point, I realized, what have I become?

250
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,202
I was not the person I wanted to be.

251
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,184
I never imagined that I'd be the type

252
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:52,468
of husband who would ignore his wife to work all the time.

253
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:55,311
It's definitely not how I pictured my married life.

254
00:13:56,684 --> 00:14:01,088
So we finally felt like we did everything we could to make the game successful,

255
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:02,929
and submitted it at the end of June.

256
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,711
The reviews were good.

257
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,393
We had an average of 80% on gamerankings.com.

258
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:12,458
The main complaint in the reviews were that there's only 10 songs, which

259
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,761
honestly is one of the better complaints you can have.

260
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,882
I want more.

261
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:28,903
But given the obsessive level of detail we had, there was no way we could afford to do any more content in a reasonable time frame, nor could we afford to keep funding development.

262
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:33,876
So this is the final feature list of Retrograde.

263
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:36,919
We did 1080p, 60 frames a second with antialias,

264
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,161
and someone at Sony thought that was a PlayStation 3 first.

265
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:41,462
We had dynamic lighting and shadows,

266
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:45,606
potential visibility set generator for object culling,

267
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:49,790
background streaming for all data, blah, blah, and so on,

268
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,153
and so on, and so on, and so on.

269
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:06,773
Now, with all that applause, you'd think that that was actually an accomplishment,

270
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,456
but none of that actually helped sales.

271
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:13,622
I think, actually, we may have sold less copies of the game

272
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:17,307
than there are people in this room here.

273
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:18,749
I'm kidding, but not by much.

274
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:24,429
So, the game went on sale August 21st, and, as I said,

275
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:28,555
the sales fell dramatically short of our relatively modest expectations.

276
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:32,121
I'm honestly too embarrassed to show the y-axis on the graph,

277
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:36,007
but trust me that even those peaks are low.

278
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:39,451
So the initial sales trade off quickly, and we did two sales.

279
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:42,854
This is just the PlayStation Network data we launched last week on Steam,

280
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,776
so I don't have fancy graphs for that.

281
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:48,140
But, I mean, the sales were at a larger discount,

282
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,185
and they moved more units than launch, but didn't make as much money.

283
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,148
But why didn't the game sell?

284
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:57,590
I wish I knew.

285
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,863
Any business endeavor is a risk, and of course they don't all pay off.

286
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:08,750
I mean, certainly the Kickstarter, 30%, only 30% get their funding.

287
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,013
I mean, for Retrograde, we didn't get a huge amount of press.

288
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,975
I'm surprised you people are here.

289
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:15,096
No one's even heard of the game.

290
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:21,702
But anyway, given our awards and showing off the game at PAX year after year, I thought

291
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:22,703
we would do much better.

292
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,660
So what did I learn?

293
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,822
It's really tough to come up with things

294
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,142
because it still hurts to think about.

295
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:35,884
When I do think about it, I have obsessive thoughts

296
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:39,365
about how I'm a failure and a bad game developer

297
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,705
and everything is my fault.

298
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:44,346
And honestly, those thoughts really ring true,

299
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:47,767
which makes them very difficult to block out.

300
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:50,748
However, there are several lessons that are fairly apparent.

301
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:54,132
Don't compete where you can't.

302
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:57,033
We spent a huge amount of time on our 3D rendering tech

303
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,375
and all those bullet points and graphical polish,

304
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,717
but we can't compete with AAA games and big studios

305
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:08,159
on 3D graphics quality, so it was really a bad idea to try.

306
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,160
We spent so much time on graphics,

307
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,982
both from the content side and the tech side.

308
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,383
Will this feature increase sales?

309
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:22,239
When creating something out of love, it's a bad question to ask.

310
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,800
It doesn't feel right.

311
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,682
However, if you have to make money off a project

312
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:29,063
to maintain the life you want to live,

313
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:31,544
it's something you should think about.

314
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:33,965
I'm not recommending that you compromise your vision

315
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,466
based on what you think will sell.

316
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,927
I think that's a terrible idea.

317
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,668
But I think asking yourself that question

318
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:41,529
gives you an important perspective.

319
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,831
At the very least, you can ask for feature X.

320
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:48,994
What is the net impact on the player's experience?

321
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:53,896
These questions are a good sanity check for how you should be spending your development

322
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:55,357
time.

323
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:59,520
We lost sight of this earlier in development because we wanted to make the game we never

324
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,082
got a chance to at other studios because we always had these really tight deadlines.

325
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:10,866
So this is our in-game concept art viewer, which has fancy pixel shader transition effects

326
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:13,107
and streaming JPEG decompression.

327
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,137
probably a poor use of our time.

328
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:24,264
Focusing our efforts on creating gameplay content instead of the visuals would have

329
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:27,427
allowed us to release sooner and been a better game overall.

330
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:33,133
Although I did the game design and gameplay programming, I spent much more time on graphics

331
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,555
and procedural animation and effects.

332
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:39,118
So this is an image from our Skydome system.

333
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,420
And so how it works is it projects frustums

334
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,303
on the sky sphere and then generates clipped geometry.

335
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:50,445
The idea is then the clipped geometry

336
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:54,768
is rendered with decals tied into the environment map.

337
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,951
And then it's composited in the shape pixel shader

338
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:01,713
with multi-texturing because we wanted to reduce fill rate.

339
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:05,456
Because then we basically only have to draw the sky sphere once,

340
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:09,420
and we don't have to draw separate geometry for the cards.

341
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,942
I spent about a month on it.

342
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,045
Really, we should have just gotten an artist to make more cube maps,

343
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:18,067
or been content with less details.

344
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:23,251
I mean, I don't know if you noticed the sky domes in the previous videos,

345
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,492
but I'm betting not.

346
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:31,518
I really should have been making more content, more songs for the actual game, making the

347
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:32,119
game.

348
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,704
Live the life you want to live.

349
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:41,528
Even if Retrograde were successful, I'm not sure all the sacrifices I made would have

350
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:42,329
been worth it.

351
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:46,168
The development of the game was quite frankly miserable,

352
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:50,611
and it put a huge strain on my marriage right as it was beginning.

353
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:53,052
I'm now trying to work 40 hours a week,

354
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:57,974
and I quite honestly feel like I'm getting to know my wife for the first time,

355
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:00,536
which is pathetic and sad.

356
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:05,218
I feel immensely guilty for putting her through the development of Retrograde,

357
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:07,939
and while she was very supportive and patient,

358
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:11,061
that wasn't something she should have had to put up with.

359
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,922
So, this is more of the Mobius proposal, and I did all the art, programming, music, and

360
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:20,383
everything, and that worked pretty well.

361
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:25,464
It's not the best looking game, as you can tell, but I managed to come up with an art

362
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:30,526
style that I could deliver on with my limited 3D modeling skills.

363
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:35,387
Unfortunately, in Retrograde, we didn't get the people we needed, or designed for the

364
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:36,468
people we had.

365
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,531
We lost our artist early on and had little success

366
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,454
finding a contractor that could create the content we wanted.

367
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:46,296
We should have switched the art style to be more abstract

368
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:49,618
and then committed to procedural graphics.

369
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:53,281
We ended up building the tech to do completely artist-driven content,

370
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:55,503
but it was after we already wasted a lot of time

371
00:20:55,503 --> 00:21:00,086
trying to do these pseudo-realistic graphics procedurally.

372
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,927
Well, duh.

373
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,589
I'm sure you're all saying these mistakes seem obvious.

374
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:05,930
Why is that guy even up here?

375
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,332
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

376
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,962
Well, the real question is, why did we fall down this path?

377
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:14,423
And I have a few ideas.

378
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:18,085
I don't think AAA development methodologies adapt well

379
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:19,386
on the small scale.

380
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:23,708
I worked on a number of projects at supposed AAA studios,

381
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:27,630
you know, doing the big budget titles.

382
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,251
And I thought, oh man, I'm going to kick ass as an indie

383
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,832
because I have all this experience.

384
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:33,453
But like.

385
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,055
I don't think the mindset was right.

386
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:40,198
So this is a directory map of our insane code base.

387
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,921
We built out all these systems and modules to create this engine

388
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:46,743
that was supposed to be used for future games,

389
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:50,086
but honestly we probably won't use the engine again

390
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:52,227
because the game was unsuccessful,

391
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,489
and really I'm trying to focus now on creating games

392
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:58,312
that are easier to make content for.

393
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:00,394
So all of this effort was a waste.

394
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:06,790
We really should have focused on the minimum effort to get this project done.

395
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,895
If we succeeded, then we should have started worrying about the next one.

396
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:14,119
It sounds silly to say don't plan for the long term,

397
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,525
but if you don't know if there is a long term, it makes a lot of sense.

398
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,678
So polish matters.

399
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:26,761
I think most successful games deliver a really polished experience.

400
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:31,764
And we recognize the importance of polish, but we went way overboard.

401
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:33,985
So this is a video of the final boss.

402
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:38,287
The iris on his eye is hinged like a proper mechanical iris.

403
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:41,549
But of course you can't tell because it's like 10 pixels, even at 1080p.

404
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,472
He makes a number of expressions throughout the boss battle.

405
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:54,480
I thought they gave the boss some personality, but no one has ever mentioned these animations

406
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,623
in any review or fan tweets.

407
00:22:57,623 --> 00:23:01,085
I'm really betting no one ever noticed.

408
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:03,167
Why did we go so overboard?

409
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:08,532
I think partially because it was our baby, partially because we completely lost sight

410
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:14,937
of the business aspect, and we really felt like making a great game was the key to success,

411
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,598
but that isn't enough anymore.

412
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,860
We never re-evaluated our decisions.

413
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,360
When we started going down an avenue,

414
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,721
that was how we saw the game.

415
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:26,881
We never took a step back to try and figure out

416
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:31,462
what we could achieve the same gameplay in an easier way.

417
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:33,743
In hindsight, I wish we would have made the game in 2D.

418
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:36,543
I think it would have looked better

419
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:39,204
and finished way earlier.

420
00:23:39,204 --> 00:23:41,645
We began building 3D tech because...

421
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:44,706
We felt like we had a lot of computer graphic skills,

422
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:47,427
and we could differentiate ourselves from other indies.

423
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,607
But once we decided on Retrograde,

424
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:52,348
we never stopped and said, hey, the game's in 2D.

425
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:55,009
Why don't we make it in 2D?

426
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:57,790
Instead, we decided to do 1080p, 60 frames a second

427
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:02,392
with anti-aliasing instead of 720p like everyone else.

428
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:05,253
It required a ton of optimization and engine work

429
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:06,153
to pull off.

430
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,515
It contributed to our enormous code base, which, of course,

431
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:10,915
makes porting more daunting.

432
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:16,471
We get a lot of requests for a Vita port, but like, bringing the game to any new platform

433
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:22,978
is very difficult because of the immense code base and its complexity.

434
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,180
So what's next?

435
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:29,305
Justin Wilder, the other remaining founder of 24K Games, left and got a full-time gig.

436
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:33,385
I'm still trying to find balance in my life.

437
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:37,205
I don't want to neglect my responsibilities to my family.

438
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:41,166
I want to work reasonable hours and spend time with my wife.

439
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:45,647
And realistically, I need to start getting paid for work.

440
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:51,688
I'm hoping to do another indie game and apply the lessons I've learned,

441
00:24:51,688 --> 00:24:53,789
but I'm not sure I can afford to.

442
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:58,490
Retrograde has not been profitable, and perhaps there's hope on PC, but...

443
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,651
I've kind of lost my confidence.

444
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:05,533
And, you know, certainly getting money for a project

445
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:08,295
at the beginning is tricky, and I took lots of notes

446
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:12,338
at the Kickstarter presentation, but hopefully I'll be able

447
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:16,461
to continue living my dream of being an indie developer.

448
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:21,844
But I, it may not be possible to balance my life

449
00:25:21,844 --> 00:25:23,545
and have the career I want, which.

450
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:28,250
is unfortunate, but that just may be in the cards for me.

451
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,292
So hopefully that's not.

452
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:30,833
Fingers crossed.

453
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,215
So thank you for listening.

454
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,538
I really appreciate your time.

455
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:36,840
I hope you found this helpful.

456
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,982
Does anyone have any questions?

457
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:39,462
I have time.

458
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:39,583
So.

459
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:54,029
Does that work?

460
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:54,210
Sorry.

461
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,390
Sorry to interrupt, but I have an announcement to make.

462
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,031
It will be short.

463
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:03,132
When you started the conference, most people didn't

464
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:03,732
leave the room.

465
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:06,612
So if you could please let us scan your badges on your way

466
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:09,893
out, so you can receive the survey and fill it up.

467
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:12,674
It's important to us and to the speaker, too.

468
00:26:12,674 --> 00:26:15,734
So please, there will be three exits, and you will be asked

469
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:18,095
to have your badges scanned.

470
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:18,755
So that's it.

471
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:20,416
Now you can go back to the questions.

472
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,236
So we can do questions or no?

473
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:27,669
Okay, cool, questions, go for it.

474
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,749
First off, thank you so much.

475
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:33,032
That was really raw and intense and I don't know about everybody else, but that was, I

476
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:37,094
really appreciate you being that honest and frank about that.

477
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,912
I, uh, my Steam login doesn't work for some reason.

478
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:45,994
I was just about to buy the game right now, but I assure you when I get home I'll be buying

479
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:48,235
the game on Steam, because there's no question.

480
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:49,956
I played it at all the different PAXs and things.

481
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:52,237
I really appreciated when you guys did the shirt promo.

482
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:52,877
I still have mine.

483
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:59,602
But I guess what I want to say, I just interviewed Andy Schatz, who's been working on Monaco now for three and a half years,

484
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:05,807
and he had a lot of similar things, a lot of, this should have been simpler, I should, but he wanted a lot of ownership,

485
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:13,693
and I think what you're talking about is not isolated, I think a lot of developers in the indie space want to own the code,

486
00:27:13,693 --> 00:27:15,755
want to, had AAA experience and moved on, so...

487
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:21,380
I guess I just appreciate your specific insight and just want to let you know at the very least someone else I talked to

488
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,984
Had a very similar raw experience of dealing with the new marriage while making a game and all that sort of stuff

489
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:27,545
You're not alone out there. Keep it up

490
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:33,790
I hope that the next project you have is that perfect balance of your creativity and getting paid. Thanks again

491
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:41,397
Well, thank you very much

492
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:43,258
Thanks a third time

493
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:48,837
So that gigantic code base that you're probably never going to use, is that headed to the

494
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:50,738
graveyard or would you consider sharing?

495
00:27:50,738 --> 00:28:00,000
Honestly, I don't think I would wish it on anyone because, like, it's, I mean, we did

496
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,741
some really unique technical stuff that's very applicable to retrograde.

497
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:08,861
So if you want to make a game exactly like retrograde...

498
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:12,306
then, well, it's still incredibly complicated,

499
00:28:12,306 --> 00:28:14,809
but it'll do retrograde really well.

500
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:18,893
But, like, anything else, I mean, like,

501
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:22,457
I don't think it's really helpful to anyone, unfortunately.

502
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:27,155
Hey, the game looked really great.

503
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:29,276
I've played before and it was really awesome.

504
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:32,678
And I know you took it to PAX and you got feedback on it.

505
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,439
I was just wondering at any point,

506
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,240
did you consider bringing a producer on?

507
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,302
Like, you know, maintaining control and everything yourself,

508
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,302
but I know you got play testing

509
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,043
and you would have gotten feedback from that

510
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:44,023
as to what people wanted.

511
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,784
I was wondering if you'd ever consider,

512
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:47,345
or if you consider in the future bringing...

513
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:50,647
bringing an external producer on or someone you knew

514
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:54,688
or some friend to just sanity check the sort of stuff

515
00:28:54,688 --> 00:28:56,569
that I just know I find it really handy in my stuff

516
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,710
to get other people to come and tell me

517
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,252
that I really shouldn't be spending ages on this feature

518
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:01,992
that no one's gonna see.

519
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,873
Well, I mean, it's tough because we wanted

520
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:06,914
to make the game for ourselves.

521
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,175
We wanted to do everything the way we wanted

522
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:12,537
because at studios, I don't know how many people,

523
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:14,558
has anyone worked at like a AAA studio

524
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:16,219
or worked for someone else?

525
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:16,519
Show of hands.

526
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,810
How many people worked there, had a bad decision,

527
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,651
forced down their throats, and there was nothing

528
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:23,852
they could do about it?

529
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:27,395
So I would have expected a few more hands,

530
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:28,897
but you guys are lucky.

531
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:31,799
But I mean, it's a lot of times, you know,

532
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,601
people say this is the way we're doing it.

533
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:38,446
their reasoning may not make sense to you,

534
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:39,807
it may not make sense at all,

535
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:41,248
but you just have to deal with it.

536
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,770
And so with retrograde, we're like, yes,

537
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,192
we're free of the bonds, we're free of the shackles,

538
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:49,214
but then we wasted our freedom on.

539
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:56,016
obsessing on all these details. So, no, it never entered into our heads that we should

540
00:29:56,016 --> 00:30:00,478
bring anyone else on, that we should consult people. It was just like, this is our baby,

541
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:06,180
this is what we have to do. We need to finish it, and we need to finish it our way. Which

542
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,421
is stupid, if you didn't catch the gist of the talk.

543
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:33,015
Uh, hi, I wanted to say thanks, uh, for sharing and for, uh, to provide some context, I, uh, also suffer from severe OCD, and I have that regular struggle when I'm making a game that I'll, I'll know I'm spending way too much time on a feature that no one else is gonna care about or even notice.

544
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:41,502
And so it's great to just know that someone else is out there who struggles with that same thing.

545
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:49,368
And as far as the question goes, I wonder, moving forward, since it is a continuing struggle,

546
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:57,736
how you feel you are going to learn from that experience and approach finding that balance in a new way,

547
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:59,077
now that you have that behind you?

548
00:30:59,077 --> 00:31:00,258
Well, I mean, certainly...

549
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:06,392
I mean, it's tough. It's a struggle. I, I think everything in life is a struggle, right?

550
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:13,413
It's not just me with obsessive compulsive disorder. It's not just certain people with

551
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:18,075
problems. Everyone struggles with development. Game development is hard. And certainly, if

552
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:23,956
you listen to any talks today, I think you would get that message. But I think with all

553
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:27,217
your experience and every time you do it, you know, you.

554
00:31:27,577 --> 00:31:33,581
take something from it, and certainly I've taken a lot from it, like, you know, I have to be

555
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:39,405
hypervigilant that I'm not wasting time. And, you know, it's really tough, because polish matters.

556
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:46,730
You know, sometimes those details really make the difference between, you know, a 90 or an 80, and

557
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:52,534
I can't say I have a formula, but certainly I at least have some perspective that doing

558
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:56,956
things that no one will ever notice is probably not a good usage of time.

559
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:00,598
So I hope that answers your question.

560
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:03,759
I wish I had better answers than that.

561
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,260
Thanks.

562
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,001
Okay, last question, but I'll be out in the hall if anyone wants to ask more.

563
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:10,022
Quick question.

564
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:11,042
What happened to your hat?

565
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:20,626
Well, so, the story behind that is one of the things with 24KaratGames is I tried to do branding.

566
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:25,769
So I tried to dress crazy. I had like a gold miners hat with a light on it.

567
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:32,094
And then, you know, I would do all these events in this gold miner persona.

568
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:32,614
But like...

569
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:38,199
Part of the problem is 24 karat games is sort of dead, because it's just me.

570
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:45,464
So like, I mean, even moving forward, I don't know if I can create games as 24 karat games

571
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,946
because I don't have 100% ownership in the company.

572
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:52,890
So I may have to retire the poor miner.

573
00:32:54,667 --> 00:33:00,010
But also, I mean, besides getting the right color shirt for the video recording, which

574
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:06,873
they're very specific about, I wanted to give this talk as myself, if that makes any sense.

575
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:07,133
I don't know.

576
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:11,815
I mean, certainly when I did the minor thing, I tried to have this very positive, you know,

577
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:16,158
buyer game, it's great, I'm a salesman, which takes a lot of energy.

578
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:22,141
I don't know, maybe it's just me, but like, oh my gosh, like, PAX and doing that salesman

579
00:33:22,141 --> 00:33:22,321
thing.

580
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:23,821
Killer!

581
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:25,742
I'm just so drained, like, every day.

582
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:27,042
Like, oh my gosh.

583
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:30,623
So this is me, the regular me.

584
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,844
Hopefully, hopefully I can still put on a good show.

585
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,964
Thank you so much for your time.

586
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:34,184
And I'll be...

587
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:35,524
Regular you is awesome.

588
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:37,725
Regular you is awesome.

589
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:38,425
That's what you're about.

590
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:40,646
Thank you.

591
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:40,846
Thank you.

592
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:41,026
Thank you.

593
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:41,246
Thank you.

594
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:41,486
Thank you.

595
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:41,746
Thank you.

596
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:42,046
Thank you.

597
00:33:42,046 --> 00:33:42,506
Thank you.

598
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:42,826
Thank you.

599
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:43,106
Thank you.

600
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:43,426
Thank you.

601
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:44,066
Thank you.
