1
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:06,277
Hi.

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:10,442
I wasn't expecting feedback, thanks.

3
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:12,364
That's the talk, everyone, we're done.

4
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:13,866
Okay.

5
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:16,809
Welcome to Embracing the Co-op Studio Model in Indie Games,

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,690
featuring us.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,232
We have a different slide, there you go.

8
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:23,839
Today we're going to just talk about worker cooperatives.

9
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:26,541
Show of hands, how many people know what a worker cooperative is?

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,304
That is way more than I thought, so that's great.

11
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:34,747
At the start of this, we're going to, the format of this, we're going to give you a

12
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:41,132
really very, very, very basic 101 on just what co-ops are, and then we're going to each

13
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:45,315
share our experiences of how our co-ops came to be, how they're set up.

14
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:47,224
kind of the ups and downs of that,

15
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:49,045
and then we're gonna do some Q&A at the end.

16
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,206
But at the beginning of this,

17
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:51,847
we're just gonna dash through some really quick,

18
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,969
like the elevator pitch of what a co-op is.

19
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,231
So what is a worker cooperative?

20
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:59,593
There's a lot of different aspects to them,

21
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:01,194
but if you wanted to boil them way down

22
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:04,016
to some very like core shared ideas,

23
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,117
it's a business that's owned, operated,

24
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:07,779
and controlled democratically by its workers

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,200
who share in the profits of their labor.

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,001
You can already see how that's very different

27
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:12,642
than probably a lot of the places you've worked.

28
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:17,765
These are businesses where decisions, all decisions are made democratically.

29
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:23,128
People discuss their salaries and work these things out together.

30
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,110
There is, you share in the profits of your labor, meaning that there's not

31
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,832
some, like, there's not someone like way over your head that's sucking up kind

32
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:35,895
of all the surplus value leftover from your labor, you know, after you get paid.

33
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:39,940
a lot of that money that you make goes up the chain.

34
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:44,666
And worker cooperatives, everyone is sharing in that

35
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:48,210
and discussing kind of democratically how that's working,

36
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,632
how those things are distributed,

37
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:51,475
which leads to a lot of co-ops

38
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:53,838
having very egalitarian pay structures.

39
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:56,133
and revenue share and that kind of thing.

40
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:59,735
There's a lot of ways of organizing worker cooperatives

41
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,837
from very, like everyone just sits around a table

42
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:02,677
and like talks.

43
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:04,898
Some larger ones have more,

44
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,661
a structure where there are managers of certain,

45
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:11,122
you know, there's like boards of directors and stuff

46
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:14,524
that are elected by the workers involved.

47
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:16,705
But it comes down to an idea of one person, one vote.

48
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,127
So it's not like your art lead has five votes

49
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:22,529
and someone working on like environment art has like one.

50
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,251
or something when it comes to these larger decisions.

51
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:30,214
So it's just kind of this democratic sort of setup.

52
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:32,675
And I think Bethany's gonna tell us

53
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,016
a little bit about the history.

54
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:40,886
All right, so cooperative societies have always existed.

55
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,928
It's basically just a group of folks working together

56
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:45,629
to get through life.

57
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,651
But worker co-ops as we recognize them

58
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:51,653
started more during the Industrial Revolution.

59
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,194
It's mainly just started by workers

60
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,775
who are trying to protect themselves,

61
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:59,458
either physically from unsafe working conditions.

62
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:03,339
their actual jobs, their skilled craftsmen,

63
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,579
they're just worried about the new machines coming in

64
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,320
and them being replaced with unskilled laborers.

65
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,041
And just your livelihoods, wages going down,

66
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:15,942
and you're not able to afford rents or basic necessities.

67
00:03:16,982 --> 00:03:18,583
This was around the time when there was a,

68
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,003
you could start to see the vast inequality

69
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,064
between the bosses and workers,

70
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:25,685
and all of that exploitation that was happening.

71
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,265
So they were just coming up with new.

72
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:32,053
techniques to try to get together and survive.

73
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:35,775
And yeah, over the next couple centuries,

74
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,096
they grew and expanded all over the world.

75
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:41,958
They kind of are just empower workers

76
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:44,219
to democratically own and run their own workplaces.

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,042
Usually, they have a focus on serving their local communities

78
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:54,625
because kind of what regular companies can or won't do.

79
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,596
Yeah, and then often during times of large scale crises of labor and economics, there's

80
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:05,499
kind of another burst of co-ops that kind of come up.

81
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,825
And I think like today, that's what we're currently witnessing, like a growing wave

82
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:17,171
of like worker organization, unionization, kind of more interest in starting co-ops.

83
00:04:17,271 --> 00:04:19,413
And this panel is kind of part of that.

84
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,720
So yeah, we're kind of in a spot.

85
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,501
I should probably get up on the mic before I start talking.

86
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:26,882
We're kind of in a spot right now.

87
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:28,783
Just even the fact that this panel is happening

88
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:31,084
is kind of because we're in part of this moment, right?

89
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:32,625
Where there's more unionization,

90
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:34,386
there's more organization kind of happening

91
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:37,407
because we're in kind of a difficult time

92
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:38,368
in a lot of ways.

93
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:39,888
So that's cool.

94
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,269
It's cool to be here in this room

95
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:42,390
and be like, oh, we're in one of those.

96
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,038
One of those moments right now.

97
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,840
Okay, so I talked a little bit about,

98
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,961
I alluded a bit to how co-op structures

99
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:52,183
are a little different than your structures

100
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:54,325
you may be used to in other kinds of businesses.

101
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:56,026
Now, I've created two slides,

102
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,527
and they're pretty complicated,

103
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,068
because business is complicated.

104
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:01,709
So just bear with me, we're gonna get through it.

105
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,530
There's a lot of moving parts of this, okay?

106
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:04,831
Okay.

107
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:06,652
So.

108
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:10,575
I know there's multiple circles on there,

109
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:11,775
so I'll try to walk you through it.

110
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:16,902
This is a very, very, very basic breakdown of how this would work.

111
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,809
Now a boss could be a whole team of bosses, it could be shareholders, it's all these people

112
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,973
up here who are making these decisions, right?

113
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:25,754
And then there's workers kind of below.

114
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:28,757
And your company could be really cool.

115
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:31,039
You could be like, oh yeah, but like my boss,

116
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,540
we get together and talk things out.

117
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,743
And they take a lot of our opinions on board.

118
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,486
We like to think of ourselves as a family and a community

119
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:39,907
and all that kind of stuff.

120
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,008
However, at the end of the day,

121
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:43,410
your boss has that power, right?

122
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:45,512
Like there are people that are not you

123
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:47,314
and not like you don't have...

124
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:53,544
very much say in what your schedule is, how much you're paid, that kind of thing usually.

125
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,549
The expectations are not being set by the workers.

126
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,752
The expectations are being set by someone else.

127
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:04,872
And what worker co-ops do is kind of upend that entire thing

128
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:06,974
where there aren't bosses anymore.

129
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:10,037
Or rather, everyone's a boss, or everyone's not a boss.

130
00:06:10,198 --> 00:06:12,520
That whole distinction kind of fades away.

131
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,841
There are still people who do things

132
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:17,245
like the administrative tasks that you would associate

133
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:18,586
with someone who's kind of at the top.

134
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:19,907
of a company.

135
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:23,912
Like, there are tasks that still need to get done, but they're getting done by every, you

136
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:27,396
know, by your fellow worker as opposed to your boss.

137
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:34,584
You make decisions about hours, deadlines, salaries, all kinds of just things.

138
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:38,789
And it does, and we'll probably all talk about this a little bit in our own way, it changes

139
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:40,671
the dynamic of how you work together.

140
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:42,973
in a way beyond, because like I said, a lot of companies,

141
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,434
particularly a lot of companies in the games industry,

142
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,196
are like, but we're just a big family here,

143
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:48,358
we all just have so much passion, and we're working together

144
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:50,900
and that's great, why not a structure

145
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,702
that actually makes you, you know,

146
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:57,166
so, you know, a community where you are working together.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,642
and not just saying that in that sort of way.

148
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:06,303
So why go work a cooperative if you're kind of starting

149
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:09,964
a studio or you already are one and you maybe want

150
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:11,184
to migrate into doing that?

151
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:13,685
There's shared control and ownership of the workplace

152
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:14,806
and the products of your labor,

153
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,046
and that's kind of a big thing.

154
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:19,907
There's not like one rockstar developer at the top of it.

155
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:24,149
no pun intended, who is getting a lot of the credit for it,

156
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:24,789
necessarily.

157
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:28,311
You can actually, as a group of people, go like, yeah,

158
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:29,571
we did this.

159
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:33,313
We all share in this success in a way

160
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:38,135
that you just simply can't in a more standard, top-down

161
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:39,215
structure.

162
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:41,476
There's greater accountability and participation.

163
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,837
There's greater accountability because you

164
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,118
have to talk about stuff.

165
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,442
If you're making a decision in a healthy co-op that's running, you have to get together and

166
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:52,044
talk and you have to vote.

167
00:07:52,965 --> 00:08:00,371
We vote in a Slack, we each have a little thumbs up button and stuff, or over Google

168
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:01,072
Chat or whatever.

169
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:04,935
You have to participate and you have that accountability for that reason in a way that

170
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:06,116
you simply don't.

171
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:09,661
in a more hierarchical top-down structure.

172
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,704
There's greater job security relative

173
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:12,865
to top-down businesses.

174
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,988
You are still dealing with selling games,

175
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,230
trying to make it through,

176
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,613
like this doesn't obviate all those problems or anything.

177
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:20,936
However, you are probably making decisions

178
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:24,281
that are based on you all trying to not.

179
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:27,483
have to lay yourselves off, basically.

180
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:29,984
Since all the workers are coming together

181
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:32,224
to make these decisions, you're less likely to be like,

182
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:33,224
okay, well, we're done with the game.

183
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,585
Half of you leave now, because you just kind of

184
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:39,086
can't necessarily easily do that,

185
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:42,267
which has its own ups and downs, but it's just different.

186
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,308
There's more equal share of profits,

187
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:46,529
because you are talking about that and negotiating that.

188
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:47,570
This kind of goes without saying.

189
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,652
Studies show that there's an increased quality of life

190
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:52,573
at work, and people are kind of more invested in it

191
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,314
because they feel like a sense of ownership.

192
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:56,416
They're not just working at a place.

193
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,277
They are part of a thing that they

194
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,358
are building and maintaining.

195
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:02,980
And there's a real sense of community

196
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,221
and kind of emotional support.

197
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,803
And a lot of these things, or that's often the case,

198
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,005
because you are getting together and making these.

199
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:16,844
collective decisions and sharing responsibilities and sharing the ups and downs of that kind

200
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:17,965
of amongst yourself.

201
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:22,830
And there's a last thing is you're not depending on the benevolence of an owner or an employer

202
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,732
for everything I just said, right?

203
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,335
Like, you know, you could have the coolest boss ever, but like they could go and get

204
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:32,580
like the rabies virus and 28 days later, like over the weekend, and then it doesn't matter

205
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,842
how cool your boss was on Friday, they're still your boss.

206
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:40,584
And you don't have to rely on just the whims of one person

207
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:44,665
or some people up here to make all these decisions

208
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:50,246
for how your workspace will be and what you put into it

209
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:50,846
and take out of it.

210
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:53,007
And there's a lot of, like I said,

211
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:56,027
there's a lot of conversation right now about unionization,

212
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,008
worker organization, all kinds of stuff.

213
00:09:58,048 --> 00:09:58,728
And that's awesome.

214
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:02,289
And worker cooperators fit into this in different ways.

215
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,550
We're giving power and ownership directly to workers.

216
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,932
You know, unions exist to bring workers together

217
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:12,574
so that they can have a greater leverage

218
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:14,535
versus the bosses, right?

219
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,119
There's that kind of inherent sort of dynamic there.

220
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,580
Whereas in co-ops, we're just kind of I guess,

221
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,281
skipping to just not having bosses to begin with.

222
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,462
We kind of point to horizons beyond what we're told

223
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,142
to expect as workers.

224
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:34,223
I think a lot of people hear about all this,

225
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:35,743
you know, unions and everything, but co-ops,

226
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:37,343
and they're like, oh, like co-ops aren't new,

227
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:38,964
but they're new to a lot of people.

228
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:41,404
So it's just like, oh, we can make new things.

229
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:43,045
There might be better ways of doing this.

230
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:44,906
history hasn't ended.

231
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:50,793
And we can also stand in solidarity with other workers who are fighting for power.

232
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:57,681
Because we have an understanding of, yeah, we wanted to create less exploitative structures,

233
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:02,086
we can recognize and maybe stand in solidarity with other people who are trying to create.

234
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,447
less exploitative structures in their own industries.

235
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,908
And also, there are unionized co-ops,

236
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,088
there are co-ops that work with unions.

237
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:09,328
There's all kinds of interplays

238
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,668
with how these things work together,

239
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,329
which is pretty cool.

240
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:13,789
This is all just really exciting,

241
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,369
and these things exist a lot elsewhere.

242
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:17,450
In the US, this is like,

243
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,670
I guess saying this is like lost knowledge almost,

244
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,910
just because it was suppressed.

245
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:25,091
But it's building right now, and it's really exciting.

246
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,292
So we each come to our work as cooperatives

247
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:28,092
in very different ways.

248
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:29,592
We're all very different in how we're set up,

249
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:30,372
and with our different,

250
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,741
assumptions and how we run things and where we're from.

251
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:36,903
And it's just like any other kind of business.

252
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:39,545
And I think we're all going to share a little bit about that

253
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,707
right now, starting with Ted from PixelPushers.

254
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:44,149
I didn't do the introductions for everyone.

255
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,029
I'm really sorry.

256
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,411
I'm Scott from the Glory Society.

257
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:52,054
Yeah, that's me.

258
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:53,735
Hi, I'm Ted.

259
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,217
I'm from PixelPushersUnion512.

260
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:56,798
I'm Ian.

261
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:57,578
I'm from Tailspinners.

262
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,914
I'm Steve, I'm from Motion Twin, we made Dead Cells.

263
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:04,176
And I'm Bethany, I'm also from Glory Society.

264
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,398
Yeah. Alright, now Ted.

265
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:07,278
Alright.

266
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,742
So, as I said, I'm from Pixel Pushers Union 512,

267
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:16,284
and we are a worker-owned game development team.

268
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:22,925
I'm the artist on the staff and we are currently working on a game called Tonight We Riot.

269
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:26,087
So if you've heard of that, I'm the one who made all the pretty pixels.

270
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,750
Anyways, so I've been doing games for a long time.

271
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:36,194
I got hired real young into the industry and without naming names of places that I've been,

272
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,796
I've been doing it almost 20 years.

273
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:39,697
So I've seen...

274
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:46,133
you know, benefits go away, I've seen paid internships go away,

275
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:49,995
I've seen Crunch become something that was just kind

276
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:52,696
of like it happens occasionally to something that's actually

277
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,017
planned, which just blows my mind.

278
00:12:57,118 --> 00:13:00,440
And so with all that in mind, after doing this for so long,

279
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,522
you know, I figured there's got to be a better way to do this,

280
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:07,843
you know, instead of looking for jobs every two to three years.

281
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:14,909
and kind of like what Scott said, being at the whims of either shareholders or, you know,

282
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,531
the top brass at any given studio.

283
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,679
it would be interesting to try something new.

284
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,460
And I've always been a big fan of history.

285
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,280
And so what Scott was talking about,

286
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,681
like the idea of a suppressed history in the United States,

287
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:34,362
I started looking into different ways of doing things.

288
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:38,823
And I ran across a group from roughly 100 years ago.

289
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:42,544
How many people here are familiar with the IWW,

290
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:43,164
the Wobblies?

291
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:47,105
Wow, that's really cool that I saw so many hands go up.

292
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,183
Well, I was watching a documentary about the Wobblies,

293
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,403
and it just struck a nerve.

294
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,564
I was watching it, and I was like, this is great.

295
00:13:56,204 --> 00:14:00,345
The idea of workers owning the means of production, the idea

296
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:04,687
of working collaboratively in a democratic way to achieve

297
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:05,567
whatever your goals are.

298
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:09,948
And there was a line, it was a quote, that one of the workers

299
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:13,609
said when they were confronted by a group of hastily

300
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:17,110
deputized drunks, where they called out and they said, who

301
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,750
are your leaders?

302
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:20,038
And I said, we're all leaders here.

303
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,319
And I've always taken that to heart.

304
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:25,540
So at Pixel Pushers, we're all leaders.

305
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,761
And no one's in control of everything except for us.

306
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:33,202
And so when we vote on things, even though I'm the one who

307
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:37,483
kind of got the ball rolling, I get outvoted pretty

308
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:38,603
routinely, which is great.

309
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:39,644
It's very liberating.

310
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:43,885
So with that in mind, that's kind of what we

311
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,205
call shop democracy.

312
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:48,066
So inside our shop, we are democratic.

313
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:53,181
We vote on major things to do with the game and major things

314
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:53,841
to do with the team.

315
00:14:54,303 --> 00:14:56,444
So we even voted on me being here today.

316
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:57,224
And I'm here.

317
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:58,424
So obviously that worked out.

318
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,366
But it's also good because even as a small team, especially

319
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:06,047
if you guys are indie devs out there and you've got your

320
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:09,248
small team, it's kind of good to start with best practices

321
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,128
going forward.

322
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:14,529
And we started talking about, OK, so if Tonight We Ride is

323
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:18,491
successful and we become self-propelled, how do we want

324
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:19,551
to handle things in the future?

325
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:20,251
Should we grow?

326
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,581
talking about democratic management, the idea of voting

327
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:28,923
your managers into position as a means to kind of separate

328
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:33,205
the idea of salary and management, and the idea of

329
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:36,387
separating management from workers would kind of go by

330
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:36,988
the wayside.

331
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:38,909
Because if you're just voting amongst yourselves in your

332
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:42,631
department, and there's no salary linking you to that

333
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:45,332
management position, you're probably going to be less

334
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:47,873
concerned with holding on to that power than you are of

335
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:48,854
being a good manager.

336
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:51,747
So if someone's not a good manager and they're not

337
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:54,329
comfortable with it even, it helps both sides.

338
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:57,030
So if someone wants to step down from management, they

339
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,650
totally can.

340
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,950
If they're not doing a good job, the

341
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,791
workers can vote them out.

342
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:01,471
Easy peasy.

343
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:08,814
So like I said, we're working on Tonight We Riot.

344
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:11,695
And I'm a big believer in the idea that the personal is the

345
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:14,737
political, that everything about our lives cannot be

346
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:17,858
separated from the context of the lives we live and the

347
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:19,118
lives of other people around us.

348
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,899
So with that in mind, I decided to make a game

349
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:26,001
that was about workers' liberation

350
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:28,623
and really use that as a means

351
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:31,226
to propel the ideas of our studio.

352
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:32,407
And it doesn't mean that like every game

353
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:34,589
we're ever gonna make is gonna be politically motivated,

354
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:36,971
but this one is kind of especially so.

355
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:44,238
But, you know, it's kind of like,

356
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,412
No matter what you're making, you're going to be making it

357
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:50,174
based on the experiences you've had, the upbringing

358
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:53,115
you've had, the place where you live, and the culture and

359
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,156
society you live in.

360
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:57,618
And so with that in mind, we really wanted to push those

361
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:58,699
ideas with our game.

362
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,821
And we also think that it's a better way to develop.

363
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,343
We have a lot of efficiency and flexibility.

364
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,124
There's no real taboos.

365
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:09,385
There's no worrying about whether or not your manager is

366
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,027
going to handle being questioned, or your boss is

367
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,768
going to deal with the idea of a subordinate.

368
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:19,323
you know, raising a hand in a meeting. Uh, everyone has a voice, but also everyone has

369
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:23,448
accountability too. So there's no one who's, you know, kind of a sacred cow at the, uh,

370
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:27,613
company that can't be questioned or, you know, that their word is law. Uh,

371
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:32,834
And also on top of that, it's lower development costs.

372
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:34,856
Now this changes from studio to studio, but with the way

373
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:38,218
that we work, our team, we all start with the same base

374
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:40,860
salary, and then depending on the game that you're working

375
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,542
on, everybody gets an equal share of the

376
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,663
profits from that game.

377
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:49,547
So no one's making a huge hand over fist amount over anybody

378
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:50,328
else in the studio.

379
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:53,959
And that works out quite well,

380
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:56,741
because you're not having to pay for a C-suite

381
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,143
of executives at the top of the company,

382
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:01,384
or making sure that a certain percentage of the profits

383
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:02,725
go to a group of shareholders.

384
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:05,587
It goes right back into the hands and pockets

385
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,388
of the people who actually made the game.

386
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:10,670
So, yeah, it kind of covers

387
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,831
a fair distribution of profits.

388
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:13,172
And oh, and there we go.

389
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,052
And that's pretty much it.

390
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:16,674
So I'm gonna lead on over to Motion Twim,

391
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:17,995
with Steven here.

392
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:19,356
Thanks all.

393
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:27,037
Thank you, that was cool.

394
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:31,059
So as I briefly mentioned earlier on,

395
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:32,619
I'm from Motion Twins.

396
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,539
We're based in France.

397
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,280
Motion Twins been around since 2001.

398
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,761
Functioning as a workers' cooperative since then.

399
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:42,822
Officially sort of legally set up as a workers' cooperative

400
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:43,622
a little bit after that.

401
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:47,183
And we made the game Dead Cells, which hopefully some of you

402
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:47,683
might have heard of.

403
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:51,784
So yeah, our logo is a red star.

404
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:57,406
As you can see, that's a little screenshot of our old website which was kind of steeped

405
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:00,887
in constructivism and very much that mentality.

406
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:05,608
So just a little bit of a disclosure, I'm going to be the black sheep of this talk.

407
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:11,610
I wanted to talk about some of the complications of running a workers' cooperative and some

408
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,630
of the hard parts about it.

409
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:20,135
being directly in confrontation or in discussion with your fellow man or woman at all times.

410
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,478
So, you know, Motion Twin is kind of like the classic start up story, you know, but with

411
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:32,661
communists. It was just a bunch of dudes making video games together and they were like, man,

412
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:35,142
this is awesome. We love making video games. And they started making money from it and

413
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:38,083
they were like, hmm, okay, well, we're going to have to pay taxes because, you know, the

414
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:38,623
government exists.

415
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:44,926
So we need a legal structure to handle that. So they set up a company and a standard corporation

416
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:49,448
in France comes with a whole bunch of implications in terms of how you actually distribute power.

417
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,609
Someone has to be a manager. There actually has to be someone who is legally responsible

418
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,129
in that person.

419
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,845
well, they have their heads on the line.

420
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,187
And so that comes with all kinds of complications.

421
00:19:58,508 --> 00:20:00,189
However, in France, there's something cool called

422
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:03,390
the SCOP, Societe Cooperative d'Ouvrier de Production,

423
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,113
so basically a workers' cooperative in French.

424
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:13,116
And that actually allows you to have an official, recognized

425
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:15,217
by the state, legal structure that

426
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:17,699
sort of perpetuates the existence of this workers'

427
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,079
cooperative.

428
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,409
And so we went down that path.

429
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,930
Obviously when I say we, not me.

430
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,531
I was probably like 12 when they did that.

431
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:27,773
So it's managed to survive.

432
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,834
And I think there's a couple of reasons for that.

433
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,736
I think one of the major strong points over Scott

434
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:39,259
is that it really pushes the bar in terms of what we do.

435
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,660
So because everyone has the right

436
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,961
to have a say on absolutely everything,

437
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,143
me being like the marketing and business dude,

438
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:47,703
I can come and.

439
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:50,765
say to the game play programmer who's sitting around here somewhere

440
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:54,346
that what he just did sucks and that I think we should change it.

441
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:59,468
But that can be difficult in the sense that sometimes you can get, okay if there's

442
00:20:59,528 --> 00:20:59,849
eight of us

443
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:03,550
you can have seven different opinions from every single one in the room all sort of saying

444
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,051
we think you should do this and you have to try and pick through all of that

445
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:10,433
noise and come up with a consensus. But it also definitely helps because

446
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:13,955
no one feels illegitimate in saying hey I'm not happy about this aspect of the

447
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:14,215
game

448
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:15,555
can we do something about that?

449
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:24,833
So some of the issues that we've sort of run into with the structure of the scope is that

450
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:30,062
there are peculiarities to the legal structure of the court.

451
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:36,984
which means that once money goes into the co-op it becomes the property of the co-op

452
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:43,050
and of the national union of co-ops. So it doesn't technically belong to the workers

453
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,314
in the co-op, it belongs to the workers in the co-op and all the potential future workers

454
00:21:47,354 --> 00:21:51,979
in the co-op. So that actually makes it very difficult to put money aside because once

455
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,243
it goes in it stays in the company and if we take it out to spend it on a game it has

456
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:56,643
to come back.

457
00:21:57,923 --> 00:22:02,627
If it doesn't come back, that can leave the workers in a sticky situation as to why did

458
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:06,050
you spend all this money and it then not come back for the future workers of the co-op.

459
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,193
If we keep making games that keep making money, that's not a problem, it's a cool thing because

460
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:15,217
it perpetuates the structure but it does also make us cautious about having a huge amount

461
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:15,657
of reserves.

462
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:23,351
Not all fun and games, limits to organizational efficiency.

463
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,993
I was really on my A game when I made that title up.

464
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:29,676
So at Motion Twin, there's zero hierarchy.

465
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:33,058
And there's three sort of fundamental pillars

466
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,099
that we talk about.

467
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,302
So it's equal pay, equal say, and equal work.

468
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:44,447
Apart from that, based on that, we're all entirely equal.

469
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:51,328
what that means is that probably we're limited in terms of how much we can grow. We will

470
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:56,971
probably always stay small. Maybe 7. It's kind of that Amazon discussion about feeding a team

471
00:22:57,231 --> 00:23:02,913
off a pizza or something like that. Just because once you go past, you know, you go past 10, all

472
00:23:02,954 --> 00:23:07,536
of a sudden you need to have much more rigorous internal structures about internal communication,

473
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:11,377
making sure that everyone is talking to each other. When there's 8 of us you can literally

474
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,758
shoot someone with a Nerf gun and say, what do you think about this?

475
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:20,421
And what it means is that you have to have probably a lot more rules and a lot more systems

476
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:25,925
than what you would have in a standard company, or at least a lot more tools that allow everybody

477
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:31,690
to have that accountability and to know that everyone else is doing the right thing.

478
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:34,692
So time, we track time quite carefully.

479
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,374
Generally not because people are slacking.

480
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:41,998
When you're an owner and a participant in your own company, there's lots of motivation

481
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:42,318
to work.

482
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:45,795
and the problem is that it goes too far and quite often you have people who are

483
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:48,339
coming in the office on the weekends just because they're like, man I'm so excited about

484
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:49,401
running my own company, this is awesome

485
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:53,647
and that starts to create a little bit of a culture of crunch and so sometimes you have to be like, dude

486
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:55,710
take a step back, go home

487
00:23:56,691 --> 00:24:00,513
hang out with your family, play with your dog, do whatever you have to do but don't put

488
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:09,538
pressure on the rest of the team by working insane hours. Responsibility. My famous quip is

489
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:14,341
when, it's not mine, someone else said it, when it's the responsibility of everybody, it's

490
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:20,385
nobody's responsibility. You see that with the dishes, for example. The dishes never get done.

491
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:26,566
And when they do it's someone who grumpily goes in washes all the dishes and leaves an angry message on slack like why don't

492
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:30,448
You guys watch your dishes or something like that. So you got to make sure that you have tools in place

493
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:35,051
to take care of that for us. It's a little sign that says wash your dishes now and

494
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:39,555
Us regularly looking and making sure it's like it someone leave the dishes here so that it doesn't pile up

495
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:43,544
and that can be the dishes, that can also be dealing with administrative tasks that no one

496
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:47,527
wants to deal with like for example if we get audited by the tax man who has to go and sit with

497
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:56,753
the tax man while he goes through three years worth of accounts. Not me. Crunch again when it's

498
00:24:56,793 --> 00:25:02,837
your company and you are responsible and you're also interested in absolutely making a game

499
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:07,480
of success then there's kind of like a mentality that happens where it's like okay we're going

500
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,201
to get this done, let's get this finished, we're about to ship.

501
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:14,293
And we don't, you know, there's nothing like the crunch that exists in the industry, but

502
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:19,234
it does happen and it's something that we have to be very vigilant about because it

503
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:22,536
can snowball and it can definitely lead to us all sort of feeling like at the end of

504
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:24,396
a project like, whoa, we need to take some time off.

505
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:27,177
The cool thing about being in a workers' cooperative is that you can just have a discussion

506
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:28,318
where we say, hey man, you guys tired?

507
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:28,738
Are we tired?

508
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,039
Let's have a take two weeks off and we can do that.

509
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:31,939
So that's great.

510
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:40,353
So fatigue as well, fatigue is a big one because when you have seven other people coming to

511
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:44,460
you and saying we're not happy with what you're doing or questioning your decisions particularly

512
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,621
like

513
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:45,382
Transcribed by https://otter.ai

514
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:50,741
I felt that particularly strongly when I first arrived because I was the only non-productive

515
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:53,723
member on the business and marketing team, the only person who sort of specialised in

516
00:25:53,763 --> 00:25:54,243
that subject.

517
00:25:54,824 --> 00:25:59,387
So I've got as many opinions going from people who don't care about that stuff and aren't

518
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,988
really specialised in it coming and telling me, we should be doing this, you know.

519
00:26:02,008 --> 00:26:04,910
Okay, and so you have to defend that.

520
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,791
You can't just say, no, no, no, I'm in charge of this.

521
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:09,633
You have to defend your point of view and explain it rationally to everybody, which

522
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:11,594
takes a lot of time and can be tiring.

523
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:20,187
So we covered washing up. The other one that sucks is telling people that they're fired. Or

524
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:28,174
how you deal with what happens if something doesn't go right. So what does happen if it goes

525
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:33,338
pear shaped? I put the little survivor icon. If you've ever seen that television show, it's

526
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:39,463
awful. But it's a little bit like that because no one has the authority to fire anybody else.

527
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:43,867
So it's kind of like Game of Thrones mixed with Survivor. You have to democratically.

528
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,223
say okay we've decided the majority

529
00:26:47,763 --> 00:26:52,530
that you are not pulling your weight or no longer fit into the team and you're

530
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,251
going to be out

531
00:26:53,831 --> 00:26:54,232
and that

532
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:56,797
I can tell you from experience, is awful.

533
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:57,958
It stinks.

534
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,761
So some of the systems we put in place to avoid that kind

535
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:04,263
of situation, hiring.

536
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:07,665
When we're hiring people, it's kind of like getting married.

537
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,307
It's a super big commitment.

538
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,811
We generally have people do two consecutive six-month

539
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:15,752
temporary contracts.

540
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,775
So that gives us plenty of time to say, OK, this person

541
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:21,557
fits in, or this person doesn't fit in, before we

542
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:21,917
bring them in.

543
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,116
Most of the time you know in the first two months, you're like, yeah, these guys are

544
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:26,798
going to be a great fit.

545
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,282
Or sometimes you don't.

546
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,167
So we have to protect ourselves from that moment because getting rid of them is...

547
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:41,918
heart wrenching. So then questions about risk. So for example, dead cells, when I joined

548
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:46,941
the company I was brought on to help do a switch from web to mobile. We hadn't had a

549
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:52,103
successful web game in years. We tried mobile and didn't like it. It wasn't really what

550
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:55,745
we wanted to do. We didn't have any success on mobile. By the time dead cells came along

551
00:27:55,765 --> 00:28:00,128
it was kind of like a last ditch effort. And when you're part of a co-op,

552
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:03,850
You can do all kinds of amazing things, but some things that are kind of also insane.

553
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:08,574
And we bet the farm and basically said, okay, well, we're going to make dead cells.

554
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:12,498
We're going to do something that we love doing and either we'll go out in a blaze of glory

555
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:13,839
or it'll work and we won.

556
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,200
So fortunately it worked.

557
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,541
We're all still here, which is cool.

558
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:22,526
But those kinds of decisions, managing risk can have a different sort of mentality when

559
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:25,389
everyone's like, well, you know, we're either going to do this or we're just going to go

560
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,310
do something else because this is what we love.

561
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:32,891
And if you're used to a traditional sort of business structure as I was when I came in, that sort of seems like it's insane.

562
00:28:33,832 --> 00:28:37,096
And then inequality, like just individual difference and personal inequality.

563
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:40,499
Some people are leaders and loudmouths and want to get involved in everything.

564
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:46,427
And some people have direct confrontational styles for discussions that are going to sort of crush out the more introverted people.

565
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:52,552
So how do you create space so that everyone who is a different type of person can express themselves?

566
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:59,137
How do you give, how do you make sure that you can give responsibility to the people who won't put their hand right up and be like,

567
00:28:59,157 --> 00:29:05,463
yeah, I'm going to do that, you know, and say, okay, well, you know, we noticed that you haven't been asking for these kind of roles.

568
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,065
Is there something going on? And we try and sort of organize around that.

569
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:09,346
But that takes time.

570
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:15,052
and it's a management of the people that you're working with and everyone is doing that at

571
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:15,473
all times.

572
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:17,795
So again, none of this is a reason not to do it.

573
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,218
It's awesome fun.

574
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:24,783
But it does come with a whole bunch of different dynamics that you just don't have in a standard

575
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:25,144
workplace.

576
00:29:25,484 --> 00:29:27,847
So I'm going to hand it over right now.

577
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:43,990
Thank you. Hello, I'm Ian. I'm from Tailspinners. I'm based in the UK and was a bit surprised

578
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,613
to be asked to this because I hadn't realized how little US seems to know about co-ops because

579
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:53,777
we have really large scale co-ops like international, multinational corporations in the UK and across

580
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:59,962
Europe who work in this way. We are multinational. We have one guy in Toronto.

581
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,662
But yeah, so we're coming at this from quite a different angle because we're not a development studio.

582
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:09,965
Tailspinners are a writing studio, an outsourced writing studio.

583
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:14,609
We help everybody from indie to AAA, but mostly kind of indie to mid-level

584
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:17,331
with story for their game in whatever form that might be.

585
00:30:19,272 --> 00:30:23,596
So we're a studio of people who all work together to do that, but that's not really what we are or what we were,

586
00:30:24,016 --> 00:30:28,660
because we started as two freelancers who went...

587
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,168
Well, we seem to be visiting an awful lot of the same potential clients, why don't we

588
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:38,776
team up? And we thought about all of the reasons why that was a good thing and we adopted a

589
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:44,583
company name and a logo and we made a website and suddenly people started treating us differently

590
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:48,748
and the conversations that we had radically changed as individual freelancers.

591
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:51,864
They stopped asking us things like, are you available?

592
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:53,888
Because you're a company, and clearly, therefore, you are

593
00:30:53,928 --> 00:30:54,549
always available.

594
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:57,555
And they stopped asking for things like writing tests in a

595
00:30:57,675 --> 00:31:00,240
lot of cases, because we have a cool logo or something.

596
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,132
you can do the job. So it was very strange and that set us thinking about how the whole

597
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:09,453
thing holds together and about the gig economy and I'll talk about that in a little bit.

598
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:16,116
But it went very well, we expanded, we always had, we'd come up with a way to deal with

599
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:19,638
the fact that we might have too much work because everybody thinks we're available all

600
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:24,780
the time by having other freelancers to help us out kind of on call or for specific if

601
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,581
they had skills that we didn't have in-house.

602
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:30,970
And then we needed to grow and we thought about it and went well

603
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,992
Why did we get together in the first place? Well actually it was for mutual protection, right?

604
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:41,013
So maybe we could talk to some of our freelancers and see if they want to join and be part of this and that what

605
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:44,334
Happened so we've grown into a group of what are really freelancers

606
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:48,956
But a group of freelancers who will collaborate and cooperate and actually work together day to day

607
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:51,211
And this gave us a load of advantages, some of which we

608
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:54,014
thought about up front, some of which only really turned up

609
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:54,414
later on.

610
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:57,076
So these were our original reasons.

611
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,119
And these were kind of the pitch also that we gave to our

612
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,602
prospective freelancers to say, why don't you join us?

613
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:04,283
Creative support is a big one.

614
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:07,266
So if I'm writing something, I'm writing a bunch of

615
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:10,109
dialogue, and I could immediately then send that to

616
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:11,650
the client and say, hey, here's the dialogue.

617
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,090
What do you think?

618
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,012
But they haven't been trained in dialogue in any way.

619
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:17,426
The ability to pass it over to another of us internally and say,

620
00:32:17,446 --> 00:32:18,527
can you just have a look at this?

621
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:19,888
Am I doing something insane here?

622
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:21,869
Have I got it all wrong in some way?

623
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:22,930
Do you think the client will like it?

624
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,752
You know, is it story wise, you're trained in story, does it hold up?

625
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:27,073
And they can do that for you.

626
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:30,796
And the brilliant thing is because we've signed an NDA as a company, we can talk

627
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,799
to anybody else in our company who has particular set of skills or whatever

628
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,980
it is about that piece of work.

629
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:39,823
So if one of us is much stronger in design and we've got a design issue and

630
00:32:39,843 --> 00:32:41,525
that the person who's writing it is stronger in dialogue.

631
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:42,645
they can just pass it over.

632
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,186
If I'm banging my head against a brick wall

633
00:32:44,226 --> 00:32:45,086
with a story problem,

634
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:47,888
I can call up anybody else in the company and say,

635
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,469
hey, here's my problem, can I explain this to you?

636
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:52,951
And as normally happens, when you start doing that,

637
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,071
you come up with a solution yourself.

638
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:56,403
But because they're under the same NDA, at least you can

639
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:57,084
talk to them about that.

640
00:32:57,104 --> 00:32:58,945
So creative support is a huge thing.

641
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,147
Emotional and social support.

642
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,088
And I can't stress strongly enough how important the

643
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,009
emotional side of it is.

644
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,091
As an individual freelancer, you are on your own against

645
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:07,471
the world.

646
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:10,954
You have nobody to help you, possibly your partner at home

647
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:11,655
or something like that.

648
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,476
But it's a very lonely existence.

649
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:15,758
And you're dealing potentially with a string of clients.

650
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,419
And you might see them for a few months.

651
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,380
That's the social bit, right?

652
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:21,602
We're dealing with different people every day.

653
00:33:21,902 --> 00:33:23,884
and you have no kind of ongoing conversations,

654
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,165
even about what movie did you see last night,

655
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:27,206
any of that sort of stuff.

656
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:29,208
And being able to be in a group with people

657
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:30,789
who can emotionally support you,

658
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,291
whether it's, I'm really struggling with this client,

659
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:35,372
can somebody help me out?

660
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,754
Whether it's, I'm writing a knee-jerk response

661
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,175
to this client, can somebody shut me down

662
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:40,036
before I press send?

663
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:42,037
Or any of those kinds of things.

664
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,579
It's so valuable to have other people just around you

665
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:47,301
and feel as, we've talked about family here before,

666
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:48,262
and feel like that family.

667
00:33:49,436 --> 00:33:52,800
From an external point of view, there are huge advantages to being a company.

668
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,925
I've talked about the kind of just the feel of having something like a logo and a website

669
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:58,606
and all the rest of it, just that professionalism.

670
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:03,332
But it also brings a lot of weight with it, which you don't have as an individual freelancer.

671
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:06,387
If you're struggling with a client who isn't paying their

672
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:08,829
bills for some reason, as an individual freelancer, you

673
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,830
have not a lot of weight with that.

674
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,112
You can threaten legal action or something like that in an

675
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:15,055
email, but there is as much to think, well, you're a tiny

676
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:17,016
company, you're one person on their own, how are you going

677
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:17,717
to afford a lawyer?

678
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:20,780
Whereas if we look like we've got more weight than that as

679
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,662
being an organization, being a company, and actually, we

680
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:24,563
might have engaged a lawyer.

681
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:25,444
I'll talk about that later.

682
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:28,106
But an email on properly headed paper that looks like

683
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:30,968
it's come from a proper company makes a huge

684
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:31,369
difference.

685
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,073
Internally, being a company is useful for economies of scale.

686
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:36,574
So we need an accountant.

687
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,397
If each individual freelancer had to organize an accountant

688
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:42,520
and pay them accountancy fees and deal with accounting

689
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:46,805
systems, that cost, not only does it cost money, but it

690
00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:48,807
costs time for each individual freelancer.

691
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:50,889
But we only have to do that once for all of us.

692
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,173
Same for legal stuff, same for websites, same for PR.

693
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:57,374
Same for, for example, being here at GDC.

694
00:34:57,394 --> 00:34:59,056
There are two of us here at GDC.

695
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:04,019
If we wanted to do that before, as a group of individual freelancers,

696
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:06,401
all of us might have had to pay our own way to come across here,

697
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:10,684
to all do our kind of business dealing

698
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:13,266
and actually be fighting each other for different deals and clients.

699
00:35:13,426 --> 00:35:14,467
That's just pointless.

700
00:35:15,428 --> 00:35:17,289
And it means that we can afford to stand here at GDC

701
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:19,811
as a group between us, which works brilliantly.

702
00:35:20,572 --> 00:35:21,332
Practical support.

703
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:28,820
I'm ill or something and I need somebody else to answer an email or I'm busy here at GDC,

704
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,922
then we've got people within the company who can do that, we've got people who can cover

705
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:36,204
each other, we've got people who can, you know, oh God, I forgot something, can somebody

706
00:35:36,244 --> 00:35:40,947
mail me something from that thing back from the UK or whatever it happens to be. So just

707
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:44,969
the practical support of having other people around you is great. And just strengthen numbers.

708
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,974
If you think about it from a freelancer point of view, you've got a list of contacts, but

709
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:57,140
if we've got four, six, eight of us, that list of contacts is magnified hugely and we

710
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,824
have all of those different relationships. And if we as a company get a contact from

711
00:36:00,864 --> 00:36:04,348
a particular possible client, we can go around to everybody else and say, yeah, has anybody

712
00:36:04,468 --> 00:36:07,030
had dealings with this company before? Is there any connection? Is there any link we

713
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,994
can make here? And often there is. And it just magnifies that strength in numbers.

714
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:13,453
So we've done that for a while and it's worked very well.

715
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,254
And we've discovered some other things and thought about

716
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:19,257
it a bit, which are really good.

717
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:21,958
So the safety net is a really important thing.

718
00:36:21,998 --> 00:36:25,601
So how it works is we do a job for a client.

719
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:26,501
We get some money in.

720
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:29,003
A small percentage of that goes into the company coffers

721
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:31,304
to pay for things like accountants and that sort of

722
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,086
thing, and the rest goes on to the people who

723
00:36:33,106 --> 00:36:33,626
actually did the work.

724
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,550
We put slightly more in the coffers than perhaps we might need to, just as a sort of fighting

725
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,531
fund. And we came up with a use for it which we hadn't expected at all, and we should have,

726
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:49,252
but we hadn't expected, which is when a client didn't pay and suddenly an individual freelancer

727
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:52,473
who was supposed to be paid by that job didn't have any money coming in that month, which

728
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:56,853
is every freelancer's nightmare, really. But we have this safety net, we have this fighting

729
00:36:56,893 --> 00:37:01,194
fund, and while we couldn't pay the whole of that fee, we could pay some of that fee

730
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:04,215
to tide them over until we'd sorted out the invoicing and got the client to pay up.

731
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:07,674
And that we did it once for the first time and suddenly went,

732
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:09,276
well, this is a thing that we should just do.

733
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:10,337
We should put it in place.

734
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,318
And you could do that as an individual freelancer.

735
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:13,119
You could save.

736
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,802
But it never really works out like that, does it?

737
00:37:16,062 --> 00:37:17,923
And we've got everybody putting money into the pot, so

738
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:19,485
the pot is commensurately bigger.

739
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:22,788
So it just gives us that kind of fallback and that safety,

740
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:26,531
which is something which is really valuable in this gig

741
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:26,912
economy.

742
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:30,852
Skill development is something that didn't occur to us, but of course we are all different

743
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:36,377
people with our different skills, areas of expertise, and we have the ability to cross-train

744
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:40,640
each other in that as freelancers. If I'm doing a voice direction session with somebody,

745
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:45,584
one of the other people involved can be listening in, sitting in the background on Skype or

746
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:48,247
however we're doing the voice direction, and they can pick up those skills. If we're doing

747
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:52,270
a story workshop, we can have two or three of us in there to learn how to do story workshops.

748
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:54,904
We're cross-training each other all the time.

749
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:58,466
And something I should have said last slide, I guess, is

750
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:01,609
that the strength in numbers thing applies to the skills as

751
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:02,169
well, right?

752
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:03,771
So I might be really good at dialogue.

753
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:08,214
We have Matt, who's excellent at archaeology and that sort

754
00:38:08,254 --> 00:38:09,615
of thing, alongside what he does.

755
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,577
And we have somebody else who's very much into narrative

756
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:14,058
design, and those skills all feed off each other and

757
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:15,339
improve each other.

758
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,661
And it means that if we go to a client, we have a much

759
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:19,002
better offering, right?

760
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:20,523
So we can't just say, well, yeah, I can.

761
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:23,328
I can do the dialogue, but you'll need somebody else to do the narrative design.

762
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,069
We don't have to do that, we can do the whole thing.

763
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:27,931
The gig economy.

764
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:31,733
So this was the big revelation really, because we kicked this off at about the time it was

765
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:35,835
becoming obvious that the games industry was changing, particularly amongst indies and

766
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:38,996
mid-level, which is, it's much more like the film industry now.

767
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:42,458
It is a small creative team comes up with an idea, they maybe get some funding for that

768
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:44,739
idea, they hire a bunch of people on temporarily.

769
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,641
and they get rid of them towards the end of the project.

770
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:48,003
And that's happening at big studios,

771
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:49,585
it's happening at very small studios.

772
00:38:50,365 --> 00:38:53,048
That's the life we're in, and that's difficult to unionize.

773
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,472
I wouldn't say it's easy to unionize big companies,

774
00:38:56,492 --> 00:38:57,813
but you can see how it might work.

775
00:38:57,854 --> 00:39:00,136
You can see how all the workers

776
00:39:00,196 --> 00:39:01,878
at a particularly large company can go,

777
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:03,580
no, we're not having any of that, we're gonna walk out.

778
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,982
If I walk out as an individual freelance writer

779
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:06,903
of a project, they go.

780
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:14,248
goodbye and hire somebody else. So we're sort of micro-unionizing by being in this co-op

781
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:18,110
together because of all of the benefits I've already talked about. I mean, things like

782
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,912
I need my contract checked. Well, we have a lawyer as part of the company. Things like

783
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:26,654
the safety net. And things like just having that logo and that weight with the client.

784
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:33,300
I don't know how many other freelancers are out here in this room today, but I strongly,

785
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,222
strongly recommend you think about teaming up with other people, if only for the key

786
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:42,623
thing to me is that emotional safety net, is not being on your own and not feeling alone.

787
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:44,524
And that's terribly, terribly valuable.

788
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:46,265
And I'll hand that over.

789
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:47,085
Back to Scott.

790
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,369
I already talked a bunch, so I need a drink.

791
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:01,273
All right.

792
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:08,195
All right, thanks everyone for talking, that was cool.

793
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:12,536
All right, so we just launched this

794
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,177
like a week and a half ago publicly,

795
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:17,418
which is funny, because it took like forever to get going,

796
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,758
which we'll talk about in a second.

797
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:24,200
But Bethany and I are two-thirds of the core team

798
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,540
that made a game called Night in the Woods.

799
00:40:29,402 --> 00:40:35,249
Afterwards, we're working with a really fantastic artist named Ren Farrin.

800
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:35,770
She's not here.

801
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:41,837
But we needed to form a team after Night in the Woods for our next game.

802
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:47,064
We had a bit of money coming in from Night in the Woods, so we're like, okay, let's get

803
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:47,424
this going.

804
00:40:47,464 --> 00:40:48,466
Now, what you're supposed to do...

805
00:40:49,689 --> 00:40:50,649
is one of a couple things.

806
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,431
You hire on some people.

807
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,233
It's like Bethany and I are like, we started this,

808
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:55,814
and then they do like magazine stories

809
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:57,656
or whatever about us or something.

810
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,737
And then we also brought on this artist

811
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:00,959
and it was super cool or something.

812
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,822
Or more likely, it's just Bethany and I working.

813
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,064
We bring on a bunch of freelancers and contractors

814
00:41:07,104 --> 00:41:09,066
for like short-term things here and there

815
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:12,389
and you know, staff up and then staff down at the end of it.

816
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,754
And so we were getting into that,

817
00:41:16,794 --> 00:41:19,036
but it just kind of seemed like wrong, right?

818
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:23,738
And like Bethany and I, we've worked a bunch of jobs,

819
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:24,979
a lot of service industry,

820
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,680
and also just being kind of struggling artists for a while

821
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,161
until we kind of fell through the side door

822
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:30,162
into making video games.

823
00:41:30,502 --> 00:41:33,563
So we've had like a lot of like bosses over the years.

824
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:36,345
We've been very aware of that dynamic

825
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:38,606
between being an employee

826
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,027
and kind of being the person in charge.

827
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:42,329
It just didn't feel right.

828
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:43,851
Something just felt like, eh, about it.

829
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:45,713
We're like, you know, we like Ren a lot.

830
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:48,956
Why would we want to be Ren's boss, right?

831
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:51,699
Her voice is as valuable as ours is.

832
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,702
So I angsted about it pretty hard for a few months

833
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,444
because I just didn't know what to do, right?

834
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:57,866
I was like, we need to make this thing

835
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,307
that I don't know how to do.

836
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:00,289
Ah, this doesn't feel right.

837
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,174
And then I heard about this whole worker cooperative thing

838
00:42:04,214 --> 00:42:06,537
and was just immediately like, wow, this sounds great.

839
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,281
Yeah, this is before we got into all the complicated part

840
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:10,482
of actually doing it and everything.

841
00:42:10,502 --> 00:42:12,225
But at least at first I was like.

842
00:42:13,087 --> 00:42:14,128
This is fantastic.

843
00:42:15,209 --> 00:42:16,750
And it took us a really long time,

844
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,012
because as I've said a couple times,

845
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:23,215
in the US, there aren't a lot of worker cooperatives.

846
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:24,216
They're in the hundreds.

847
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:25,297
They're growing now.

848
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:30,822
But it is, I've been saying it's like lost knowledge.

849
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:32,603
It's like when you have to read the item descriptions

850
00:42:32,663 --> 00:42:34,064
in Dark Souls to get the story.

851
00:42:34,545 --> 00:42:35,145
It was like that.

852
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:36,606
That's what it felt like sometimes,

853
00:42:36,626 --> 00:42:38,188
just getting little bits here and there

854
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,329
of how to do this in the US.

855
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:41,690
So it took a lot of legwork and research,

856
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,492
and a lot of Googling, a lot of trying

857
00:42:44,512 --> 00:42:46,533
to find local people who were involved

858
00:42:46,553 --> 00:42:50,094
in cooperative, pro-cooperative building organizations,

859
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:51,515
and all that kind of stuff.

860
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:56,258
Ted here talking to our friend Salim up at Co-op in Montreal.

861
00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:00,478
a bunch of other people, and just getting kind of ideas.

862
00:43:01,818 --> 00:43:07,920
So we began acting basically as a worker cooperative in 2018, and then it took us a while to get

863
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,901
our legal entity because the government shut down for a while, and we couldn't get our

864
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:13,181
paperwork through and all that.

865
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:19,903
But then we publicly legally launched it just last month.

866
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:25,574
So why'd we do this? There was a history of projects that Bethany and I have been in.

867
00:43:25,594 --> 00:43:34,118
I co-founded an international indie animation collective called Late Night War Club a few years ago.

868
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:39,721
Night in the Woods was very egalitarian. Like, we did vote. We knew there wasn't a hierarchy in that.

869
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:40,721
But it was all informal.

870
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:47,731
And so the idea of formalizing that, making that an actual structure that we were really a part of

871
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,216
and not just, oh, we like to keep it pretty horizontal around here.

872
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:57,851
type of thing. That sounded dirty. Anyway, there was also, I think, experience also with

873
00:43:57,931 --> 00:44:05,936
IWW, knowing some IWW folks. We're in DSA, Democratic Socialists of America, labor organizers

874
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:13,961
there, and Game Workers Unite, which is the worker unionization, worker organization advocacy

875
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:16,802
organization in the games industry that a few of us are a part of.

876
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:19,716
And also just a lot of years of bosses.

877
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:23,418
It kind of made us not want to do this, right?

878
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:25,140
Like I had good bosses and bad bosses,

879
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,000
but they were still bosses.

880
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,782
And the good bosses, I would have liked them a lot better

881
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:29,623
if they weren't my boss, you know?

882
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:34,387
And so yeah, tired is bosses and employees,

883
00:44:34,427 --> 00:44:36,948
but wait, I messed up this thing.

884
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:38,029
It was supposed to say wired.

885
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,831
Tired, bosses and employees.

886
00:44:41,192 --> 00:44:41,652
Wild.

887
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:44,804
worker owners, right?

888
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:46,707
It's not like it's gonna get rid of all your problems,

889
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,089
like as, you know, Steve was talking about.

890
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:49,831
There are complications that come with this,

891
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:54,317
but it's not like being involved in a more hierarchical,

892
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:56,741
like boss worker, you know, thing,

893
00:44:56,841 --> 00:44:59,164
gets rid of problems that you're gonna have.

894
00:45:00,706 --> 00:45:01,848
So other reasons why we did this.

895
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:05,533
There's creative benefits to working like this.

896
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:10,000
I've worked in a lot of creative scenarios where there was like, here's your project

897
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,345
lead and then there's like the boss or whatever and you're kind of just coming in every day

898
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:13,525
going.

899
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:15,630
All right, what are we doing today?

900
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,991
Or like, oh no, the scope expanded over the weekend.

901
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:20,072
Like, oh my god, I left on Friday and it was one thing,

902
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,473
and I came back on Monday, it was another.

903
00:45:21,493 --> 00:45:23,413
And now I have to do all this work,

904
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,854
and someone set a deadline, and I have to.

905
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:28,196
There's just a lot that we can talk and plan that.

906
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:30,157
It's way harder for me to walk in and go,

907
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,057
okay, everybody, we're doing this, or something.

908
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:32,798
We talk about it.

909
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,699
There's creative benefits to that that we've found.

910
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,400
We have kind of like, you know,

911
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:40,982
it's not as though we all get together,

912
00:45:41,002 --> 00:45:43,063
and when Ren draws something, all of us get together,

913
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:46,564
vote what the cat looks like or something, you know?

914
00:45:47,424 --> 00:45:49,085
There's a term that I heard a while ago,

915
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:54,147
actually in a documentary about a construction co-op

916
00:45:54,527 --> 00:45:57,228
that's a horizontal organization and vertical deployment,

917
00:45:58,169 --> 00:45:59,649
meaning that we all come together

918
00:45:59,689 --> 00:46:00,950
and talk and make these decisions,

919
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,271
but at the end of the day, we all also have our lanes.

920
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:04,971
that we operate in.

921
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:07,532
And so while we can talk about things and vote on things

922
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:10,793
and discuss things, we also trust each other

923
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,614
to be able to do what we do best.

924
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:16,215
And it's not like you can't have creative direction.

925
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:19,136
Like I'm kind of operating, again, voted on by the team

926
00:46:19,556 --> 00:46:20,736
as kind of a creative director,

927
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:22,797
kind of nudging us along in a certain direction.

928
00:46:23,777 --> 00:46:26,599
So you can, it's not like it's a giant free for all,

929
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,882
you know, there's still like, not hierarchy,

930
00:46:29,902 --> 00:46:31,463
but there's still organization in how you do stuff.

931
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:32,584
And there's creative benefits to that,

932
00:46:32,784 --> 00:46:34,905
because people feel empowered to talk, you know,

933
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,267
to speak up, because you have to get some consensus,

934
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:38,868
you have to build consensus with each other.

935
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:42,831
You do have to look out for like personalities

936
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:45,232
that just do dominate those spaces.

937
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,174
That's something you really have to look out for.

938
00:46:48,174 --> 00:46:50,216
But it tends towards there being more

939
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:51,536
kind of creative collaboration.

940
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,481
because as multiple people have said,

941
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:55,203
you do have to talk about this stuff.

942
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:57,585
There's the material and organizational benefits,

943
00:46:57,605 --> 00:46:58,786
which I've kind of gone over.

944
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:02,548
Material is, we talk about where the money's going,

945
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:04,070
what money we're putting into it,

946
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,032
how we're paying, who's getting paid, that kind of thing.

947
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:08,033
Oh, we need to bring someone on.

948
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:09,994
Okay, let's all talk about this,

949
00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:12,256
because this isn't just like, oh, they hired someone,

950
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:14,678
and I walked in and there was someone there,

951
00:47:14,718 --> 00:47:16,439
and now the company's like, oh, we gotta lay people off,

952
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,221
because, no, we talk about that stuff.

953
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:20,539
before we make those decisions.

954
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,387
There's the interpersonal benefits of.

955
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,571
I remember talking to Ren when we were first

956
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,612
talking about this, and she had just left

957
00:47:27,892 --> 00:47:30,272
a mobile studio that was particularly crunchy.

958
00:47:30,993 --> 00:47:33,093
And I kind of, like, okay, so we want to do

959
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:34,554
this worker cooperative thing, blah, blah, blah.

960
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:36,995
And she was like, after I kind of explained it,

961
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:38,955
she was like, why aren't every company,

962
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:41,036
why isn't every company working this way?

963
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:43,077
Because it's one of those things where

964
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:44,937
you suddenly realize, like, oh, like,

965
00:47:45,137 --> 00:47:47,778
once you get rid of the boss-employee distinction,

966
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:49,539
so many things change, right?

967
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:53,221
like overtime stuff, okay, we need to talk about that.

968
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:55,242
Like crunch, okay, we need to talk,

969
00:47:55,382 --> 00:47:56,883
oh, do we need a deadline, do we need to sprint

970
00:47:56,903 --> 00:47:59,644
through the next week to hit like an E3 demo or something?

971
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:02,206
Cool, let's take a week and a half after that.

972
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:03,567
We can just talk about that.

973
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:06,908
That changes how you interact with each other.

974
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:09,070
There's friction, there's all kinds of other stuff

975
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,190
as you come to a,

976
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:14,813
an agreement or you come to consensus on something,

977
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:18,356
but there's not one person just telling someone else

978
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,718
what to do and it has all of these implications

979
00:48:20,738 --> 00:48:22,719
that you don't even realize when you put them into place.

980
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,101
Like it trickles down into all these things

981
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:28,043
and there's this toxic nature that you,

982
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:29,844
there's this toxic dynamic that you get

983
00:48:30,725 --> 00:48:33,007
with a more hierarchical system that just kind of

984
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:35,989
doesn't apply as much when you're.

985
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:37,850
working cooperatively.

986
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,691
And it's just really personally fulfilling.

987
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:41,531
Everyone feels like they own what they're doing

988
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:43,492
because they do, legally own what they're doing.

989
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,814
There are three co-owners in our company.

990
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:50,376
We'll be staffing up to probably five by the end of it.

991
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:55,138
And as we kind of build to a fuller team,

992
00:48:55,498 --> 00:48:56,679
but we all own this.

993
00:48:57,259 --> 00:48:58,980
Like we're all on paper, you know?

994
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:01,084
So it's not just, like I said at the beginning,

995
00:49:01,124 --> 00:49:02,865
it's not just like, oh, we like to think of ourselves

996
00:49:02,885 --> 00:49:03,805
as a family and we all own it.

997
00:49:03,825 --> 00:49:05,265
It's like, no, we legally do.

998
00:49:05,285 --> 00:49:06,666
And it's different.

999
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:10,027
And we went from this dread to this excitement

1000
00:49:10,627 --> 00:49:13,128
about how we structure our labor and our relationships

1001
00:49:13,188 --> 00:49:14,128
together as workers.

1002
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:15,869
Because like I said, it's not like it solves every problem.

1003
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:16,809
It's not like everything is.

1004
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:23,558
Sunny skies forever, but like it's exciting to be able to do this. It's exciting to own what you're making. It's decided

1005
00:49:23,578 --> 00:49:27,863
It's exciting to to not just you know. Oh, I work here. I'm part of this team, too

1006
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:34,229
It's like no I work together, and we constitute what this is all of us. There isn't one person

1007
00:49:34,982 --> 00:49:36,883
doing it and then we all just work for them.

1008
00:49:36,923 --> 00:49:39,244
It's like, no, we all work for ourselves and for each other.

1009
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:41,426
And that's just really different.

1010
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:44,647
And so, yeah, that was, that's pretty cool.

1011
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,428
I think that's why we like it so much.

1012
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:48,930
And so, what we're gonna do now

1013
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,570
is opening it up to some Q&A.

1014
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:54,332
There's a microphone there.

1015
00:49:54,473 --> 00:49:55,633
I can't see it because there's lights.

1016
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:57,334
I think we have a few minutes left.

1017
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,421
Yeah, we have about 10 minutes left.

1018
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:04,445
So if you want to come up, say your name, where you're from,

1019
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:09,289
and just speak your question as the microphone.

1020
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:10,870
That is a long line already.

1021
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:12,692
Jeez.

1022
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:14,173
Exciting.

1023
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:16,796
And you can ask just general questions,

1024
00:50:16,896 --> 00:50:19,158
or if there's anything specific from anyone.

1025
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:29,429
Hello, I'm Gabriella from Argentina. I

1026
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:32,411
wanted to ask you if you know about

1027
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,232
big corporations and

1028
00:50:35,472 --> 00:50:39,655
if you have any idea of how to apply it to

1029
00:50:40,355 --> 00:50:41,035
by your game

1030
00:50:41,816 --> 00:50:42,956
Enterprise or whatever

1031
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:46,078
You're talking about corporations in the US

1032
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:53,061
No, it's like B corporations. I don't know how it's said like properly in English is

1033
00:50:53,301 --> 00:51:01,224
Empresas B. It's like an organization that certifies you that you are a

1034
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:03,885
corporation that both helps like...

1035
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:04,845
Okay, it's kind of hard.

1036
00:51:04,865 --> 00:51:09,487
It's kind of about B corps. The kind of corps that are good for society.

1037
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:12,488
B corps.

1038
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:31,708
Yeah, it helps both in monetary, but also helps the society and the environment.

1039
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:41,331
So, it's not like you own a corporation and you make donations to...

1040
00:51:42,493 --> 00:51:47,374
to fulfill some things or avoid taxes,

1041
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:52,336
it must be on your, I don't know,

1042
00:51:53,517 --> 00:51:54,657
I'm wasting so much time.

1043
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:55,517
It's like a mission statement?

1044
00:51:56,338 --> 00:51:57,098
Yeah, on the organization.

1045
00:51:57,118 --> 00:52:00,419
Part of your reason to exist is to benefit society.

1046
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:04,420
Yeah, so it's like the next step for.

1047
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:09,258
like the future of enterprises, it's that.

1048
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:16,943
But it's most used in physical things.

1049
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:24,427
So maybe you buy stuff that is manufactured.

1050
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:24,747
Yeah.

1051
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,369
I don't know if someone wants to come and help me.

1052
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:30,531
Because I knew.

1053
00:52:33,344 --> 00:52:38,107
in products that are not physical, I don't know how I can apply it.

1054
00:52:38,668 --> 00:52:41,890
So, well, if you don't know, it's okay.

1055
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,291
You can look at it.

1056
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:45,813
I mean, I don't know of any off the top of my head,

1057
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:50,557
like any game companies who have a, like, as part of their reason to exist,

1058
00:52:51,497 --> 00:52:53,018
changing the world for the positive.

1059
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:55,280
But I can see how it could happen.

1060
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,941
I mean, you could start a game company that has...

1061
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:02,291
a purpose of creating educational content with the idea of changing...

1062
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:04,651
Actually, isn't there a guy on the panel doing something like that?

1063
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:08,252
You're making a game that is a political statement.

1064
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:11,233
I mean, the idea is to influence political discourse.

1065
00:53:11,493 --> 00:53:14,813
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of what we're trying to do with our game is we realize there really

1066
00:53:14,853 --> 00:53:20,015
wasn't a game like that with the message that it had that was unabashedly positive.

1067
00:53:20,695 --> 00:53:27,160
that there wasn't like you know kind of a last minute reel in of like both sides are just as bad and

1068
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:35,247
yeah so the other thing we we have in the UK things called CICs community interest companies

1069
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:38,329
And there are certainly games adjacent companies in there.

1070
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:44,653
There's things like SpecialEffect, which is trying to give people with disabilities access

1071
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:47,095
to ways to play games in different ways.

1072
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:51,217
And they're a sort of non-profit community interest company.

1073
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:56,981
Similarly, we have a company local to us who has set up a retro arcade and co-op working

1074
00:53:57,341 --> 00:54:01,404
space for developers to work in, and that's done as a community interest company.

1075
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:07,707
And it actually opens up a lot more things like government grants, because they're giving

1076
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,328
money to you to help you improve the community.

1077
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:12,029
So it's actually a really interesting structure.

1078
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,811
But I've not seen it from the point of view of game developers directly.

1079
00:54:26,779 --> 00:54:31,464
And Toby Salkin, the founder, is an advocate for other game

1080
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:32,766
companies to become e-ports.

1081
00:54:33,326 --> 00:54:36,730
So I think there's a lot of interest in that.

1082
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:36,930
OK.

1083
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:37,871
We'll check later.

1084
00:54:38,032 --> 00:54:38,592
Thank you very much.

1085
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,531
Hi, my name is Jamie.

1086
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:49,592
I'm an independent developer based in Phoenix.

1087
00:54:51,213 --> 00:54:54,475
My question for you all is, how do you go from already

1088
00:54:54,535 --> 00:54:59,098
having a small studio or a small LLC to actually biting

1089
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:00,259
the bullet to make this change?

1090
00:55:00,499 --> 00:55:04,301
It seems like there's a lot of interpersonal lifting and

1091
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:05,702
convincing that has to happen.

1092
00:55:07,207 --> 00:55:11,109
a studio that's primarily engineers, we're not terribly good at talking to each other

1093
00:55:11,149 --> 00:55:11,349
part.

1094
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:17,753
So, do you have any suggestions or tips or strategies for how to drive that conversation

1095
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:18,994
and actually become a co-op?

1096
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:20,975
Yeah.

1097
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,477
There's a lot of what we mentioned that's pretty nuts and bolts, right?

1098
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:29,100
You know, a lot of us have some like, you know, political ideals that go into this,

1099
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,460
but you kind of don't need those.

1100
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,382
You can just go, here's how this would benefit all of us.

1101
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:35,603
You know, there's a pretty like, this will be...

1102
00:55:36,152 --> 00:55:37,893
There is an efficiency aspect to it.

1103
00:55:37,973 --> 00:55:40,414
There is an aspect of transparency

1104
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:44,237
with each other, accountability, where we have to hash this out.

1105
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:48,039
Even if there is that solitary life of the engineer,

1106
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:50,841
you can get together and say, OK, well, we all

1107
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:52,822
want to have some control over this space

1108
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:55,964
and what we're doing with our company.

1109
00:55:56,064 --> 00:56:00,426
So you can just, the math checks out, for lack of better words.

1110
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:05,178
I think that you don't necessarily have to be all super high-minded about it.

1111
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:06,718
It's pretty mundane.

1112
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:12,299
This is just a system that can work better and can avoid a lot of problems that we'd

1113
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:13,280
hit down the line.

1114
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,200
So it's not just job security.

1115
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,881
It's just things can make more sense because you're talking about them and discussing them

1116
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:21,042
and working them out together.

1117
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:24,989
And honestly, I think the most practical thing to do, we didn't approach it really from a

1118
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:27,190
political point of view, it wasn't a practical thing.

1119
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:32,132
And the most practical thing we did is simply write it down, is just list, if we changed

1120
00:56:32,312 --> 00:56:33,852
this structure, what would change?

1121
00:56:34,753 --> 00:56:35,553
What are the benefits?

1122
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:36,533
What are the dangers?

1123
00:56:36,553 --> 00:56:37,234
What are the costs?

1124
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:39,714
And make sure that everybody in the company understands that.

1125
00:56:40,175 --> 00:56:44,716
And if you can, for us, we really clearly saw the benefits fall out of that.

1126
00:56:45,337 --> 00:56:47,837
And if the same is true for you, then that's the thing to do.

1127
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:50,338
And if it isn't true for some reason, then maybe don't do it.

1128
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:56,155
Well that and like, you know, kind of what you were talking about of like getting people to talk to each other and stuff.

1129
00:56:56,255 --> 00:57:01,261
I mean, it's all about everybody's schedules and stuff and you don't want to get in the way of other people's work, of course.

1130
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:03,943
And you got to trust people in their departments to do what they're supposed to be doing.

1131
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:11,171
Because that's a big part of, you know, at least my beliefs for worker co-ops is, you know, trust your workers and trust yourself.

1132
00:57:13,337 --> 00:57:25,846
But you know, if you need to, one thing we've done is every, I think it's like pretty much every month, we kind of just tap each other on the shoulder and say, hey, what are you working on? Do you have any concerns?

1133
00:57:26,086 --> 00:57:35,993
Like, you know, let's talk about the months ahead and kind of keep it succinct so it doesn't just ramble on and then everybody goes back to working on what they're working on.

1134
00:57:37,273 --> 00:57:41,456
Yeah, at the risk of rambling on, we haven't really talked about communication in huge depth here,

1135
00:57:41,476 --> 00:57:44,019
but communication is vital to any of these things.

1136
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:48,102
But it is to any company, right? If you're doing a company right, it should be all about communication.

1137
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:53,266
Yeah, like one of the big things that we're continuously talking about is how we do that.

1138
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:59,011
Do we do like a structured stand-up, you know, every day, like, you know, agile development and all that?

1139
00:57:59,031 --> 00:58:01,533
Or do we do like a once-a-week thing? Like, how do we keep in contact?

1140
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:05,877
And it is, you can't get around the human side of talking to each other, unfortunately.

1141
00:58:07,847 --> 00:58:09,048
Alright, gracias por todos.

1142
00:58:30,495 --> 00:58:34,916
people eventually who are doing a job that is not something you can do, or not

1143
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:37,757
something that's sort of in your core skill set. How do you deal with

1144
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,499
subcontracting? Do you do that, or do you staff up, or what's the process for

1145
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:47,881
bringing on more people? Especially if you're starting with a low budget. So one

1146
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:52,223
of the things that we did was we kind of just discussed amongst ourselves like

1147
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:55,404
What are the things we're going to need intermittently?

1148
00:58:56,264 --> 00:58:59,746
And do the people we're talking to, do they have other skills

1149
00:58:59,766 --> 00:59:00,906
that they can bring to the table?

1150
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:04,647
Because with a small team like ours, a lot of us

1151
00:59:04,687 --> 00:59:05,488
wear different hats.

1152
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:09,589
So I'll handle a lot of the business side of things and

1153
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,431
talk to the publisher and arrange travel and stuff like

1154
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:14,171
that, even though I'm.

1155
00:59:15,022 --> 00:59:21,027
artist on the team. But when it comes to stuff like needing concept art or animation or stuff

1156
00:59:21,047 --> 00:59:25,030
like that, we'll contract out. But we kind of have it in our best practices that we always

1157
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:32,456
make sure that no one works for free. We pay all of our contractors. And if we can't, if

1158
00:59:32,476 --> 00:59:34,197
like someone comes to us and they're

1159
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:36,478
you know, fees are outside of our budget.

1160
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:37,239
We're honest about it.

1161
00:59:37,259 --> 00:59:39,280
We're like, you know, say, hey, we think you're great.

1162
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,741
We love the stuff that you're doing,

1163
00:59:40,861 --> 00:59:41,922
but it's outside of our budget

1164
00:59:41,962 --> 00:59:43,743
and we're not gonna make you, you know,

1165
00:59:44,603 --> 00:59:46,164
lower your prices just because

1166
00:59:46,265 --> 00:59:48,146
you think we're fun folks to work with.

1167
00:59:48,226 --> 00:59:49,907
So we wanna make sure everyone comes out of this

1168
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,589
feeling good and feeling like their labor was worth it.

1169
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,531
I think for us, like,

1170
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:56,951
the way I think about that kind of stuff,

1171
00:59:56,971 --> 00:59:58,733
because this is, as someone who was a contractor

1172
00:59:58,753 --> 01:00:00,033
for a long time, I think about this.

1173
01:00:00,502 --> 01:00:02,182
And it's like, if we're a co-op, right,

1174
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,844
and all of us together open a pizza place,

1175
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:06,165
we're all just gonna make pizzas.

1176
01:00:06,205 --> 01:00:07,805
What we do is make pizzas, right?

1177
01:00:07,846 --> 01:00:11,127
We all put in our money and we get a shop and an oven

1178
01:00:11,147 --> 01:00:12,068
and we're making this stuff.

1179
01:00:12,528 --> 01:00:14,669
But we're gonna have to hire someone to paint our sign

1180
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:16,310
or design our menus.

1181
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:18,611
We don't do all that stuff.

1182
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:22,173
Or design our furniture once we get big enough

1183
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:23,454
to have a nice dining room and all that.

1184
01:00:25,732 --> 01:00:29,554
At least with us, there's an idea of, yeah, what are these

1185
01:00:29,654 --> 01:00:31,735
core skills that we bring to it?

1186
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:35,296
We don't want to end up in a situation where we have

1187
01:00:35,336 --> 01:00:38,638
someone who's basically just a contractor, but they just

1188
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,259
don't have a vote, and they're not on the team.

1189
01:00:40,379 --> 01:00:42,500
Yeah, I was going to say, how do you avoid the co-op

1190
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,961
becoming the bosses of the subcontractors that you're

1191
01:00:44,981 --> 01:00:45,281
working with?

1192
01:00:45,641 --> 01:00:49,523
I think that part of that is there are certain situations

1193
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:53,105
where there are, yeah, when you contract someone in, there

1194
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:55,046
is a task, and you do talk to them.

1195
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:59,377
There's all kinds of ways that you can actually make that a non-terrible process,

1196
01:00:59,397 --> 01:01:04,365
which I think anyone who's been a contractor can list out really quickly,

1197
01:01:04,385 --> 01:01:05,126
the things you should do.

1198
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:08,372
Crediting, prominently paying.

1199
01:01:09,546 --> 01:01:13,729
having very, like, and talking to them like you would talk with anybody else.

1200
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,112
The people who actually get to vote in the co-op are the people who are in the co-op.

1201
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:21,995
When people are kind of onboarded, like, like Siva was saying, there's kind of like a probational period

1202
01:01:22,035 --> 01:01:26,399
so that you can decide if you actually like each other enough to kind of enter into this kind of thing.

1203
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:29,641
But with contractors, you just do the best that you can

1204
01:01:30,302 --> 01:01:36,686
and don't end up in a situation where you're relying on them to be the workforce for your co-op.

1205
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:40,624
and stuff. So it's one of those things you have to keep yourself accountable on.

1206
01:01:44,886 --> 01:01:47,467
Last question. Sorry everyone else in line.

1207
01:01:47,487 --> 01:01:50,548
I think some of us might hang out afterwards to talk to.

1208
01:01:50,688 --> 01:01:54,050
Alright, well we'll keep this quick then. I'm MJ, I'm from Salt Lake City.

1209
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:58,112
I'm a graduate student in games and production. What advice do you have for

1210
01:01:58,152 --> 01:02:01,273
somebody who is a leftist who wants to enter the industry and wants to work

1211
01:02:01,293 --> 01:02:02,073
under a co-op to

1212
01:02:02,374 --> 01:02:04,755
get your foot in the door in this area that's more exclusive?

1213
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:10,239
Well, as Scott said, there aren't that many places that

1214
01:02:10,279 --> 01:02:10,959
are doing it yet.

1215
01:02:11,619 --> 01:02:14,279
But as somebody getting in the industry, I mean, for my

1216
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:16,460
money, it would be kind of following what I've been

1217
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,420
saying, which is find other people to team up with.

1218
01:02:19,121 --> 01:02:21,001
If you have a set of skills and you're entering as a

1219
01:02:21,021 --> 01:02:23,842
freelancer, then maybe consider doing what we did

1220
01:02:24,082 --> 01:02:25,922
and see if you can find other people with those skills who

1221
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:26,582
are equally looking.

1222
01:02:26,602 --> 01:02:28,423
And you've got double the power to do that.

1223
01:02:28,463 --> 01:02:29,403
That's one way to approach it.

1224
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:33,244
Just jumping in to be part of a cooperative, I guess it's

1225
01:02:33,304 --> 01:02:34,104
find a cooperative.

1226
01:02:35,727 --> 01:02:40,629
I think also, like, it is very, now is the time to get these things started.

1227
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:44,410
You don't have to, like, all of us came to these, like, differently, right?

1228
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,251
Like, there's freelancers and gig economy workers.

1229
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:49,651
There's people whose studios transitioned into that.

1230
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:55,713
There's, you know, Bethany and I, we had enough money to get a studio going, and so we decided

1231
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:56,353
to go with that thing.

1232
01:02:56,713 --> 01:03:00,654
But often, like, a lot of co-ops, they don't start with everyone working full-time together

1233
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,015
all the time, right?

1234
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:03,935
Like, you can start something like this.

1235
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,796
while you're all doing contract work

1236
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,417
or working with something like that and build it up.

1237
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:10,318
Like that's kind of what we did with Pixel Pushers.

1238
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,659
Yeah, that's what we did as well.

1239
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,782
Yeah, so it's not just always like a off the,

1240
01:03:15,502 --> 01:03:17,244
right off the blocks, we found it a co-op

1241
01:03:17,264 --> 01:03:18,585
and we're like running and stuff.

1242
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:20,987
Because there's difficulties, there's like,

1243
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,167
you know, you have to build up resources,

1244
01:03:22,187 --> 01:03:24,309
you have to see if you work together as a team,

1245
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:26,471
you know, you have to work out your like bylaws

1246
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,592
and all kinds of stuff.

1247
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:30,534
And actually go to the co-op resource.

1248
01:03:31,364 --> 01:03:35,367
URL up there for all kinds of information on this kind of stuff.

1249
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:39,209
So I guess it would be kind of like just be flexible with it.

1250
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:47,374
And maybe start something with some like-minded folks and kind of build it up into being the

1251
01:03:47,414 --> 01:03:48,215
thing that you want it to be.

1252
01:03:48,235 --> 01:03:51,757
Because it doesn't have to be your full-time job immediately, which is good because there's

1253
01:03:51,797 --> 01:03:52,558
not many of them.

1254
01:03:52,898 --> 01:03:57,761
And if you're just starting something, it might take a while to get it to the point

1255
01:03:57,781 --> 01:03:59,662
where it's, you know, your life.

1256
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:05,280
And stuff. So that would be, I think, that's a big smattering of advice.

1257
01:04:05,961 --> 01:04:06,582
Cool. Thank you.

1258
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:09,525
Okay. I think that's it. I think they're going to kick us out.
