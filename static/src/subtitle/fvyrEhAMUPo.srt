00:00:08,168 --> 00:00:16,750
Hello. Welcome to the most amazing talk at GDC. This talk

2
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,830
is called Gods and Dumps. I'll get to why it's called that in a

3
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,151
bit. It's about attribute tuning. Specifically this is

4
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:25,631
very narrowly focused on tuning attributes in Pillars of

5
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:33,253
Eternity. Who am I? Who are any of us really? I am a game

6
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:36,033
director, Josh Sawyer. I'm at Obsidian Entertainment where I

7
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,053
have been for the past 11 years.

8
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,547
I've been a tabletop role playing gamer for about 30

9
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:45,569
years. I started with basic Dungeons and Dragons. I've been

10
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:48,750
a CRPG developer for the past 17 years starting at Black Isle

11
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,312
Studios. Actually this month. And I started out doing area and

12
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:58,734
narrative design. But I primarily focus on system design

13
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:03,736
and direction these days. What are we even talking about?

14
00:01:04,612 --> 00:01:16,558
We're talking about Pillars of Eternity. If you're not familiar with the game, it was a Kickstarter-funded game that is inspired by the Infinity Engine role-playing games from the late 90s, early 2000s.

15
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:20,240
That means Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment.

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,722
And we had 77,000 amazing backers who helped us raise over $4 million.

17
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:33,586
And we released the game in 2015, and we just finished releasing the second part of our expansion, The White March, earlier this year.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,161
We are specifically talking about attributes,

19
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,281
or what is commonly called ability scores

20
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:40,402
in Dungeons and Dragons.

21
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:42,482
This is your strength, dex, constitution,

22
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:43,282
all that sort of stuff.

23
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,023
I'm amazed this talk was approved,

24
00:01:46,363 --> 00:01:49,084
because this is easily the most narrowly focused talk

25
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:49,624
I've ever given.

26
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:52,524
I'm gonna be talking about things

27
00:01:52,624 --> 00:01:54,825
using the terms viable and optimal.

28
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:56,565
I'd like to define those,

29
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:57,886
just so it's clear what I'm talking about.

30
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:02,267
Viable means you can actually get through the game with it,

31
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:04,027
like your character will live.

32
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:10,343
And I don't really mean by the skin of your teeth, I mean like you can actually do it. It's not a nightmare of frustration.

33
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:16,766
Optimal means the sort of high end where a min-maxer will take a character by, you know,

34
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:19,627
scrimping and scraping and finding every single bonus they can possibly get.

35
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:26,569
A big focus that we had on pillars was to kind of try to reduce the gulf between viability and the optimal end.

36
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,491
It makes it a lot easier to balance, but obviously we want min-maxers to be able to go crazy because that's fun.

37
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:39,860
even though I hate fun by the way. What I mean by gods and dumps is it's kind of

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,622
common when people are talking about stats in games to talk about things in

39
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:47,705
terms of a god stat or a dump stat. A god stat is a stat that is extremely

40
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:52,368
extremely good for the class or a build. You always want to max that out as much

41
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:55,630
as possible. A dump stat is a stat that you can just

42
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:57,986
Put it in the toilet like nobody cares.

43
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,468
It's not going to really affect your character, how you play the game.

44
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,750
Maybe a class doesn't rely on that stat at all.

45
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:04,892
And that's something that we are watching out for

46
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,914
throughout the course of development of Pillars.

47
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,156
So I'm going to go back into the archives because Pillars of

48
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:14,537
Eternity is a very nostalgia-driven game.

49
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:17,378
Obviously, we were inspired by the Infinity Engine games.

50
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,459
The Infinity Engine games were based on Advanced Dungeons and

51
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,260
Dragons second edition, except for Icewind Dale 2, which was

52
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,662
third edition D&D. So there's a big legacy there that we had to

53
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:27,502
pay attention to.

54
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:29,583
We didn't have to do exactly what those games did.

55
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,544
But if we strayed too far away, then understandably our

56
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:35,625
backers would be kind of annoyed at a minimum.

57
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:41,081
So what we're really talking about when we mean attributes and class-based role-playing games is AD&D.

58
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:43,243
Dungeons & Dragons and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.

59
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:49,869
A lot of games have their own variations on this, but really it started with pre-Basic.

60
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,370
It started before Basic.

61
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,894
There's a version of Dungeons & Dragons that's just after Chainmail, which was the...

62
00:03:56,314 --> 00:03:59,176
sort of hardcore tactical tabletop war game.

63
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:01,738
And even that had stats back then.

64
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:03,699
So they go back a very long way,

65
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,400
but lots of games have them now.

66
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,382
Ultima, Final Fantasy games have them, Dark Souls have them.

67
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:10,884
Lots of games that have classes also have ability scores.

68
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,365
Those can come into conflict, which I'll be talking about,

69
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:15,306
but it's very widespread in role-playing games

70
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:16,227
for these things to exist.

71
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:18,208
They're used to define and distinguish

72
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,750
the fundamental things about a character.

73
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,291
So how strong they are, how tough they are,

74
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:24,132
how smart they are.

75
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:28,450
how well-spoken they are, these sort of very basic concepts of a character.

76
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,730
Originally, in the olden days, they were always random.

77
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,892
Actually, what I found when I was doing some research is that

78
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:37,234
in the first Dungeons & Dragons before BASIC,

79
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:40,556
the dungeon master actually rolled the stats for the player's characters,

80
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:41,617
which is kind of crazy.

81
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:44,599
But yeah, there's a big emphasis on randomization,

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,441
but eventually, over time, it shifted to point-by.

83
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,683
Computer role-playing games tend to have things as point-by because,

84
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:53,465
you know, otherwise people just sit there and they roll and roll and roll and roll,

85
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:56,408
which some people have fun with, but it makes it kind of hard to balance the game that way.

86
00:04:57,913 --> 00:05:11,959
And yeah, so the traditional stats in Dungeons & Dragons are strength, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, charisma, and can anyone remember the seventh attribute that was in...

87
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,780
Thank you.

88
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,042
Seventh attribute that was introduced in Unearthed Arcana was comeliness, and it went away immediately in second edition.

89
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:24,445
Yeah, because how beautiful your character was is not necessarily the most important stat to have in D&D.

90
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,044
So in the olden times, meaning from basic through second edition, you would roll your dice and then you would figure out what class you could be.

91
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:42,591
So it wasn't, and it's actually interesting, if you go back and you look at the text in the old player's handbooks, it really does say roll your stats, then think about what character you want to make.

92
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:48,195
Whereas I think now, especially in the language of player's handbooks and things like that, you sort of conceive a character.

93
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:52,178
and then maybe you roller your allocate stats, but you kind of do it in that order.

94
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,481
But in the olden days, it really was like, well, maybe you can play a paladin.

95
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:58,763
I mean, can you get a 17 charisma? Because then you can play a paladin.

96
00:05:58,803 --> 00:05:59,964
If not, you're not playing a paladin.

97
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:03,655
There were lots of dump stats, a whole bunch of them.

98
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:06,717
So there were plenty of stats that classes could ignore, it didn't really matter.

99
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:08,257
And there were big dead ranges.

100
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:15,720
I'll talk about scaling of values, but in a lot of cases D&D, AD&D, between 8 and 14,

101
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,221
not a lot really changed.

102
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:20,963
Or if they did change, they were really minor secondary things like carry weight and stuff

103
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:21,283
like that.

104
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,924
Oh, you know what?

105
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:24,704
I just forgot to tell you guys.

106
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,265
We do have review forms.

107
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,586
I'm sorry, I'm completely ruining the flow of time.

108
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,392
We do have review forms for this. Please fill out the evaluations at the end.

109
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:36,896
And if you have cell phones, please silence them. I was supposed to say that at the beginning, but I screwed up. Anyway.

110
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:42,360
So because of the fact that you were rolling these, and because you had these big dead zones,

111
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,423
and you have these requirements for how you play the class, viability was always in question.

112
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,446
You might not be able to play a character of a certain class, or if you allocated stats,

113
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:53,869
they might be so bad that that character would either immediately die.

114
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:57,754
like in the first session or they would eventually just run

115
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,895
out of steam and you couldn't practically speaking play them

116
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:03,457
anymore. I'll give a few examples of how this might work.

117
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:08,279
So here's one. The reasonably intelligent wizard in AD&D. Make

118
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,261
a wizard with a 14 intelligence. It's a bad idea. You might say

119
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:15,502
like, well, 14 on a scale of 3 to 18, 14 sounds pretty high.

120
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:18,964
According to the player's handbook, I have 140 IQ. I'm a

121
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:22,065
genius. I'm an amazing wizard. Wrong. You suck.

122
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,380
Because as soon as you advance to 13th level, you're going to

123
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,983
realize you can't cast 7th level spells or higher. So you can

124
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:33,126
keep advancing, but you're not doing crap. I mean, you can find

125
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:36,269
ways to boost your intelligence, but if you built your character

126
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:38,672
that way, you're going to run into some trouble. You thought

127
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,294
you were going to be this dude. You're this dude.

128
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,143
reasonably strong fighter in AD&D. This is not quite as bad.

129
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:52,308
So you start with a 15 strength. By the way, Khalid in Baldur's

130
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:54,490
Gate had a 15 strength. I'm just going to mention that because

131
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:58,214
it's not a very good strength score. And then you take

132
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:00,276
specialization because fighters specialize in weapons.

133
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:03,609
And your damage is really, really bad.

134
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,450
So if you use a two-handed sword

135
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,412
against medium or small creatures,

136
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,013
just in case anyone's wondering,

137
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,435
you'll do 1d10 plus two,

138
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,076
because you have specialization,

139
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:14,878
which is 7.5 average damage,

140
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,700
versus 1d10 plus eight, which is 13.5 average damage.

141
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:20,342
That's pretty bad.

142
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,503
And you might say, well, I'm gonna get some more stuff later

143
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:24,004
so I can work my way out of this hole.

144
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,505
So you get up to 13th level, you take grand mastery,

145
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:28,566
you're using combat and tactics rules, whatever.

146
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:30,727
So, and then you get a plus four weapon

147
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,508
and your damage is still terrible.

148
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,549
And the thing is now it's even worse

149
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:37,511
because this is being multiplied across multiple attacks.

150
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:41,473
So this gulf is like, you can play this way,

151
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:43,654
but this character is way worse

152
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:45,395
than the character that's sort of maxed out.

153
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:46,135
So.

154
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,578
You thought you were going to be this guy, but you're this guy.

155
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:52,840
In 3rd edition there was a shift.

156
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:56,283
The explicit class requirements went away.

157
00:08:56,523 --> 00:09:00,306
So it no longer said, hey, you have to have a 17 charisma to be a paladin.

158
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:03,368
There were lots of implicit things that you were supposed to do.

159
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:06,490
Usually you could see them if you read the abilities and said,

160
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,072
oh wow, a lot of my abilities are based off of wisdom or charisma.

161
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:10,653
I should probably focus on that.

162
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:18,045
Bonus XP for your class disappeared. So there was a thing in AD&D where if you had higher than a certain thing in your main stats

163
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:21,989
Then you'd get more XP which is giving a reward to someone that's already doing really well

164
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:24,351
So they got rid of that because that's weird

165
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:29,315
Also a third edition got rid of the the nonlinear progression

166
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:35,480
So they went to every even point every even step you would get plus one so that changed the feeling of it

167
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,963
It is much more consistent, but that sort of massive ramp up at each end went away

168
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:42,810
There were multiple builds that were viable.

169
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,031
You could build characters in a few different ways.

170
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,712
Not necessarily optimal,

171
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,753
especially as you get to higher level in third edition.

172
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,053
That stuff gets really tricky.

173
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:53,215
Some of the classes arguably required

174
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:54,735
only three stats to be pretty good.

175
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:57,757
Others like monks and paladins are very notable

176
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,298
because they need four to be at least kind of good.

177
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:01,699
Or if you do not do that,

178
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,960
then some of your class abilities will be stinky poo poo.

179
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:08,838
And then D&D introduced Splatbooks.

180
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:13,982
If you're not familiar with the term Splatbook, it's an expansion book that usually introduces a bunch of crazy stuff.

181
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:18,464
Like cool new prestige classes and insane feats that your DM should say no to.

182
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:23,387
But they introduced lots of neat gimmick build possibilities because

183
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:26,669
you could do something like make a high intelligence fighter

184
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,233
that was actually a good character. Whereas if you made a high charisma or a high intelligence fighter in core third edition

185
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,321
That's a shitty fighter.

186
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,243
Like, that might be a really cool character to role play with.

187
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,045
That character is very bad at doing their job,

188
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:42,246
which is fighting.

189
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,131
3.5, or 3E and 3.5 is really a min-maxer's delight.

190
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:52,093
It clarified a lot of rules,

191
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,135
but it left a lot of room for optimization.

192
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:56,596
So, you know, it said, well here are all the rules,

193
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:58,057
but here are all these bonus types.

194
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,639
So if you can search through every single source book

195
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,100
and combine bonuses in the right way,

196
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,862
you can just really go crazy.

197
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,073
People made a lot of character builders for 3EN 3.5 and for Pathfinder.

198
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:12,857
Those character builders allow you to rapidly see where all these stats can come from.

199
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:15,139
And people are insane on online forums.

200
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:18,923
They're crazy. They'll come up with really, really crazy stuff.

201
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:23,608
As an example of this, I like to use the example of Lollerskate.

202
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,519
there is a forum, something awful, and in their traditional games forum they had this

203
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,160
ultra high level

204
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:33,202
character contest to see who could make the most insane character

205
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:35,824
and the winner was an insane australian person

206
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,125
who

207
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,147
made this

208
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:43,229
you can't see the stats super clearly but this is ludicrous

209
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,713
he's like a yontianathema and he had like seven classes or six classes

210
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,734
and seven hundred and fifty five hit points

211
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:51,635
uh... so yeah you could go

212
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,397
you can go really really really crazy in third edition D&D

213
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:58,281
And so people really like to min-max, but we also know that

214
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,784
when the potential for min-maxing the optimal character,

215
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:05,026
when that character gets too far away from the viable character,

216
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:08,029
it's really hard to balance content in any meaningful way

217
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:09,510
because the gulf is so huge.

218
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:14,274
So in Pillars of Eternity, when we set out to make our ability scores,

219
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:15,515
we had a few goals.

220
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:18,818
These things were not necessarily things that we started out with,

221
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:20,520
but that we moved toward them over time.

222
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,581
Six attributes.

223
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:25,898
which is very, is D&D's,

224
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,441
class abilities that are not explicitly associated

225
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:30,102
with attributes.

226
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,044
So for example, if you look at

227
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:33,425
third edition Dungeons and Dragons,

228
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:36,268
a paladin's smite is in part based off

229
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:37,149
of their charisma score.

230
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,130
We didn't do things like that where classes

231
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,052
have very specific abilities keyed

232
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,193
to specific ability scores.

233
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,232
The statistics, the attributes would influence statistics of importance to all classes.

234
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:52,753
And obviously, there's variability in there as to how significant that is,

235
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:56,414
but our goal was to say, try to influence things that all classes use,

236
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:59,895
rather than things that classes can safely, some classes can safely ignore,

237
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,516
or they don't have any meaning to them, because then you get into situations where

238
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:08,158
you can just dump stuff, or certain classes really need stats, more stats than other classes.

239
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:11,827
A primary goal is no bad builds.

240
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:17,395
What that really means in practice is that if you have an idea for a wacky character,

241
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:22,462
like the super genius barbarian, that is a viable character.

242
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,867
Doesn't mean it's necessarily an optimal character, but it is a viable character.

243
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:34,372
So we wanted people to be able to make the crazy characters like their charismatic fighter, or their clumsy rogue, or whatever sort of weird thing they wanted to come up with.

244
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:39,756
And instead of that being a character that is just fundamentally, you're not going to get anywhere with it, it was viable.

245
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:41,357
Not optimal, but viable.

246
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:46,580
And we had a secondary goal, which was to ensure that dumping stats stung a little bit.

247
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,945
This was kind of a reality check on our systems, just to make sure that, you know, like if we thought a benefit from a stat was really important, if people dumped it...

248
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,687
Then really they didn't think the bonus that was being granted was that important.

249
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,770
So we needed to go back and look at it again.

250
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:02,713
So why did we do these things?

251
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:04,535
Why do we have six attributes?

252
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:06,117
Tradition.

253
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,039
I mean that's the main thing.

254
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,883
We asked our fans on our forums and

255
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,187
they'd be like, you know, somewhere between five and seven.

256
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:15,807
I don't know, maybe...

257
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:21,118
six, I guess. But it was pretty common. I mean, some people

258
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:25,022
genuinely did say like 05 or 07, but a lot of people said six.

259
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:28,807
They wanted six. It felt comfortable. It fit this type

260
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,589
of game. So that's what we did.

261
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:36,706
Also, there were some nice things though that pairs worked out well for our three secondary defenses

262
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:40,328
Which are fortitude, reflex, and will. And defenses are not opt-out

263
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,850
I saw someone who made a more elegant sort of way of saying this but

264
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:48,773
Defenses are things that you use when you're attacked and as long as the content actually

265
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:52,716
Attacks these different defenses with some regularity the player can't

266
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,987
They can't not participate in that, if that makes sense.

267
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:58,890
Whereas certain things in D&D, like if you say like,

268
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,892
I don't care how long the duration of anything is,

269
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:02,313
so I'm gonna just dump this stat.

270
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,395
Defenses, as long as they're being attacked,

271
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:07,598
you don't want them to be bad because you will suffer for it.

272
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:10,762
So six attributes worked into three pairs

273
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,263
and that worked out pretty well.

274
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:16,968
Classibility is not associated with attributes. The reason we did this is

275
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:22,271
if you make explicit ties between certain stats and fundamental classibilities

276
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:26,093
then there's an emphasis there on viability. So it's sort of saying if you

277
00:15:26,213 --> 00:15:28,074
don't max out a stat or if you don't

278
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,535
have the stat at at least a pretty decent value

279
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:31,976
this character sucks.

280
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,397
So for comparison if you think about the example of

281
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:38,319
the wizard with the 14 intelligence and D&D

282
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,500
versus intellect and pillars of eternity

283
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,421
intellect affects durations and it affects area of effect.

284
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:45,465
for all characters in Pillars of Eternity.

285
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:49,612
So you can make a wizard that has small, low durations and small area of effect.

286
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,955
That's actually fine.

287
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:54,721
It's not going to prevent the character from learning spells or casting spells or anything like that.

288
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:55,803
So there's a big difference there.

289
00:15:56,918 --> 00:16:01,523
Similarly, if you look at Charisma in 3rd edition D&D, it's extremely important for paladins.

290
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:04,667
It affects their defenses, it affects their smite, it affects all sorts of things.

291
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:08,071
Resolve is not anywhere near the same for paladins.

292
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:11,415
It's a nice defensive stat, it boosts their deflection, increases their concentration,

293
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,057
so if they're on the front lines, it's important,

294
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:17,061
but it's not vital and it's not associated with any of their class abilities directly.

295
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,775
And the sort of question that I ask is, if something is required for viable play, why is it an option?

296
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:31,681
Like, we want players to make meaningful choices and not put in gotchas and traps that say like,

297
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:34,864
well yeah, you can kind of put these stats wherever you want, but not really.

298
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:37,987
Like, you can dump this. No, you can't.

299
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:42,130
So if something's required for viability, that shouldn't be an option.

300
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,674
So rather we would say, no, none of these are required for viable play, so it is really an option.

301
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:52,112
So, influencing statistics of importance to all classes.

302
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,715
This took a long time, and as I'll say later,

303
00:16:54,795 --> 00:16:59,181
we had to actually revise this during beta and post-launch

304
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:02,345
and into a couple of patches, so that process was fun.

305
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:05,149
But this is, someone put this together

306
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:07,111
on the Pillars of Eternity Gamepedia site,

307
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:07,752
which is very nice.

308
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,734
But it shows how things are affected.

309
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:13,376
So you can see that each pair of stats

310
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,017
contributes to one of the secondary defenses.

311
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,358
Two of the stats, or actually one of the stats

312
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:19,479
contributes to two defenses, which is resolve.

313
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,061
Those defenses are important to everyone.

314
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,242
Even if you have a character, for example,

315
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,743
that's not on the front lines,

316
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:27,504
deflection is still attacked by arrows

317
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:28,705
and guns and things like that.

318
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,806
So you don't want to tank any of those.

319
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:33,027
Endurance and health are important to everyone.

320
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,447
Obviously for frontline characters,

321
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,427
they're a little more important,

322
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:37,588
but if you're playing a class like a wizard

323
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,848
that already does not have much endurance or health,

324
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:42,089
dumping that will be not good,

325
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,989
and giving it a boost will be nice

326
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:45,129
if you want to be a character

327
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:46,210
that wades into the front lines.

328
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,890
Damage and healing is important to everyone.

329
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,811
Action speed is important to everyone.

330
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,931
Interrupt and basically the ability

331
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,092
to interrupt someone with an attack.

332
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,174
Concentration, which is the ability to resist that.

333
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,437
Accuracy, which is used for resolving every attack.

334
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:03,037
You get the point.

335
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:06,180
So the idea is that this is stuff that all classes use

336
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,543
because they all have abilities that rely on them broadly.

337
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:12,646
And that was to make sure that if you wanted to build

338
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,527
a character of a certain type,

339
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:14,868
you could play towards those strengths.

340
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:17,690
So why do we not want to have bad builds?

341
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,013
Well, role-playing is about building and expressing

342
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,694
a character both through social interactions

343
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:24,276
and through mechanics.

344
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:30,769
And viability limitations, as I suggested before, can result in mid or late game roadblocks.

345
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:36,392
You know, as the challenge sort of ramps up, you may find that how you built your character doesn't work.

346
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:40,594
And, you know, I've seen so many people playing a lot of role-playing games that said like,

347
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:45,177
I got eight hours in, and I realized I did this all wrong, and now I have to start all over.

348
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,098
Some people think that's fun. I don't think most people do.

349
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:54,905
And if we have fewer viability limitations, then we have more viable character concepts.

350
00:18:55,285 --> 00:19:00,266
So you can make the perceptive genius barbarian, which is actually a pretty darn good character in Pillars of Eternity,

351
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:03,827
because they affect a very large area with their carnage and they're very accurate.

352
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,888
You can make the idiot muscle wizard, which is a favorite of mine.

353
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:10,969
So that's a wizard that has a low intellect but has a very high might.

354
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:15,490
So they don't have big areas of effect, they don't have long durations, but they do a huge amount of damage.

355
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,031
Because might in Pillars of Eternity affects all damage, not just weapon damage.

356
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,026
But spell damage. All sorts of damage.

357
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:25,829
Or you can make the clumsy Determined Rogue, who has a low dexterity and a high resolve.

358
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:28,871
They go into the front lines, they have good defense, good concentration.

359
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,552
They don't attack that quickly, but they can still do a lot of damage.

360
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,673
And they have good defenses for frontline attacks.

361
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:39,141
We wanted to avoid the cool concept, bad character problem.

362
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:42,964
So I have been a dungeon master for most of the time that I've been playing D&D

363
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:48,468
and I really hate the feeling when someone has a really cool idea for a character that is a sucky character.

364
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,771
Because they have a dream of playing this wacky dude or lady

365
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:56,494
and I have to kind of say like, there's nothing...

366
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,435
Like the game doesn't support that.

367
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:00,397
Like you're not going to be able to make anything like that.

368
00:20:00,437 --> 00:20:01,318
That character's going to die.

369
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:05,100
Or you're going to be frustrated playing them because they're going to fail all their checks. It's not going to be good.

370
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:06,901
So how does this happen?

371
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:09,643
How it happens is that ability scores in classes can conflict.

372
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:13,485
If you say class A is good at X, Y, and Z.

373
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,966
For example, causing damage.

374
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:16,607
Rogues are good at causing damage.

375
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,749
But ability B drastically impacts X and Z,

376
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,170
then those are in conflict.

377
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,192
Because it means that if you set ability B to some low value,

378
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:28,295
you're basically torpedoing the thing that your class is supposed to be good at.

379
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:37,222
The mechanics and the content balanced around one another run into problems when these things are sort of, you know, converging.

380
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:43,307
So in D&D terms, a warrior's two-hit armor class zero, or base attack bonus, goes up,

381
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:47,530
and their strength is kind of supposed to be high, and probably will get higher,

382
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:53,915
and thus armor classes for monsters increase, assuming that those things are going up together.

383
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:59,958
If they're not, then that character is going to fall behind and they're not going to be able to actually hit those characters as much as they should.

384
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:03,679
So the example of the reasonably strong fighter I gave before.

385
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,361
The other thing is that strength also affects your chance to hit.

386
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:12,443
So that character not only is doing less damage per hit, but is hitting less frequently, so they're even further behind.

387
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:16,767
Another example is rogues and reflex saves.

388
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:18,768
They're already high.

389
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:21,289
They have skills that are very good and based off of dexterity.

390
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:25,170
They assume that your dexterity is high, so reflex saving throws

391
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,691
and the difficulty classes of the skills that they use

392
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:30,292
assume that those are both high.

393
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:31,933
If you're not min-maxing them,

394
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,974
then it's very difficult for the DM, or in our case,

395
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,695
as people designing a computer role-playing game that doesn't adapt

396
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,055
to the player's stats,

397
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:42,737
it's very difficult to find a difficulty class that actually works.

398
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:47,782
So you get this thing, the cool concept, the smart fighter that is bad in practice.

399
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:52,606
The failure to min-max your key attributes means that your totals are lower overall,

400
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:55,929
and the content that scales assuming that the player is min-maxing

401
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,472
will just leave suboptimal characters behind. And that's where you get that

402
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:03,476
mid-game non-viability or late-game mid-viability. Both are very frustrating.

403
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:07,543
We wanted to ensure that dumping would sting.

404
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,544
So dumping a stat is again like if you,

405
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:10,825
you know it starts at 10 and you're like,

406
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:12,185
I don't need this and you take it down to three

407
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,346
and then you put the point somewhere else.

408
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:15,287
So why did we want to ensure that dumping stings?

409
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:16,688
It wasn't to be punitive.

410
00:22:16,728 --> 00:22:18,548
We weren't trying to say like, we'll get you player.

411
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,970
But it was supposed to be a reality check.

412
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,711
So again, if we said, hey, we put this stat

413
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:27,252
or this thing on this attribute, for example,

414
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:28,853
area of effect and duration.

415
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:34,338
So we think area of effect and duration are important, and we think the value we give to it is important.

416
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:38,201
But if we see players continually dumping them, then clearly it is not important to them.

417
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:43,766
That might be a perception problem, which I should also say that a huge part of balance is actually just the player's perception.

418
00:22:44,307 --> 00:22:48,010
Whatever the sort of... there's no objective sort of understanding of it. It's all what they perceive of it.

419
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:53,055
So if they're dumping it, you have to find a way to either communicate it better, or you have to look at the values of what it's affecting.

420
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,496
If people don't care about dumping it, it's not that important. Go back.

421
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:01,500
And choice and consequence is important to obsidian games.

422
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,344
We make role-playing games and in our role-playing games we think that if you make choices

423
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,868
there should be consequences for those. Good consequences and also bad consequences.

424
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,490
So that is another part of it is how you build your character.

425
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,192
There are trade-offs to how you do that.

426
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,376
Here's some good things about how this all turned out.

427
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:21,677
I'll start with good things and then I'll go to the things people didn't like.

428
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,680
It is hard to make non-viable characters.

429
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:27,703
Unless you're playing on the path of the dam difficulty, which is

430
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:29,484
the highest level of difficulty,

431
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:31,867
it's pretty hard to make a character that can't

432
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:32,988
get through the game.

433
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,372
And as long as you play toward the strengths of whatever the build of the

434
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:40,574
character is, like again, if you make a barbarian that has a high

435
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:41,495
intellect...

436
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:45,257
You want to emphasize your carnage, which is your big AoE melee attack.

437
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:50,160
And other things that have an area of effect and duration-based effects, because that's what int affects.

438
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:54,422
It's easy to build a lot of unusual and viable character concepts.

439
00:23:54,482 --> 00:24:00,826
I've seen lots of people that propose a lot of the weird, weird characters that if you tried to make them in D&D would just be bad characters.

440
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,828
But they're able to play them in Pillars of Eternity and they're just fine.

441
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:08,891
And they love playing them because they had that fantasy and that's part of why we allow people to do these things.

442
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:13,682
It is not hard to make different optimal builds that emphasize different things.

443
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:17,166
Again, I'm not going to say that everything can be made into an optimal build

444
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:19,789
because then they wouldn't be optimal. Optimal is sort of the cream of the crop.

445
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,452
So I've seen people make an interrupt-focused barbarian,

446
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:24,555
so a barbarian that really focuses on just...

447
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:29,518
Causing hit reactions on a lot of enemies at once they ramp up their int they ramp up their perception

448
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,259
And they just smack those guys all day long

449
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:36,501
A lot of people will make gish muscle wizards gishes are sort of the fighter wizard combos

450
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:41,784
They emphasize personal buffs and summoning spell weapons super strong and powerful

451
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:49,888
Versus a crowd control wizard this is someone who focuses very heavily on big AoEs stun locking enemies keeping them locked down lots of debuffs

452
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:55,396
And minmaxers can still go wild. Like, you can't make Lawler skate in this.

453
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:58,018
No one can make Lawler skate.

454
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:02,843
By the way, did I mention that that guy lost a semester of his university making that character?

455
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:07,707
I personally admire that a hell of a lot because I was a terrible student.

456
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,550
But yeah, minmaxers can still go crazy on this stuff.

457
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,314
Yeah, it does not get as wild as 3E or 3.5, but there's a lot of room for optimization in it.

458
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:21,267
And despite the relative simplicity, the mechanics still allow for a lot of interesting analysis.

459
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:26,109
So for example, accuracy and damage is a common trade-off.

460
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:32,091
Each point of perception that a character has in Pillars of Eternity adds one on a 100 point scale.

461
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:39,695
to accuracy. And that shifts your miss, graze, hit, and crit ranges for all attacks. Now one point is

462
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:45,198
not very much, but it's shifting that whole, all those attack windows. And so people do perceive

463
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:49,861
that as being valuable. It's not, you know, crazy powerful, but it does make a difference.

464
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:55,604
Each point of might adds three percent to damage and healing from any source.

465
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,467
So again, casting spells, shooting a gun, stabbing someone with a knife, whatever, those

466
00:26:00,507 --> 00:26:01,990
are all affected by your Might Score.

467
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:07,398
If a character casts a healing spell, casts Lay on Hands, or Cure Samana, then that is

468
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:08,319
affected by your Might Score.

469
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:13,056
So certain builds will rely more heavily on accuracy than damage output.

470
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,317
So for example, the crowd control wizard that I mentioned,

471
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:18,660
they're not really focusing on doing damage, but they really want to hit.

472
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,922
They want their accuracy to be as high as possible.

473
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:24,485
So with that you can say like, well, my might doesn't really need to be that high

474
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:27,027
because I'm not really focusing on doing damage, that's other characters doing that,

475
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,790
I'm debuffing people, and I just want to make sure that they're more likely to hit or crit.

476
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,651
And so people do breakdowns and analyses of these, and a lot of it comes down to personal preference.

477
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:38,652
What sort of character do you want to make, and how do you want to make that, or how do you want to play that character?

478
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:41,873
So that's always good, is that we do want that room for interpretation in there.

479
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:46,734
If it's really open and shut, well this is superior all the time, then we kind of screwed up.

480
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:49,475
So here are some common criticisms.

481
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:54,696
Things people either didn't like, or continue to not like about Pillars of Eternity attributes.

482
00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:56,737
They aren't realistic.

483
00:26:58,297 --> 00:26:59,298
I'm not going to argue that they are.

484
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:01,864
They don't have enough of an impact.

485
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:05,207
Certainly compared to D&D, I think that's a fair criticism.

486
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:09,090
Perceived lack of value, when again this goes back to

487
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,992
the difference between what the numerical value is

488
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:13,794
and what people really understand of that value.

489
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:16,876
And the companions are awful, oh my god.

490
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,778
The worst stats you've ever seen.

491
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:21,380
We'll see about that.

492
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:23,361
So they aren't realistic.

493
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,653
Well, AD&D is not super realistic either, which is kind of our starting point.

494
00:27:30,893 --> 00:27:32,794
AD&D kind of has some interesting things.

495
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:37,177
There are certain things that it seems like it is really trying to simulate.

496
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:40,939
Like it is really trying to say, like, no, this is like things work in the real world.

497
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,061
Also, you can jump off of a cloud castle.

498
00:27:44,722 --> 00:27:49,023
fall and take 20d6 damage and get up and dust yourself off and that's fine

499
00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:53,405
so it's not super concerned necessarily with verisimilitude

500
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:55,366
being really like reality

501
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:59,928
pillars already abstracts a lot there's a lot of stuff we already knew we were

502
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:02,369
going to abstract so for us realism was not a priority

503
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:06,791
so you know for players who say that it is not realistic and and we go

504
00:28:06,891 --> 00:28:08,412
even we i would say we go even

505
00:28:09,012 --> 00:28:10,933
uh... further in some cases so for example might

506
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:16,895
affects gun damage, it affects spell damage, it affects, you know, melee weapon damage.

507
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:22,258
That's not realistic. That's done so that all that stuff is on one stat rather than being spread out in a way that

508
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:26,980
certain classes can kind of ignore certain stats or it doubles up for certain people,

509
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,081
which is what happens in D&D. Like if you get things that align on one stat,

510
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:33,823
then you're always supposed to max that and it doesn't make any sense to, you know,

511
00:28:33,863 --> 00:28:36,484
focus on the thing that affects the damage types that you don't use.

512
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:41,888
So, our focus was to try to make good gameplay out of these stats and realism was not really a priority for us.

513
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:44,449
Not enough impact.

514
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:53,516
So, because we wanted these characters to be ensured to be viable, that means that that limited their relative impact.

515
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:58,820
If you have something that goes up this high at the highest end and it drops down this low,

516
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:05,104
there's a big chance, because that gulf is so huge, that something about the viability of the character is dropping into the netherworld.

517
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:11,229
So, whereas if you keep it in a more constrained range, it's much more likely to avoid viability problems.

518
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:15,072
If you dump that stat, the character will suffer, but they're not an unplayable character.

519
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:20,656
If you give a wizard in D&D a three constitution, they get one hit point per level and will die.

520
00:29:23,168 --> 00:29:25,289
Linear scaling means that we have a regular progression.

521
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:28,190
So if you look at the strength table that I'm going to show you in a bit,

522
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,991
you'll notice that there's a big dead zone,

523
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:32,072
and then it ramps up pretty quickly at the ends.

524
00:29:32,232 --> 00:29:35,353
And so there is a much more significant sense of progression

525
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,473
once you start really ramping up things like strength.

526
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:41,875
You're like, wow, like, the difference between these scores is really, really huge.

527
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,836
But it kind of ignores the dead zone in the middle.

528
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:48,197
So when you have a linear scaling, that does mean that it just kind of goes up at a very regular pace.

529
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:51,399
Third edition skips the odd numbers.

530
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,080
So they actually get a sort of skewed thing where

531
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,901
every two points it goes up.

532
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,843
So it's a different feeling than having a little teeny increment every single point.

533
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,162
And we were trying to avoid what we already were known,

534
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:08,203
and when I say known, I mean by the designers of D&D,

535
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,383
imbalances in the scores.

536
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:12,944
So if you look at some of the ways that things were designed

537
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:13,904
in third edition or 3.5,

538
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,786
they understand that strength is an insane stat.

539
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,466
It affects two hit, it affects damage,

540
00:30:19,786 --> 00:30:21,087
or rather it affects base attack bonus,

541
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,988
or being added to attack bonus, and damage.

542
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:28,589
And so, for example, half-orcs get twice as many penalties

543
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,610
as they get bonuses because they get a plus two to strength.

544
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,875
because they knew that if you give a half-orc a 20 strength and give them a great axe, they are going to chop through the entire world.

545
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:43,941
So we knew, based on looking at how they designed those mechanics by reverse engineering how they tried to solve those problems,

546
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,223
that they knew that they were too powerful.

547
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:54,650
So we said like, well, you know, we know that these things are crazy, so let's scale them back so that they're more balanced across the spectrum.

548
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,529
So as an example, if you look at strength in D&D,

549
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,810
if you have a two-handed sword with an 1800 strength,

550
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,390
which is sort of like, you know,

551
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:05,431
good times, top human strength,

552
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:07,432
you're doing 1D 10 plus six.

553
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:11,713
One to 10 plus six is a lot better in terms of percentage

554
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:12,633
than 14 to 20 plus 24%.

555
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:18,253
So yes, much bigger impact in D&D.

556
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,093
So if you want your stats to have a huge impact,

557
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:22,854
we decided to err on the side of viability,

558
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:26,134
not making characters really swing really wildly

559
00:31:26,174 --> 00:31:27,475
in terms of how their stats were built up.

560
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,056
So this table shows AD&D strength damage adjustment.

561
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:34,256
This is for comparison.

562
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:36,216
You can see that big dead zone in the middle

563
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:36,976
where it's just flat.

564
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:39,877
That means there's no damage bonus.

565
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:41,497
This is only looking at damage bonuses.

566
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:42,898
There are other things that strength affects,

567
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:43,898
but it's primarily damage.

568
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:48,440
Assuming a two-handed sword because it's 1 to 10 that means I can do percentage modification. It's easy

569
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,062
If you use d8 then suddenly that's an even bigger percentage modification

570
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:58,004
But you can see how it it kind of has some spots where it'll go to points

571
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:02,645
And flatten out and then it you know keeps going up and then at 25 strength

572
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:05,607
They just go and get an extra you get an extra plus one for fun

573
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:09,088
So there's not really a lot of rhyme or reason to it. I should also note that

574
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:12,972
Before 3rd edition, strength had this weird percentile system.

575
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:15,355
So if you were a warrior and you had an 18 strength, you'd get...

576
00:32:15,756 --> 00:32:19,441
you'd roll percentile, and that's how they incremented above 18 until you got to 19.

577
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:20,762
That's why this chart is weird.

578
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:21,964
D&D is weird.

579
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:22,825
You got it.

580
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:27,797
Now if you look at Pillars of Eternity strength damage adjustment,

581
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:30,039
you can see that this is extremely linear.

582
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:31,439
It's going up by 3%

583
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,241
just so you can go back. You can see 140 is the top end

584
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:39,524
at 25 strength. For us, 30 is the top end and that's 60 strength.

585
00:32:40,464 --> 00:32:41,545
So it is quite a bit

586
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:42,966
less of an impact,

587
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:44,447
but again that is by design.

588
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:46,868
Some people don't like that and that is

589
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:48,069
okay,

590
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:49,669
but we're not changing it.

591
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:53,757
And then there's problems with perceived lack of value.

592
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:57,261
And again, balance and perception of value is

593
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:01,446
not just about what you set up, but about what the player actually perceives about it.

594
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,889
And lots of stuff goes into perception of strength.

595
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:07,833
I mean, I talked to someone, one of our system designers, who had worked on a game where

596
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:11,076
a gun was in a test and everyone was like,

597
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:12,117
God, this gun sucks.

598
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:13,438
Like, this is so horrible.

599
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:14,799
Everything about it is just junk.

600
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:15,880
I never want to use it.

601
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,962
And then they went through a tuning phase

602
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:21,605
and they changed the audio effects on the gun.

603
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:24,207
And they did not change any of the stats.

604
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:26,249
And they put it, you know, they did another test.

605
00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:28,811
And the player's like, oh man, that gun's so good now.

606
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:30,912
It's, you guys got it.

607
00:33:31,213 --> 00:33:33,154
And it was just purely, it was purely audio.

608
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:34,916
So lots of things go into perception of these things.

609
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:41,771
So why did people have problems perceiving the impact of stuff or continue to have trouble perceiving them?

610
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:48,801
One is that percentages are hard if you ask people to do percentile modifiers like yeah, this is

611
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:50,343
23% better like they're not immediately like

612
00:33:51,314 --> 00:33:51,794
Yeah, I got it.

613
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:56,417
So, you know, they kind of round off, but sometimes it gets difficult to do those versus

614
00:33:56,717 --> 00:33:59,319
oh, 1 to 10 plus 6, that is a little easier to conceive.

615
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,400
Larger numerical values pose problems.

616
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:06,283
So for various reasons we used bigger numerical ranges.

617
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:10,905
I think you noticed before our greatswords do 14 to 20 points of damage.

618
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:14,948
So once you start saying like, hey, you have two or three digit numbers that you're supposed

619
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:18,350
to do percentile operators on, players kind of start going like, I don't...

620
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:21,753
I kind of get that, but I don't really get it.

621
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:25,209
And we didn't have great feedback in the UI initially.

622
00:34:25,549 --> 00:34:27,870
Thankfully, Brian McIntosh and Kez Uruga

623
00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:30,511
have improved this a great deal

624
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:32,372
so that players can actually see comparisons,

625
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:34,673
like this is the base, this is the modified version,

626
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:37,093
these are all the things that are contributing to this value.

627
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:40,214
Transparency within the UI is extremely important.

628
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:42,895
And that was a reason why, though,

629
00:34:42,935 --> 00:34:44,516
is that early on, people were just like,

630
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:46,297
I don't, I mean, it says this damage value,

631
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,237
I don't know what the base is,

632
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:48,517
I don't know what's modifying it,

633
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:50,438
I don't know how much my strength

634
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:51,538
is actually contributing to this.

635
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:55,574
And the companions are awful.

636
00:34:58,035 --> 00:34:59,855
So, people complain about the stats

637
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:01,596
of our companions a bunch.

638
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,476
When we designed the companions,

639
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,137
we did them this way for a few reasons.

640
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:08,537
One is that the companions attributes

641
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:10,538
are reflecting who they are as characters.

642
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:12,958
So, we'll go back to the Khaleed example.

643
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,799
Khaleed's not a super tough guy.

644
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,639
He's got a 15 strength, that's okay man.

645
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:20,783
Our attributes are designed to be middle of the road.

646
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:23,365
So, you know, if you make your...

647
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:24,807
Let's say you have a paladin,

648
00:35:25,027 --> 00:35:27,309
and that paladin is superminmaxed for damage.

649
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,872
Our companion paladin, Paladina,

650
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:31,333
is set up to be kind of like,

651
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:32,474
well, you can use her for healing,

652
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:33,435
you can use her for damage,

653
00:35:33,455 --> 00:35:34,656
you can use her for defensive stuff.

654
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:36,839
Her stats are kind of more evenly balanced

655
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:38,320
across what paladins can do.

656
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:44,921
And despite the fact that players, you know, plenty of players have played through On Path of the Damned

657
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:49,303
the hardest difficulty using just the stock vanilla companions without modifying them, and they're just fine.

658
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:52,065
A lot of players are still like, no, I want to change these stats.

659
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:56,448
So I'll give an example of how people kind of change these stats.

660
00:35:57,268 --> 00:35:59,810
First example is Pallagina. She is our paladin companion.

661
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:03,019
Her character is described as being very willful.

662
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:06,041
She's tough, but she describes failing her physical

663
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,803
examinations in the Brotherhood more than once.

664
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,665
Sure she's not especially strong.

665
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:14,448
She is an avian godlike, meaning that she sort of has these bird-like features.

666
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:18,051
She has heightened senses and her eyes are frequently described in reaction text,

667
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,573
like she's very perceptive of things.

668
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:23,096
So the way that I statted this character, because this is the character that I made,

669
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:27,159
it's kind of hard to see there, but she has a 12 might, 13 constitution,

670
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:28,320
you know, nothing too crazy.

671
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,883
And then 14 perception, because she's avian godlike.

672
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:36,988
And, what is that, a 13 intellect and a 15 resolve,

673
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:38,289
because she's very, very strong-willed.

674
00:36:39,461 --> 00:36:42,026
So this is from a mod called Better Companions.

675
00:36:43,488 --> 00:36:48,690
She has a 21 might. She's incredibly strong. She has a

676
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,411
15 con. Okay, that's fair. She has a 4 dexterity. Extremely,

677
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:56,032
extremely clumsy. A 3 perception, which is about as

678
00:36:56,072 --> 00:37:00,473
bad as you could possibly get. She's a genius. She has a 20

679
00:37:00,513 --> 00:37:04,935
intellect and an 18 resolve. So clearly this person wanted to do

680
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:08,956
like one thing. Or actually two things. They wanted to cast land

681
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:09,276
hands.

682
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:13,981
and they wanted to use their auras, because paladins have nice auras.

683
00:37:14,502 --> 00:37:18,607
If you want to hit something, good luck, because you have a three perception, so you're tanking

684
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:21,871
your main attack stat. You can play a paladin this way,

685
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:24,615
but this is like the way that you have to play this paladin.

686
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:30,734
So our stance on this is we don't really care about people adjusting their companion stats.

687
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:36,297
Maybe a little. It does seem weird to see that character who's described in that way be so different from how she's described.

688
00:37:37,678 --> 00:37:39,599
But the attribute system is designed to handle it.

689
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,821
Again, it's robust enough that it doesn't...

690
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:44,442
It's not that that character can't be played, you just have to play them a certain way.

691
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:46,104
So...

692
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,045
Sure.

693
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:49,446
Like, knock yourself out.

694
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:53,808
Here's an example of how you could go crazy with another companion, DevilOfCarrick.

695
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,467
is a rogue that you get in the White March.

696
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,731
A lot of people like to complain about her stats and her armor.

697
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:02,554
She has a relatively modest might score. It's 13.

698
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,958
Might bonuses to damage are not multiplicative, but they add up.

699
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:10,482
So every bonus to damage, they just kind of add up as a percentage modifier.

700
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:14,686
So if you set her might to 18, you'd get an additional 15% damage.

701
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:25,292
But a rogue sneak attack, which is their common, like they just get it all the time, they do it to anyone who's vulnerable to it, is plus 50% damage.

702
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:27,613
So that alone is a huge bonus.

703
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:32,454
Most rogue active abilities add 25% damage, and you get a bunch of those.

704
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:39,096
So just netting 15% more damage is not really... I mean, it's making a difference, but it's not that big of a difference.

705
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:46,647
If you dumped her might down to three, that would be, actually it wouldn't be 30%, I think it'd be, it's about 30% though, I think it's actually 27.

706
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:52,071
But you, it's not that big of a deal, because you're already doing plus 50 from your sneak attack,

707
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:54,652
and you're doing plus 25 on any active ability.

708
00:38:54,992 --> 00:39:00,156
So rogues are good at doing damage, even if you tank their might, they're still pretty good at doing damage.

709
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:03,978
And you probably put those stats somewhere else, so they're getting a bonus somewhere else.

710
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:07,980
Significantly lower damage, but it's certainly not non-viable.

711
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:14,627
So I'd like to talk a little bit now about the changes that we made during the development cycle and after launch.

712
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:20,190
So we did have a pretty extensive beta, which is great. We got a lot of feedback.

713
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,311
A lot of feedback on attributes.

714
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:27,878
Initially, all attributes granted bonuses from one.

715
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,602
So, if you looked at the scale before, like D&D,

716
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:34,565
D&D kind of is balanced around nine as being neutral,

717
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:36,126
and then things above that give a bonus,

718
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,207
things below it give a penalty.

719
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:38,528
So we said, no, no, no.

720
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:40,530
Or actually, I should say, it's my responsibility.

721
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,092
I said, yeah, at one, that gives you a bonus.

722
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:45,072
And it just keeps getting better.

723
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:46,873
Well, people didn't really dig that.

724
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,913
It was different from D&D, which in itself,

725
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,094
some people don't respond well to.

726
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,194
The other thing is that we have this concept

727
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:55,575
of perceived loss, like our perception of loss

728
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:57,555
is way stronger than our perception of value.

729
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:00,176
So with that sense of we want people to feel

730
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:03,057
like dumping a stat is not really a great thing.

731
00:40:03,477 --> 00:40:05,417
As soon as we set those, like we basically

732
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,937
just normalized all the math and then said,

733
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:09,858
oh yeah, a 10 is zero, and if you go down one,

734
00:40:10,138 --> 00:40:11,819
you're at minus 3% damage.

735
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:12,679
And immediately people are like,

736
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:13,219
you're getting out of here.

737
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:13,759
You're getting out.

738
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:19,263
Like oh my god, I can't put anything to nine and if you look at people's builds a lot of people are really like

739
00:40:19,303 --> 00:40:21,265
They'll take everything down to ten

740
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:28,611
But that perception of badness from going negative is extremely strong and powerful and I knew that at the beginning

741
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:32,634
I should have probably just had them at ten to begin with but well, I didn't

742
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:39,059
We also had perception and resolve both contributed to a deflection. So though we have two things feeding into that stat

743
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:43,696
Perception initially granted plus two to accuracy per point.

744
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,039
Everyone maxed this out as much as possible.

745
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:48,240
It was really dumb.

746
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:51,624
Like everyone in QA made max perception characters,

747
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:54,007
every little teeny bonus they could get to perception

748
00:40:54,027 --> 00:40:55,208
because it's shifting your miss,

749
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:57,050
graze, hit, and crit chances.

750
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,271
It slides the whole thing up.

751
00:40:58,772 --> 00:40:59,593
So that was dumb.

752
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,012
Constitution's bonus to endurance and health was only 3%.

753
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:05,293
This was a minor thing that we adjusted later.

754
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:06,974
Perception modified range.

755
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:08,035
That felt terrible.

756
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:12,558
Intellect modified radius, not area.

757
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:14,699
Those are different things.

758
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,621
And I did it in 3% increments.

759
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:22,285
So, throughout the course of the beta and into launch, and I don't remember when each of these things happened.

760
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:28,450
Like I said, we were, I think we continued patching attributes through patch 2.0 maybe, or maybe even later than that.

761
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:33,414
We averaged attributes around 10, with lesser values inflicting penalties.

762
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:38,919
Perception now contributes to accuracy at one point per, and people seem to find that worthwhile.

763
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:42,121
And resolve contributes to deflection, just by itself.

764
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:47,621
We increased the constitution bonus to 5% and that actually did make a significant difference in how people perceived it.

765
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:52,723
3% to 5% doesn't seem like it would be that big of a deal, but people perceived it as being a bigger deal.

766
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:55,824
And so they actually kind of said, okay, I'm not going to dump this so much anymore.

767
00:41:56,984 --> 00:42:00,685
And intellect modifies area in 5% increments.

768
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:06,507
So you can't make everybody happy. Obviously not everyone was super thrilled with how this worked out.

769
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:13,490
It's true of any design, but we did not set out to try to make everyone happy.

770
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,854
We knew that we had an audience with a variety of tastes.

771
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:22,145
Our implementation was within what we believed our audience's tolerance threshold were.

772
00:42:22,445 --> 00:42:25,246
So we know that some people that play our games,

773
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:28,187
they would rather not have attributes at all.

774
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:31,928
There are role-playing games, like Mass Effect, that has classes,

775
00:42:31,988 --> 00:42:34,189
but it doesn't have attributes at all. You don't have to do that.

776
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:36,650
It's easier when you're not making a fantasy game.

777
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,591
It's easier when you're not making a fantasy game based on D&D very clearly.

778
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:46,536
So we know that some people just sort of ideologically or because of their preferences for system design

779
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:49,058
They'd rather have no attributes at all. That's fine

780
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:55,704
We understand that and we know that a lot of people wish that there were stronger or different attributes and during our beta phase

781
00:42:55,764 --> 00:42:58,346
There were people that got real real upset about how we

782
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:05,292
Initially specced out attributes how we change attributes. There are some people that sort of forswore the game. They're like I'm over this

783
00:43:05,993 --> 00:43:07,914
So people have really strong feelings about this stuff

784
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:15,100
But we knew that there was a big group within our core audience that we could probably make something for them where most of those people would be happy.

785
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:21,626
So usually, you know, I still hear people criticize that, which is sort of like, we wish this were different but it's not a deal breaker.

786
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:26,430
And so that applies to class design, that applies to armor design, like all the stuff that we have in our game.

787
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:32,175
There's a lot of stuff that people will say like, well, we wish this were not quite this way, but we're okay with it as it is.

788
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:35,258
No data to support this. This is just anecdotes.

789
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:39,240
We do have very active forums, lots of people that give feedback, a lot.

790
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,901
Also there are lots of off-sites.

791
00:43:42,382 --> 00:43:51,346
NeoGAF, RPG Codex, Something Awful, lots of very active communities there that have very robust discussions about this stuff.

792
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,911
And ultimately ideological purity doesn't necessarily mean the players are going to be happy.

793
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:01,893
I think it's important to have ideology for what you're doing as a designer,

794
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:04,955
but at a certain point, if what you're trying to accomplish

795
00:44:05,535 --> 00:44:07,556
sort of hits the players and the players go,

796
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:10,177
I don't like this, this isn't fun.

797
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:14,118
Whatever your ideology is, you kind of have to step back and say,

798
00:44:14,138 --> 00:44:16,980
am I approaching this wrong? Is this a bad goal?

799
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,921
Is this not really accomplishing what the players needed to accomplish?

800
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:25,674
So start with an ideological point, but then you know move toward the players

801
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:30,978
In a sense of like you want them to have fun with it. So yeah, that should always be a goal

802
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:34,081
Would we do it this way again?

803
00:44:35,402 --> 00:44:35,902
Probably

804
00:44:37,323 --> 00:44:41,707
The benefits seem to outweigh the drawbacks. I will say that I spent

805
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:48,496
an obscene amount of time talking with people about how to set up these attributes, how to tune these attributes

806
00:44:49,297 --> 00:44:53,041
going back and forth with programmers on it because the math gets really complicated

807
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:57,886
seemingly it wouldn't because we have a simpler system in many ways but it does get very complicated

808
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:00,909
listening to forum feedback and all that stuff

809
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:07,013
It really did take a lot of time and effort to make something that actually accomplished all the goals that we set out to do.

810
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:10,595
And even there, we didn't necessarily do a perfect job on it, obviously.

811
00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:13,677
But the benefits of it do seem to outweigh the drawbacks.

812
00:45:14,397 --> 00:45:18,459
We were happy with the gameplay. So internally, people seemed to like, overall, how stats work.

813
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,782
They like adjusting and getting little stat-boosting bonuses, and using spells and buffs to raise those up.

814
00:45:24,102 --> 00:45:25,043
That's fun gameplay.

815
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:27,084
And most of the players seemed happy too.

816
00:45:27,164 --> 00:45:29,345
Like I said, there are some players that really don't like it.

817
00:45:29,725 --> 00:45:30,466
That is okay.

818
00:45:32,137 --> 00:45:33,318
Would I do this personally? No.

819
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:36,380
I don't like that stuff.

820
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:37,361
Like I don't...

821
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,044
I think attributes conflict with classes. They have a lot of problems. I don't even like

822
00:45:41,064 --> 00:45:42,285
class-based systems. So

823
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:44,987
I've been playing Ars Magica for the past two and a half years.

824
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:46,728
That's a goofy, goofy game.

825
00:45:46,748 --> 00:45:50,531
So yeah, this isn't really about like my personal preferences though. Like as a

826
00:45:50,571 --> 00:45:53,333
designer I'm looking at the audience, I'm looking at their expectations.

827
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:55,595
Obviously we kick-started a game

828
00:45:56,075 --> 00:45:58,657
based on nostalgia and that, you know, that's based in

829
00:45:59,177 --> 00:46:01,519
a lot of memories and feelings and emotions that people have.

830
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:06,020
You know, the point of designing this stuff is not to make something exactly as I want it,

831
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,562
but to make something that I think will make a good game that sort of fulfills the expectations of the people that backed it

832
00:46:12,622 --> 00:46:15,063
and the people that want to come into the genre for the first time.

833
00:46:18,004 --> 00:46:21,125
I do want to thank a bunch of people that helped out with this stuff.

834
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:25,706
I want to thank all of our backers. Obviously we wouldn't have been able to make this game if it were not for them.

835
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:29,377
Our beta testers, we had a subgroup of beta testers,

836
00:46:29,397 --> 00:46:31,598
and we still have beta testers that beta test our patches,

837
00:46:31,638 --> 00:46:32,799
they give a lot of great feedback.

838
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,061
And players, we have a lot of players,

839
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:37,643
we have great YouTubers, a lot of us at work,

840
00:46:37,783 --> 00:46:38,984
you know, we watch these YouTubers

841
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,966
and we see their breakdowns of their analyses of the classes.

842
00:46:42,327 --> 00:46:43,407
Sometimes it's very interesting

843
00:46:43,447 --> 00:46:44,949
to see how they perceive things,

844
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,830
and we understand like, oh crap,

845
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,651
like, they think it works like this.

846
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:50,553
What are we doing wrong here?

847
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,076
Yeah, but players give us a lot of really fantastic feedback.

848
00:46:54,912 --> 00:47:03,697
Our QA testers, I know that, I think that especially in the non-development world, people don't really give QA enough credit.

849
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:09,079
I think that, you know, in development also, I think there are a lot of places where QA is underappreciated.

850
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,642
I spent a lot of time talking with our testers, and I still continue to spend a lot of time talking with our testers.

851
00:47:14,902 --> 00:47:19,965
They play the game all the time. They're trying to min-max and break everything. They have really good insight.

852
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:21,986
into how the game is played.

853
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,687
You know, I don't always agree with their analysis of things,

854
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:25,728
but again, that's the point though,

855
00:47:25,748 --> 00:47:27,169
it's like you want to listen to their viewpoint

856
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:28,610
and hear where they're coming from on that stuff.

857
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,811
But they were extremely valuable in how we built this stuff.

858
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:33,552
And lastly, to Brenda Romero.

859
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:36,834
So I had given up on trying to pitch talks

860
00:47:36,874 --> 00:47:38,055
that were this narrowly focused

861
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:39,496
because every time I did, they were like,

862
00:47:39,536 --> 00:47:41,317
this is really niche, like no one's gonna,

863
00:47:41,797 --> 00:47:42,878
no one cares about this stuff.

864
00:47:43,898 --> 00:47:45,219
So I had gone broader and broader

865
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:46,260
and kind of stopped submitting things

866
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,161
and Brenda Romero actually contacted me and said,

867
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:49,521
hey, I want you to do.

868
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:53,210
are considered doing a really narrowly focused

869
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,132
niche RPG talk, so thanks to her, I was able to do this.

870
00:47:58,193 --> 00:48:02,415
We have some time for questions, if anyone has anything.

871
00:48:02,435 --> 00:48:05,497
Oh, thanks.

872
00:48:05,577 --> 00:48:05,797
Oh, thanks.

873
00:48:05,937 --> 00:48:06,517
Oh, thanks.

874
00:48:06,537 --> 00:48:07,318
Oh, thanks.

875
00:48:14,837 --> 00:48:15,137
Hello.

876
00:48:15,537 --> 00:48:16,518
Hey.

877
00:48:16,638 --> 00:48:17,699
Thanks for a great presentation.

878
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:18,800
Thank you.

879
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,302
In the old, like, Baldur's Gate games,

880
00:48:21,442 --> 00:48:22,483
you usually had dumb stats.

881
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:25,626
And I remember specifically that you had.

882
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:30,279
if you could have a low charisma you can dump that down to three and

883
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:35,821
Like in the first tenth outsider in Akers Dungeon, you can get a ring that set charisma to 18

884
00:48:36,201 --> 00:48:38,562
Yeah, so lots of people did that was like

885
00:48:39,682 --> 00:48:43,764
Go to strategy for many classes. How did you work with items?

886
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:45,184
to

887
00:48:45,944 --> 00:48:48,205
Yeah affect attributes and balance

888
00:48:48,947 --> 00:49:00,154
So the question was, sort of compared to Baldur's Gate where there were lots of items that influenced stats and in fact would set stats to certain values regardless of what their starting value was, how do we approach that in Pillars of Eternity?

889
00:49:00,595 --> 00:49:07,639
So in Pillars, we did something that's more like 3rd edition D&D in the sense that we don't have items that

890
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:11,103
that set stats to certain values.

891
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:14,306
Instead they give bonuses and there are stacking rules for those.

892
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:18,070
So you can min-max them a little bit, but at a certain point

893
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,012
it's only going to take the highest value from that.

894
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:23,196
Part of that is also because if you think about

895
00:49:23,356 --> 00:49:26,639
especially in the context of a single player CRPG

896
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,322
if a person has a strat guide or if a person

897
00:49:29,502 --> 00:49:30,824
read a forum and they already know

898
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:32,985
oh there's a griddle of hill giant strength right here

899
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:36,286
well then they can start dump the points that they would have put in strength

900
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:37,547
they can put them in another stat

901
00:49:38,027 --> 00:49:40,588
go straight to that griddle of hill giant strength

902
00:49:40,928 --> 00:49:43,149
and effectively they're playing with many more points

903
00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:45,190
in their attributes than other players are

904
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,311
so that kind of stinks

905
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:51,413
like obviously it's cool to have game knowledge and like knowledge of the world

906
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:53,493
and be able to beeline for things and get that cool stuff

907
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:54,734
but that advantage

908
00:49:55,154 --> 00:49:58,176
I think should be a marginal advantage. It shouldn't be so gross.

909
00:49:58,196 --> 00:49:59,016
Because the difference...

910
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:01,257
Girdle of Hill Giant Strength is 19 Strength.

911
00:50:01,357 --> 00:50:05,160
If you set your Strength to 3, you just got 16 free attribute points.

912
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,422
So, yeah, we tried to keep those bonuses a little more constrained.

913
00:50:10,002 --> 00:50:12,664
I know that, again, some people would like those to be more significant.

914
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:15,685
In the White March expansion, we added plus 4 items, which...

915
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:16,526
Oh my god!

916
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:20,648
You know, people really like when those step up and they can keep ramping them up.

917
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:22,209
Thank you.

918
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:24,611
Hello.

919
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:25,631
First of all, thanks for the game.

920
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:26,071
It's great.

921
00:50:26,091 --> 00:50:26,951
Thank you.

922
00:50:27,311 --> 00:50:28,752
And I just had a question, actually,

923
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:31,672
about the early process of design

924
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:33,053
and the prototyping process.

925
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,133
Since you were so steeped in tabletop design,

926
00:50:36,674 --> 00:50:39,254
what it was like to test such a complex system,

927
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:42,055
if you went straight to digital or if you did paper prototyping

928
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:45,656
or even a tabletop session, and how that sort of looked like

929
00:50:45,716 --> 00:50:49,117
and how you kind of got to where you are before the code

930
00:50:49,137 --> 00:50:49,457
happened.

931
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:57,279
We did not do any, so the question is if we, how we prototype prior to implementation.

932
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,181
Yep.

933
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:02,345
And since we had a lot of basis in tabletop, did we do any tabletop gaming?

934
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:07,271
We did not. Part of that is because these stats would be a nightmare.

935
00:51:07,892 --> 00:51:09,113
That's funny too, because some people say like,

936
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:10,414
hey, when's the tabletop version of this coming out?

937
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,057
I'm like, you want to do percentile operations on damage ranges that are like double digit?

938
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:15,178
I don't think you actually do.

939
00:51:16,299 --> 00:51:17,700
So we didn't do that.

940
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:20,683
We sort of charted things out in Excel to see like,

941
00:51:20,783 --> 00:51:21,784
what are the boundaries of this?

942
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:26,548
How is this really mapping out with how we're planning out abilities and damage ranges and things like that.

943
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:30,190
So it was mostly sort of, it was theoretical for a very long time

944
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:34,451
But we also, we looked outside of D&D, we looked to other games and said, you know

945
00:51:34,652 --> 00:51:36,712
How do we feel about balance in these games?

946
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:43,195
And what are the sort of margins of influence? Like how impactful are these attributes on that?

947
00:51:43,595 --> 00:51:46,816
And how does that feel for the type of game that we're trying to make?

948
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,417
And the nice thing was that

949
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:55,903
You know, Tim Cain did a lot of the implementation of the attribute things and it was usually pretty easy if I went to him and I said,

950
00:51:56,363 --> 00:52:00,345
I was wrong, like these values are bad, we need to adjust this up or down or whatever.

951
00:52:00,665 --> 00:52:02,265
It was usually pretty quick turnaround.

952
00:52:02,646 --> 00:52:04,987
So we could test out those changes relatively rapidly.

953
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:10,929
But, yeah, I would have done tabletop sort of testing of that stuff.

954
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:16,332
but the mechanics were really designed and we wanted to design them for a CRPG.

955
00:52:16,392 --> 00:52:20,714
We wanted to say like, we got a computer here, we can do lots of calculations really easily

956
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:25,316
for you, we don't have to base things on dice, you know, and so that's why our damage ranges

957
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:27,097
are more things like, you know, 14 to 20.

958
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:28,238
So yeah.

959
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,159
Great, thank you.

960
00:52:30,379 --> 00:52:30,639
Thank you.

961
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,220
Hi.

962
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,100
So obviously...

963
00:52:33,874 --> 00:52:38,136
the tributes are a pretty big exception, but was there anything else that came up kind of organically

964
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:44,698
while you were designing the game that you wanted to put in, but you thought the nostalgia focus wouldn't allow?

965
00:52:45,918 --> 00:52:49,019
Were there things that we wanted to put in that we thought the nostalgia focus wouldn't allow?

966
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:49,059
I...

967
00:52:51,798 --> 00:52:55,060
Not really. There were certain things that we put in that people resisted very strongly

968
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,481
because they weren't kind of part of their vision of what the experience was.

969
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:04,124
So for example, we have firearms in Pillars of Eternity, but they're all like 16th century era firearms.

970
00:53:06,366 --> 00:53:10,270
While Forgotten Realms did have guns as early as second edition

971
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:12,452
They weren't part of the Infinity Engine games at all

972
00:53:12,852 --> 00:53:17,797
And so a lot of people thought that that was just like they were like that's no that doesn't work that that feels completely wrong

973
00:53:18,438 --> 00:53:21,161
And there were certain things that early on we decided

974
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:25,685
We should probably have these because we think of people a lot of people will miss them if they're not there

975
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:29,309
So for example, we have humans we have elves we have dwarves

976
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:31,942
I think a lot of people like humans, elves, and dwarves.

977
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,683
We don't have halflings, we don't have half-orcs.

978
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:36,645
So we were like, eh, we don't need to have those.

979
00:53:36,665 --> 00:53:38,846
We can put in a maw, they're our big race.

980
00:53:39,946 --> 00:53:41,667
And then we have orlins as our small race.

981
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:43,368
So we kind of figured that people like that idea

982
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,809
of like the sort of big race and small race.

983
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,430
We didn't think people were that attached

984
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,451
to the idea of like, I must play my halfling

985
00:53:48,531 --> 00:53:50,112
or gnome in this game, so.

986
00:53:51,073 --> 00:53:51,353
Thank you.

987
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:51,713
Thanks.

988
00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:53,034
Hi.

989
00:53:53,883 --> 00:53:58,126
I was wondering if you could elaborate on the different difficulty options in your game

990
00:53:58,226 --> 00:54:00,267
and kind of how that influenced your attribute design.

991
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:05,730
I find that the higher difficulty goes, usually that leans more towards min-maxing, less towards

992
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,151
viable characters.

993
00:54:07,191 --> 00:54:11,434
And since some of your most dedicated players are going to be interacting with those systems,

994
00:54:11,474 --> 00:54:15,316
I feel like it's better to always look there and not look at viable characters.

995
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:16,777
I was wondering what your experience with that was.

996
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:21,043
So the question is about our difficulty design and how that influenced our attribute design.

997
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:25,346
And so we have easy, normal, hard.

998
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,767
And then we have a few other crazy ones.

999
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:29,668
The most significant of which is Path of the Damned.

1000
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:36,052
And we, except for Path of the Damned, we did not do stat modifications on creatures.

1001
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,093
Instead, we changed the composition of encounters.

1002
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:43,096
So if you're on normal, you might see, you know, like a wizard and two...

1003
00:54:43,996 --> 00:54:49,637
paladins but on hard it's like an archmage it's a completely different like more powerful wizard

1004
00:54:49,977 --> 00:54:55,198
and two paladins and you know like a rogue gets added into the group and and it's in a weird

1005
00:54:55,218 --> 00:54:58,959
position where it makes it more tactically difficult for you to deal with it but path of

1006
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:05,921
the damned was specifically designed for the most aggressive players and so we said like this mode

1007
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:10,242
not only does it have all the creatures from all levels of difficulty but they all have increased

1008
00:55:10,362 --> 00:55:12,922
stats so they have better defenses and better accuracy

1009
00:55:13,682 --> 00:55:20,084
And we kind of said with Path of the Damned, we know that there is a gulf between viable and optimal.

1010
00:55:20,465 --> 00:55:25,026
And this is where the players who want to push that envelope, they need to do that.

1011
00:55:25,746 --> 00:55:28,527
If you just kind of stumble and like, hey, Path of the Damned, what's this?

1012
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:31,929
And you just kind of try to stumble and bumble through, you're probably going to die.

1013
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:36,830
So, yeah, we wanted to make sure that viability for...

1014
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:40,193
characters didn't require crazy optimization even on hard,

1015
00:55:40,514 --> 00:55:41,194
but on Path of the Damned,

1016
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:43,036
there are some really good Path of the Damned players

1017
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:44,538
who don't even feel like you need to optimize

1018
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:45,519
that much on Path of the Damned,

1019
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:46,920
but they're really good players.

1020
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:50,463
Most people have to get a little more ambitious

1021
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:52,125
with how they're looking at their stat spreads

1022
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:52,846
and things like that.

1023
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:55,008
Their gearing becomes much more important

1024
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:55,769
on Path of the Damned.

1025
00:55:56,209 --> 00:55:57,430
So that's how it tied together.

1026
00:55:57,911 --> 00:55:58,191
Thank you.

1027
00:55:58,391 --> 00:55:58,671
You're welcome.

1028
00:55:59,753 --> 00:56:07,196
Yeah, so talking about dump stats, I get the feeling that a lot of RPG players kind of naturally assume that

1029
00:56:07,716 --> 00:56:10,597
You know if you're playing a fighter you want to dump charisma if you're playing, you know wizard

1030
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,538
You want to dump like dexterity or something like that?

1031
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:20,241
How did you guys communicate to new players of your game that you don't necessarily want to you know, just dump all your perception?

1032
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:26,886
Yeah, so that is a tricky thing. And we did have to deal with that a lot. Thanks for bringing that up.

1033
00:56:26,906 --> 00:56:31,008
We did have a thing where people would look at something and they're like, wizard strength? I don't think so.

1034
00:56:31,028 --> 00:56:35,129
And then they're like casting their damage spells and we're like, what the heck is going on?

1035
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:39,533
In D&D, usually stats don't affect your spell damage at all.

1036
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:41,014
So they had no expectation of that.

1037
00:56:41,554 --> 00:56:44,116
So one is again, trying to make the UI reflect,

1038
00:56:45,617 --> 00:56:48,339
clearly say this affects damage, like all damage.

1039
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,681
But the other thing we did is,

1040
00:56:52,102 --> 00:56:54,644
one of our programmers, Robbie, put in a thing where we could

1041
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:57,326
add little stars next to character attributes

1042
00:56:57,827 --> 00:56:59,248
in certain classes to say,

1043
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:01,810
this is kind of important.

1044
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:04,472
To sort of say, you might think this is not important.

1045
00:57:05,385 --> 00:57:05,966
Look again.

1046
00:57:07,027 --> 00:57:12,451
So I think Wizards had like a either a silver or gold star next to might to sort of say like this is more

1047
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:18,496
Significant than you might think it is. You can still dump might but if you dump might you're gonna make a crowd control character

1048
00:57:18,896 --> 00:57:21,098
Or something like that. You're not gonna be focusing on damage

1049
00:57:21,518 --> 00:57:27,843
But yeah, it is a difficult problem because again, you're dealing with a lot of expectations. We also we called it might

1050
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:32,819
Hopefully to make a player go like, wait a minute, isn't that normally strength?

1051
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,301
Is this something different?

1052
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:35,862
It is something different, friend.

1053
00:57:36,362 --> 00:57:37,103
It's something that affects

1054
00:57:37,603 --> 00:57:39,144
damage and healing for everything.

1055
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:41,406
So sometimes it's the nomenclature like

1056
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:44,569
charisma we got rid of and replaced it with resolve.

1057
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:48,152
It's sort of similar but it affects like deflection, it affects concentration.

1058
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:50,093
Very different from how charisma works.

1059
00:57:50,954 --> 00:57:55,036
mechanically in D&D although resolve is also used in conversations for you know

1060
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:59,458
being like a real intense kind of a person so it's difficult but we tried to

1061
00:57:59,578 --> 00:58:03,700
use naming and UI sort of signaling to help guide people in that direction

1062
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:10,463
thanks any last questions all right thank you everyone for coming
