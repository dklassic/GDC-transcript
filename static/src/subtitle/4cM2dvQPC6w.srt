00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:06,647
Hello, my name is Ian Livingston. Thank you so much for joining us today.

2
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:10,729
Today we're going to be discussing UX.

3
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:15,251
We're going to start by just doing a brief introduction of who we are.

4
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,012
Actually, the panel, right? So, playing the middle.

5
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:26,035
This panel is about looking at how UX cross-cuts all the different disciplines within our industry.

6
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:29,656
So, it's about balancing the creativity, the design.

7
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:34,729
the business and the production as well as the science of experience.

8
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:38,012
So that's what we're going to be discussing today and we have a number of great panelists

9
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:39,233
which are going to be helping us with this.

10
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,254
So let's introduce that.

11
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,616
Who am I?

12
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:45,057
As I mentioned, I'm Ian Livingstone.

13
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:45,818
I work at EA.

14
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:50,841
I'm the Senior User Experience Researcher up at EA Canada in Vancouver.

15
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:54,124
I manage a team of researchers up there.

16
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:57,526
We take care of all of the projects that are coming out of Canada.

17
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:07,969
To my right we have Cory May. Actually, let's start with John, sorry. John is from Warner

18
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:15,591
Brothers. Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment. Right. John is a user researcher, has a ton

19
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:19,392
of experience and has worked on a number of different platforms and genres in the many

20
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:22,273
years that he's been here. So you want to introduce yourself, John?

21
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:29,366
Yeah, hello. So yeah, I'm currently working out of Warner Bros. Montreal for Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.

22
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:34,750
I did a quick single decade at Ubisoft before moving over to Warner.

23
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:39,673
Working mostly, I spent a long time on Assassin's Creed with some of the other fine gentlemen on this panel,

24
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:45,036
but did a couple of other interesting projects while I was there and now working out of Montreal on some other cool stuff.

25
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,559
And I'm here to represent the Games User Research...

26
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:53,120
side of this equation of the iron triangle that we're going to talk about.

27
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:59,763
Yeah, I think that's about it. Maybe it's worth mentioning that GamesUR, I think, as

28
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:05,546
well as all the other problems here, they're not solved problems. And so I'm not representing

29
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:09,948
all GamesUser researchers, I think it's safe to say. Other people will have different opinions

30
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,609
on how they would approach similar problems. But I'll do my best to make those of you who

31
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:16,611
raised their hands when he asked who the researchers are, I'll do my best to make you guys proud.

32
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:26,348
To his right we have Corey May. Corey May is a narrative director at 2K. Advocate for the

33
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:28,412
player experience. Corey, you want to introduce yourself?

34
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:29,093
Sure. So...

35
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:33,090
Like Johnny, I spent many years at Ubisoft. I think 12 years.

36
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:41,677
Then I moved to a place called Certain Affinity, and then most recently I have started working at 2K up in Novato.

37
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:48,062
And Johnny knows I've always been a very big fan of user research, of user experience in games.

38
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:52,445
I think it's the language that we developers use to communicate with the players.

39
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:57,328
I believe it serves a critical function in game development.

40
00:02:57,368 --> 00:03:02,630
I think too often it is ignored, and so I just want to let everyone out there know

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,531
that people on the production and creative side do very much care about what you specialize in,

42
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:10,413
and we want to find ways to work together better.

43
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:19,156
Next we have Alex Hutchinson, designer, writer, producer.

44
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:21,582
Freelance.

45
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:21,822
Yeah.

46
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:27,524
So I'm at the moment of, I guess as of Friday, a freelance creative director, which is one

47
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:28,764
step up from homeless person.

48
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:35,486
Before that I was creative director for many years at Ubisoft on Far Cry 4, Assassin's

49
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:35,906
Creed 3.

50
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:38,987
Before that I was a lead designer at Maxis, on Spore, The Sims 2, other games like that.

51
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:45,289
And yes, now I have a PR rep from Ubi staring me right in the face from four feet away.

52
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,570
So I will speak very guardedly.

53
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,068
Next we have Chris Lang. Chris joins us from Bungie.

54
00:03:55,651 --> 00:04:02,162
So yeah, I'm a producer at Bungie. I did a short stand at Obsidian Entertainment for a

55
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:02,422
while.

56
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:06,692
Then I transitioned to platform and services space at Microsoft

57
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:12,778
on Xbox live, focusing on UR and data telemetry. And then I

58
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:16,762
transitioned back to Bungie where now I'm focusing mostly on

59
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:21,647
UI. So I produce a few of the UI teams at Bungie.

60
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,653
Okay, so just a quick overview of how we're going to go through this panel.

61
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:33,556
There will be time for questions at the end, but there's three topics that we want to jump

62
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:34,596
into and dig on.

63
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:39,319
First one we're going to talk about user experience in games, understanding the player, and then

64
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,321
finally feedback in the creative process.

65
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,442
So we can jump straight into that first topic.

66
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:48,737
So this is obviously going to be kind of a general topic.

67
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:52,018
We're going to talk about what user experience is.

68
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:55,119
Obviously, there's a lot of people who know what that is here.

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,500
But when you're looking at it from a different perspective,

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,543
it can actually be quite interesting to see what user experience means in people's day-to-day.

71
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:06,964
So our first question that I'm going to pose to the panelists here,

72
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:10,586
and I think, Alex, you would be a good person to kick this off.

73
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:14,908
What does user experience mean to you in your day-to-day?

74
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,062
Yeah, so I apologize in advance, this is probably the most broad answer that we'll give all day.

75
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,203
What is the thing we're talking about?

76
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:26,124
But for me as a creative director, it's really the culmination of all of the different disciplines that we have in the game.

77
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:31,707
So my job essentially is to try and get people who are much smarter than I am in different disciplines,

78
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,867
who have great levels of expertise in different disciplines,

79
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:38,209
to stay focused on the same idea and expressing the same idea throughout the game.

80
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:40,830
So that when the player touches it, when they experience the game,

81
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,091
that it's consistent and it actually follows through on that idea.

82
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:50,034
So it's everything from, you know, if we do it perfectly, which we never do, but it's

83
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:54,216
everything from, you know, the first boot up sound that you have in the game to the

84
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:59,419
first button we ask you to press to the consistency of the controls to what actual interactions

85
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,379
we give you in the game.

86
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,941
You know, something that always impressed me at Bungie, for example, on the original

87
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,963
Halo was that sound, that sort of operatic, I'm not going to ‑‑

88
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:10,385
I embarrassed myself by doing it. But that sort of rising, you know,

89
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,926
Christiano voices that starts at the start of the Halo games.

90
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,488
It meant you knew it was Halo. It gave you a sense of epicness,

91
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:19,650
a sense of awe before you even started the game. And trying to get that feeling and

92
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,152
whatever it is in your particular game and drive it through the whole experience.

93
00:06:24,073 --> 00:06:27,475
So how important is feeling for user experience?

94
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:32,485
I think it's really important. I like it much more than, I mean we've got data people here so we

95
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:38,727
should all be afraid. But I like the soft data as much as the sort of really hard numbers. The

96
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:42,869
idea that you're driving for a human emotion and you want to get that back and it's very hard to

97
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,751
prove that you have it with a graph. But if you can get it, you can see it in people's faces and

98
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:53,113
you can feel it in their responses. And that for me is the most important bit in terms of picking

99
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:54,333
features and picking elements.

100
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,342
I would definitely argue that both are equally important, right?

101
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:02,863
The joke that I said to some new people when they were coming on the team back in the day was

102
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:07,864
just because people walk out of a movie and they're like, oh yes, I understood that plot

103
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:10,185
doesn't mean that they enjoyed a movie, right?

104
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:14,546
So having both the hard and the soft, the qualitative and the quantitative,

105
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:18,007
both contribute to the sense of validating your vision.

106
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:18,627
For sure.

107
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,482
I have a question for you. A lot of times when we do user testing or play testing, it

108
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:25,364
comes down to numbers. They ask people on a scale of 1 to 5 what did you think.

109
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,591
If I had my way, I would take the numbers out.

110
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:45,793
And you can maybe keep them on your end, but I think any client-facing paper,

111
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,734
like, would you be down with trying to get rid of the numbers?

112
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:52,295
I feel like we have the same problem a lot of times with review scores, right?

113
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,516
People just rush to the number, and they don't necessarily read the review,

114
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:56,916
and I think that can sometimes happen.

115
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:05,147
When you compile this very well-considered, well-researched, well-put-together, thoughtful document,

116
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,990
and everyone raises down to the number, and what the fuck do you do with the number?

117
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,592
It says 4.4. What's a 4.4? No one can do anything with a 4.4.

118
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:17,379
So I agree that there is sort of an important difference between formative testing and summative testing, right?

119
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:23,862
The idea of like giving a score versus, hey, what's, you know, in the general sense, how does this feel and where is it going and how do we move forward?

120
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:24,062
Yeah.

121
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:32,587
But I think Chris would certainly argue that having a number moving, you know, it's important as you push a product through to be able to see that there's some sort of evolution.

122
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:36,249
And certainly for us, an ROI on the service that we provide that says, well, this is moving up.

123
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:41,990
Absolutely in a vacuum. If you work very loosely with a research service and you only test once every six months and they show up and they go,

124
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:46,954
You got a 3.9, it should be a 4.1. There's minimal value there.

125
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:53,600
But having some sort of summative result is useful, particularly let's say for example if you're comparing across items.

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,323
Then now you can say, oh, well maybe we need to invest more in this one or maybe we need to adjust that.

127
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:03,688
I understand your gut of like, but if everybody just races to that one fund number and then they throw the rest of the report out, that's wrong?

128
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,231
But that's you doing it right.

129
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:09,995
What is your in-game economy has a 3.8?

130
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:12,378
That doesn't tell me anything, right?

131
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,841
I want to look at people's actual responses.

132
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,164
So I would say it could point you in the right direction of where to look and say,

133
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:19,367
okay, well, this is the lowest score of all of my systems.

134
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:23,049
And then you go and you continue to dig deeper and you can look at metrics and say, well,

135
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:26,530
they're not engaging with the system. Or you can look at the qualitative and say, oh, they

136
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,452
hate the system. And so at least it can give you some direction. But you're right. It shouldn't

137
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:36,054
be a final answer. Nobody should walk around going, my game is a 3.9. I know, but they do.

138
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:39,576
The worst thing is it's like, don't, don't, don't do that.

139
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:47,319
Good discussion. We have other questions. Okay. So, Corey, kind of building on that, when you're

140
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:53,234
In your opinion, who do you think is ultimately responsible for providing a great user experience?

141
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:57,899
So, originally, my answer to this question was it was the creative director's responsibility.

142
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,179
Whoa, whoa.

143
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,665
I've just, I, I, that said, I'm pulling back a little bit.

144
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:07,490
I think that, you know, since games are intensely collaborative, or at least should be,

145
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,475
It's really everyone's responsibility. It's a shared responsibility.

146
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:14,438
Look, at the end of the day, you have to accept some responsibilities as creative director.

147
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,263
You get, like, all the accolades. You've got to, like, own some of the responsibilities.

148
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,264
We get mostly dance rights these days.

149
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:28,071
But I think that everyone needs to be working together to ensure that the user experience is a smooth one.

150
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:30,272
But yeah, you have to balance that against the other thing.

151
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:33,052
There needs to be some responsibility because if it's like a whole group of people,

152
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:36,253
if there's suddenly like 12 or in games that we've worked on like 40 fucking leads,

153
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:39,654
then the buck has to stop somewhere, right?

154
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:43,794
There has to be a person calling the shots and like making the decisions and assuming responsibility.

155
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:47,975
Otherwise, you run the risk of getting stuck with something that's like designed by a committee

156
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,656
and I don't think anything good has ever come of that.

157
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:55,037
So it's a balance, right? There's no easy answers, I think, to any of this.

158
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:59,619
And like Johnny was saying earlier, I don't know that my answer is the right answer,

159
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,961
or the answer that everyone should take, but I do think it's a shared responsibility by all the leads,

160
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,242
eventually ending with the creative director.

161
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:10,723
Or if you work at other places, maybe it's the producer, actually,

162
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:14,024
because more and more these days, and that's a topic for another day, I suppose.

163
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:14,945
It's a totally different summit.

164
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,085
It's a sad summit.

165
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:25,488
So, actually, kind of following up on that one, Corey, Chris, when you're sitting down

166
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:30,733
and you're looking at what's coming in, how do you go about deciding where you need to

167
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:35,979
focus the efforts of your team and where you need to kind of start sacrificing that vision?

168
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,000
So I think like...

169
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,202
Over the course of development, there's always going to be

170
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,823
multiple things that are competing for attention.

171
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:45,006
And really, it's going to come down to what are the problems

172
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:47,788
that you're trying to solve, and what are you trying to

173
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:48,908
achieve with the product?

174
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,350
And that can be defined.

175
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,552
It's usually defined by creative leadership in some

176
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:56,974
capacity, but the hard part is conveying that to the team.

177
00:11:57,314 --> 00:12:01,577
And so part of my job is to work with creative leadership

178
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:02,318
or creative directors.

179
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:05,981
and understand what is the problem that we're trying to

180
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:08,403
solve and what is the responsibility of this team in

181
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:14,348
that space. So for instance, like Bungie, we have a laundry

182
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:18,931
list of features for the UI team. And I spent a couple hours

183
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:22,294
or multiple hours I should say, talking with our creative

184
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:24,836
director and just getting him in a room and saying, hey, why is

185
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:27,599
this thing important? What is the why here? And that's going

186
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,181
to frame the sandbox that the team works in. And so

187
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:34,707
If you're making a tradeoff between two features or between

188
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:38,189
two different systems, you're going to say which of these is

189
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:39,610
more important for that ultimate goal.

190
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,343
And it's not always as black and white as that, but really it's going to come down to that.

191
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:49,905
There's going to be some compromise, but ultimately there's going to be one that's going to be more important to the experience.

192
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:55,607
So when you're looking at trying to figure out what's more important, do you have things that you're using to try and identify?

193
00:12:55,887 --> 00:13:04,151
Absolutely. So we're looking at community research, user research, internal feedback, also from a protection standpoint, risk.

194
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,733
associated with different features like is this thing

195
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,256
going to ship on time. So all of those things play a part of

196
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:13,239
the conversation and ultimately it's the responsibility of the

197
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,261
creative leadership to make the decision given the data that we

198
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:16,661
can present.

199
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:29,424
Yeah, and I think it's really interesting in the current climate where there are a lot of projects that have very long life cycles that are alive for many years after initial release, that there's a different, I think, way to calibrate the features that you're building based on, is it a first product?

200
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:34,207
You know, are you making something new or the initial game? Or are you keeping something alive?

201
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:40,091
You know, like, I mean, there's been a lot of, you know, information, say, Valve, for example, or Blizzard, when you're maintaining a game over many years.

202
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:44,436
You deal with feedback from users and the situation much differently.

203
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:49,600
Sometimes on a new game, the argument is, I think, we've had this conversation many times,

204
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:53,144
we think this would be fucking amazing. That's the logic, you know what I mean?

205
00:13:53,164 --> 00:14:01,392
At the end of the day, you don't have data yet because it doesn't exist and we'll use people like Dankov or Ian to go through it and try and get some sense of it before we put it in the box.

206
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:04,314
But a lot of it, you know, having 20 people in a room every, you know,

207
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,677
Every couple of weeks is never going to give us the same data.

208
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:11,339
Sometimes you have to back yourself to be like, no, I think this will be amazing.

209
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,381
A good example from Bungie is the controls for the vehicles.

210
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,283
This was testing terribly for years.

211
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:21,385
I remember Hamilton back in the day, the producer on Halo 1 and 2, saying,

212
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:23,186
they hate it, they hate it, but it's right.

213
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:24,487
You know what I mean?

214
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:25,928
Everything in the game controls the same way.

215
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,069
It's consistent controls, it's consistent controls.

216
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:31,291
It worked in the end, but if you'd just gone based on user feedback,

217
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,473
then you would have killed the feature.

218
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:37,554
I'm realizing we have a blind spot on mobile. We're all

219
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:40,556
console guys but mobile also. I'm sure anybody in the room

220
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:44,437
that's working on mobile now is like yeah, of course. We do

221
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:47,578
most of our research in soft launch. That's where we get,

222
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:49,619
like, you know, on mobile games that's where they get the bulk

223
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,020
of the info. I mean, certainly they do usability ahead of time

224
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,801
but there's a richness of data available to them where they're

225
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:57,443
able to pivot very quickly once they're in soft launch that, you

226
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:01,184
know, box products or software service can't really, can't

227
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:02,124
track as quickly.

228
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:05,414
Cool. All right, moving on.

229
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:07,835
Let's move on to our next topic, understanding the player.

230
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:12,137
Okay, so as we know, players are both

231
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:14,978
our biggest customers, obviously,

232
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,339
but also our biggest critics.

233
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,301
And since I hope we can all agree

234
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:23,502
that games are both art and entertainment,

235
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:27,424
the understanding that we develop of those players

236
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:30,185
is absolutely crucial to the overall success

237
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:31,546
of the games that we're making.

238
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:32,706
So.

239
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:34,830
What?

240
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:36,511
This is the one on purpose.

241
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,552
Corey's going to make me mad.

242
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:38,192
Oh, okay.

243
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,093
Because Corey's going to answer this one first.

244
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:40,793
What?

245
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:41,834
Oh, right.

246
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,694
So let me ask the question.

247
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:42,954
Yes.

248
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:46,316
So this is just an abbreviated version.

249
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:47,977
So here's the full question.

250
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:53,759
What has contributed most to your personal understanding of players that you feel others

251
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,541
most often overlook, misunderstand, or misuse?

252
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,822
So I think I'm answering this question right.

253
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:00,282
So.

254
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:16,194
The thing that's been big for me, and yeah, now Johnny will get mad, is that while I appreciate the process of user testing and user research, I feel like we are kept as developers away from the players, and so we never get to communicate with them.

255
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:24,000
We get a document that tells us what they thought. It doesn't often do a very good job at getting to the why. You'll get like a single sentence or a sentence.

256
00:16:26,062 --> 00:16:52,238
I would love to be able to communicate with the players after the fact. So I won't be poisoning your data, but I'd like to sometimes get a better understanding of why they're making the selections that they're making or why they're responding to a feature or an aspect of the game the way they're doing. And they absolutely won't let me do it. And I don't understand why. I mean, maybe

257
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,341
The game's user research is in the audience right now are cringing.

258
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:59,383
But why? Explain to me. What are you so afraid of?

259
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:03,306
Your instinct is right. Your instinct is I want more context for the answers.

260
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:05,307
Yeah, I want to understand my audience.

261
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:10,311
The point is there is a certain amount of rigor that is involved in the process that needs to be maintained.

262
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:15,174
And that if you roll in and you're like, hey, I'm Corey May, the guy that does all the cool stuff that you like, and they go, oh, never mind that.

263
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:16,735
You know what, actually I loved everything.

264
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,696
But that's not going to change your report though, right?

265
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:20,697
They've already shit all over the thing in the report.

266
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:23,158
If we were looking for a more context, and you talk to me ahead of time, like,

267
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:25,139
hey, this is something that I really need to understand better.

268
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,681
Or if you get preliminary data and you go, all right, dig deeper on this,

269
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:32,764
then we can work together on doing it in a way that is properly structured.

270
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:35,965
And then, because if you do it once with one guy, that's a single data point,

271
00:17:35,985 --> 00:17:37,946
then you fall into the trap of a question we're going to get to later,

272
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,247
of like, doing it wrong.

273
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,970
No, and I know, and you know how I feel about that.

274
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,993
Then we can start to get, okay, well, if this is the question that you want, rather than

275
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:49,217
one person, we can formalize the process of gathering the data that you're interested

276
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:54,762
in and get you more substantive and more useful and reliable information on the topic that

277
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,183
you're curious about.

278
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:55,984
But don't you think I'd be...

279
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:59,427
Rather than you rolling at me like, hey, I'm the guy who made the thing, tell me what

280
00:17:59,447 --> 00:17:59,727
you think.

281
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:05,091
I think that that initial conversation could also benefit you as you reshape the test.

282
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:06,792
We should have that conversation, not you.

283
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,015
Why can't we involve... your answer is like not doing it for me.

284
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:14,117
Because if I'm going to do it wrong, is the short answer, you're going to ruin everything.

285
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,680
But the reason you hire a games user researcher is to do that.

286
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,983
I'm just trying to add an extra layer of data, and your job is done at that point, right?

287
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:24,404
I'm not poisoning your...

288
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:27,246
If you still need more context, I would argue that my job is definitely not done.

289
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:29,469
If you're walking away from research results and going,

290
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,232
I still don't understand what my problem is,

291
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,916
then I have failed as a researcher,

292
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:37,501
and we need to have more interesting conversations about what you're looking for

293
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:40,065
so that I can deliver results that are more useful to you.

294
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:41,427
Or I could just talk to the people.

295
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:45,663
Even if you're not engaging with the community in a formal way,

296
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:47,984
where it's like, hey, I'm the creative director, I'm the lead

297
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:48,765
for this team, right?

298
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,206
Engaging with the community in an informal way, just playing

299
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:51,966
your game, right?

300
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,687
In the case of Destiny, right?

301
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:57,029
Playing Destiny with everybody, it's a multiplayer game, that

302
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:00,271
provides a lot of insight that, or context that you don't get

303
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,831
just by looking at research results.

304
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:05,213
And obviously the idea of getting good guard is you have a

305
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:06,534
lot of context in that space.

306
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:10,476
But I think there's something to be said for the organic nature

307
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,696
of those interactions.

308
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,403
We could all wear a fedora and they wouldn't know who we were.

309
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,845
I can't stop you from going on NeoGAF. I know you're going to go.

310
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:24,427
But also another thing that kills me in this context is even with that,

311
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:28,409
even when we have a feature in test and then we get data back and we can or can't

312
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:31,630
speak to them, the thing that kills me is most of the time you're testing an unfinished thing.

313
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,172
So you're taking something in that you know is broken and then they're saying,

314
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:37,332
this sucks and you're like, ugh.

315
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:38,373
Yes, you know, yes.

316
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:39,874
But the goal is to find why it sucks.

317
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:41,194
Well, I mean, if we showed the Marvel movies,

318
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:43,656
everyone's watched those terrible YouTube videos of the Marvel movies

319
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,877
without the special effects of like some, you know,

320
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:49,359
mediocre buff dude jumping off the back of a utility vehicle, you know,

321
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,740
and then like without the effects and the sound and all that sort of stuff,

322
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,222
thinking, oh, this is the worst bit of cosplay that I've ever seen.

323
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:58,484
And, you know, like testing at that point is terrible,

324
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:00,525
but we often get stuck in that point and we have no choice.

325
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,646
I think there's a happy medium there, right?

326
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:04,867
To both Kari and John's point that there's...

327
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:10,040
This is why I think a lot of user researchers will argue that having a creative...

328
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:14,849
in the room, well not in the room, but there when a session is happening, so that they can

329
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:19,290
riff back and forward with the researcher and, you know, point out the things that they're

330
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,512
interested in is something that is really important. And I think a lot of times this...

331
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:25,212
Alternatively, even the stuff not to be interested in.

332
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:25,612
Yeah.

333
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:28,793
You know, if a player gets stuck and they're like, no, don't, and they're like, okay,

334
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,193
we'll just fix it.

335
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:33,134
Yeah, I think there's a lot more to be said about the overall collaboration on how

336
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:36,155
it can be made more useful and still maintain that rigor.

337
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:39,181
I think one way to improve collaboration is to let me talk

338
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:44,946
to the participants. I feel very strongly about this.

339
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:52,832
Okay. Moving on. All right. So this one, this one is to Alex.

340
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,184
Alex, should a game be built for a specific player base, or should a player base be built

341
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:00,486
for a specific game?

342
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:04,830
I think you can discover new audiences, and that's one of the joys of a game.

343
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,151
You know, Spore, we built Spore.

344
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:11,156
We were in our hearts making a game for adults, doing adult things in adult-appropriate environments.

345
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:17,237
and it hit really hard with kids. And I guess that pre-phase, like a lot of stuff that happened

346
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:22,678
with the younger audience later, but like the 12 to 14 set. So you can discover people as you go

347
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:26,199
and that's amazing and I think that's one of the most rewarding parts of building a game.

348
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:34,021
Finding any audience is super rewarding. Sometimes you don't. But I think it's important to have

349
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,361
in your head a clear target of who you want to enjoy it. And I don't mean on a, you know,

350
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:38,702
males.

351
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:43,145
18 to 35, which is horrendous. Anything that's undirected or

352
00:21:43,265 --> 00:21:46,208
unfocused doesn't end up particularly going anywhere or

353
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:50,772
trying to finish and express an idea properly. We often get bad

354
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:55,836
feedback from the marketing department saying who is our

355
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,818
target audience and they'll say everybody.

356
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:02,720
This is not useful information. So I think it's important to sort

357
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,801
of know who you're, or at least along with what idea you're

358
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:08,162
trying to express, who you think would enjoy that and then you

359
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,523
can use a testing process to figure out if it works or maybe

360
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:16,005
you found a new audience. Chris? Yeah, so I'm going to take the

361
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:19,606
cowardly middle of the road approach. So I think, you know,

362
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:23,038
I think if you look at it from a business perspective, like,

363
00:22:23,638 --> 00:22:27,600
you're obviously going to want to attack a preexisting player

364
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,521
base because it's going to provide minimal risk, right?

365
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,242
You're going to, if I'm making a first person shooter, I'm going

366
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:34,723
to target first person shooter players, right?

367
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:41,746
But I think the novelty of creative design is what allows

368
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,868
us to define those new or create those new player bases

369
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:48,550
that then lead to the longevity or the long-lastingness of our

370
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,352
game. I think if you went solely with the we're just going to

371
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:56,614
cater to this one or these few player bases, it's really easy

372
00:22:56,654 --> 00:22:58,775
for a competitor to step in and say, okay, well, we're going to

373
00:22:58,795 --> 00:22:59,415
do the exact same thing.

374
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:03,577
just slightly differently. But it's the novel approaches that

375
00:23:04,277 --> 00:23:09,519
help, you know, turn your new game or your game or move that

376
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,940
preexisting player base into a new player base that then you

377
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,341
don't have many competitors in that space and you can then ride

378
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:18,342
that train for much longer. You know, I think I look at, you

379
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:21,683
know, like Dota from Warcraft 3, right? Like that spawned a whole

380
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:24,564
new genre, a whole new player base and now there's more

381
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:26,324
competitors in that space but for a long time, like, yeah,

382
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:27,424
that was the only competitor in the space.

383
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:30,305
So successful business model.

384
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:34,687
And so I want to take like the idealistic slash naive slash

385
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:38,468
fundamentalist approach which is never mind all of that stuff

386
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:43,489
and like if you believe strongly in what you're creating it will

387
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,390
find an audience. And your mention of Dota is actually

388
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,171
really interesting to me, right? Because I don't think when they

389
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:52,752
were coming up with that there was any like consideration of,

390
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:55,733
you know, they were like this is a cool idea.

391
00:23:57,454 --> 00:24:02,138
It organically grew out of that. You can argue that Riot being the geniuses

392
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:05,721
that they are took a look at that and shaved off the rough edges.

393
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,483
There is an argument ‑‑ I love League of Legends.

394
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:12,126
I feel like the genesis of that came from the heart.

395
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:15,809
It didn't come from a lab or a cynical consideration.

396
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,471
That's just saying the audience is me. They still did it.

397
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:20,893
They just said ‑‑ there were a bunch of dudes.

398
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:23,275
They did the strangely authentic 18 to 35‑year‑old dude.

399
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:26,596
Yeah, but I mean it was specific to them, right?

400
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,157
It was like, what gets me excited?

401
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:31,658
If this is getting me excited, maybe it will excite other people.

402
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:33,259
But also audiences evolve, right?

403
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:38,801
So everyone these days forgets, but The Sims was bought by guys, hardcore gamers first.

404
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:43,277
The first audience was hardcore gamers because they were falling on Sim City.

405
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:44,077
They were super into it.

406
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:47,060
Then they all went, it's kind of interesting, I kind of get it, but it's not really something

407
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,400
for me.

408
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,361
They passed it across.

409
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:52,485
Then the audience went sort of, what it was at the time, but the hardcore female audience

410
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:53,006
at that time.

411
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:57,130
Then it migrated across from them over time and ended up going down to a very young, majority

412
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,790
female audience.

413
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,574
That's where it sort of ended for a long time, but that audience went through multiple phases

414
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:02,915
over its life cycle.

415
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:09,497
It's also interesting talking about the role of defining your audience ahead of time or

416
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:16,081
the creative. I would also argue that that evolves throughout production. There are certain

417
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:19,704
points where you want to have a clear definition because it will help you in a different way

418
00:25:19,844 --> 00:25:20,945
rather than later on where...

419
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,748
The use of personas is something I find interesting, for example,

420
00:25:25,768 --> 00:25:28,990
where it can be really useful very early in a project. But I

421
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,052
found most of the time when I've used it later on, like when it's

422
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:34,494
like to try to find test markets, that it's like, okay,

423
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:37,897
what, you're just giving me a demo information. Like it's not

424
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:40,819
really a persona that you're using anymore. And so certainly

425
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:45,942
the use of defining your UX audience varies from

426
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:48,384
preconception through to like gold or even beta.

427
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:58,220
Cool. All right. Next question. This one's to you, Johnny. I

428
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,580
like this question. I think this is one of my favorite

429
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,221
questions. When has your knowledge failed you, causing

430
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:07,263
you to miss something big or make a poor decision? And how

431
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:08,163
would you avoid that now?

432
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:14,525
Right. I think I bring this one back to the idea of continuously

433
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:15,705
maximizing context.

434
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:18,860
This is a mistake I made on one of the games I was working on

435
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:22,584
back in the day. There was a system, it was like a den

436
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,927
defense type system. And what game could that be, Johnny?

437
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:30,434
But the problem was I didn't fully understand the context of

438
00:26:30,494 --> 00:26:33,877
how it would fit within the game flow and I tested it on its own

439
00:26:34,277 --> 00:26:36,239
and this may come as a shock to some people but it tested

440
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,502
really well. People enjoyed it. And so, you know, it got the

441
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:43,965
GUR stamp of approval like this is a fun thing, cool, moving on.

442
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,808
And then it was only later when I realized exactly how it fit

443
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:51,431
into the overall macro schematic of the systems where the way

444
00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:53,273
that it was sort of presented in the game, um,

445
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:58,698
broke that down a little bit and the context of it broke it.

446
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,600
And so because, you know, if I had been testing it properly I

447
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,782
would have had them playing the regular game and even though

448
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,205
that system wasn't integrated I would have done a hard stop on

449
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,667
what they were doing like do this now and force them that way

450
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,689
because that was the way eventually it would be in the

451
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,831
final product. And so just by lacking...

452
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:19,997
I ended up telling everybody something was fine and I got a

453
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:22,179
very angry phone call when the reviews for that game came out

454
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:24,361
of like, hey, why didn't you spot this?

455
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,392
So again, going back to making sure that you understand the

456
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,394
larger vision and probably that was a conversation that if I had

457
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:36,456
had earlier with the creative director on that one where he

458
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:39,017
explained to me what his end goal vision rather than just

459
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,219
talking to the designer of the specific system who was like,

460
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:43,940
this is how it works. And I'm like, cool, I'll make sure that

461
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,302
they understand how it works. And I never took that step back.

462
00:27:47,823 --> 00:27:51,064
And so that was one of my big like whiffs.

463
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:05,227
So let me think. I think that once upon a time, there was a

464
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:09,982
I would get defensive with some of the results.

465
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,304
I would be like, it's wrong, or they don't know what they're talking about.

466
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:16,765
I think this can be both a blessing and a curse.

467
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:17,945
It's just not in yet.

468
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:23,788
They'll understand later when everything's online and the game is more feature complete.

469
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,168
I think that that was a mistake.

470
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:31,533
I learned my lesson, which is to pay more attention to the data.

471
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:36,979
If you see a trend of people not liking something, or not understanding something, or not appreciating

472
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,842
something, it's very dangerous to put it off.

473
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:42,565
It'll be better in the next test, they just don't understand yet.

474
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:47,791
And to be a little bit more proactive, to get in front of red flags.

475
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:53,115
and warning signs. The other thing, and I think Johnny would be okay with this that I've realized,

476
00:28:53,155 --> 00:28:58,239
is that sometimes you want to be a little bit more selective in terms of who the audience

477
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,063
is that you're putting together for testing. So one of the things that Johnny and I had

478
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:08,608
started developing at Ubisoft before we departed was something called the narrative review

479
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:13,492
process because we found that user testing with kids off the street was not providing

480
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:16,935
us with very useful feedback when it came to story testing.

481
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:20,357
We would basically get a thumbs up or a thumbs down, I like it, I don't like it.

482
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:22,358
And that was it.

483
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,841
And sometimes if you want to dig a little bit deeper, it wasn't going to happen with these kids.

484
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:31,264
So we put together something with the other writers and narrative people inside the studio

485
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:36,188
where we were doing user research, but we were using people who specialized in the craft

486
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:38,329
so that we could get more detailed feedback.

487
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,030
And so we had a very different looking...

488
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,352
survey that dove a lot deeper. Johnny actually let me talk to

489
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:49,154
the participants in that particular instance. But again

490
00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:51,955
that was very targeted in special circumstances. Yeah, so.

491
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:55,430
And we found that it was.

492
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,351
It forbids you forever from speaking to your colleagues.

493
00:29:57,391 --> 00:30:00,873
Yes. So he at least, you know, allowed me to do that.

494
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:02,815
And it was really interesting.

495
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:08,458
And I think we could have done even cooler stuff with it had we not departed.

496
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:13,562
But so that to me something that I think is at least worth exploring,

497
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:17,224
I don't know if it messes things up, is to choose your audience for the test.

498
00:30:17,404 --> 00:30:19,786
And I don't necessarily mean choose a sympathetic audience.

499
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:22,588
Choose an audience that can speak to the stuff that you're testing.

500
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:26,430
So you identified your target audience?

501
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:36,775
Well, I found people that could speak to the topic, not necessarily people that would like

502
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:38,655
the material, right?

503
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:43,778
So it wasn't necessarily a sympathetic audience, it was at least one with a deeper understanding

504
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:44,398
of the subject matter.

505
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:47,540
It's similar, for example, to when you're working on a sequel, you're obviously going

506
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,942
to run some studies on people that are new to it and people that are returning from the

507
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:52,582
previous ones.

508
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,182
So it's similar, yeah.

509
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:56,144
So we can do the same, right, which is like people that have

510
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:59,205
experience with narrative design versus people that are, again,

511
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,907
kids off the street. Because they're often kids off the

512
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:05,849
street, aren't they? Not literally. Never mind. All

513
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:06,669
right. Next question.

514
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:15,614
Okay. Moving on. Moving on. Just leave that one. Okay. So we've

515
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:18,256
gone through our next topic. Feedback in the creative

516
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,836
process. I think this is

517
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,532
I think this is probably the most interesting one.

518
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:28,962
I think a lot of the conversations that we're having right now are kind of ending up on

519
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:31,127
this topic, like how does feedback work?

520
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:37,424
And I would feel that I'm pretty safe that everybody would agree if I said that

521
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:44,188
everybody on a production team has an opinion and there is a huge amount of feedback that comes in for

522
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,249
a game while it's being worked on.

523
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,973
And this feedback can have an effect on the team's morale and it can also be really noisy.

524
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:54,896
It's hard to cut through and get to what's actually important and useful.

525
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:56,657
So

526
00:31:57,878 --> 00:32:01,561
my first question, and I think this one's going to Alex.

527
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:10,171
What is the impact of and what is the best way of managing

528
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:14,516
negative research or data or feedback results on that

529
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:16,157
development? I think it's...

530
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,044
central to the job of the whole leadership crew on the team.

531
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:22,225
It's probably the hardest thing that you can do because as Corey said,

532
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:25,127
you need to be open. You're in this really vulnerable state, right?

533
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:27,849
You need to be open to negative feedback and you really need to listen.

534
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,931
You can't let it destroy you because then you go home and you don't make a game.

535
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:31,712
You know what I mean?

536
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:35,894
So you have to be in this horrible friction state of like listening and then

537
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,076
going for a drink and telling Corey that it's okay, we're going to get there.

538
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:40,497
We're going to, we're going to be okay. And you know,

539
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:43,199
we would have throw down fights and, and, and, and not in,

540
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:46,922
not in an aggressive way, in a sort of upset way.

541
00:32:46,942 --> 00:32:47,863
Do you know what I mean?

542
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:51,647
Because you're really trying to wrestle with the idea of, is it junk?

543
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,371
Have we made a really bad decision and we're making something poor?

544
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:55,572
Or is it unfinished?

545
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:59,557
Or is the audience not understanding it correctly?

546
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:03,221
And so everything we're talking about are these ways of wrestling with the problem of

547
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:06,505
where, honest to God, I know I'm in this room, I'm probably very sympathetic to this idea,

548
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:10,830
But honestly, it always fascinates me that the audience doesn't think that a game team

549
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,933
is a bunch of people trying with everything that they have to make something cool.

550
00:33:14,273 --> 00:33:18,417
And that the only people more upset than the person yelling at you on Twitter if it isn't

551
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,960
good is the people that spent three years of their lives making it.

552
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,243
So it's just a puzzle when you see people.

553
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:39,639
It's horribly wounding. I've seen a lot of people have really difficult times after not just

554
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,843
the release of games but after reviews of features and that sort of stuff. You need to still

555
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:47,326
stay open to the feedback because otherwise you fail in the other direction and you guarantee

556
00:33:47,446 --> 00:33:48,027
that it won't work.

557
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:52,051
At a much more granular concrete level, I think one of the ways

558
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:56,394
that some of us had solved this was really integrating user

559
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,577
research into the processes of the dev team. Making sure that

560
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:03,759
you are completely integrated. It's not a pull for the team to

561
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,422
use your results. For example, we use JIRA at UB and we would

562
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:10,223
All the results would go straight in, they would go to an

563
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:12,264
approver who would look at the research feedback, leave a

564
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:14,665
comment, put it into the next guy who was going to have to

565
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:17,587
write about it, have to fix it and that would get sent to

566
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:21,689
whoever and then go back to the research team. It was a much

567
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:24,350
more integrated process rather than the way when I first

568
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,831
started doing research ten years ago which is here I wrote

569
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:29,092
a thing that says your thing sucks, bye, I'll see you in a

570
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:31,713
month. I think hitting the second half of the point I

571
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:33,594
wanted to make, I got a bit sidetracked by remembering

572
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:34,154
people being upset.

573
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:40,036
is that you know that that's the job of this interaction with the user research group is to try

574
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:44,017
and get some objectivity on it because it isn't just good if it's all emotion and all feelings

575
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:47,878
and all response and your personal belief about something versus another team member's

576
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:52,579
personal belief. You want to get some distance from it so hopefully you can be like Corey

577
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,440
said I feel very strongly about this and then you have to decide whether you keep pushing on

578
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,221
it or maybe you bow to the pressure of whatever feedback you're getting and modify it. But

579
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:07,342
The job on the creative side I think of getting all this data is to try and bleed some of

580
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:11,784
the emotion out of it so you can be objective and know where to make your stands and where

581
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:12,924
to make it easier.

582
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:17,526
I also have a bit of practical advice for the people that have to put these things together

583
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:23,488
so hopefully it will help is that if there's bad news, try and get it in front of people

584
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:25,028
as quickly as possible.

585
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:29,870
If you hide that stuff and then it leaks out, it fucking poisons the team.

586
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:36,098
I've seen it less with user research because they've been pretty open, but mock reviews

587
00:35:36,198 --> 00:35:41,245
will happen at a lot of places these days, and no one talks about it, but I guarantee

588
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,367
you they are going to find out.

589
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:48,234
And if it's being held from people, it will start to feel like a...

590
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:52,417
The publisher, the developer, whatever, management has given up on the team.

591
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:57,561
So you may intend to be shielding them from something, but if you hide it and it leaks

592
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:03,205
out, it is interpreted as like you've abandoned us and everyone gets very upset, morale takes

593
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:05,807
a terrible hit and people become nonfunctional.

594
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,792
A long time ago, it was best practice. That report goes to everybody.

595
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:12,113
Yes, I see it.

596
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:22,143
Because the idea that you think you can pretend that the people working on your game don't know the health and the status of the game, it's dishonest and it's a mistake.

597
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:22,844
Don't hide stuff.

598
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:27,746
It's a very, very big mistake. We can't address issues if we

599
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,368
don't know they exist and if they're just coming up in

600
00:36:30,408 --> 00:36:33,609
whispers and we don't have a way to validate it, it's very bad.

601
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:37,351
So I don't know, someday some of you may have the ability to

602
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:40,752
decide like who gets to see what and I think Johnny's right,

603
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:44,434
err on the side of over sharing. It's necessary.

604
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:47,795
I talk about using research results as a platform for

605
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:51,057
communication. Like even bad results as much as good results.

606
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:52,597
One of the things that

607
00:36:53,872 --> 00:37:01,435
Like I'll say the opposite of everything I just said, but I'll give like a six hour head start to a creative director or producer and be like, listen, man, this is cutting out.

608
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:01,755
Fair.

609
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:03,775
That's just I want to start to think about it.

610
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:09,217
And I want you within an hour of me sending these results that you can send a bullet point like of an action item list.

611
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:09,777
Like we got it.

612
00:37:09,837 --> 00:37:10,897
Like we know this didn't work.

613
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:12,358
We have an action plan.

614
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:13,218
We're going to go into this.

615
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:14,979
That's going to be part of our next sprint.

616
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:15,859
Oh, this was great.

617
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:16,579
We expected that.

618
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:17,259
We worked really hard.

619
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:17,860
Thanks for this team.

620
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,561
And using research results as a platform for really open

621
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:23,583
communication to drive the team can be super, super helpful

622
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:24,583
rather than the opposite.

623
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:26,924
Where if you obfuscate it and you try to pretend like it's

624
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:31,087
not happening, it quickly turns toxic and then you get a bad

625
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:32,868
relation with your research team, then you have less data.

626
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:36,610
And then it's very quickly for that thread of the sort of

627
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:40,799
internal consultancy relationship to disintegrate if

628
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:44,743
you don't handle it nicely. I want to bring Chris in. I was

629
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,826
going to say you were advocating for transparency with research

630
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:52,591
data. Do you ever worry that like, because bad results do

631
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:56,275
not always mean bad things. Do you ever worry that like

632
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,977
transparently saying, or transparently saying,

633
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:03,701
There's this piece of data and it appears bad and everybody is

634
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:06,743
going to interpret it bad. That's the wrong thing to do

635
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:09,566
because really it's not bad if you have more context.

636
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:13,809
You contextualize the results by saying, look, ignore this one

637
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:17,031
thing because it was like the build was buggy, you know what I

638
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:19,293
mean, versus, oh, don't worry about it.

639
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:21,515
It doesn't exist.

640
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:23,756
If they're like, it's going to be okay.

641
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:30,039
If they say this is a bad data point, here's a very clear

642
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,820
reason why. You'll see on the next test it will go back up.

643
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,961
I think that's okay. Ideally you're working with people that

644
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,222
are mature and responsible enough not to go into full on

645
00:38:40,262 --> 00:38:43,343
meltdown mode if they see a negative piece of feedback.

646
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:47,664
Which I know is sometimes asking too much and I have been known

647
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,505
to spiral out of control. I know.

648
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:54,228
Obviously when that happens it's because I'm right.

649
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,991
Cory was a fan of standing behind my desk and yelling at me while I typed.

650
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:01,672
That was one of my favorite. It was only for about three years.

651
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:08,196
If he would just get a drink in me it would be okay afterwards.

652
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:10,177
That was just my way of saying I needed a break.

653
00:39:10,197 --> 00:39:12,599
Assassins don't ride on boats. That's a pirate.

654
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:18,522
I still think it should have been a pirate game.

655
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:27,788
Okay. Moving on. It was entertaining. I'm sorry. Okay.

656
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:31,110
Next question. Honestly, this one could go to literally any

657
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,872
of you and I'm kind of scared who to ask now. So let's go

658
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:41,717
with Johnny. What's your worst that's not how you use data

659
00:39:42,137 --> 00:39:42,437
moment?

660
00:39:44,324 --> 00:39:45,946
And let's keep this short, okay?

661
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,649
I mean, look, there are, and I think Celia's published a couple

662
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:52,792
of things on how not to do it, of like, you know, cognitive

663
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:54,774
biases that will impact the way that you interpret data.

664
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:58,577
And, you know, there's stuff like focusing on one bad data

665
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:00,839
point, which I think we've all seen several times where

666
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:03,982
somebody, you know, or the confirmation bias, there's a lot

667
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,984
of these things that can come in when you're looking at how,

668
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,746
like, oh, God, no, don't use that.

669
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:08,727
Don't, please don't do that.

670
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:12,788
Or like, you know, you guys have mentioned like, oh, if the data doesn't look right, throw it

671
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:19,331
out. Is another one where it's like, no. If you don't agree with it, you shouldn't throw it out.

672
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:25,853
You should look at it harder. Sometimes the data will say something that a person doesn't want to

673
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:31,975
hear. And rather than accept it, they're like, oh, you did it wrong. Can I tell a funny story?

674
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:37,199
Let me tell a story as an unemployed person. My favorite

675
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:39,082
meeting of this and it involves Dankov. It's a happy story.

676
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:54,319
One of the beauties of a franchise is that you have lots of data points.

677
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:56,499
Usually on a game it's the first edition of a game.

678
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:02,001
Even if you get data of what people like and don't like, it's very hard to draw long-term conclusions.

679
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,301
Your sample size is small.

680
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:09,622
On big franchises, and Yubi has a few, we have many years of releases,

681
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:12,263
often with evolving mechanics and different systems.

682
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:16,824
But one of the biggest challenges for me was when I saw Dankov present a slide

683
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:19,785
where he'd gone through all the different mission types in a particular franchise.

684
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:29,689
And had gone over, you know, over like five or six years and seen, you know, the five or six

685
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:33,471
different mission types that we often use and had pretty much, you know, a graph categorical

686
00:41:33,511 --> 00:41:37,233
evidence in one, you know, with enough sample size, enough data to say this particular mission

687
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:42,936
type in this game, in this franchise is despised by all players all of the time.

688
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:51,607
It was like everyone thinks we'll use the horrible numbers but 1.5, 4.1 and then 1.

689
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,307
Across seven years.

690
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:54,308
It wasn't like a blip.

691
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:57,448
It was very consistent.

692
00:41:57,468 --> 00:42:01,810
We were in the room and this is something that the teams, because we're talking about teams and data points,

693
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:07,431
but there's teams and data points and marketing and publishing and all kinds of other fun people involved in this discussion.

694
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:11,072
The management looked at the graph and there was silence in the room because everyone else was just like,

695
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:11,272
thank you.

696
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:12,733
Thank God we have the evidence.

697
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:13,853
It's like Watergate.

698
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:14,614
We have the tapes.

699
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,415
We can take it out.

700
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:21,457
And management leant forward, tapped the microphone and said, this graph is outrageous.

701
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:26,172
And I thought, it's amazing, the graph can't be outrageous.

702
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:26,792
You know what I mean?

703
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:29,073
Like, the interpretation of the data.

704
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:29,793
The sample must be wrong.

705
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,673
Yeah, it could be.

706
00:42:30,693 --> 00:42:32,394
Well, actually, the sample is all of your players.

707
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:33,935
It's all of the people all of the time.

708
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:34,735
But you know what I mean?

709
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,956
So even then, even sometimes when you get great data,

710
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:39,397
like your ability to institute change,

711
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:40,897
even from within a development team,

712
00:42:40,957 --> 00:42:44,779
is really hard when there are fixed special interests

713
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:45,319
in the company.

714
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,855
I didn't use any names. I'm glad. I think I come out unscathed.

715
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:54,659
Moving on. All right. So I'm going to direct this one to

716
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:58,424
Chris. In the late stages of making a game, how do you

717
00:42:58,464 --> 00:43:04,351
balance high priority feedback with the need to ship on time?

718
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:09,420
I mean, I think it's pretty much just a straight tradeoff

719
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:15,027
process between risk, reward and cost. You're always going

720
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:17,890
to get research at different stages of the game or different

721
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,214
stages of development and your tolerance for change is going to

722
00:43:21,454 --> 00:43:23,096
change as you move along.

723
00:43:24,457 --> 00:43:27,320
Some people are willing to gamble a little bit more than

724
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,223
others at later stages of the game and that's both good and

725
00:43:30,263 --> 00:43:35,348
bad. But a lot depends on who's driving the ship and what are

726
00:43:35,368 --> 00:43:38,051
the processes of the team. Is the team set up in a way that

727
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:41,334
allows them to respond to change quickly or is that a more costly

728
00:43:41,354 --> 00:43:44,197
process? What is the state of other features that

729
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:49,139
This new feature, this new UX might be interacting with. Is

730
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:53,240
that going to create some unmitigatable risk to those

731
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,522
other things or is it going to be sort of an isolated feature?

732
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:02,913
I remember there was a Twitter hashtag going around of like

733
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:06,116
scariest thing you did in game dev. I think it was one of the

734
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:09,779
designers on Mass Effect was like I secretly turned up all of

735
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,721
the difficulty 20% like the day before we put it in the can. And

736
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:16,003
I know there was a bunch of games user researchers that just

737
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:18,865
responded with like sweaty emoji, like I can't believe you

738
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:22,148
did that. That's the scariest thing I've ever heard. And then

739
00:44:22,168 --> 00:44:24,209
she, you know, she walked, she was like, yeah, she walked it

740
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,131
back and was like, well, I had a really good plan and I knew what

741
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:26,771
I was doing, but.

742
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,154
Yeah, it was certainly one of those where I was like, wow,

743
00:44:30,394 --> 00:44:32,556
that is, you know, on the riskier end.

744
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:33,096
Right.

745
00:44:34,857 --> 00:44:36,599
Okay, we're getting close to the end,

746
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:38,220
so I just want to touch on the last question

747
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,222
before we open it up for questions here.

748
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:43,324
This one I'm gonna give to Corey.

749
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:45,606
Uh-oh.

750
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,688
How do you handle research that is completely

751
00:44:47,748 --> 00:44:49,249
against your design philosophy?

752
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:50,450
Booze.

753
00:44:52,717 --> 00:44:57,500
Again, this is just my answer. It's not necessarily what you

754
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,222
should do. All right. So, no, I think there's a way to be less

755
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:02,904
fundamentalist about it. It comes back to I think you were

756
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:05,646
saying this earlier is figuring out what's the actual problem.

757
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:09,328
Right? So is the issue that people have a

758
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:19,978
A problem with the game itself or in fact asking you to make a different game or is there some other underlying issue that can be addressed to help solve the problem.

759
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:28,207
Now if someone is turning around and you're, you know, testing Gone Home and they're asking for more guns, I think at a certain point you need to have like...

760
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:31,397
the courage to say no, right?

761
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,498
Like this is wrong.

762
00:45:32,718 --> 00:45:33,899
Like we're not doing this.

763
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,943
So you look and it's like, is this issue something

764
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:41,705
that compromises the vision,

765
00:45:41,725 --> 00:45:46,049
that compromises the experience in a fundamental way?

766
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:48,771
Then you need to have the courage to say,

767
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:50,632
I get it, you don't like it, this game's not for you.

768
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,934
If you fall into a, oh, well,

769
00:45:52,974 --> 00:45:54,415
I kind of want this person to link it to me.

770
00:45:54,455 --> 00:45:56,197
We just like slip in one gun.

771
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:56,437
Like.

772
00:45:56,997 --> 00:46:01,222
You know, put it under the pillow and you can maybe like go target practice.

773
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:07,368
Like don't, it's very dangerous to start playing the like compromise your vision game.

774
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:09,810
So I hope you'd agree with me, right?

775
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:15,116
That like if it's, if it's not the game you're making, then it's, the data is not that useful.

776
00:46:15,216 --> 00:46:16,757
I like to think of games, it's, we're like.

777
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:20,719
Because eventually, if you're working on the game, you're going to lose sight of the trees.

778
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:24,100
And our goal is to be the lens that lets you see the whole forest again.

779
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,461
And be like, oh, okay, well, this is how it works.

780
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:26,881
But I mean, yeah, you know.

781
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:30,943
But for me too, also, I just popped into my head then, but we keep saying like, you know, as well.

782
00:46:30,983 --> 00:46:32,523
And that's the weird metric.

783
00:46:32,563 --> 00:46:34,724
It's like effective in a weird way.

784
00:46:34,744 --> 00:46:36,705
Because sometimes you don't want someone to enjoy something.

785
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:39,886
It's a dark moment or a horrible thing or it's a pressured moment or something.

786
00:46:39,946 --> 00:46:41,046
So they won't like it.

787
00:46:41,146 --> 00:46:41,646
You know what I mean?

788
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,907
Like your test is, did you feel really under pressure?

789
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:46,689
You know what I mean? Or did you feel the urgency of this situation?

790
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:50,132
Or whatever it is that, you know, that you need them to feel is like,

791
00:46:50,152 --> 00:46:51,533
the test is ineffective.

792
00:46:51,693 --> 00:46:52,454
Well, we don't test...

793
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:56,657
There's that opposing thing where we saw a lot on a game that we may have worked on,

794
00:46:57,078 --> 00:47:01,622
where like, the more story missions, when we asked them, like, did you like it?

795
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:03,143
They were never the highest score.

796
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:05,144
But then when you get to the end of a game and you're like,

797
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:06,245
what did you like the most about this game?

798
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:07,166
They're like, oh, the story.

799
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:08,887
And so there was something wrong, I think.

800
00:47:09,048 --> 00:47:10,749
There was a flaw in our methodology of,

801
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:13,391
if you ask somebody a story-based mission, was that fun?

802
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:18,957
Well, no, it was engaging or it was, it generated an emotional

803
00:47:18,997 --> 00:47:22,581
response, but it's certainly, I think, a big question of

804
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:24,583
methodology and how are you approaching the situation, what

805
00:47:24,603 --> 00:47:29,188
are you doing, because like or fun or whatever it is, whatever

806
00:47:29,228 --> 00:47:32,712
metric everyone uses, it can't be blanket applied.

807
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:38,339
I think you, and I don't know, you would know better, I think things like, are you engaged,

808
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:38,459
right?

809
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:40,562
Did this evoke an emotional response?

810
00:47:40,622 --> 00:47:45,147
Doesn't have to be a positive one, but like, do you keep, you know, does it keep you going

811
00:47:45,268 --> 00:47:45,668
forward?

812
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:49,954
Well we all know the Steam reviews, you know, like, you know, a thousand hours played, I

813
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:51,115
hate this game, it's boring.

814
00:47:53,897 --> 00:47:57,860
I know in car, in the auto industry, they have some form of putting electrodes on people

815
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,823
when they watch TV ads and they're like, I hated that ad, and they're like, no, you loved

816
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:01,043
it.

817
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:02,184
I think I was with you.

818
00:48:02,324 --> 00:48:03,124
I was with you.

819
00:48:03,144 --> 00:48:04,305
I want to be in your brain.

820
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:05,366
It can get very confusing.

821
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:10,130
I remember we were doing a very early test on a project and I think Alex was with me

822
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,872
and there was a guy in the room that was like, I fucking hate this franchise, I hate this

823
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:16,214
new game that you're working on, this is so stupid, you've just completely ruined it.

824
00:48:16,354 --> 00:48:21,257
We're like, so do you think you'll buy it? I already preordered the collector's edition

825
00:48:21,477 --> 00:48:26,900
seven times and I can't wait to play it. I didn't know what to do with that. I hate everything

826
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,703
you do but I own nine copies of it and of course I'm buying it. I don't understand.

827
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:36,546
I don't know what you do with that information. He owned it more than we did. That's what

828
00:48:36,586 --> 00:48:41,989
it was. He was more in it than we were. That's where you need your user researcher to step

829
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:45,291
in and say this is what he really means. We just yell at the one way glass.

830
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,554
I just crashed through the one way.

831
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:48,678
You know that's not soundproof, right?

832
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:49,701
For a while I thought that was a guy.

833
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:50,865
This is really horrible.

834
00:48:50,906 --> 00:48:52,732
Maybe, you know, remember we were going to put him in the game.

835
00:48:52,752 --> 00:48:52,852
Yeah.

836
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,853
For a while we were going to put him in the game.

837
00:48:55,873 --> 00:48:57,354
He's going to live under a bridge.

838
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,054
Every time you were successful in something he was going to come in and be like,

839
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:02,735
eh, that wasn't really impressive.

840
00:49:02,775 --> 00:49:05,936
I could do better.

841
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:06,936
You're terrible at this.

842
00:49:07,196 --> 00:49:11,077
I just want to point out, because you mentioned,

843
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:12,517
it didn't ship, whoever you are.

844
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:14,178
People are interested in that.

845
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:17,118
Ben is giving a talk at the end of the day on neuroscience.

846
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:20,339
He'll be talking specifically about that TV stuff as it applies to video games.

847
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:23,000
Maybe, I don't know actually what he's talking about other than the title.

848
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:33,185
Okay. We're coming to the end. So let's open it up to questions. We have about eight minutes,

849
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:45,912
I think. Seven minutes. So questions. Questions for our panelists. Oh, and there's a mic just

850
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:48,453
back there. If you want to ask questions, just line up at the mic.

851
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:55,859
Hi, my name is Christina Woodkey. I've been doing UX for the last 20 years and games for

852
00:49:55,879 --> 00:49:59,903
the last few. I'm an associate professor now. I spoke last year on UX. And I have a question.

853
00:50:01,864 --> 00:50:04,406
Why did you decide to have an all male panel for UX?

854
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:08,489
That's actually a very good question. We didn't.

855
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,971
We didn't. We didn't. We actually had...

856
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:16,528
We approached a number of women. We actually had a woman on the panel and she unfortunately

857
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:22,032
had to back out only a couple of days before and we struggled to find a replacement.

858
00:50:23,172 --> 00:50:25,814
I have a website called women talk design. Call me.

859
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:30,156
Can I get your card afterwards? Thank you.

860
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:34,303
James Berg, user researcher. I work for Ian, so I have to be

861
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:37,144
very careful with my question here. So question from the

862
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:41,025
production side. What would you say is the biggest struggle or

863
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:43,586
how do you approach the challenge of integrating the

864
00:50:43,646 --> 00:50:47,488
timing of research and how you get that into the game in an

865
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:53,070
appropriate way? So I think it depends on, you know, how well

866
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,871
your studio or how well your team is set up to both gather

867
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:57,952
data and respond to data.

868
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:05,290
I think you can create a system that if you have the resources

869
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:08,072
and the time you can create an infrastructure that allows you to

870
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:11,955
collect data frequently and accurately over time and that

871
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:13,976
will give you the data points that you need to make.

872
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:17,855
pretty frequent decisions. But if you're also over scoped in

873
00:51:17,895 --> 00:51:20,456
your project and you don't have a whole lot of flexibility, then

874
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:23,498
you might not be able to respond to that data more quickly. So I

875
00:51:24,098 --> 00:51:26,559
think in the organization of your team, you have to decide,

876
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:29,180
hey, like how important is data going to be for us in our

877
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,162
development process? And there's a range there. It's not going to

878
00:51:32,182 --> 00:51:36,824
be it's not or it is, right? But you can set up systems or

879
00:51:36,864 --> 00:51:39,706
processes that are more conducive to responding to data

880
00:51:39,826 --> 00:51:40,246
than others.

881
00:51:43,985 --> 00:51:47,027
Hello, my name is David Hooker. I actually do have a question, guys.

882
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:49,007
Oh, okay.

883
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:55,630
But it was more for the research side. How do you deal with or have any keys or tips

884
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:59,652
for that kind of data where the consumer is obviously going to purchase the game like

885
00:52:00,032 --> 00:52:05,254
UGS just addressed, but their feedback is still sort of negative, so on one spectrum

886
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:07,455
it's not going to work out, but on the other spectrum...

887
00:52:08,649 --> 00:52:13,493
What the metrics for how many cells or copies or what have you is going to provide a contradiction.

888
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:20,019
Particularly in like pre-production. Sorry, the question is how do you reconcile people that are still going to buy the game but have opinions that are,

889
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,181
like they want some improvements on some of the features.

890
00:52:23,782 --> 00:52:29,967
And so I think that, you know, purchase intent is not always your most important metric when you're doing formative user research throughout a project.

891
00:52:31,008 --> 00:52:35,992
So negative feedback is just another, it's another interesting data point for a thing that you need to consider as you're making the game.

892
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:42,704
If that negative feedback would prevent them from purchasing, it adds a little weight potentially,

893
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:48,047
but I don't think mashing those two together is necessarily something that you would do throughout.

894
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:52,229
Particularly, up until I would say very late into the project,

895
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:58,952
trying to douse purchase intent is a mistake from a games user research perspective.

896
00:52:59,352 --> 00:53:03,895
It's not a thing that you should be trying to get out of that type of testing.

897
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,629
Are we out of time? No, we have a couple of minutes, right? We have four minutes.

898
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:21,133
Hi guys, I'm Leonard, how are you doing? I have a question about, because I never worked in an

899
00:53:21,193 --> 00:53:26,556
actual games company, so I just have a question. At the end of the year, you know, you go and

900
00:53:27,797 --> 00:53:32,719
you do your final report and you know you've done a good job and you know maybe there was some

901
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:36,881
fighting between the designers and the user researchers but like how do you say you've had a

902
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,383
successful output? Like what is...

903
00:53:40,023 --> 00:53:42,164
How does your boss say you're doing a good job?

904
00:53:42,184 --> 00:53:45,886
Because just hearing how there's a little bit of fighting and stuff,

905
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,807
within the company, how is success determined?

906
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:49,407
In the company?

907
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:50,308
It's obviously not determined by...

908
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:51,989
You mean like on his performance review?

909
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:53,509
Well, I write a lot.

910
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:55,130
No, I don't.

911
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:55,550
Possibly.

912
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,032
I mean, for me, the subjective metric is always that if I...

913
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:03,050
You've probably heard versions of this, but on the dev team your job is to defend your

914
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,251
vision and make sure it's getting through and executed.

915
00:54:05,531 --> 00:54:08,512
Their job is to tell you when it's failing or when they have a better idea.

916
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:13,534
For me the success is when we've heard something, worked through that problem and you can point

917
00:54:13,574 --> 00:54:14,094
to something.

918
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:18,196
We had a lot on Far Cry 4 where at the end I was like, wow, that made it better.

919
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:21,577
That is a horribly subjective blobby metric for it.

920
00:54:22,874 --> 00:54:25,256
In terms of hard metrics, if you're using some sort of, if

921
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:27,117
you're integrated with the team and using their bug tracking

922
00:54:27,137 --> 00:54:30,420
software, you can extract everything that you ever said

923
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,062
and look at, you know, did they take the feedback, did they

924
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:36,765
throw it out as will not fix or can't replicate or whatever, or

925
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:39,888
need more information. Need more information is a super

926
00:54:39,908 --> 00:54:41,829
interesting one because that means you didn't do your job

927
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:42,570
well enough.

928
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,351
And that they saw what you're saying and they're like,

929
00:54:45,371 --> 00:54:47,132
I don't quite get it yet, and you have to go back for that.

930
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:50,094
And so looking at the breakdown throughout the milestones of the project

931
00:54:50,114 --> 00:54:51,554
of all of the things that you told them,

932
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,656
and then tracking how those were resolved can be an interesting way to see like,

933
00:54:55,216 --> 00:54:56,757
am I being effective as a researcher?

934
00:54:56,977 --> 00:55:01,179
Would you agree or disagree that at the end of the day,

935
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,700
like the game, if it reviews well and sells well,

936
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,121
you're given like a pat on the back?

937
00:55:07,281 --> 00:55:09,122
And if it doesn't, you're in trouble?

938
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:13,752
Well even if you did, even if you were like, look I showed you all this shit was wrong,

939
00:55:14,373 --> 00:55:15,455
they're like, you're in trouble.

940
00:55:15,535 --> 00:55:19,143
It would be an interesting arm wrestling match of who reads reviews more carefully.

941
00:55:19,505 --> 00:55:21,606
between creative directors and games user researchers.

942
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:24,508
Because you guys were, I mean, we're both fighting at opposite,

943
00:55:24,528 --> 00:55:27,369
or well, we're fighting together, but on things that are kind of different.

944
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:27,910
My experience is...

945
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,371
But like, we go through with like a high level.

946
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:29,671
I think, yeah.

947
00:55:29,691 --> 00:55:30,271
We're like, I told them.

948
00:55:30,431 --> 00:55:31,892
Yeah, those fuckers, they're retarded.

949
00:55:31,932 --> 00:55:32,752
I told them again.

950
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:32,972
Look.

951
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:33,453
Send it.

952
00:55:33,473 --> 00:55:35,814
Sometimes he sends them to me, but physically, because he doesn't need to.

953
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:36,314
He just likes to.

954
00:55:36,414 --> 00:55:37,895
I wrote a told you show report once.

955
00:55:37,995 --> 00:55:38,976
It was very cathartic.

956
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,216
But I think, you know, we know.

957
00:55:40,556 --> 00:55:43,458
So I, from my position, if you're going really high level,

958
00:55:43,658 --> 00:55:47,360
I think I measure my personal success is when...

959
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,451
At the end of the day, if I can talk to the team that I've been

960
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:54,571
working with and say that they were not surprised by anything

961
00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:59,092
once the game was live, then I've done a good job. If they

962
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:01,793
know everything that was wrong with the game before it went

963
00:56:01,853 --> 00:56:04,313
out and they accepted that and they made decisions on how they

964
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:08,034
were going to deal with those things, I did my job.

965
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:10,495
When you don't get a call going, hey, you said this system

966
00:56:10,515 --> 00:56:11,415
was okay and it's not.

967
00:56:14,062 --> 00:56:15,805
Maybe he's doing a better job than you, Johnny.

968
00:56:15,925 --> 00:56:17,627
I've moved on. I've moved on.

969
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,671
I have Xanax in my pack.

970
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:21,512
I think...

971
00:56:22,614 --> 00:56:23,535
Do we have time for one more?

972
00:56:23,735 --> 00:56:24,196
Where's my...

973
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,723
Mostly what I hear represented here are AAA console type games.

974
00:56:31,783 --> 00:56:35,466
And I know that one metric that's used a lot on the mobile side is just

975
00:56:35,546 --> 00:56:36,026
retainment.

976
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,249
And so I wonder if that's something you look at during a soft launch.

977
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:41,931
That's a lot more than even in console, it's all retainment.

978
00:56:42,051 --> 00:56:46,114
Oh yeah, Johnny used to have a thing you could see where people checked out.

979
00:56:46,174 --> 00:56:48,756
Like, it was like this mission, everyone was there,

980
00:56:48,856 --> 00:56:50,537
they didn't play the game anymore after this mission.

981
00:56:50,677 --> 00:56:53,600
Or like, you'd see the places where people pop out.

982
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:58,753
Acquisition and retention are the key metrics for everything.

983
00:56:59,975 --> 00:57:01,617
Do you find that you have to wait until...

984
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:04,260
Is there a certain point where it's too soon to talk about that?

985
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:06,583
You need to wait until a certain point for that to be meaningful?

986
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:09,327
It is tough to check retention in progress on a story game.

987
00:57:11,049 --> 00:57:13,912
You can ask them, like, oh, is this the point where you would think about maybe quitting?

988
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:17,976
And they're sitting in a lab and they're there until 4 o'clock and you're like,

989
00:57:18,196 --> 00:57:19,237
would you maybe want to quit now?

990
00:57:19,297 --> 00:57:22,180
And it's not the most reliable metric, but it can be interesting.

991
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,324
Haven't there been on occasion games where, like, during the test someone's like,

992
00:57:26,364 --> 00:57:28,646
you know what, I'm out, I'm not doing this anymore.

993
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:30,648
They're like, I'm going to have a cigarette and they don't come back.

994
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:32,229
Like, that could be interesting data.

995
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:32,550
So, so...

996
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,372
It does happen.

997
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:38,414
Usually you suddenly get a bout of sickness.

998
00:57:38,474 --> 00:57:41,016
You'll have like 16 people and 4 of them will get sick.

999
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:45,200
There was something though, I won't be able to, but there was something where the guy

1000
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,380
was like fuck this and left.

1001
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:47,601
Like once.

1002
00:57:48,262 --> 00:57:49,223
Not on anything I worked on.

1003
00:57:49,243 --> 00:57:50,063
There's a few we've rejected.

1004
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,044
Just to be very clear.

1005
00:57:51,084 --> 00:57:53,726
There's always the ones we kick out for being too stoned when they turn up.

1006
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:55,007
Has that happened?

1007
00:57:55,087 --> 00:57:55,708
All the time.

1008
00:57:55,968 --> 00:57:58,150
You look at me like, you're just like, oh shit.

1009
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,350
You're gonna fuck up my data.

1010
00:57:59,511 --> 00:57:59,771
Get out.

1011
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:04,328
But then again, I always think, though, but then again, that's your audience.

1012
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:05,929
Like, you know what I mean?

1013
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:08,692
It's like 50% of your audience, like maybe he should stay.

1014
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:13,656
Maybe half of them should be stoned.

1015
00:58:13,816 --> 00:58:15,958
And then we would get realistic data.

1016
00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:21,503
Maybe in the new world we'll be allowed to, once Mr. Trudeau lets it happen.

1017
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:24,146
Once marketing comes back to us and says that there's a stoner segment.

1018
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:24,786
Yeah, exactly.

1019
00:58:24,826 --> 00:58:25,407
They know it.

1020
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:26,328
Anyway.

1021
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:30,536
We completely derailed off your question. We'll be in the wrap up room after if you want to ask.

1022
00:58:30,996 --> 00:58:35,637
Okay, okay guys, so we're out of time. A couple of things, please fill out the evaluation. You

1023
00:58:35,657 --> 00:58:42,378
got scanned, so you should be getting an email with it. Good marks, please. And we'll be heading

1024
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:48,120
over to the wrap up room, which is in the West Hall level two, room 2022. Wait, 2022-2024.

1025
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,601
Oh, okay, they just listed off all the wrap-up rooms.

1026
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:57,143
I'm sorry, we're going to be going to 3022.

1027
00:58:58,524 --> 00:59:01,606
So 3022 or 2022?

1028
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:03,087
No, no, 30.

1029
00:59:03,468 --> 00:59:03,828
We're going to 3022.

1030
00:59:04,368 --> 00:59:07,251
20, yeah, 3022, which is over there somewhere.

1031
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:10,153
Just follow us after we leave if you want to talk to us more.
