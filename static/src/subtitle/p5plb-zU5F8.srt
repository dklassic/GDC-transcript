00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:13,824
So welcome to our session about learnings from the removal of loot boxes in Brawl Stars.

2
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:20,006
You've probably seen one or two headlines out there.

3
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:25,207
And as we say in Finland, Brawl is currently doing pretty OK.

4
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:33,209
What these nice headlines don't show, though, is how much it took it to get us here.

5
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,350
And today we're going to talk about the removal of loot boxes

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:45,050
But also our key learnings by taking browsers from historical lows to historical heights right now.

7
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:48,555
And spoiler alert, we're going to talk a lot about engagement.

8
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:54,549
Show of hand, maybe.

9
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,710
How many in the room have played Brawl Stars?

10
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,150
Oh, wow.

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:58,830
Oh, sweet.

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,390
Sweet.

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:00:59,750
Awesome.

14
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:00,851
That's quite a few.

15
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,732
For those who don't, play Brawl.

16
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:10,033
Brawl is a fast-paced 3 versus 3 multiplayer battle game and battle royale.

17
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:10,913
It's made for mobile.

18
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:18,975
It was released into global launch in December 2018 and generated a little bit over $2 billion USD lifetime revenue so far.

19
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:27,801
The game is made by a very diverse team of people, mostly in Helsinki, but supported by some of our colleagues in South Korea.

20
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:39,370
We have 23 nationalities in the team, and we are also supported by a bunch of people in central teams within Supercell and on the outside.

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,275
So we're working with freelancers, and we're working with agencies on the outside to support our work.

22
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:49,909
My name is Frank Heinborg.

23
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,031
I'm the general manager for Rolsters.

24
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,793
I've been with Supercell for a bit over 9 years now.

25
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:57,535
9 years, 3 months and 12 days or something.

26
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:00,558
I've moved to Finland, you have to understand that.

27
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:02,799
So I'm still counting days maybe.

28
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:09,745
Previously I worked for Blizzard Entertainment in Europe in a role in PX.

29
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:11,692
Awesome.

30
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:13,173
And my name is Frank Yan.

31
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:19,654
I currently work as a game designer on Brawl Stars and mainly focus on systems.

32
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,015
And prior to this, I was also at Blizzard.

33
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:28,457
But most recently on the Hearthstone team, I was there for about six years and two years at Supercell.

34
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:33,619
And I got my start when my dad told me that I'll never amount to much if I played a lot of video games.

35
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,260
So that really fueled some passion to prove him wrong.

36
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,842
And no, you don't have to be called Frank, and neither did you have to work at Blizzard to get a job at Supercell.

37
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:45,463
We're hiring.

38
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:47,743
So, yes, let's go.

39
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:51,965
So the talk today is separated in three sections, really.

40
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,226
It's before, during, and after the removal of loot boxes.

41
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:59,928
And the first part, before we go into anything else,

42
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:04,545
Please keep in mind that what we're presenting to you today is our reality.

43
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:05,586
It's our learnings.

44
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:10,410
They're very specific to Rolsters, to the history of Rolsters, and everything else.

45
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:13,713
So your game circumstances might be different.

46
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:19,198
We still hope that some of the learnings we are sharing with you in a moment will be applicable to what you do.

47
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:26,404
But we wanted to set the expectation that just because it worked here for us doesn't necessarily mean that it works for you.

48
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:35,099
Before we talk about the removal of loot boxes, let's talk about how loot boxes actually looked like in Brawl Stars before.

49
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,803
And they were pretty much part of the game from early soft launch.

50
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:45,931
We went through a bunch of iterations in the meta, but ultimately ended up with a series of three different boxes.

51
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:48,674
You have the regular brawl box, that's the iconic thing on the left.

52
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:59,523
In the middle, you have a big box that's worth three boxes, and then the mega box, the piece de resistance, and that one is 10 gacha pulls.

53
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:07,949
Now, these boxes contain both horizontal and vertical progression in Brawl Stars, so it was your primary mean to progress in the game.

54
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:16,796
And it was our second most important SKU after the Battle Pass, which is called Brawl Pass in Brawl Stars.

55
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:19,873
This is how it looked.

56
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,916
You open a box, add a few taps with escalating rewards.

57
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:27,997
Sometimes you got lucky and got a brawler.

58
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,158
And that was the whole experience.

59
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,920
Now, let's talk a little bit about the early days of Brawl Stars.

60
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:38,935
Initially, things were great.

61
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:49,382
So you see there on the left side the period from December 2018 to December 2019, and then January 2020 to June 2021.

62
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,866
On the left is a global launch that, again, was December 2018.

63
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:59,329
The big revenue spike there in the middle, what a happy moment.

64
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:03,813
It's a combination between Brawl Pass, the first version, and the game launch in China.

65
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:07,835
And as you can see, the numbers came down quite hard afterwards.

66
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:14,838
Overall, what we saw in our game is that the revenue did not always follow the growth of the MAU.

67
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:21,262
It was still meaningful, and over these 18 months or so, the game generated the first 1 billion USD.

68
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:25,284
However, things didn't stay like that.

69
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:28,626
This is then the period from July 2021 until October 2022.

70
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:38,416
So coming out of the summer period, summer 2021, Europe is a crazy important market for us.

71
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:44,982
And everyone in Europe in summer 2021 traveled because they could travel again.

72
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:50,247
And we have this weird thing that in most games, vacation means people play more.

73
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:56,670
But in Brawl Stars, when people go on vacation, they play less because the social graph around them is missing.

74
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:58,511
So it hurt us.

75
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:02,633
So every after summer, we need to bring people back to the game somehow.

76
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:04,554
And guess what?

77
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:05,254
They didn't come back.

78
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:12,097
And there's some external factors, but also probably a bunch of internal factors of us not hitting the mark with our updates.

79
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:22,572
In October 2021, we released an update to stem the tide against the decrease of our KPIs.

80
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:28,716
And so we introduced a feature for clubs where all the members of the club could participate.

81
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:33,198
It was a really hardcore system with leagues and a shop, a special currency, etc.

82
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,421
And we thought, you know, we need to enable social to get higher retention, yada, yada, yada.

83
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:42,478
We also introduced two new power levels to the game.

84
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,702
Before that we had 9 power levels for each brawler, now we have 11.

85
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,289
And to make that interesting, why would you level up your character, we introduced new ultimate abilities.

86
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,771
There were passives actually called gears you could equip.

87
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:56,713
And they were pretty complex.

88
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:59,614
You had to collect them, different pieces, then craft them.

89
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,055
A concept completely new to Brawl Stars.

90
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:08,358
And, well, initially, you see that both MAU and revenue stabilized somewhat.

91
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:11,519
But there was also the seasonality, of course, in quarter four.

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,181
But ultimately, this update didn't hit the mark at all with our community.

93
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:22,844
And they told us in no unclear terms that the fund-to-cost ratio for this new feature was not OK.

94
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:30,255
Then, February 2022, Russia invaded the Ukraine.

95
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:37,837
For us, that meant that in February, essentially, we pulled out of Russia immediately.

96
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:47,081
And Russia at that point represented 25% of our DAU and 20% of our revenue.

97
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:53,883
So in this downtrend already, we had, well, an even harder battle to fight.

98
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:59,566
Then later in the year, we decided to rework gears.

99
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:03,169
The community, especially hardcore community, was still pretty upset with this update.

100
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:05,390
So we simplified everything.

101
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,291
No more crafting.

102
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:07,492
Gears could just drop now.

103
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:08,473
It's just one level.

104
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:12,476
And it worked out again somewhat.

105
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,878
DAU and MAU came up.

106
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,540
Revenue stabilized somewhat.

107
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,882
But yes, it didn't really do much.

108
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:28,084
So after seeing a decline for quite a long period, we knew we needed to change.

109
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:36,011
Around this time, I actually got hired.

110
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:40,535
So I got hired during a pretty tense period, not going to lie.

111
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,356
It was a bit stressful.

112
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:49,122
They kind of said, hey, we need someone on systems design to come help us recover.

113
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:49,918
the game.

114
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:57,064
And when I came on, one of the key questions that we asked was, how do we get players excited to come back to Brawl Stars?

115
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,947
And the answer was quite clear.

116
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:04,690
Unlocking brawlers is one of the most engaging aspects of the game.

117
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,192
Particularly, we have five rarities of brawlers.

118
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,173
The highest is legendary, as you see here.

119
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,615
And these are the most exciting brawlers to unlock.

120
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:15,798
Because through boxes, there's a chance you unlock one of these.

121
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:17,380
And it's a really exciting moment.

122
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,380
You see it in videos.

123
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,081
People record.

124
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,820
and it's really, really exciting.

125
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:34,206
So at this point, you know, we had maybe like 8 to 10 of these legendary brawlers, and when we did the math, it was like, on average, it takes a free-to-play player almost a year to unlock a legendary brawler.

126
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:37,267
So we actually viewed this kind of as an issue.

127
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:45,033
So we believed kind of like the best solution would be to remove loot boxes from the game.

128
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:54,756
This is a pretty dramatic jump from what I just said, but I'll go through a bunch of reasons, and maybe reasons that maybe weren't that great in hindsight.

129
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,537
So why did we believe that we should have removed loot boxes?

130
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:04,219
The first was we were in a decline, and we felt we could take bigger risks with the game.

131
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:11,441
The second was that we wanted to provide more choice to players and clear goals around brawler unlocks.

132
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:12,861
You just saw a common problem there.

133
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:18,643
The third was there was a lot of scrutiny and continues to be a lot of scrutiny around loot boxes in the media.

134
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:26,486
And, you know, imagine a situation where we say, we come out and we say, Brawl Stars is removing loot boxes.

135
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:30,947
That is a very newsworthy moment, and we felt this could be what we needed.

136
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:32,688
The silver bullet, so to speak.

137
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:39,863
And then, certainly, even within Supercell, the other teams had kind of been discussing, like, you know, maybe we wouldn't do a loot box.

138
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:46,990
And so we thought that, in the worst case, we'd be able to pass on some learnings from Brawl to other games.

139
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:56,899
Naively, though, and this is a huge, huge but, we decided to remove all random rewards from the game.

140
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:08,536
So regardless, let's go down the second part of the presentation, which is around what did we do during this process of removing loot boxes.

141
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:11,297
Well, we had some key goals.

142
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:21,739
Not surprisingly, we wanted to provide clear goals and expectations for when players can expect to unlock their next brawler.

143
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:36,726
we felt that because loot boxes, as Frank mentioned, and I'm not talking about myself in the third person, we need a new monetization hook, because loot boxes represented quite, you know, strong monetization for the game.

144
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:45,133
It had to be really easy to understand, and I can't overemphasize this enough, and this will transcend the talk, that it had to be really easy to understand.

145
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:48,156
People have to come in, they have to get it, and this is a really core pillar of ours.

146
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:52,258
So this is what the replacement system looked like.

147
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:53,378
We call it the Star Road.

148
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:54,658
Two Rs.

149
00:11:55,598 --> 00:12:00,280
And what happens is you want to kind of unlock brawlers sequentially.

150
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,801
So basically, we tell you in the beginning which brawlers you'll unlock.

151
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:08,922
And then you kind of collect this new currency called credits.

152
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:13,703
And once you earn enough credits as a free-to-play, you unlock that brawler.

153
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:20,556
The order is predetermined in the sense that everybody gets the same path, so there's no unfairness here.

154
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:25,580
And we have to, however, we have to account for different rarities.

155
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,063
We have five rarities, each has a different price point that had to be respected in the system.

156
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:38,729
And so as I mentioned, we have credits as the new currency, and we said no RNG in this system, right?

157
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:53,732
However, this leads to the first learning, which we had over 60 brawlers in the game at this time, and imagine if we had come up with a system where you got a choice between all 60.

158
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:55,633
That's a very tall order.

159
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:02,864
And we actually wrestled with the design of the Star Road for many, many weeks.

160
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:09,086
We went back and forth around the questions of, you know, how do we account for you unlocking a rarity?

161
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:24,209
Because imagine if players are excited to unlock a legendary rarity brawler, but it takes them many, many weeks, but they can choose to unlock a legendary, they could be stuck unlocking a legendary brawler and not being able to unlock brawlers for a very, very long period of time.

162
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,190
So we had to account for this in the design of the new system.

163
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,131
team.

164
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:58,732
We had these really complicated design documents and ultimately what we realized was, look, we're just going to allow players, we'll give them a subset of choices, and they'll just be able to freely switch between which brawler they want to unlock until they have enough credits and then they get to unlock that brawler.

165
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:01,973
And this is kind of the details of what that looks like.

166
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,795
So this player is first unlocking Jackie.

167
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:08,936
She's a super rare brawler, our second lowest rarity.

168
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:14,579
And then we say, hey, now you're unlocking either Brock or Barley.

169
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:16,180
You make a choice.

170
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,403
We wanted to kind of have you commit to that choice so at least you kind of saw your progress towards that brawler.

171
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:27,325
And then the closer you got, actually the higher chance that people would monetize to kind of top up the rest.

172
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:29,586
And then you kind of move on to the next.

173
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:33,367
And we always just limited the amount of choices for you in this new kind of system.

174
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:38,788
What this meant was that the star road accounted for brawler unlocks.

175
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:50,232
And because I mentioned earlier that we removed all random rewards, this is some foreshadowing, all of the rewards for vertical progression, so powering up those brawlers, became deterministic.

176
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:53,193
So you knew exactly what amount you were getting when.

177
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:57,830
So, some of the pros and cons.

178
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,671
Well, the first, I'm just going to mention one key pro and one key con.

179
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:04,472
The pro is that it's very predictable.

180
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:06,352
You know exactly which brawler you're going to get.

181
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:09,253
You have a choice, so it's like really easy to understand.

182
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:19,277
And the con, though, was that it's really not that exciting to unlock brawlers anymore in this new system, because you knew there was no surprise when you were going to get them.

183
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:22,678
And so engagement was at risk here.

184
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:33,107
Regardless, I think this comes to our first learning, which is, and this is something that comes up often in our design discussions, is when wrestling with a design, simplify.

185
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:38,972
And you could probably cross out the first part of that sentence and just, the learning is just simplify.

186
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:45,898
Because a lot of our designs I think that resulted in some of the historical highs we've experienced more recently

187
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,515
we do think they're really easy to understand.

188
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:52,116
And Brawl is played by a largely young audience.

189
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:57,379
And when they come in, it has to be really obvious what the game they're playing is and how things work.

190
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,001
So I can't overemphasize this first learning enough.

191
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:02,362
OK.

192
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:05,424
So we decided this was what we're going to ship with, YOLO.

193
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,286
And Frank will now talk about what happened.

194
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:17,455
So at the end of November, we have the Brawl Stars World Finals usually.

195
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:18,435
It's an esports event.

196
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:28,839
And during that event, we had a small community talk on stage, which told the community that we will remove loot boxes from the game.

197
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:37,603
And the irony, lo and behold, we introduced a new box to send it off, the Omega Box, the box to enter boxes.

198
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:43,187
And so we created this community event where the community would have to do some takedowns in the game.

199
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:46,348
We're talking about millions and millions of takedowns.

200
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:50,111
And as they progressed on this path, they would unlock rewards.

201
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:54,652
because we wanted that the community feels good about changing system.

202
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:59,953
And it was really, really important for us so far that, well, they were on board with that change.

203
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:00,853
They got excited.

204
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:02,673
We could also re-attract people.

205
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:11,615
And so we created a simple community video where we talked about it, which got 17 million views, just like a little community video.

206
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:16,796
So it reached a lot of people, created a lot of hype, and people were really, really excited about this.

207
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:19,797
So that started late November, early December.

208
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:23,838
In the same period, we had a lot of other things going on.

209
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:32,600
Besides the Omega Box event, we also have our traditional seasonal free base in December, from December 12th, which is our anniversary, to the 26th.

210
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,821
We had a free brawler people could unlock with a quest.

211
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:41,303
We had a new legendary that garnered a lot of interest, and the first legendary was cheaper after the system change.

212
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:43,583
And last but not least, seasonality.

213
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:48,525
Quarter 4 is always higher for us in audience, and spend is also always higher.

214
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:53,974
So the initial results were pretty promising.

215
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:57,136
You see pretty clearly when things happened.

216
00:17:57,837 --> 00:18:05,361
So first, the Omega Box event, early December, late November, and then the update itself with a star drop on December 12.

217
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:10,625
And normally, even on update days, we have a DAU and MAU drop.

218
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,448
So it was pretty clear that the community got excited, and a lot of people came back to the game.

219
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:20,968
And yeah, so zoomed in really in the DAU, the initial results looked awesome.

220
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:26,915
DAU was up 60% month over month, which is like, wow, hey, did we just pull this off?

221
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:36,307
However, it was super hard to get a read on what was actually going on, because there are four mentioned things we did.

222
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:47,419
So the next learning is really about, and hindsight is great, but the next learning is about reducing noise when you ship important things.

223
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,742
You really want to make sure that you can read those changes in your data in other ways.

224
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,143
And we just couldn't.

225
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,804
The socials were full of stuff.

226
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:01,966
Most people were still talking about the removal of boxes, so it was impossible to read socials.

227
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:07,329
The data showed us, well, what you've just seen, it looked pretty good and pretty promising.

228
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:09,750
Even retention jumped up temporarily.

229
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:13,576
But yeah, it was impossible to read for us.

230
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:25,003
So, our suggestion to you, if you ship a big changing update or something really, where the key is in measuring the outcome, yeah, avoid doing a ton of other stuff around it.

231
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:32,308
And don't pick Christmas, because that's... We were in a hurry for some reason.

232
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:33,849
Yeah, no kidding.

233
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:39,893
So now we're going to the period after we shipped the Star Road.

234
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:44,155
We had two more updates right after.

235
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:48,157
And both of these updates had been planned as the original change.

236
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,258
In February, we shipped Masteries.

237
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,979
Masteries, the idea was pretty simple.

238
00:19:53,519 --> 00:20:02,064
Give players another way, and give players more agency to change this on-rails path, the regular unlock process of Brawler's Force.

239
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:06,326
All of a sudden, just by playing more, there was a cap there as well.

240
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:10,068
But the cap would kick in after like eight hours of straight play or something.

241
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:17,447
You could get additional currency to unlock brawlers, to upgrade brawlers, some extra cosmetics for the brawlers you loved.

242
00:20:20,938 --> 00:20:24,799
And then there was a second update in April, which introduced a new currency, bling.

243
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:29,301
It removed an old currency called star points and introduced the catalog.

244
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:34,283
In short, what this did is that we replaced a currency that was entirely broken.

245
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,923
It was exponential.

246
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:41,925
Star points was something we would give out for competing in the game in different places.

247
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:46,047
But an average player would maybe get 50 star points in a week.

248
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,689
And someone who is super, super invested would get $50,000.

249
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,275
And it's incredibly hard to manage that from an economy perspective.

250
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:56,115
And so we couldn't.

251
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:58,758
We couldn't produce all that content for these people with $50,000.

252
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:00,920
It also didn't make sense.

253
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:04,583
But we also couldn't lower the barrier for other people.

254
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:05,704
So we removed it.

255
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:07,326
We replaced it with Bling.

256
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:10,361
Bling became a pure cosmetic currency.

257
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:11,663
We made that clear from the beginning.

258
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:18,591
Bling can be used to buy almost all the skins, all the cosmetic items in the game, except the higher rarities of items.

259
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:23,842
So we wanted to make cosmetic items more accessible for free-to-play players as well.

260
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,405
We hoped it would generate some hype in the community.

261
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,108
And the catalog is the second feature here.

262
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:33,212
The catalog was our new way to distribute skins.

263
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:37,316
When Bross was launched, we had like less than 20 skins in the game.

264
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:43,498
And so you had a random, random four skins showing up in your store every day.

265
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,479
For 20 skins, that works.

266
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,699
When it shows up, you buy it.

267
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,319
That was the only way to buy skins.

268
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,380
But by this moment, we had over 300 skins in the game.

269
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,521
So waiting for the skin you really, really wanted was really cumbersome.

270
00:21:58,861 --> 00:21:59,761
So we resolved it.

271
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:00,742
We removed that barrier.

272
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:02,622
People could just go and buy skins.

273
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:07,896
Quick show of hands.

274
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:09,157
These two updates.

275
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:13,100
How many of you think those changes were positive for our community?

276
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:15,202
Oh, wow.

277
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:15,703
Wow.

278
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:17,224
OK.

279
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:17,684
Some hands.

280
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:18,045
All right.

281
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:18,505
Good stuff.

282
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,166
Good stuff.

283
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:23,269
Yes.

284
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:24,971
I guess everybody is negative then.

285
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:26,132
OK.

286
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:31,231
Both features were, in fact, embraced by our core community.

287
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:35,635
So if you looked on Reddit or Twitter, people were raving about it.

288
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:39,178
They were like, ah, the developers, they finally get their shit together.

289
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:42,902
And it's like, sorry, PR person.

290
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:45,964
We didn't rehearse this part.

291
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:46,605
No, we did not.

292
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:51,009
I'm getting the evil eye from our PR person.

293
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:59,536
But yeah, the reality was, unfortunately, not that rosy.

294
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:02,618
Our DAU kept declining.

295
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:07,141
So the Star Road hit, brought a ton of people back.

296
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:13,686
But as you can see, even by the time the Mars 3 update arrived, we were already below the November numbers in DAU.

297
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:20,011
And Mars 3s and Blink did not really change that trajectory, at least not immediately.

298
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:27,404
Um, these are the 30 retention cohorts both for bling and masteries.

299
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:44,245
The important learning here for us, and that's maybe also a pretty obvious thing to say, but big changes, just because you feel like, oh, we need to make a big change, we need to shake up things.

300
00:23:45,486 --> 00:23:47,447
Those big changes are rarely a silver bullet.

301
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:50,429
It's not like, we make this big change, everything will get good.

302
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,992
So Star Road did not fix our problems at all.

303
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:57,843
And yes, big changes can be part of the solution.

304
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:02,407
But by themselves, it's more like rolling the dice and see if it will work or not.

305
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:19,141
So for us, we transitioned actually about mid last year to a place where we take selected big bets and go much deeper with making incremental, less controversial improvements to the game, both for us and our players.

306
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:28,932
Yeah, basically incremental improvements and this learning of like that, you know, you don't need to change a lot to change everything.

307
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:32,794
I think that was also a key learning coming from this.

308
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,455
And for us it was also

309
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,241
Another secondary learning, maybe, if you will.

310
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:43,603
But people really don't play, at least Brawl Stars, for the systems at all.

311
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,404
They play it because of the gameplay, because the gameplay is engaging.

312
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:52,386
And we spent possibly 80% of our dev resources on systems at that point.

313
00:24:54,146 --> 00:24:54,967
Now we don't anymore.

314
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:55,887
And it shows.

315
00:24:59,522 --> 00:24:59,763
Awesome.

316
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:00,844
All right.

317
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:08,156
So as Frank mentioned, the Star Road didn't succeed in recovering the game, which is a huge gut punch, because that's what I was brought on to do.

318
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,584
At this point, I was like, maybe I won't be here much longer.

319
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:21,992
But I think the key here was that we didn't understand what our players wanted in the sense that we were kind of in this echo chamber.

320
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:31,236
Because even when we were showing our design for the Star Road and how we were going to remove loot boxes from the game to a bunch of other teams, and some folks were really critical.

321
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:37,638
But because our pretense was we've already made this decision to remove loot boxes, people didn't actually question that.

322
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:42,000
And so this echo chamber effect was very real.

323
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:53,180
And that gets to kind of the fourth learning is you really have to find folks to challenge you, particularly on big changes and particularly on what Amazon calls like one-way door decisions.

324
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,862
So you can't really go back from this.

325
00:25:54,902 --> 00:25:57,004
Like once Star Road is in, it's there.

326
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,125
It's there forever.

327
00:25:58,545 --> 00:25:59,065
at least for now.

328
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:23,759
And so, I mean, we did get, like, critical feedback, but it was more on the design of the Star Road and not so much... Actually, it was, like, second month into the job, I went to show one of our more vocal teams that were, like, the, you know, original Brawl Stars creators that had moved on to a new project, and I got grilled for half an hour on, like, the first version, which you don't see here, on the first version of the Star Road.

329
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,982
So they do give us very impromptu feedback, and it sometimes comes really harsh.

330
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:41,348
And now on the team, culturally, we're very happy to call each other out and talk about, you know, hey, I don't think this is the right design, and we have very constructive and sometimes very colorful discussions.

331
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:50,232
And we don't hold it sacred, like, maybe this is part of the Finnish culture, but, like, people are very brutally honest and happy to voice their complaints.

332
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:54,419
And then that actually comes back to really help us.

333
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:02,545
So, all right, we hit our lowest monthly active users ever around Q1 of 2023.

334
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:08,049
And at this point, I'm like, look, confidence, my confidence level is shattered.

335
00:27:09,814 --> 00:27:14,716
But, you know, despite this, team morale was actually really strong.

336
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:18,938
And as a team, we felt quite empowered to turn Brawl around.

337
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:21,339
There wasn't a lot of this self-victimizing.

338
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,282
There was just a strong focus on, well, look, we're in this position.

339
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:27,362
We're now the underdog.

340
00:27:28,343 --> 00:27:30,744
What can we do to really save the game?

341
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:32,925
I mean,

342
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:41,433
Certainly, if it did come through, it didn't come through the team, and maybe Frank took the brunt of it from other folks, but not... I had full hair before that.

343
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:50,238
And as a team, we just started to really reflect, like, why didn't we hit the mark?

344
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:54,717
We looked up, certainly, a bunch of internal data.

345
00:27:54,997 --> 00:27:59,998
I mean, internal data is really good at predicting historical trends, not really good at predicting the future.

346
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,719
And then we started looking more closely at our player sentiment.

347
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:10,200
Our community team is very in touch with the community, and there's a lot of very good dialogue.

348
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,081
And I want to highlight one particular from TrollFaces777.

349
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:22,373
who writes, Brawl Stars without chests, and he's referring to boxes, is not fun.

350
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:24,015
Please return them.

351
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:29,201
And I guess he had another thought there after that, because he kind of trails off.

352
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,442
But we got the picture.

353
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:35,949
We got a lot of one-star Google Play reviews in that period, like a lot.

354
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:36,910
Yeah.

355
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:43,733
So whatever plans we had for the rest of the year were actually trashed.

356
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:44,833
This is Ash.

357
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:46,874
He's a trash bin brawler in our game.

358
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,615
So we thought that would be a good reference point.

359
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:50,716
Are you struck by something?

360
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:51,296
Because I was.

361
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:54,637
This was about March, April time frame.

362
00:28:55,578 --> 00:29:04,381
And the fact that we were willing to just scrap our plans for what the June update was, and we had planned out the next couple of updates, we ship every two months.

363
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:08,543
I was really inspired by how quickly the team

364
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,300
kind of can make these decisions.

365
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:21,845
Because in June, we made the decision, we shipped this decision, which was we had to infuse rewards once again with excitement.

366
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:30,250
That the deterministic reward structure that we had with Star Road and vertical progression really was not working for us.

367
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,612
Players were not entertained when they came and played the game anymore, and it showed through in our numbers.

368
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,835
And yeah, so what did we do in June?

369
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:41,177
Well, we added random engagement rewards.

370
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:44,179
So you earn these by playing the game back into the game.

371
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,841
And this is what they look like.

372
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:48,703
Instead of a box, they're now a star.

373
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:49,664
Totally different.

374
00:29:50,544 --> 00:29:56,009
And what happened is you click, and there's a chance that the reward can upgrade.

375
00:29:57,423 --> 00:30:22,876
From our lowest rarity which is rare to our highest which is a legendary that was a mythic one that you saw there which is our second highest rarity and every time you tap there's a chance it upgrades and We do think the design of this definitely helped us and I think there was like two key things The first is if you are considering designing random rewards this anticipation is really important that the fact that the player is

376
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:23,605
I'm

377
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:50,258
The other really important thing is that it's really important to have a high highs in the sense that your jackpot rewards need to feel like jackpot rewards.

378
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:55,702
So the legendary, which is our highest rarity, that needs to have some really juicy rewards in there.

379
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:59,524
And actually, when we launched it, we did not have a really good legendary reward.

380
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:07,050
From the team, we actually had to improve upon this over a few months to kind of get it to where it is today that you can enjoy.

381
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:16,052
Just to be really clear, we also added cosmetic items, cosmetic skins, into the old box model.

382
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:16,833
We did not have skins.

383
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:20,135
Skins are actually a huge, exciting point to unlock.

384
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:21,916
And so we added those also in.

385
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:25,839
And this system complements the Star Road in the sense that we did not pull the Star Road out.

386
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:31,042
This was just something that was added on top instead of deterministic rewards in a lot of places.

387
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:38,471
And we do think that a key aspect of design that worked was we made it really obvious it was on the main hub.

388
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,012
It's really easy to understand.

389
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,113
You get three of these a day, and you just have to win.

390
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:45,033
So there's no elaborate quests.

391
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:48,675
If you're playing Brawl, hopefully you're winning at least above 50%.

392
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:50,956
And you'll get these.

393
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,076
You can't miss them.

394
00:31:55,557 --> 00:31:57,058
So what were the initial results?

395
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:03,980
Let's take a look at retention first.

396
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,363
Again, D30 is a set we're using all the time.

397
00:32:09,064 --> 00:32:11,306
We almost don't care about D1, D7, etc.

398
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:15,710
So we're very focused on the longer tail, and that starts, in our opinion, with D30.

399
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:28,096
So the Blink Catalog update and the Startups update, which also included another piece, which is a re-engagement program.

400
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:31,238
Before that, you would come back to Brawl Stars, and there was nothing.

401
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:33,339
So if you were gone for two years, you came back.

402
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:40,304
There's probably 20 new Brawlers, five new game modes, a lot of new systems, and we didn't reintroduce people at all.

403
00:32:40,864 --> 00:32:41,545
And now we did that.

404
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:43,126
We learned from Clash of Clans, actually.

405
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:46,288
We had a similar program, and ours worked really, really well.

406
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:49,439
So the retention worked out.

407
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:59,296
And as a result of that, our ADU started to recover, or the decline started slowing down at least.

408
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:10,802
Now the interesting piece about this graph specifically is that, again, like it's summer period, the lion's share of our player base is in Europe.

409
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:14,064
A lot of people go on vacation, as I mentioned earlier.

410
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:15,845
We always see a drop.

411
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:18,067
We always see a drop into the summer period.

412
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,468
but the drop was curiously flatter now.

413
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:27,901
We didn't release much new content in that period, so it's really people get just more sticky to the game.

414
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:42,076
The learning here is probably the most obvious from our perspective, but random rewards are indeed exciting for our players.

415
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:47,038
And maybe that's so because our players grew up with a gacha in the game.

416
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:59,704
But the amount of people buying into the completely unreal experience, they were just a much smaller group than the people who wanted an exciting gacha experience.

417
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,933
So we're able to recover a little bit more in the future now.

418
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,857
So this is already 30 until February.

419
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,320
And you see the startups update there on the left.

420
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:20,764
And that was just the beginning of the recovery.

421
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:25,905
The first update we shipped after the Star Drops was hyperchargers.

422
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:27,625
That update was in September.

423
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:34,028
It improved the value proposition for power level 11 in the game.

424
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:36,850
So we replaced gears from that slot.

425
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,031
So we didn't want to introduce a new power level.

426
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:40,772
We moved that a little bit lower.

427
00:34:41,772 --> 00:34:45,954
And now you had, on power 11, the possibility to unlock a hypercharge.

428
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:48,155
And we only introduced six at the beginning.

429
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:55,013
And we were highly inspired by Clash Royale at that point, who just had shipped card evolutions.

430
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:56,934
So there's a lot of cross-team learnings.

431
00:34:57,114 --> 00:34:58,315
If something works, it works.

432
00:34:58,795 --> 00:34:59,736
And we all want to use it.

433
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,938
Clash Royale might just have introduced star drops.

434
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,259
They're not called like that.

435
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,661
They're boxes, so they're completely different.

436
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:15,151
So what, what hyperchargers do, as I said, they unlock at power 11.

437
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:18,032
But they really give you a hero moment every game.

438
00:35:18,872 --> 00:35:21,513
So if you're a good player, you get probably two, three hero moments.

439
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:23,975
And if you're an average player, you get probably one hero moment.

440
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:27,636
And in that moment, so you charge it along your super.

441
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:32,258
And in that moment, you just get faster, stronger, and tougher.

442
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:34,299
And the supers change.

443
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:38,338
This is an example of how that looks with Shelly.

444
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:44,140
So she's just on speed, runs really, really fast.

445
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,800
Her super is much stronger than before.

446
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,541
And has a wider range, so it modifies the gameplay of that brawler.

447
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:52,122
We lean into kind of their strengths.

448
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:57,007
The first batch of six hyperchargers was received OK.

449
00:35:59,248 --> 00:36:05,231
I think we managed to reach about 25% of the original target for revenue.

450
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:07,552
So that was not great.

451
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:12,915
But we quickly took the learnings from that and iterated for the next releases.

452
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,026
So hyperjudice arrived here.

453
00:36:18,866 --> 00:36:21,348
Again, our retention pretty much flat at this point.

454
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:24,490
Shortly after, we had a community event.

455
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,273
The first community event after the Omega Box event.

456
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,975
So we didn't do one for a long time.

457
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:36,878
Shooting Star Drops, it was an event that was triggered by the community.

458
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:38,199
Again, the community could play.

459
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:39,880
Takedowns were counted.

460
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,982
And depending on where the community would end up, they would get bonuses.

461
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,831
And we also added hyperchargers to startups at that point.

462
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:57,733
And last but not least, we also turned on a LiveOps modifier to get two startups every time you would get one before.

463
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,894
And again, community event was super hyper.

464
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:03,094
It was pretty clear that people liked startups.

465
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:05,235
And wanted more.

466
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:06,395
And wanted more, yes.

467
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:08,056
And this was like a very slight change for us.

468
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:09,596
Like, you just get double.

469
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:11,163
That's the event.

470
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:17,048
And then we have this progress bar that we track as to how many takedowns the community has received.

471
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:19,451
And it's just a bar that moves up.

472
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:20,932
And that's it.

473
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:21,613
That's the design.

474
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:24,608
Then we also introduced the MegaPig.

475
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:28,629
The MegaPig, I'm not actually sure how we ended up with a pig.

476
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,230
I wanted a pinata.

477
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:38,873
But anyhow, so we had the MegaPig that replaced the previous social features, which were Club League and Quests.

478
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:42,775
Club League was an event going on every other week.

479
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:46,937
Every other week, you got tickets and had to play on three different days.

480
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:49,579
to get rewards.

481
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,045
Now the mega pick is once a month for three days, very clear on a weekend.

482
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:59,272
In the old world, you had to play 24 to 36 matches per month, depending on the length of the month.

483
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:00,433
Now you play 15 a month.

484
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:08,014
Um, previously you had a choice, depending on where you were in the game, regular matches or competitive matches, which are rather long.

485
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:10,136
Best of three, picks, bans.

486
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:12,979
Now we have just a simplified format.

487
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,081
It's a competitive format without bans.

488
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:16,843
It's just best of one.

489
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:20,687
And we also introduced modifiers to the game to make it a bit more lighthearted and fun.

490
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:27,551
Before that, you got club coins from your club rewards, and then there was a store.

491
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:32,153
From that store, you could buy specific items only for club coins.

492
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:34,493
We removed all that complexity.

493
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:41,655
Now, in the Megapick, as your club is filling the Megapick, you just get more and more star drops as a reward at the end.

494
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:46,533
And yeah, we had league ranks before, no more ranks, no more hard corners.

495
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:52,894
Our goal was to get the old system engaged less than 10% of our DAU.

496
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:57,775
And our goal was 20 for the MegaPig.

497
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,295
And currently we're sitting above 40% participation.

498
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:03,316
And this cut, we cut a ton of complexity.

499
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,376
As Frank mentioned, it took him that long to explain the design.

500
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:11,197
This new format is literally for three days a week you come in, there's a MegaPig

501
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:16,380
Game mode, you click it, you play, and then you earn for the club.

502
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:16,980
And that's it.

503
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,121
That's the basic design.

504
00:39:22,102 --> 00:39:27,645
The startup effect, the community event shooting startup effect, and then the megapick release here.

505
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:30,426
And once again, our retention improved a little.

506
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:38,645
The next update we shipped took our old brawl pass and transitioned it to a new pass.

507
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:41,666
And the easiest to compare those two is this slide.

508
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:46,529
The old pass was a bi-monthly event, 7 to 9 weeks.

509
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:48,890
The new one is 4 to 5 weeks every month.

510
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:51,672
Always starts on the first Thursday of a month.

511
00:39:52,953 --> 00:39:59,194
The old one was available for gems, which is our premium currency, 169 gems, or IP USD 99.

512
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:10,157
Now, the interesting piece here is that on the free track of the pass, you could earn 90 gems for free, which means that free-to-play players could buy the pass every other season for free.

513
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:18,699
And so, and yeah, and the value proposition was 13x, and it included an exclusive brawler that was part of that season.

514
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,139
Now we changed it quite drastically.

515
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,200
It's now IAP only.

516
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,021
The regular pass costs 6.99 and the big pass costs 9.99.

517
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,181
It's called plus.

518
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:32,362
There's no more exclusive brawler in there, which I had some sleepless nights over.

519
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:40,704
We can give out actually more gems for people because they cannot spend them on getting the raw pass anymore.

520
00:40:41,444 --> 00:40:47,306
And we were able to increase the value proposition for paying players because we wouldn't give that to all the free-to-play players anymore.

521
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:50,997
At the same time, we buffed the free progression.

522
00:40:51,838 --> 00:41:00,166
So we took what they earned before in the premium pass every other season and the regular stuff and all merged that into the new monthly season.

523
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,329
So the free-to-play players actually got a buff out of all of this.

524
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,791
So they felt pretty good with it.

525
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:12,677
And of course, payers also feel pretty good with it because all of a sudden we get a lot more value.

526
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:18,585
So how would the community respond if the broadcast was only available as an IRP?

527
00:41:19,225 --> 00:41:21,788
Well, again, that could have gone really, really bad for us.

528
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,210
And we countered that in three ways.

529
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:29,174
We communicated really early that we would make a change, early November.

530
00:41:29,894 --> 00:41:33,097
The first new season would start in January, to give a frame of reference.

531
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:36,800
We also, as I already mentioned, we buffed the free-to-play progression.

532
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,334
And we were, in general, really, really transparent with the community who would get what in the new world.

533
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:45,917
So we showed a table on socials even like two months before.

534
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:54,125
And so people could compare, content creators could create content around it, and actually like, you know, oh, yeah, they're not lying to us.

535
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:55,726
This is actually more.

536
00:41:56,827 --> 00:42:02,392
And community sentiment went to a place where people all of a sudden were rather positive with all those changes.

537
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:06,317
which was absolutely not expected.

538
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:31,424
and he made a very strong stance, almost like a die on the hill kind of stance, that if we didn't execute properly and buff free-to-play with this, it was going to be a non-starter and we were going to flail really, really hard.

539
00:42:31,524 --> 00:42:41,510
And we've seen other games out, because we do our research, and it's really hard to do this transition if you're free-to-play looking at this and saying, now I have to pay, and not every two months, every month.

540
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:51,030
Um, so we just tried really hard to get in front of it and be transparent and in plain English tell you, Hey, this is what you're getting in the new world.

541
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,811
The exact, almost like the exact numbers.

542
00:42:52,831 --> 00:43:01,359
Like Jeff, who's one of the other design, really talented designer on the team, like crunched a bunch of numbers and work with Danny on this and the community folks to really get this.

543
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:06,843
And I do think this is, it ended up being really well received as a result of all that hard work.

544
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:08,625
So, so shout out to all those folks.

545
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:14,887
We also added 5v5 game modes that comes to speak about the gameplay side.

546
00:43:15,407 --> 00:43:20,028
We finally decided to actually increase the team size a little, so we would have more people working on gameplay.

547
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:21,808
That happened about mid last year.

548
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:27,669
And so the first results showed in December when we were able to ship some new game modes.

549
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:30,650
The community had asked us to have 5v5 for a long, long time.

550
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,990
We always, ah, there's so many problems with this.

551
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,411
And then we just decided to do it for the community.

552
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:37,711
And it was really positive.

553
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,352
And so we had some more community events to send off another currency.

554
00:43:46,013 --> 00:43:47,514
Then the Raw Pass update arrived.

555
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:53,577
Then we had another event where you could play together to earn more rewards.

556
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:56,859
And then maybe about Star Drops.

557
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:57,740
Yeah.

558
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:05,064
And after introducing them in June, we continued to kind of add them to other key areas of the game.

559
00:44:06,448 --> 00:44:09,931
So we have a couple of key areas we consider pivotal to the game.

560
00:44:10,532 --> 00:44:11,413
One is Trophy Road.

561
00:44:11,453 --> 00:44:12,494
This is your main progression.

562
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:14,716
Everybody talks about the game in terms of how many trophies they own.

563
00:44:14,856 --> 00:44:16,397
You earn trophies for playing matches.

564
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:17,518
We added them there.

565
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:20,961
We added them to Megapig, as Frank mentioned earlier.

566
00:44:21,882 --> 00:44:25,085
We added them as live ops and offers that you saw at the community events.

567
00:44:25,225 --> 00:44:29,049
All of them largely centered around this new star drop and just getting more star drops.

568
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,332
And we added them to the pass on the free track.

569
00:44:33,543 --> 00:44:39,987
And lastly, more recently in February update, we added them as we revamped our rank mode, which also had very low participation rate.

570
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:44,070
So we felt we had to kind of go back and rework a lot of the key systems.

571
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:56,118
And over the last eight months, the trend has been to revamp old systems that have very low participation rate, make them easier to understand, and add more random rewards in the process.

572
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,882
So zoomed out again a little bit on looking at MAU.

573
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:04,434
This is how this looked.

574
00:45:05,294 --> 00:45:11,338
So you can see things consistently becoming more flat at summer, even going up a little.

575
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:13,959
And then from there, just kept creeping up.

576
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:26,366
And so the increase between our low point over there, which was June 2023 and February, we increased our MAU by 2.4x.

577
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:30,689
Zoomed in a little, looking at the average DAU.

578
00:45:32,457 --> 00:45:34,258
that actually improved by 3.9x.

579
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:41,740
So it's not only that more people are playing the game, it's also they're playing it more intensively.

580
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:48,203
And some of these changes, like the brawl pass being shorter, always a brawl pass waiting for you, et cetera, surely have to do with that.

581
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:52,444
And the last but not least, the revenue.

582
00:45:56,757 --> 00:46:01,119
An increase by 8.8x from June last year to February.

583
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,802
And March is on track of being a growth month as well.

584
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,884
So that feels pretty good for the team.

585
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:15,326
We call that doing OK in Finland.

586
00:46:17,347 --> 00:46:18,548
The Finns in the room appreciate it.

587
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:26,743
When you see, the learning here is that when you see retention-based momentum, really double down with everything you have.

588
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:30,606
You know, these hype moments and driving installs, that's easy.

589
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:32,548
There's always a tool.

590
00:46:32,568 --> 00:46:40,114
There's UA, you can go massive there, you can invest a lot of money, or you find other ways like content creators to work with.

591
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:43,977
Creating temporary momentum for a game is not the difficult exercise.

592
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:46,539
The difficult exercise is to improve retention.

593
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:56,548
And when retention is there, everything that you do, every hype moment, every USD you spend on UA, all of that becomes much more powerful.

594
00:46:57,428 --> 00:47:00,931
So we were able, once the star drops and the re-engagement calendar

595
00:47:01,895 --> 00:47:08,860
changed our attention to something much more meaningful that allowed us then to invest heavier in UA.

596
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:17,586
It allowed us to push more with the community side because all of a sudden we're driving people into the game and they're actually sticking around.

597
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:23,029
So at this point you might wonder

598
00:47:24,237 --> 00:47:25,317
OK, we had boxes.

599
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:29,499
There's obvious nervousness when you remove loop boxes as your primary monetization.

600
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:33,081
How does that change in terms of paying behavior?

601
00:47:33,421 --> 00:47:36,922
And what does it look like in a world where rewards are largely deterministic?

602
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:43,145
Because you can't monetize on star drops, largely speaking.

603
00:47:44,187 --> 00:47:46,809
This graph can show you that story.

604
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,974
So from January to December 2022 is the less-than half side.

605
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,215
That was when boxes were in.

606
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:57,779
This is just looking at the equivalent of boxes in the old world versus the new world.

607
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,202
So we don't have broad paths on here because it would mess with the comparisons.

608
00:48:02,703 --> 00:48:07,567
And in the new world, starting December, you could basically buy coins,

609
00:48:08,107 --> 00:48:18,795
You can unlock a brawler by just spending paid gems, you can level them up spending paid gems, or gems in general, and items we call the gameplay related stuff.

610
00:48:18,835 --> 00:48:24,620
And you can see actually, we were shocked by this, that it's been relatively consistent.

611
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,001
And we did not expect it to be this stable.

612
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:30,882
And now we're actually trending up, as you can see, towards the end of that.

613
00:48:31,582 --> 00:48:38,344
So this was definitely surprising to us that we were able to transition off of loopbox-based monetization, largely speaking.

614
00:48:38,444 --> 00:48:44,066
So that gets to the recap, which is I'll just go over the key learnings.

615
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:51,349
And then I'll summarize with a final lesson that's on here for folks to take an easy screenshot of.

616
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:54,330
The first is, when wrestling with a design, simplify.

617
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:56,669
And I can't stress this point enough.

618
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:04,916
It's like a lot of the designs and features that we've done since have been a lot of simplification while trying to maintain depth.

619
00:49:04,996 --> 00:49:09,400
That's ultimately where we think the best design lies in terms of elegance.

620
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,223
The second is to reduce noise, particularly around big changes.

621
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,005
You saw us introduce Omega Box, a bunch of other December stuff.

622
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:19,448
Probably should have moved Star Road to February, for instance.

623
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:24,403
The third is that big changes are, in our case, not a silver bullet.

624
00:49:24,743 --> 00:49:35,965
That actually, if you look at all the incremental improvements we've made since June, those were all, like, relatively small in terms of, versus the Star Road took, like, six months of development.

625
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:41,326
Each of those updates, for better or for worse, we kind of develop in two months and we ship every two months.

626
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:48,488
So we double down on one major feature every two months and we kind of, we do that.

627
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:53,125
It's a lot of this is like incremental improvements.

628
00:49:53,946 --> 00:49:57,789
The fourth is to really find people who can challenge you.

629
00:49:58,149 --> 00:49:59,971
And on the team, some of the folks are here today.

630
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:03,153
They challenge us every day, especially on design related stuff.

631
00:50:03,173 --> 00:50:11,020
So hats off to everybody that's here and everybody who's watching remote and on the team that are working on the maintenance right now that we have going on.

632
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:14,387
that's really, really important culturally for us.

633
00:50:15,027 --> 00:50:19,370
The fifth is random rewards are really exciting, especially for engagement purposes.

634
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:25,134
And the last is if you see retention-based momentum, double down.

635
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:32,139
And maybe like the final thing to kind of wrap this up for us is ultimately the player doesn't care about any specific thing you do.

636
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,103
When they come and play the game, they're subconsciously asking themselves, were they entertained?

637
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,685
And if the answer is no for too many days in a row,

638
00:50:41,044 --> 00:50:42,065
you get what we had in June.

639
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:57,956
And I think what we've done, and a lot of this is, we don't know how much of which contributed to this kind of historical highs that we've hit five years into the game, but certainly players come back and they're entertained, and they're telling their friends to come back.

640
00:50:58,677 --> 00:51:03,600
And we think a lot of it is maybe viral spread through the school networks.

641
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:08,284
So thank you for having schools in this world to help spread Brawl Stars.

642
00:51:10,555 --> 00:51:11,736
And that concludes our talk.

643
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:22,402
So there's a lot of stuff that we didn't get a chance to cover, but certainly there's a lot of details here and a lot of work done by a lot of the team that is not captured in this presentation.

644
00:51:23,002 --> 00:51:27,585
But certainly you can come and ask us about any of the specifics there.

645
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,946
And certainly we're hiring, hiring a lot of roles.

646
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:37,810
And so if you are interested in joining our grant, this adventure, please consider that too.

647
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:39,491
That's it.

648
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:40,232
Thank you for your time.

649
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,951
I guess maybe, do we have time for a few questions?

650
00:51:55,332 --> 00:51:55,692
Not sure.

651
00:51:55,832 --> 00:51:57,513
We have ten minutes for some questions.

652
00:52:06,479 --> 00:52:06,819
Hello.

653
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,380
Thank you so much for the talk.

654
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:17,366
Do you have a target retention rate that you kind of know is going to lead to the growth that you're looking for?

655
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:29,830
And just like what's the KPIs that are indicating that you're heading in the right direction versus you know Maybe not what you're looking for Is it d30 pretty much it?

656
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:37,334
I don't think we have a target retention rate per se.

657
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:40,955
It's like we're constantly looking at how the courts do.

658
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:50,817
We talk now a lot about new player attention as well, depending on when your game is returning player attention is probably more important in process.

659
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:58,458
Last early last year, the amount of returning users coming into the game every day started outpacing the amount of new users, for example.

660
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:01,219
So, you know, we had to really take serious

661
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:04,281
that we had to measure returning player retention, et cetera.

662
00:53:05,022 --> 00:53:07,404
There's no specific target number in mind.

663
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:13,408
Other indicators, really, as long as the graphs go up, that's it.

664
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:17,812
But there's a gazillion of different KPIs we're looking at every day, really.

665
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:18,956
and

666
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:42,529
The way the team is structured now is that within Supercell, we transitioned to a world where each of the live game teams, which we call cells, they're essentially independent business units.

667
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:47,934
And within those, we have sub-cells, run usually by a lead or a captain.

668
00:53:49,036 --> 00:53:53,100
And in Brawl Stars, we made the separation that we have a feature development team,

669
00:53:54,321 --> 00:53:55,542
and we have a gameplay team.

670
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:57,583
That's how we split.

671
00:53:58,184 --> 00:54:04,828
Today is still like the, I would say the development team is still much bigger in terms of headcount than the gameplay side.

672
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:09,550
But this is mostly because a lot of people are flexing between roles.

673
00:54:09,911 --> 00:54:15,114
You know, we have a few people actually in the room who are working like as a, for example, UX, UI artist.

674
00:54:15,734 --> 00:54:18,216
who will also work on gameplay stuff when necessary.

675
00:54:18,777 --> 00:54:23,581
Or we have client programmers and server engineers on the team who don't mind flexing in one direction or the other.

676
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,323
So we're trying to stay as flexible as possible on that side.

677
00:54:27,384 --> 00:54:29,066
Other game teams are structured in different ways.

678
00:54:29,586 --> 00:54:33,950
So at Supercell, we made the decision that each of the live games can ultimately decide how they want to work.

679
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:36,512
Do you stagger releases between the both of them?

680
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:37,733
No, we don't.

681
00:54:37,914 --> 00:54:40,216
We are having goals for both things every update cycle.

682
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:41,257
Thank you so much.

683
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:41,517
Thank you.

684
00:54:42,438 --> 00:54:51,122
And there's a lot more focus on gameplay iteration now than ever before, because ultimately that is really, really important for us, rather than just purely a systems change.

685
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:53,323
Hey, thanks a lot for the talk.

686
00:54:54,144 --> 00:55:00,347
I'm wondering just generally in Supercell, like in current teams and also going forward, what the feeling on loot boxes is.

687
00:55:00,827 --> 00:55:07,530
Is there like a systemic movement away from them, or is it sort of each team is kind of making its own decision as they go?

688
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:11,212
There's no mandate from the company, so it's completely down to the game teams.

689
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:18,173
But I mean, in terms of how the game teams are feeling about it generally, do you see kind of a movement away from it, or is it kind of all over?

690
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:20,054
I would say it's pretty much 50-50 still.

691
00:55:20,454 --> 00:55:25,776
So some game teams still believe in it, and some other game teams want to try something else.

692
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:29,338
But there's no, again, independent business units.

693
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:35,020
Each game team can make their own decisions, and there's no pressure from the outside to go one way or another.

694
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:37,789
I'm not sure how hard that definition is.

695
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:39,830
The way we're using them right now is mostly engagement-based.

696
00:55:55,137 --> 00:56:18,173
We have introduced them as part of chain offers as freebies We might in the future offer them for gems again It's like you know we're always trying to do the best for our players And we ultimately will experiment with things to see how our players accept them Yeah, I would I would expect more experiments from our side with with random rewards Thanks

697
00:56:22,156 --> 00:56:31,760
Hello So one of your bullet points was to try to reduce noise around big changes so you can measure the success easier How do you do that?

698
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:47,687
Because I know that you mentioned that summer was like kind of your slow season and if you know that Christmas time, you know Everyone has Christmas money and there's more spend and I'm sure there's some changes that you'd want to piggyback on Christmas How do you like balance that tension between like oh this we want to make this easier to measure?

699
00:56:48,107 --> 00:56:49,988
Versus we want this to piggyback on Christmas

700
00:56:51,811 --> 00:56:52,431
I mean, it depends.

701
00:56:52,812 --> 00:57:02,419
If you could ship the thing a little bit earlier to have still some clean data from October or November before going into the Christmas period, you can of course ship it a little bit later.

702
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,801
I guess it depends a lot on the game.

703
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:07,443
In our case, January is usually

704
00:57:08,283 --> 00:57:12,027
on a similar level revenue-wise, for example, like December still.

705
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:17,111
So, yeah, I think you could work around it.

706
00:57:17,672 --> 00:57:20,815
But I also don't think it would be a problem if you have just this one big change.

707
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:25,900
Because if you have historical data from previous years, you know, oh, my game is usually going this direction.

708
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,282
So then you can compare a little bit easier maybe.

709
00:57:29,702 --> 00:57:31,163
But for us it was just too much.

710
00:57:31,223 --> 00:57:37,006
We were in this mindset that we always wanted to do really as much as possible and squeeze it into every update.

711
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:42,429
And I do, from today's perspective, I think that was a mistake.

712
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,110
And we would like to move away from that.

713
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:50,133
And we've started a very conscious journey now to move away from that and be very deliberate about that.

714
00:57:50,773 --> 00:57:53,795
Like, oh no, we are not shipping these two big things at the same time.

715
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:55,978
Thank you so much.

716
00:57:56,038 --> 00:57:56,398
You're welcome.

717
00:57:58,379 --> 00:57:58,999
Hello, Franks.

718
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:04,760
Your journey has been incredible since beta, and you've had to pivot many times.

719
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,281
And thank you for bringing those insights to GDC.

720
00:58:08,181 --> 00:58:11,042
Supercell is also known for dropping projects that don't work out.

721
00:58:11,262 --> 00:58:14,702
So what metrics kept Brawl Stars alive?

722
00:58:16,343 --> 00:58:16,883
What metric?

723
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:25,074
Yeah, well Frank was there for some critical, critical periods of time when the game was still being killed, so it's probably best to answer this.

724
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:37,781
I think it's really like, it sounds super fluffy, okay, but besides metrics, of course if the metrics say this is an absolute no-go from our experience, then the team will probably kill their darlings.

725
00:58:38,947 --> 00:58:45,896
But if things are a bit more on the edge, then there's a second component, and that is the team.

726
00:58:46,677 --> 00:58:48,379
How does a team feel with their product?

727
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,105
We're not making top-down decisions, so it's not our leadership team saying, you've got to kill this game.

728
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:55,864
They will challenge you probably if it doesn't look great.

729
00:58:55,924 --> 00:59:00,587
And if you don't have answers, you will probably come to the conclusion yourself that you've got to kill it.

730
00:59:02,068 --> 00:59:04,650
But in Brosser's case, for example, it was very much on the edge.

731
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:09,713
Before we made the decision to go global between May and June,

732
00:59:10,573 --> 00:59:16,695
2018, we were in the situation where we rolled it also out to the soft launch to Android, which we hadn't done before.

733
00:59:17,175 --> 00:59:18,756
And that changed the numbers already a lot.

734
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:23,057
But it was still like, eh, you know, it's like, could go this way, could go that way.

735
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:28,039
Then we compared against Clash and Royale data, and we were like, oh, we look pretty bad, actually.

736
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:35,882
But there were a lot of people in the team back then, the data science in the team, it was really conservative.

737
00:59:36,562 --> 00:59:38,904
So he always, you know, assumed the worst.

738
00:59:39,264 --> 00:59:44,268
He was like, Frank, we're going to hit March, and I'll go to 13 million DAU, and then we're going to die.

739
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:49,552
And that was not super inspiring, as you can imagine, maybe.

740
00:59:50,072 --> 00:59:51,954
So it was really about like,

741
00:59:53,835 --> 01:00:06,587
Trying to give other perspectives other angles and like hey, there's possibly also best case and you know Clash of Clans was released in 2020 12 Does it still make sense to compare game in 2018, which is an action game with a very different audience?

742
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:10,339
So it's like, sorry, there's maybe a convoluted answer.

743
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,200
But there is a mix between the KPIs need to look good.

744
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,701
We have a lot of benchmark values there.

745
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:17,002
But there's also the team component.

746
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:23,605
If a team believes, then you can mitigate risk by having a smaller budget for going global, for example, marketing-wise.

747
01:00:24,585 --> 01:00:25,366
Thank you for believing.

748
01:00:25,386 --> 01:00:27,146
Thank you.

749
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:27,847
I think we're out of time.

750
01:00:29,027 --> 01:00:29,908
I think we're out of time.

751
01:00:29,948 --> 01:00:30,788
Sorry, we're out of time.

752
01:00:30,888 --> 01:00:33,669
But Frank and I will be outside of the room if you have some other questions.

753
01:00:33,689 --> 01:00:34,449
Yes, definitely.

754
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:34,830
Thank you.

755
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:35,470
Thanks again.
