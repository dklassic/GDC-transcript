1
00:00:06,787 --> 00:00:08,147
Hi.

2
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:16,008
So, uh, uh, the Sound of Horror, Resident Evil 7, thanks for coming to our talk.

3
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:22,430
We are Capcom audio team from Resident Evil 7, and we flew from Japan.

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,190
It's really nice to play San Francisco, actually.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,650
Thank you.

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:31,491
It's really nice, and we are super happy to give a talk here, and, uh, yeah, hope we will

7
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:32,232
be fine.

8
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:32,957
OK.

9
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,278
OK, so the next slide here.

10
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:41,407
I'm just going to give a short interaction from each of us.

11
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:46,553
So we have, my name is Akiyuki Morimoto.

12
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:48,014
I'm a composer.

13
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,678
And we have, my name is Kenji Kojima.

14
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:51,739
I'm a sound programmer.

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,575
And I'm Ken Osami, I'm a sound designer.

16
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:59,339
And good news, we have audio director here sitting here.

17
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:01,302
He's Wataru Hatsunoko.

18
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:03,565
So yeah, he's the guy actually.

19
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:06,388
So, so, so, okay, thanks, Wataru.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,324
OK, so let us just give a short overview on today's topic here.

21
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:15,987
At first part, we will just talk a little bit of Resident Evil

22
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:17,889
7, a little talk on the game features,

23
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:20,632
and some summary maybe we'll cover a little bit of.

24
00:01:20,632 --> 00:01:23,674
And the second part will be a sound design and pipeline.

25
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,076
And here we will break down to a sound effect, system

26
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:28,719
workflow, music, and working with the level designer

27
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,680
pretty much.

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,023
And each of us will give a little talk on each topics.

29
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:39,642
Okay, and we will have some video clips here to illustrate our audio works.

30
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:45,445
And you know, it's a Resident Evil 7, it's an M-rated game, so it contains intense violence,

31
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:47,567
and strong language actually is there.

32
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:52,650
So please be aware for that, and we just want to warn you first.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,852
And also there are some spoilers for those who have not played the game, so please be

34
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:58,273
aware for that too.

35
00:01:58,273 --> 00:01:59,734
Okay, so let's go.

36
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:07,385
So, Resident Evil 7. I just want to start with this short question. How many of you have played Resident Evil 7 here?

37
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,162
Wow, great, great.

38
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,063
Thank you so much.

39
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,143
It's really good to see.

40
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:13,565
OK, so the Resident Evil 7, we have new features.

41
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:17,508
It's quite a shift from the previous sequel.

42
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:20,551
But if we were to point out some of the key phrases or new

43
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,233
features in Resident Evil 7, there would be a photo real

44
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,796
visuals with first person view, really big change from

45
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:30,619
the TPS, the previous sequel, or a fixed camera from the

46
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:33,581
really old, great Resident Evil sequel.

47
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:38,083
And we may say this every time when new Resident Evil comes,

48
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,544
but it's back to its horror roots.

49
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:45,546
But I think we really tried our best to make horror games.

50
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:48,007
But yeah, again, so it's back to its horror roots.

51
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:52,985
And OK, so I'm just going to give a little bit of people

52
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:56,387
here who worked in audio production for Resident Evil 7.

53
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:59,089
So it's kind of really small here, but we have about 15

54
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:01,731
people involved in total audio team.

55
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:03,552
And I think that's kind of huge.

56
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,633
But of course, that's the maximum number.

57
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:08,175
So at the early production, pre-production, we have less

58
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:11,917
people, like audio director, maybe some of the leads.

59
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,359
And we add more people when it gets busier.

60
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:22,532
And three years of production, including prototyping, grey box testing, and vertical slice.

61
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:26,034
And we also actually developed a new engine here.

62
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:29,736
It's called RE Engine, in-house game engine designed for Resident Evil 7.

63
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,157
Resident Evil 7 RE Engine.

64
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:32,098
So it's very cool.

65
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:33,933
Yeah, nice name, actually.

66
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,714
Very, very, very straightforward.

67
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:36,775
I like it.

68
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:41,038
And we used Vicepool as a middleware.

69
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:44,360
And Kenji will explain this complicated system part.

70
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,443
And I'm a sound designer, so I don't know much about it.

71
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:48,523
But Kenji's going to tell that.

72
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,023
All right, so here we have a smiley guys here.

73
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:56,566
It's in our foley stage, so that's a lot of people there.

74
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,707
And we're smiling.

75
00:03:57,707 --> 00:04:01,730
I guess it's because of the shipment of the game, right?

76
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,313
Yeah, I mean, we are really happy that the game is shipped.

77
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:08,496
And finally, we finished the video game development, and

78
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:12,299
that's really cool.

79
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,263
And also, I think I need to, but I think I'll do it later.

80
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:18,867
OK, so the sound summary, I'm just

81
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:22,771
going to tell a little bit of our core pillow of sound.

82
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:24,312
And it's really simple here.

83
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:27,055
It's just sound of horror, because the game

84
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:29,097
is a really scary game.

85
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:32,601
So we really focused on how to scare people by sound

86
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:36,765
and how to make a more immersive experience

87
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:37,465
throughout the sound.

88
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:40,948
And so the sound of horror is the core pillar.

89
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,529
And we have some, when it breaks down, we try to house

90
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,611
the creepier mood in the game by sound.

91
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:50,793
And the blend of realistic, it's for the real visual.

92
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:54,275
So we really needed to nail the real sound by

93
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:55,275
follies and vice versa.

94
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,096
But it's dramatic.

95
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,477
I mean, it's the game.

96
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:00,378
So we have some cinematic scene as well.

97
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:03,580
So there is a blend of real drama.

98
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,687
And the pacing, silence is of course important

99
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,768
in the horror games as well.

100
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,008
If the scary sound, you know, like continuously,

101
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,449
you know, if you have like lots of scary sound,

102
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,130
then people get used to it.

103
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,850
So the pacing and the silence is also

104
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,831
are some things we really explore with.

105
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:27,352
In Traumatic Immersive, we have a VR version in the game.

106
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:30,192
So the immersive is also our key phrase here

107
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,073
and the dynamic interactive is the game.

108
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:34,633
So yeah, it's interactive.

109
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:42,230
Okay, and yeah, moving on to another part here in the sound summary still.

110
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,291
I'm going to talk a little on some sound summary.

111
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,112
So we actually re-sketched our system and workflow.

112
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:54,314
We really thought about efficiency, agility, accessibility, resource management were kind

113
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:55,294
of keyword here.

114
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:59,176
And because of our tight schedule here, we choose more automated methods.

115
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,939
And that's, yeah, we have like numbers

116
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:05,803
of automated system here, but these two are kind of being

117
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:08,706
here, the measure system here, the auto trigger

118
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:11,369
for movement, footsteps, props, some of the movement

119
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,112
on the props, and the utilize of other resources

120
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,976
such as effect collisions or meshes to change ambience,

121
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,057
reverberations, occlusions.

122
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,398
and stuff like that.

123
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:22,519
And within this automated system,

124
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,220
it's kind of really weird to say,

125
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,882
but sound implementation are taken care of or done

126
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:29,583
at some extent when upper stream assets,

127
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,584
such as animations are ready.

128
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:34,125
For example, when animations are ready,

129
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,427
there is no sound usually,

130
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:40,649
but within this new system with new component behaviors,

131
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:44,371
so we have some sound playing to some extent,

132
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:47,092
and that's taken care of automatically, so I really make.

133
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,581
things easier.

134
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:57,864
And also Kenji prepared some tools that let some designers to polish and do more, do manually

135
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,945
to brush up assets later on.

136
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:03,886
So we have both static ways and dynamic ways.

137
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:09,168
And I think from next slide I'm going to hand to Kenji and he's going to share some details

138
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:11,908
on RE Engine and our basic sound features.

139
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,382
Okay, let me talk about our new engine

140
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:22,703
and the sound system in this part.

141
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:28,144
First, I will give a quick overview of RE Engine.

142
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:30,745
RE Engine is the latest state-of-the-art

143
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:31,845
in-house game engine.

144
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,985
It was specially designed for development

145
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:36,046
of Resident Evil 7.

146
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:40,167
We can produce photorealistic results

147
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,967
and display objects of various textures

148
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,608
and to write into the smallest details.

149
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:51,074
Next will be about the sound system.

150
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:52,975
We had two aims to start with.

151
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:56,296
I designed the sound system,

152
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,517
not only basic features for game audio,

153
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:00,638
but also to meet these goals.

154
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:05,001
The first aim was the works of sound

155
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:09,143
roughly ends automatically when upstream assets are ready.

156
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,934
And the second one was to provide more spaces

157
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:17,056
and choices for sound designers to polish assets later.

158
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:21,958
In this way, we could get high quality

159
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:26,621
and immersive sounds with relatively less effort.

160
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,382
I will show two examples at later part

161
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:33,104
when I talk about systems and workflow.

162
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:39,347
The sound system was powered by Wwise for basic features.

163
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,509
Wwise is an excellent audio-video player, as you know.

164
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:48,873
On past experience, sound designers and composers

165
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:53,057
in our studio make complete use of their tools

166
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:57,780
to improve the quality of game audio more and more.

167
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,982
I respect their challenge as an artist,

168
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:02,023
and I think it should be so.

169
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:07,363
But sometimes that tends to take lots of time

170
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:10,084
and efforts for game programmers

171
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,266
because they get more requests from some section.

172
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:18,940
As I wanted to make this game with not only rich experience,

173
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,761
but also exciting gameplay,

174
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,462
I wanted sound designers and composers

175
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:27,343
to concentrate on leverage quality,

176
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:32,885
and the game programmers to utilize more time

177
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:34,806
for making game mechanics better.

178
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:37,887
I was keep thinking about this issue,

179
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:39,968
and this idea popped up.

180
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:47,102
Game programmers are no need to consider or know very well

181
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:51,466
about using Ys, but let some designers and composers

182
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,208
utilize the full potential of Ys functions.

183
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,250
So here was my approach.

184
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,792
First, I sealed Ys under the engine.

185
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:08,117
Next step was to open public about floating point parameters

186
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:09,999
and was step by step stage in the game.

187
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:14,765
Finally, I changed that to the engine.

188
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:20,647
Even in a complex use case, all of the process for Wwise

189
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,628
was executed at the engine.

190
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:28,189
Game programmers are never called Wwise API.

191
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:33,371
At minimum, they only needed to trigger

192
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:35,351
and to open public parameters.

193
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:38,512
The engine took care for the rest part.

194
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:43,176
That is how we could get rich sound system.

195
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:49,199
The sound system in RE Engine equipped many functions

196
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:52,761
for basic development of action shooter game.

197
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:56,483
For example, animation sequence, FSM actions,

198
00:10:56,483 --> 00:11:01,025
clip timeline, generator for environmental sound,

199
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,746
monitoring tools, and so on.

200
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,216
Okay, thanks Kenji.

201
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:10,860
So from next part, we'll break down to little categories

202
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,462
of sound effect, music, and the system,

203
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:15,583
and we will again talk a little.

204
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,085
So from this part, I'm gonna explain a little bit

205
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:21,608
of sound effects here and how we built our sound design

206
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:22,809
in Resident Evil 7.

207
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:26,893
So first of all, I want to share some videos here

208
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:28,534
to illustrate our work here.

209
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,521
That was silly, I'm sorry.

210
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,324
We should have actually cut that word, I'm sorry.

211
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:35,944
I'll go, i'll go.

212
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,982
So that's clip number one here.

213
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,728
And the, just gonna explain, oh, I have to close this.

214
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,650
Right, thank you, Kenji.

215
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,813
So, okay, the follies.

216
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:21,136
Well, obviously, it's the Hodorio Realistic,

217
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:24,260
and we have lots of props that's really real.

218
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,721
So the sound also needs to be real.

219
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:29,944
So we really focused on our Foley recordings here.

220
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:32,285
And the aim was to create real sound

221
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:36,308
with the exact resonance and the deep details in each sound.

222
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,750
And we tried to place really many sounds

223
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,893
that we hear in our daily lives, such as noise of electricity,

224
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:47,356
draft wind, drawers, or really simple furniture, sound,

225
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:48,117
something like that.

226
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:48,817
And perhaps.

227
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:53,220
You know, we don't pay much attention in this sound because it's supernatural.

228
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,021
We are surrounded by this kind of sound.

229
00:14:55,021 --> 00:15:01,485
But we know somehow we know subconsciously how they sound and the variety of sound that surrounds us.

230
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:07,289
So the first step was to create this real, real, real, hyper real atmosphere in the Resident Evil 7 in this way.

231
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:11,424
And these real sound roles were to create

232
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:14,227
much immersive spaces.

233
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,428
And if things are ready,

234
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:19,011
unlikely once you hear the sound you're not familiar with,

235
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:22,393
it creates much uneasy and disturbing moods in the game

236
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:24,955
when it accumulates especially.

237
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:28,618
And that can actually drive players into a horror state.

238
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:31,200
So we really have this real sound

239
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,903
versus this horror dramatic sound.

240
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,280
So a little more talk on the Follies.

241
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,121
For the Follies stage, we choose to record sound

242
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:45,142
in larger places so that we had more flexibility

243
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:47,702
and could get various resonance on each sound.

244
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:48,822
So two main places.

245
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,903
We went to Toho Studio, which is in Tokyo, Japan.

246
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:53,764
It's a really famous studio.

247
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,524
And fortunately, actually, we do have a Follies stage

248
00:15:56,524 --> 00:16:00,345
at Capcom, and we really used that studio, too.

249
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:03,786
And for the microphone setting, we set three

250
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:05,047
or even more microphones.

251
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:12,772
For each recordings, all the microphones were set in different positions to capture different characters on each sound.

252
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:19,516
So if it's close, you get more direct sound. On the other hand, if you have mid-range sound, it captures more spaces and ambience.

253
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:22,758
So in this case, we really recorded a lot of sound here.

254
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:30,924
And we actually, the cool part of this is we actually collaborated with Masaya Kitada, who actually worked in the garage, Japanese horror film.

255
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:37,153
I think it's the 90s, I'm not sure, but it's a really scary movie there, and he was the

256
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:42,801
foley artist there, and he even actually worked in Howl's Moving Castle animation, so he's

257
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,425
really a famous foley artist in Japan.

258
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:49,483
And so the amounts were quite a lot here.

259
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,003
We have a prox.

260
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:52,283
We have 700 props there.

261
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:56,844
And we have some MVNs recording in the foley stage.

262
00:16:56,844 --> 00:17:00,345
And character movement, like footstep, crossing closes, and

263
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:03,626
weapons were also recorded basically in the foley stage.

264
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:08,007
And the in-game demo, yeah, so the amounts were really a lot.

265
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,988
And we took our PC, actually, to the Capcom stage.

266
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:13,870
so that we could actually implement really quick.

267
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,333
And, I, and Foley recording for like cinematic scene

268
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,895
or in game demo, we recorded like simultaneously

269
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:22,317
by watching, we have a TV screen in the Foley stage,

270
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:26,320
so, you know, just like how they do in a film industry.

271
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,843
Okay, so here's some footage of the Foley recordings.

272
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:31,845
It's a really short one.

273
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:36,088
So that's a Capcom stage, and that's me with long hair.

274
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,751
And that's Masayaki Tadai.

275
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:56,584
It's in Toho.

276
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:58,605
That's Wataru, right?

277
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:00,006
Playing with pineapple.

278
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:15,450
I was mentioning the world.

279
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,172
Here's my best part.

280
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:04,470
So that was one of the fun part of Holy Recordings here.

281
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,653
And yeah, you see pretty much the scary stuff,

282
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:10,874
Masaya took care of.

283
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:12,995
And we did simple stuff.

284
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:13,795
Just kidding.

285
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:18,778
OK, so continuing on the slide here.

286
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:22,380
For the equipment gears, pretty really famous microphones

287
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,120
were used here.

288
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,862
And we tried some of them, but these microphones

289
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:29,003
really worked well.

290
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:32,926
Well, the plugins Magnetic 2 was really great, and RX4 was

291
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,827
really great, especially.

292
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:37,169
We really used lots of RX here.

293
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,951
Well, obviously we had a Foley recording, and they have

294
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:42,733
really great denoise and the de-reverb function.

295
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:46,155
And these were really useful for the props recorded outside

296
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:47,436
the stage, such as door sound.

297
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:47,476
So.

298
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:52,790
Okay, that's it for the Foley sound,

299
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,651
so I'm gonna talk a little bit on the ambience here.

300
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:58,192
For the ambience, we have, basically,

301
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,173
we have three layers of ambience,

302
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:02,134
and these are, base ambience is just, you know,

303
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,715
base, like, really low frequency room tone,

304
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:07,455
and we have 3D positional ambience

305
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,876
that's like a water drop from water tap

306
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,617
or a wind sound from window, or, you know,

307
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:13,198
something is placed in a 3D world.

308
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,261
And the spooky sound, we named it spooky sound,

309
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:19,503
are more likely a strange sound,

310
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:21,665
like wood clack or rap sound you hear.

311
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:25,068
You may hear in a haunted house or in Japanese old house,

312
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:27,571
you actually hear this kind of sound.

313
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,272
And it's kind of scary.

314
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:33,076
And I have some samples for each of those.

315
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:37,119
So here's the 3D sound, basically.

316
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,020
Geno-wing sound.

317
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,271
And here is some sound from the props.

318
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:46,611
It's all mixed.

319
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:47,812
I can't do it.

320
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:53,214
So the refrigerators, water.

321
00:20:53,214 --> 00:21:02,957
And here's some spooky sound.

322
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:06,758
And we have a bass tone for the kitchen.

323
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,099
And here's the ensemble of all of those.

324
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:31,442
Okay, so among of those, the spooky sounds

325
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,365
were really, really effective here.

326
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:36,008
Most of them are actually random sound,

327
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,971
but when players are in the area

328
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:40,434
where it's filled with all sorts of natural sound,

329
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:41,976
the more immersed player get,

330
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:44,058
they tend to lose actually their sense to identify

331
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,702
the sound they are hearing, whether it comes from enemy

332
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,883
or from by themselves, such as footsteps

333
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,465
or kicking just bottles or chair,

334
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:55,547
or just simple ambience or prop sound.

335
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:59,049
So it was really important for us to put many kinds of sound,

336
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,191
not to only match these photoreal visuals,

337
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:03,893
but to create the sound illusions to player.

338
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:06,555
And it's FPS, so it's kind of really hard to identify

339
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:08,076
which sound actually comes.

340
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,077
We know the direction, but it's really hard

341
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:13,460
to localize the precise place.

342
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:16,992
So we really tweak with those techniques.

343
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,016
So I haven't actually prepared the extra slide for this,

344
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:23,256
but apart from these ambience and props,

345
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:25,677
we also implemented lots of horror sound,

346
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,659
which typically were placed and triggered by a level designer.

347
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:32,039
And the role of these sounds vary

348
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,280
from creating an anticipation or to simply shock the player.

349
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,901
And these sounds are something you may not

350
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:41,143
want to hear in the real life, but the sound in the game

351
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:43,323
could give you a clue of what's going to happen next.

352
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:45,384
So it's anticipation, basically.

353
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:49,063
And here is some cool slide here.

354
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:50,684
It's not written here.

355
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:54,568
Again, we have lots of sound in the game.

356
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:57,190
But the most effective way to create an anticipation or

357
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,534
anxiety was to bring the sound level lower or make complete

358
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:04,636
silence in it.

359
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:08,479
So it makes actually people questioning what's going to

360
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,540
happen next.

361
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,562
So that's actually our.

362
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:17,046
We really tweaked with the silence a lot, especially with music.

363
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:21,624
Okay, so moving on to reverb and occlusions here.

364
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:23,905
We had some simple systems here,

365
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:27,386
but a really cool way to do automatically

366
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,247
detect the parameters.

367
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:31,808
And so the reverb and occlusion changes interactively

368
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:34,249
and automatically depending on the space

369
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:35,630
where sound plays.

370
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,110
It's a sound place.

371
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,692
And when sound playbacks, the system allows sound

372
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:42,913
to detect the space name, which is game object,

373
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:44,954
and then an appropriate reverb set

374
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:46,154
for that sound automatically.

375
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:52,899
And these functions are also one of our automated systems, as I have mentioned before, for utilizing

376
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,280
meshes and collisions in the game.

377
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,203
So occlusions change depending on what object lies between players and sound source.

378
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:05,186
The ratio change by material of the structure would hear more clear and if you have metal

379
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:06,347
it's more muffled, like that.

380
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,048
Really basic physics here.

381
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:11,059
And these basic actually reverb parameters

382
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,740
were adjusted by mixing engineer at Capcom,

383
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,101
Kazuya Takimoto, so I think the reverb

384
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:17,162
is really good too in this game.

385
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:20,264
Okay, so here's the example of the occlusion.

386
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:23,866
So please pay attention to a mother emerge voice.

387
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:25,847
Gets muffled and gets clear.

388
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,128
I am sick and tired of your bullshit, girl.

389
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:29,489
I am sick and tired of your bullshit, girl.

390
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:38,274
I need to hide.

391
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:40,632
I need to hide.

392
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:45,096
Why are you putting this muffin up?

393
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:49,319
What have I done to deserve this except open my hole

394
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,384
and feed you?

395
00:24:55,384 --> 00:24:57,346
So yeah, that was, I hope that explained.

396
00:24:57,346 --> 00:25:00,869
But really, really simple principle

397
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,730
we did in Resident Evil 7 here.

398
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,372
I'm just going to show a little off.

399
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,652
It's kind of handwriting drawing.

400
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:10,276
So the basic principle of occlusions here in the

401
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,878
Resident Evil 7 at least.

402
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,282
So we have on the left side, we have a room here.

403
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:17,587
And when the sound plays back, sound asks where am I?

404
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:18,228
Those questions.

405
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:20,411
And the system tells you you're in the room A.

406
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:22,974
with the larger and the wooden covered room

407
00:25:22,974 --> 00:25:26,636
and the player here clear because there is nothing

408
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,497
to distract or there is no obstacle

409
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:30,358
between the sound and player.

410
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:32,700
On the other hand, you have a similar situation

411
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,661
but different setup, so the sound plays

412
00:25:34,661 --> 00:25:36,782
but there is a metal ball between so you're muffled.

413
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:40,844
So it's really, really simple techniques were adopted here.

414
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:42,885
But it's really done automatically.

415
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:44,066
Thus,

416
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:49,749
the cost goes down to 1 3rd comparing to RE6, right?

417
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:54,171
Okay, and because we don't add collisions manually

418
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:56,393
as often as we have done before,

419
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:59,374
obviously there are some places that some designer like me

420
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:01,595
needed to add collisions manually,

421
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:05,577
but that's the numbers were significantly decreased

422
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:07,778
and once, I mean, that took care of optimization as well.

423
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:11,600
So that's a sound effect part and I'm gonna hand to Kenji

424
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,941
and he's gonna tell about the system.

425
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:21,969
Okay, now let me talk about some of the system

426
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:24,551
and workflow on our game.

427
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:27,833
We will give you two concrete example in this part.

428
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:32,857
First one is automated sound trigger.

429
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,738
This is for sound effect,

430
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:38,881
mostly corresponds with animation assets.

431
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:43,444
There are numbers of cases,

432
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:45,525
automated sound trigger in this game.

433
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:49,489
Footsteps, rustling of crosses,

434
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:51,591
his sounds are some of the examples.

435
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:54,913
I will highlight the movement sound

436
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,916
such as cross rustle and gimmick movements.

437
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:03,759
When we have both approaches, dynamic and static.

438
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,804
Sometimes dynamical way can be much better and vice versa.

439
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:15,106
The system for movement sound uses velocities.

440
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:21,234
There are three ways to use velocities.

441
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:25,457
Velocity of any joint, angular velocity by any three joints,

442
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:27,619
and twist angular velocity by any two joints.

443
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:31,662
Some designers get automated sound triggers

444
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:35,284
by setting thresholds on each weight.

445
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:39,968
Let me show some examples of automated sound trigger.

446
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,482
So you hear the squeaky lantern sound,

447
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,803
and that's also automatically generated.

448
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:21,287
So there are two cases that how to use automated sound

449
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:25,449
triggers, a one-time calculation and a pre-calculation.

450
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,551
The former is usage of dynamic,

451
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:31,373
and the later is static way.

452
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:35,656
In each cases, the source of calculation

453
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:36,916
are done in same assets.

454
00:28:38,086 --> 00:28:42,349
First, sound designers check velocity using velocity monitor

455
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:46,812
on each game object while playing with lists of animations

456
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:52,056
or playing game and set thresholds of each triggers

457
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:52,576
on asset.

458
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:57,720
Next, they set the property of assets on behaviors.

459
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:03,225
Finally, they also can bake it in animation sequence.

460
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:06,046
In this way, some designers can brush up

461
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,907
and adjust the sequence more precisely.

462
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:15,070
Runtime calculation affects entire character moving,

463
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,051
including blended animation.

464
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:23,794
The benefit is, there is no lack or surplus triggers,

465
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:27,336
even if it has a complex blend animation.

466
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:31,970
There is one other advantage in dealing

467
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,471
with updating animations.

468
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:38,355
If animation will be changed, animation sequence

469
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:41,157
need to change or check accordingly.

470
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,418
But because of this system, the triggers

471
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:46,621
are calculated interactively, so no need to keep changing.

472
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:48,863
It is even possible to polish out easily

473
00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:50,304
with the function of pre-calculation.

474
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:02,250
Triggers which are baked in animation sequence

475
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,853
can be added, deleted, and they are adjustable.

476
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:11,696
I'm sure that some designers do it in their familiar tool.

477
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:15,539
And finally, the scope of baking can be changed.

478
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,942
We can use the animation sequence plug for

479
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:23,404
to stop runtime calculation temporarily.

480
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,864
Thus, because of automated system,

481
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:31,466
the works of sound roughly ends automatically

482
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:33,508
when animator's process finished.

483
00:30:33,508 --> 00:30:37,130
And sound designers are able to polish them later,

484
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,550
as needed.

485
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,271
Next keyword is cohesion.

486
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,591
In Resident Evil 6, we used collisions by meshes

487
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,872
and primitive shapes.

488
00:30:56,872 --> 00:31:02,233
We used meshes which had been added by environmental artists

489
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:04,974
for only changing sounds by materials.

490
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:10,155
For example, footsteps, hit sounds, and so on.

491
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:17,120
Additional to that, we had used primitive shapes

492
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,183
for changing reverb ambience by each room,

493
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:24,585
and also for obstruction and occlusion.

494
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:30,128
These collisions had been added manually by sound designers.

495
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:34,651
It's very hard work for sound designers

496
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:37,613
because it was often requested again,

497
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:42,376
and it could have caused spikes when placed a lot.

498
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,010
Things that we had meticulously worked on

499
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,871
and spent lots of energy on would constantly go to waste.

500
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:57,013
It was like carefully building a house brick by brick,

501
00:31:57,013 --> 00:32:00,834
and then what someone bruises over it,

502
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:03,674
and build another house instead.

503
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:05,135
So in Resident Evil 7, we change roles.

504
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:16,371
We use meshes for all of collision usage.

505
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:22,855
So we request environmental artists to cut meshes by rooms.

506
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:29,599
And we use primitive shapes for overriding the effect of meshes.

507
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:37,163
It's only for limited areas, basically to reduce the reworks of environmental artists.

508
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:43,618
Okay, let me show some examples of changing ambience

509
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:44,059
and reverb.

510
00:33:45,254 --> 00:33:48,796
Actually, in many cases, sound designers

511
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:51,057
no need to put primitive shapes.

512
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:54,438
It was such an innovation.

513
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:57,180
Sound designers are very happy.

514
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,980
Right, Ken?

515
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,981
Yeah, of course, because we needed to add manually

516
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:03,422
and when the spaces and area changes,

517
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:05,723
we actually needed to redo it,

518
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:06,944
so it really helped a lot.

519
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,841
Great.

520
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:12,124
But is everything okay without any problem?

521
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:18,688
No, the CPU cost for this way is very heavy.

522
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:22,991
We get to take care of it.

523
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:25,553
So I thought about a way to solve the problem.

524
00:34:25,553 --> 00:34:31,897
There are two approaches, thinning out update and updating asynchronously.

525
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:33,778
The former is simple.

526
00:34:34,931 --> 00:34:39,594
I think I'd update with consideration for sound designers

527
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:40,195
who don't feel gap.

528
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:43,517
The later one consists some steps.

529
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:48,381
For starter, triggers of sound in behavior

530
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:50,382
is only in set Q basically.

531
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:54,645
In this timing, they don't take place

532
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,086
of obstruction and occlusion.

533
00:34:56,086 --> 00:35:00,609
Exceptionally, generator of environmental sound

534
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,711
are calculated as a sound position in this phase.

535
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:09,480
In another phase, animation sequence update

536
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,001
for true trigger or not,

537
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,643
but don't check place and so on.

538
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,946
It's only queuing basically.

539
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:22,393
The sound module also update asynchronously.

540
00:35:22,393 --> 00:35:23,974
It's broke off the game loop,

541
00:35:23,974 --> 00:35:27,057
only with buffer synchronization

542
00:35:27,057 --> 00:35:28,679
and setting update task.

543
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:33,816
Actual updating process will be done in coherence

544
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:34,997
of another processes.

545
00:35:34,997 --> 00:35:36,257
Updating asynchronously is not easy way.

546
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:40,520
It's a hassle, but it can be solved.

547
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,064
We made it possible and get non-blocking sound system.

548
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:50,267
We usually having trouble with spikes of collisions

549
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:56,651
for sound, but there was no trouble in this game.

550
00:35:58,313 --> 00:36:02,955
Of course, I needed to take care of those spikes,

551
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:06,856
but mostly it occurred because of another reason,

552
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:08,897
which can be solved a lot easier.

553
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:15,379
So, within this workflow, environmental artists

554
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:18,220
can brush up until last moment.

555
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:22,758
And in this area, some designers worked not on

556
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:27,341
roughly ends automatically, but also have some spaces

557
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:32,244
for further modifications and improvements likewise.

558
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:37,226
And again, spikes by sounds have decreased.

559
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:40,788
It contributed a lot to make an immersive atmosphere

560
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:41,309
in the game.

561
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:47,612
I have a favorite proverb, kill two birds with one stone.

562
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:53,166
In Resident Evil 7, we managed things sometime in this way.

563
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:58,309
We get two or more benefits with only one solution.

564
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:02,292
Needless to say, everyone is happier.

565
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:08,515
Okay, next part is everyone's favorite, music.

566
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:10,577
So, okay.

567
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:14,019
Can you cue key?

568
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:15,760
Okay, here goes music part.

569
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:19,522
OK, I'm Akiyuki Morimoto.

570
00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:23,725
I will explain how we develop the music.

571
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:32,530
OK, this clip explains how the in-game music transits

572
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:39,114
and how it interacts with sound effects, such as ambience.

573
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:39,735
Let's watch.

574
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:56,890
hear her i can feel her clawing her way back inside of me

575
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,652
So, you know, strong balance.

576
00:41:21,652 --> 00:41:22,712
I told you, I told you.

577
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:29,358
Okay, on the left side, blue area,

578
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,101
horror, immersive, realistic world,

579
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:37,264
are the concept for the game.

580
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:41,707
On the right side, we built music idea

581
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,410
that connect well with this game concept.

582
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:51,102
And we came up with three keywords,

583
00:41:51,102 --> 00:41:56,027
which are tones, recording sound, and analog sound.

584
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:58,489
That eventually leads up to a technique

585
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:04,014
called music concrete.

586
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:05,976
When we started developing the game,

587
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:10,761
we thought what was the role of the music in this title.

588
00:42:12,148 --> 00:42:15,250
Music, especially underscore type music,

589
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:20,453
are commonly not a part of a 3D world in the game.

590
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:24,095
But in this title, we wanted to create

591
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:28,417
music that can be perfect match with the game scene

592
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:33,279
and textures, as if it could be heard as a source music, which

593
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,600
most of them were not.

594
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,401
We named it.

595
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:43,570
this type of music, music atomos.

596
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:50,474
To build music atomos, we concentrated on the tones rather than typical harmony.

597
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:56,718
For example, microtones, spectral music, and sound textures.

598
00:42:56,718 --> 00:43:05,063
We composed the music using original tones as a reference to technical music concrete.

599
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,501
Music Concrete was developed in France in 1940s.

600
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:13,802
This music is generally developed from resonance

601
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,762
and textures of sound, not always from harmony

602
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:17,903
or basic element of music.

603
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:21,844
When we created the tones, we prepared some key words

604
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:23,064
that represent the taste of the game.

605
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:44,307
High temperature and humidity represent the idea or atmosphere of the stage in the game.

606
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:48,951
The game takes place in Louisiana.

607
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:54,537
Noise texture and analog sound, they are from the key items in the game.

608
00:43:56,643 --> 00:44:01,506
The character explores mostly in the old mansion,

609
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:07,930
so ruined, dead, silent, derived from there.

610
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:15,414
Decay comes from a new creature called Molded.

611
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:19,416
The creature is covered with mold,

612
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,938
so it is called Molded.

613
00:44:21,938 --> 00:44:23,439
Yeah, the guy actually, yeah.

614
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:24,639
It's mold.

615
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:25,540
Black map.

616
00:44:28,728 --> 00:44:32,752
This shows the basic flow of music development in RE7.

617
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:39,097
For composing music, we made a careful preparation.

618
00:44:39,097 --> 00:44:45,142
At first, we recorded elements for making tones.

619
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:49,686
And then we create original sound library

620
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:52,668
with editing these tones.

621
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:55,371
And finally, we composed the music

622
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:57,873
using the original sound library.

623
00:45:00,257 --> 00:45:01,758
OK.

624
00:45:01,758 --> 00:45:04,961
To create original sound library,

625
00:45:04,961 --> 00:45:09,564
several recording sessions with total of 10,000 tracks

626
00:45:09,564 --> 00:45:11,045
were recorded.

627
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:15,748
These are just like a sound palette.

628
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:19,551
It is like a drawing in campus, but in music.

629
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:19,751
OK.

630
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:26,576
I'm going to briefly introduce about each recording session.

631
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,462
I will give you some unique hearing examples.

632
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:48,611
First one is quarter tone cluster.

633
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:51,492
And here goes super low cluster.

634
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,872
Okay.

635
00:46:05,872 --> 00:46:11,697
And we recorded three people's voices in total.

636
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:16,281
The concept is creepy human noise,

637
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:19,063
like Japanese horror film Grudge.

638
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:19,664
Do you know Kayako?

639
00:46:19,664 --> 00:46:20,024
Uh...

640
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:24,548
We have lots of Kayako.

641
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:24,848
Uh...

642
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,734
This sound is death scream.

643
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:43,683
And next is throat sound.

644
00:46:55,328 --> 00:46:57,989
Next, we recorded many kinds of real organic sound.

645
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:06,213
So many unique sounds recorded by the Hachenda Creative.

646
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:10,395
This example comes from the bee noise.

647
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:11,555
Buzzing.

648
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:33,787
Yeah.

649
00:47:33,787 --> 00:47:34,688
OK.

650
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:40,772
We built different tones for each character,

651
00:47:40,772 --> 00:47:45,596
rather than building a music theme or a music

652
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,578
piece for each character.

653
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:51,921
We used Mind Map to start up to find out the best matching

654
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:54,403
sound for that specific character.

655
00:47:55,667 --> 00:48:02,109
This mind map is for Jack, who is a quite cool guy

656
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:03,490
from the Baker family.

657
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,830
Yeah, welcome to the family.

658
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,290
Okay.

659
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:14,474
Okay, so far I talked most about the recording sound.

660
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:19,816
From here, I will focus more in creating

661
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:22,097
and how we edit tones.

662
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:27,538
We built the original music software, named it REM,

663
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:32,662
which stands for Resident Evil Music Module.

664
00:48:32,662 --> 00:48:36,725
It runs in contact instruments with basic functions,

665
00:48:36,725 --> 00:48:40,768
such as simple editing, process effect, and so on.

666
00:48:40,768 --> 00:48:45,311
This system allowed the composers to build tones.

667
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:50,696
with more flexibility, especially because of Raymer control

668
00:48:50,696 --> 00:48:55,399
with a good usability and very friendly operation and function.

669
00:48:55,399 --> 00:49:02,463
I have prepared a clip to show how RAM looks like.

670
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:06,986
This is RAM.

671
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:12,089
There are main, mix, and master windows,

672
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:14,511
and different parameters in each option.

673
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:23,397
Now changing attack speed.

674
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:40,796
Then, let's change the value of the revolve.

675
00:49:40,796 --> 00:49:42,238
Next is changing delay.

676
00:49:48,840 --> 00:50:08,392
And the final part I'm going to share is still a spread to change, narrow sound.

677
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:09,453
To wider spread sound.

678
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,054
So, believe me, it's different.

679
00:50:11,054 --> 00:50:15,116
Maybe this, I don't know, we have a big room here so that our sound actually spreads.

680
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,702
So we created our original tones utilizing this system.

681
00:50:20,702 --> 00:50:21,303
Oh.

682
00:50:21,303 --> 00:50:21,863
Okay.

683
00:50:21,863 --> 00:50:33,108
These are some other plugins which really worked well

684
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:35,229
in music development of RE7.

685
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:40,152
We often use sound toys plugins.

686
00:50:40,152 --> 00:50:45,354
For example, Crystallizer, Echo Boy, Pan Man,

687
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:46,035
Decapitator.

688
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:52,686
And Nomad Factory Magnetic 2, it's a tape simulator.

689
00:50:52,686 --> 00:51:07,638
One last thing we would like to mention is that we used lots of analog sound from a tape.

690
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:11,561
It helped to boost more mid and warm tones.

691
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:17,312
that I think definitely helped to build and create a peaceful moment. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪

692
00:51:17,312 --> 00:51:36,821
♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ This music can be heard at a safe room

693
00:51:36,821 --> 00:51:41,623
where you don't get attacked from creatures or enemies.

694
00:51:56,709 --> 00:52:00,070
Okay, that's all for music part,

695
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:03,511
and I will hand back to Ken.

696
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:08,492
So our last part, we are going to show a little bit

697
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,773
of a little talk on how we worked

698
00:52:10,773 --> 00:52:12,953
with a level designer here.

699
00:52:12,953 --> 00:52:16,254
So here's cool level designer, and they're really cool.

700
00:52:16,254 --> 00:52:18,895
And we have Koshi Nakanishi, he's the director there.

701
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:22,236
And he actually gave a talk on four o'clock or something.

702
00:52:22,236 --> 00:52:23,336
Is Koshi here?

703
00:52:23,336 --> 00:52:25,116
He told me he will be here.

704
00:52:25,116 --> 00:52:25,657
Koshi-san.

705
00:52:26,902 --> 00:52:28,542
Ah, hi, Koushi.

706
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:29,742
Hi, Koushi.

707
00:52:29,742 --> 00:52:29,862
Hi.

708
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:32,043
Ganbarimasu.

709
00:52:32,043 --> 00:52:35,004
OK, so yeah, we have Koushi.

710
00:52:35,004 --> 00:52:36,725
So we have a good guy here.

711
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:40,166
OK, so we really especially worked really, really close

712
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,226
with level designer in this project.

713
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,947
I just want to mention that we do work close with level

714
00:52:44,947 --> 00:52:48,088
designer planner in Capcom, in other project too.

715
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:51,869
But typically this title, since it's the horror game,

716
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,250
the role of sounds were kind of large.

717
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:54,330
So.

718
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:59,112
We really concentrated on working with Level Designer here.

719
00:52:59,112 --> 00:53:03,695
And we actually prepared some systems that allowed Level Designer to tweak and readjust

720
00:53:03,695 --> 00:53:05,215
the horror sound by themselves.

721
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:13,159
These tools actually vary from just play one shot sound or move that sound object or even

722
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:17,361
setting the state of the game to change music or volume of ambience.

723
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:21,063
So we had some tools for the Level Designer as well.

724
00:53:21,816 --> 00:53:25,881
And here's a basic, really, really primitive workflow

725
00:53:25,881 --> 00:53:28,345
that I want to show here.

726
00:53:28,345 --> 00:53:30,207
So basically, level designer, of course,

727
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,989
mainly designed the game.

728
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:35,654
And with the audio team, we had a really good relationship

729
00:53:35,654 --> 00:53:38,338
with them, so we shared our ideas, tips.

730
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:41,661
especially to make sound like source placement,

731
00:53:41,661 --> 00:53:45,224
to connect well with level designing and stage.

732
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:46,665
And because of nature of the sound,

733
00:53:46,665 --> 00:53:48,987
I think we are really good at,

734
00:53:48,987 --> 00:53:53,171
good on like tempo, timing, because sound is linear.

735
00:53:53,171 --> 00:53:54,432
And we deal with the dialogues too,

736
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:57,094
so in this part we are really good at,

737
00:53:57,094 --> 00:53:59,056
so we really talked a lot with them.

738
00:54:01,648 --> 00:54:07,451
So we also, actually it was kind of cool, we also suggested to make complete silence

739
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:09,893
to enhance the horror sound coming up next.

740
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,654
So that's pacing again.

741
00:54:14,172 --> 00:54:19,755
So at the first, we have pre-production, gray box

742
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:20,796
testing, those periods.

743
00:54:20,796 --> 00:54:23,978
We prepared some placeholders, like temporary asset,

744
00:54:23,978 --> 00:54:26,860
and let level designer use really freely.

745
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,862
I mean, they could do anything with those sound.

746
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:34,405
And within these assets, everyone

747
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:37,647
is really clear in the team that we could see what's

748
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:39,028
going to happen next and what.

749
00:54:39,248 --> 00:54:41,590
they want to do and what we want to do.

750
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:44,593
So it was really good to share, I mean,

751
00:54:44,593 --> 00:54:46,655
working this type of way.

752
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:49,438
And for the second part is the iteration.

753
00:54:49,438 --> 00:54:50,799
We have a lot of.

754
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:56,274
iteration, of course, in Resident Evil 7, too, so we really had to go over work and

755
00:54:56,274 --> 00:54:57,214
stuff like that.

756
00:54:57,214 --> 00:55:03,819
And this is the timing when we see if everything really makes sense and for that particular

757
00:55:03,819 --> 00:55:05,561
places within placeholder and stuff.

758
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:08,303
We still don't really make a real asset yet.

759
00:55:08,303 --> 00:55:11,605
The placeholder is pretty much being used here, but maybe some...

760
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:17,329
change has been done usually and really really lots of like gigantic huge amounts of

761
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:25,355
Communication and discussions are needed at this point, and it's really cool kind of we are I mean house team so

762
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:29,759
Actually the re7 team was just below our floor

763
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:34,202
So we could just go and talk to them and hear it's here is wrong and here

764
00:55:34,202 --> 00:55:41,007
It's cool, and you know stuff like that, so we really had a healthy conversation with you within really nice in-house environment

765
00:55:42,084 --> 00:55:45,164
And the final phase is, of course,

766
00:55:45,164 --> 00:55:48,065
is to prepare the actual asset for the audio teams.

767
00:55:48,065 --> 00:55:51,706
And many refines and many readjustments

768
00:55:51,706 --> 00:55:53,787
has been done up to here.

769
00:55:53,787 --> 00:55:58,488
And we share, hopefully, our goals from very beginning

770
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:59,889
to meeting all members of the team.

771
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,649
So we are kind of clear.

772
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:08,371
And it made us easier to work in a relatively larger team

773
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:08,791
like this.

774
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,562
So yeah, that was just a basic workflow here.

775
00:56:12,562 --> 00:56:16,403
And actually that wraps up our talk here.

776
00:56:16,403 --> 00:56:19,103
So just want to thank you once again for being here.

777
00:56:19,103 --> 00:56:26,045
And it's really great for us to give a talk in GDC.

778
00:56:26,045 --> 00:56:26,705
And, uh,

779
00:56:26,705 --> 00:56:28,105
Arigato gozaimashita.

780
00:56:28,105 --> 00:56:28,666
Arigato gozaimashita.

781
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:33,347
Arigato gozaimashita.

782
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:34,787
Thank you very much.

783
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:40,435
Hopefully we will have some time for Q&A, but we have put

784
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:41,856
our email address over there, too.

785
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:45,557
So if you have any questions, or maybe deeper questions,

786
00:56:45,557 --> 00:56:48,598
maybe you guys can ask on the spot, we'll be here at GDC

787
00:56:48,598 --> 00:56:49,158
tomorrow, too.

788
00:56:49,158 --> 00:56:52,759
So if you have simple questions, that would be much

789
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:54,719
better for us.

790
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:56,400
But I may need to translate.

791
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,620
So that's OK.

792
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:02,501
So if you have any questions, please do so.

793
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:02,541
Oh.

794
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,912
That's good.

795
00:57:07,912 --> 00:57:10,654
Or maybe a little sad.

796
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:12,875
Director Nakanishi.

797
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:14,736
Oh, director.

798
00:57:14,736 --> 00:57:16,257
Ask us later.

799
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:17,078
Japanese?

800
00:57:17,078 --> 00:57:21,781
Japanese, no. It's America here.

801
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:22,601
Sorry.

802
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:27,064
No, no, no. Please, yeah.

803
00:57:27,064 --> 00:57:29,926
Of course, yeah.

804
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:35,169
The best scene we like?

805
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:35,410
Okay.

806
00:57:37,101 --> 00:57:40,923
Ah, so the choice between Mia or Zoe.

807
00:57:40,923 --> 00:57:43,684
So there is a scene in chapter 3, or I mean, yeah, in middle part.

808
00:57:43,684 --> 00:57:46,365
So you have to choose either Mia to save me.

809
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:51,367
I'm sorry, I'm spoiling for some, but you have to choose little, I mean, you have to

810
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,708
choose Mia or Zoe.

811
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,049
That's the other girl there.

812
00:57:55,049 --> 00:57:56,510
So that's, yeah, that's right.

813
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,071
Yeah, that's, that's nice part.

814
00:57:59,071 --> 00:57:59,751
Yeah.

815
00:57:59,751 --> 00:58:01,752
What's your Kenji?

816
00:58:01,752 --> 00:58:02,312
Kenji.

817
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:02,572
Kenji.

818
00:58:02,572 --> 00:58:02,832
Kenji.

819
00:58:02,832 --> 00:58:03,093
Kenji.

820
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:03,453
Kenji.

821
00:58:03,453 --> 00:58:03,993
Kenji.

822
00:58:03,993 --> 00:58:04,533
Kenji.

823
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:04,753
Kenji.

824
00:58:05,376 --> 00:58:15,739
Yeah, my favorite is Jack Chase's Ethan.

825
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:17,220
That's nice.

826
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,160
And the other four.

827
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:19,820
OK, yeah.

828
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,260
That's right.

829
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,321
That's a really nice one, too.

830
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:25,262
And my favorite is the garage.

831
00:58:25,262 --> 00:58:27,403
I mean, you're driving the car, and you're actually

832
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,063
killing Jack by hitting the car.

833
00:58:29,063 --> 00:58:31,624
So that's cool, too.

834
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:33,412
Oh, sorry.

835
00:58:33,412 --> 00:58:35,117
So is there any other questions?

836
00:58:35,117 --> 00:58:35,337
I'm sorry.

837
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:35,558
I'm sorry.

838
00:58:35,558 --> 00:58:36,140
Sorry for being.

839
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,808
Are we out of questions?

840
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:39,250
Or are we out?

841
00:58:39,437 --> 00:58:41,738
Oh, I think I answered my question, so please.

842
00:58:41,738 --> 00:58:43,798
I mean, I answered my answer, I'm sorry.

843
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:44,859
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.

844
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:45,959
Jet lag, jet lag.

845
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:46,499
No, it's okay.

846
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:48,599
So, my name's Lenny Moore, I'm a composer.

847
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,780
So, thank you guys for coming all the way from Japan.

848
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,081
Thank you very much for inviting us.

849
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:57,482
It's such a pleasure to see you share

850
00:58:57,482 --> 00:59:00,102
what's going on with your team there and your great work.

851
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:01,202
So, it's just a comment.

852
00:59:01,202 --> 00:59:02,283
Oh, thank you so much.

853
00:59:02,283 --> 00:59:03,583
Oh, so nice of you.

854
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:04,303
Arigato gozaimasu.

855
00:59:04,303 --> 00:59:05,163
Arigato gozaimasu.

856
00:59:06,602 --> 00:59:23,752
So I was wondering, I love the game and the sound design is amazing, what do you think was the thing that you guys didn't feel happy about or that you thought you didn't do well and you would like to do better for 8 or whatever your next project is?

857
00:59:23,752 --> 00:59:25,573
Okay, I think Kenji will answer that part.

858
00:59:25,573 --> 00:59:33,697
Propagation deflection more definitively.

859
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:41,621
Yeah, more precise location, like more system side of the early reflection and...

860
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:41,901
Yeah.

861
00:59:41,901 --> 00:59:42,302
Is that it?

862
00:59:42,302 --> 00:59:42,442
Yeah.

863
00:59:42,442 --> 00:59:42,682
Okay.

864
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:45,966
In the system side we want to do that.

865
00:59:45,966 --> 00:59:48,489
And also I asked Kenji to build more...

866
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:52,714
I mean, his tool is really amazing, it's really friendly use.

867
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:57,004
a little more friendlier.

868
00:59:57,004 --> 01:00:01,709
But you know, I'm a sound designer, so I don't code,

869
01:00:01,709 --> 01:00:02,490
so please help us.

870
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,112
I hope I answered my question.

871
01:00:04,112 --> 01:00:05,253
Yeah, that's great.

872
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:08,576
Thank you so much, appreciate it.

873
01:00:09,757 --> 01:00:11,177
Maybe there is a key.

874
01:00:11,177 --> 01:00:12,217
I'm sorry.

875
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:13,717
Oh, you can ask.

876
01:00:13,717 --> 01:00:13,897
Go ahead.

877
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:14,257
Oh, yeah.

878
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:16,178
Thank you for your presentation.

879
01:00:16,178 --> 01:00:18,618
I thought it was very interesting

880
01:00:18,618 --> 01:00:22,219
that there were two particular sounds in the game that

881
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:25,039
came from earlier Resident Evil games.

882
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:25,399
Oh, I see.

883
01:00:25,399 --> 01:00:29,020
The first one was the key panel.

884
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,440
Oh, you noticed that.

885
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:30,640
OK.

886
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,601
Yeah, you noticed that.

887
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:36,241
Resident Evil 3 and one of the ending themes

888
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:36,502
rearranged.

889
01:00:38,029 --> 01:00:41,131
That's right, you noticed that too.

890
01:00:41,131 --> 01:00:44,973
Ending team rearranging for that.

891
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:48,875
We actually used it intentionally.

892
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:51,376
Yeah, we tried, yeah we tried.

893
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:56,859
Actually it was Wataru's idea to put the old UI sound

894
01:00:56,859 --> 01:01:00,060
on the keypad we were actually doing.

895
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,662
You still have that library?

896
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:04,743
Really deep.

897
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:13,953
You go like a dungeon and you just grab this masterpiece of Faber-Sachs.

898
01:01:13,953 --> 01:01:17,055
I hope I answered your question.

899
01:01:17,055 --> 01:01:17,995
Oh, I'm really bad at it.

900
01:01:17,995 --> 01:01:22,499
Thank you guys so much for being here. That was amazing.

901
01:01:22,499 --> 01:01:26,381
Did you guys develop for VR at the same time?

902
01:01:26,381 --> 01:01:30,724
So it was all just along the same timeline?

903
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:36,989
Yes, actually, VR was developed almost at the same time.

904
01:01:37,591 --> 01:01:41,577
uh... uh... it's not well-sounding and to answer the yeah

905
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:45,182
okay and so did you guys think any different approaches to that and

906
01:01:45,182 --> 01:01:48,146
if i can if you can answer it what you guys use course of course the audio

907
01:01:48,146 --> 01:01:51,691
for the uh... actually the prospect on the audio

908
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:53,995
didn't actually

909
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:01,303
necessarily, I mean we didn't focus on the VR side much because every sound is in 3D positions

910
01:02:01,303 --> 01:02:06,606
that actually took care of the VR part but for the most of the VR players they are going to use

911
01:02:06,606 --> 01:02:13,971
headphones so we have virtual surround features in the headphone and what else and actually we

912
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:16,332
have some musics are actually binaural.

913
01:02:16,956 --> 01:02:18,557
by no running things.

914
01:02:18,557 --> 01:02:20,978
So in some approaches, we did.

915
01:02:20,978 --> 01:02:24,179
But most of the part, actually, our audio workflow

916
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:26,060
took care of the VR version as well.

917
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,981
We really tried to nail.

918
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:32,143
I mean, we tried to put lots of sound in a 3D world.

919
01:02:32,143 --> 01:02:34,945
And that actually helped a lot.

920
01:02:34,945 --> 01:02:40,688
We attention this program in early phase.

921
01:02:40,688 --> 01:02:42,568
So we prepared for.

922
01:02:42,568 --> 01:02:44,249
That's right.

923
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:45,250
Yeah, we actually.

924
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:49,379
thought, or we guessed, actually, the problem is going

925
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:50,680
to come later on.

926
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,062
Because we weren't sure if we were going to build a VR

927
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:54,643
version or not.

928
01:02:54,643 --> 01:02:57,145
Actually, at the really early phase, we

929
01:02:57,145 --> 01:02:59,787
don't know about that.

930
01:02:59,787 --> 01:03:04,111
So we actually thought the solution for that.

931
01:03:04,611 --> 01:03:10,636
Thanks. Also, I'll do a little plug for you guys, but Resident Evil 7 is Amazon's deal of the day.

932
01:03:10,636 --> 01:03:14,400
So, pick it up if you haven't. I just bought it.

933
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,021
Thank you.

934
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:16,982
Thank you.

935
01:03:16,982 --> 01:03:19,404
Thank you.

936
01:03:19,404 --> 01:03:22,447
Excuse me, but this is Japanese.

937
01:03:22,447 --> 01:03:23,348
Ah, of course.

938
01:03:25,432 --> 01:03:29,993
I was going to ask about VR, but I was asked first, so I'll change the question.

939
01:03:29,993 --> 01:03:36,434
When we make games in a small studio, the sound direction is done by the director or the planner.

940
01:03:36,434 --> 01:03:39,875
It's really hard. But when I watch Resident Evil,

941
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:45,217
the sound is perfect at the right time, the music is perfect,

942
01:03:45,217 --> 01:03:51,478
and it's amazing. I'm really impressed, but who decides when to make this sound?

943
01:03:51,478 --> 01:03:52,058
How do you do it?

944
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,672
OK, I need to translate that.

945
01:03:54,672 --> 01:03:57,494
Yeah, please.

946
01:03:57,494 --> 01:03:57,674
OK.

947
01:03:57,674 --> 01:04:00,236
So yeah, his question was, he's Swery,

948
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:02,938
and he runs a studio in Osaka.

949
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:04,900
And yeah, Swery, yeah.

950
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,340
Yeah.

951
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:05,780
Yeah.

952
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,381
Yeah.

953
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:09,323
So yeah, we have a big guest here.

954
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:12,005
We have a Nakanishi-san, and every director is here.

955
01:04:12,525 --> 01:04:15,946
Well, anyway, so his question was that he runs a relatively

956
01:04:15,946 --> 01:04:18,907
smaller studio, comparing to Capcom.

957
01:04:18,907 --> 01:04:22,848
And he thinks our audio was really nicely done because of

958
01:04:22,848 --> 01:04:23,608
the audio director.

959
01:04:23,608 --> 01:04:25,809
I mean, we have audio director, and we have this

960
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:26,989
working pipeline here.

961
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:29,830
But unlikely, like his studio, they don't have audio

962
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:35,511
director, so is it sometimes hard to figure out where to

963
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:38,011
put all the sounds and the quality lines and stuff?

964
01:04:38,503 --> 01:04:44,187
I think you will get the exact answer with Wataru.

965
01:04:44,187 --> 01:04:48,470
So maybe we can talk with him.

966
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:57,976
But I believe, I think it's because we have a really good relationship with a director

967
01:04:57,976 --> 01:05:01,038
and audio director, and of course other lead.

968
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:07,302
We have an art director and all the leads and they have really good...

969
01:05:07,963 --> 01:05:09,164
And level designer, of course.

970
01:05:09,164 --> 01:05:14,087
So we have really, you know, we have these systems to talk, like, see, like, I mean,

971
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:19,431
we see every guy's face every day and we go lunch with them and these kind of really healthy

972
01:05:19,431 --> 01:05:22,213
relationship, you know, eventually.

973
01:05:22,213 --> 01:05:22,593
Right.

974
01:05:22,593 --> 01:05:23,254
Okay.

975
01:05:23,254 --> 01:05:23,574
Yeah.

976
01:05:23,574 --> 01:05:24,655
Hope I answered my answer.

977
01:05:24,655 --> 01:05:25,135
Oh my.

978
01:05:25,135 --> 01:05:25,355
Yeah.

979
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:25,575
Yeah.

980
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:28,137
We need more drinking.

981
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:29,058
Oh yeah, that's right.

982
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:29,758
That's right.

983
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:30,539
Let's go, let's go.

984
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:31,300
Let's go drinking.

985
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,921
Thank you very much.

986
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:33,521
Thank you.

987
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:34,342
Thank you, Serif-san.

988
01:05:34,342 --> 01:05:35,723
It's really good to hear.

989
01:05:36,739 --> 01:05:39,241
Okay, that's all for today.

990
01:05:39,241 --> 01:05:40,401
So thanks.

991
01:05:40,401 --> 01:05:42,302
Oh, we're actually passing.

992
01:05:42,302 --> 01:05:47,045
Oh, so I really appreciate, thanks for being here.

993
01:05:47,045 --> 01:05:49,447
And we're super, super happy that we could give a talk

994
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:50,927
and hope we did fine.

995
01:05:50,927 --> 01:05:53,909
So yeah, please ask us any question

996
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:57,211
if you have any thoughts, questions, suggestions,

997
01:05:57,211 --> 01:05:58,732
or I mean, emails up there.

998
01:05:58,732 --> 01:06:00,213
And we have a business card here too.

999
01:06:00,213 --> 01:06:01,374
So please do so.

1000
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,514
Okay, thank you once again.

1001
01:06:02,514 --> 01:06:03,755
Arigato gozaimashita.

1002
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:04,315
Arigato.
