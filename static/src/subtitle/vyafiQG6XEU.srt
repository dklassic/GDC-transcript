1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:08,641
This is me.

2
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:16,903
My name is Nazareno Urbano and for the past four years I have been working as a lead environment artist on Alan Wake 2.

3
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:29,567
And among other things, I'm passionate about graffiti, football, meditation, photography, and most important, I'm passionate about pizza.

4
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:35,225
I've been working in the game industry since 2008.

5
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:43,929
Most of my recent career has been at Remedy, where I work on Quantum Break, Control, and Alan Wake 2.

6
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:51,233
And this talk is about environment world building of The Dark Place.

7
00:00:52,733 --> 00:01:00,477
I think game development can sometimes feel confusing and disorienting, like being lost in the dark.

8
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:12,121
So in this presentation, I will explain how we escape this dark place of development by finding some lights that led us to make the game become real.

9
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,643
This presentation is divided into three parts.

10
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:22,525
First, I'm gonna cover the creative direction of the game.

11
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:30,889
Then I'm gonna talk about the visual solution we have implemented to support the creative direction.

12
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,679
And then in the end, I'm gonna talk about some technical implementation.

13
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:50,043
And this is the table of content for each section of the presentation, and here you can see all the subjects we're going to cover throughout this presentation.

14
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:59,425
And for those who are not familiar with the game, Halloween Wake 2 is a psychological survival horror game.

15
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:10,722
And the player takes the role of two characters, Saga Anderson, an FBI agent, and Alan Wake, a writer that has been missing for 13 years.

16
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:25,010
And in the game, we're exploring two different worlds, the real world set in the Pacific Northwest, and the dark place, a nightmare dimension.

17
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,413
And this talk is about The Dark Place, and to give you a better context, I'm going to play a trailer.

18
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:38,758
In a horror story, there are only victims and monsters.

19
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,300
And the trick is not to end up as either.

20
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,683
But trapped by the genre, we're all ripped to pieces along the way.

21
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,235
We have a great show for you here tonight.

22
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:55,839
Alan Wake, one of my all-time favorite writers, and guest on the show.

23
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,901
He's here to talk about his latest book.

24
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:10,889
Initiation tells the story of a fictional writer named Alan Wake, who is trapped in a nightmare, desperately trying to find the manuscript of a novel he has forgotten he's written.

25
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,352
Did you write these pages, Mr. Wake?

26
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:15,793
I'm trying to remember it.

27
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,050
No!

28
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:21,672
You've got the wrong man!

29
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:28,678
It's my fault!

30
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:29,459
They cut out!

31
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,000
Wake has a double.

32
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,902
Where is he now?

33
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:41,150
I won't be in the story, just write me out of the story!

34
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:06,909
and the foundation to build a great and believable world is a great story.

35
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:12,775
The starting point for defining The Dark Place is the story written by Sam Lake.

36
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:19,641
Narrative is the key component of most of the Remedy games and it is also what makes them special.

37
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:26,828
The following is a quote from Initiation, the manuscript of The Dark Place.

38
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:30,209
The Dark Place is a nightmare dimension.

39
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,551
It is a source of dark energy that can make art come true.

40
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,492
It makes dreams and nightmares come true.

41
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:43,275
Alan is trapped in the Dark Place, looking to escape.

42
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:52,320
And so was I. Trapped in Sam Lake's story, trying to make the game become real.

43
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:58,567
The writer told me about the atmosphere.

44
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:05,809
Wake is a writer of hard-boiled crime novels about Alex Casey.

45
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:13,710
And the atmosphere we need to recreate, it's a seedy and dangerous New York of his crime fiction books.

46
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:20,911
And we do not want to replicate New York as it is.

47
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:25,832
The city must feel like a bad dream, wet, cold, and dark.

48
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:32,022
We want to create a fictional New York that fits the narrative.

49
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:37,563
And all of it, it's part of the construct.

50
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:40,103
So what is this construct?

51
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:48,525
The nature of the dark place is built from a crooked mirror reflection of Alan's mind.

52
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:54,046
And the dark place can manifest as a mental construct.

53
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,836
At the same time, we are trapped in a horror story.

54
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:04,800
The Dark Place must be scary, a looping nightmare dimension.

55
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:10,024
The Dark Place works in loops and spirals.

56
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:20,113
Alan is trying to escape the Dark Place by rewriting the story, and he must make the horror come true to escape the Dark Place.

57
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:26,018
And so he's lost and trapped in his own nightmare.

58
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:36,668
And so after understanding the creative direction of the game, we need to think about some visual solutions.

59
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:42,331
We need to build an atmosphere and also a world that is built from a mind construct.

60
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:47,674
So how do we start building the atmosphere?

61
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:56,879
We start by using the story as a light to start our research into the darkness.

62
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:06,173
We were doing research about New York, but went deeper than a simple image search.

63
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:13,635
We were diving and learning about the history of the place and also study relevant films and books.

64
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:24,498
We identified the most iconic elements, something that will be recognizable as an archetype of a big city.

65
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:32,737
And those elements can sometimes be bridges, dark alleys, elevated railways, and also tall buildings.

66
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,681
And there is a collective memory of New York.

67
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:45,786
And what we want to do is to steal those memory and then use them to build the world.

68
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:55,733
And this memory can come from movies, comics, photography, and also other media.

69
00:07:56,545 --> 00:08:03,709
And for example, we look at the Scorsese movies for inspiration, and Taxi Driver was one of our main reference.

70
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:17,778
And then I became obsessed with research and created numerous reference boards, and then in my mind I started forming a new version of New York.

71
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:27,106
we applied our research and ideas and created the first version of The Dark Place.

72
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:40,534
And during this phase of pre-production, we were exploring the atmosphere, we were building prototypes, and find ways to integrate narrative and gameplay.

73
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:45,898
And also trying to understand how in the world we're gonna build this dark place.

74
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:54,969
And to give you a better context of the production pipeline at Remedy, every project goes through a stage gate process.

75
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,250
So we have a mandate stage that define the strategic goals.

76
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:05,351
Then in the concept stage, we define the high level creative vision.

77
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:13,493
And this is a product of the collaboration between the three directors, Sam, Jan, and Kyle.

78
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,434
And during this concept phase, they all work together

79
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:28,388
and define how the Dark Place works, but they also make sure that narrative art and gameplay work together but also support each other.

80
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:36,130
And then we take this high-level creative vision and then create the proof-of-concept build.

81
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:45,312
So we translate that into a playable build that shows that the game is fun and it works, but we also focus on the risks and the innovation.

82
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:50,308
And we created some concept art.

83
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:56,372
And we explore different ideas.

84
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:06,940
And for example, at the end of the first game, Alan dives into Cauldron Lake and end up in a dark place.

85
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,124
And water is one of the main theme of the game, and we wanted to express it in different forms.

86
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:21,905
So we drew inspiration from underwater visuals, but at the same time, we wanted the dark place to look like a realistic city.

87
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:36,177
Eventually, this underwater feeling was translated with on-screen visual effects, surface material treatment, but we also decided in the dark place, it was always raining.

88
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:44,638
And here you can see the first prototype of directional flowing darkness effect.

89
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:54,530
And this is how then we implemented this proof of concept idea into the final game.

90
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:09,589
And then here it's when we apply the rain visual effects on top.

91
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:24,073
And for the proof of concept level, we have created a small city intersection.

92
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:32,515
And we wanted to create something that would be somehow recognizable as New York.

93
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,064
And this was our playground to experiment and also fail.

94
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:48,554
And we built prototypes for light shifters.

95
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:55,781
And light shifters are unstable lights that can change the environment around them.

96
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:04,684
And by doing that, they help Alan to progress in the game.

97
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:13,686
We built prototypes for Plotboard, where Alan find clues and move them around to change reality.

98
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:17,867
And again, this will help him to progress in the story.

99
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:23,108
And for this build, we have created a full 30 minutes mission.

100
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:27,729
And in this mission, we have tested some combat spaces.

101
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:37,061
We have combined the light shifter gameplay with narrative and also tried to give the impression of a looping environment.

102
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:55,292
We also did this test for Chase with a dark presence and explore navigation in narrow spaces such as fire escape and also small windows.

103
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:12,770
And the first version of The Dark Place was a painful learning process.

104
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:17,772
We did identify the main problem that we had with the mission flow.

105
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:20,953
So we had too much backtracking.

106
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,474
Most of the puzzles were very confusing and the narrative was very complex.

107
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:31,156
But another thing we have learned is that The Dark Place was too dark.

108
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:42,976
And this means that the scale proportion and silhouette, they play a big role in the look of the city, but also that we needed to have a bit more light to see.

109
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:52,707
And another thing we have found out is we defined the main feature we were going to need to build this looping environment.

110
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:59,172
And the first feature were the light shifters, so unstable light that can change the environment.

111
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:05,974
The second feature was the reality rewrite, so with the plot board Alan can change the environment around him.

112
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:13,876
And then the teleports, which are essentially enclosed space that we use to teleport the player around.

113
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:26,213
We've also learned that flat city intersections are quite boring, especially because the player speed in our game is very, very slow.

114
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:38,560
And in the mission we had a lot of backtracking, so it was not fun for Alan to traverse these big roads with no elevation, and that's why it was quite sad.

115
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:48,337
And so we applied this learning from the proof of concept in the final game layout.

116
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:55,182
And so we have built an elevated plaza in the middle that act as a centerpiece.

117
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:03,288
And then we added the high line next to the plaza, and that creates a nice elevated shape.

118
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:11,174
And then instead of the classic cross intersection, we have built this V-shape intersection.

119
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:17,089
And then we add even more elevation by creating rooftop gameplay.

120
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:24,733
This video shows the level layout of the proof of concept level.

121
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,837
And this is one of the earlier version of the actual Darkplace layout.

122
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:37,780
And as you can see here, the streets are still quite wide.

123
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:46,854
And then to reach the final layout, we iterate a lot on the size and position of the building and also the streets.

124
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,566
And this other example of before and after of the same layout.

125
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:09,941
And we decided to place Casi Alli on an even lower level compared to the street to create even more elevation.

126
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:19,490
And this is a top-down map of the Dark Place.

127
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:27,417
And we designed the world in a way that every key location of the game is visible from the center plaza.

128
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:34,993
And from there, you can also see all the iconic elements of the city, such as the high line, the bridges, and the alley.

129
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:41,074
And then we had assigned one artist working on each location.

130
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:44,695
And we all felt like we wanted to escape the dark place.

131
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:56,717
To continue on the learning, we have learned that using too many light shifter would increase the scope and complexity of the environment.

132
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:04,151
And then we needed to have less of them and also find better ways to manage the resources.

133
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:09,633
So we applied this learning in the final game layout.

134
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:20,256
So we have spread the light shifter across the whole dark place and we made sure we had a lot of space between them as well as having something interesting to see.

135
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:32,248
We find out that the fire escape were very problematic, especially for navigation, collision, and camera.

136
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:41,452
And so we decided to cut them from the game, mainly because we didn't want to scale them up and make them look unrealistic.

137
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:47,654
Because everything in the game must be as close to a realistic scale as possible.

138
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:53,417
Because that will help the horror experience, and it makes the environment look real.

139
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,405
so we didn't scale any asset.

140
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:08,969
We also found out that small interior apartments were very expensive to build and they were not very useful for combat spaces.

141
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:15,631
But instead we decided to use them mainly for narrative and exploration.

142
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,992
And to continue talk about the visual solution, we need to talk about the construct.

143
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:37,755
The construct is the main pillar of the world building in the dark place, because everything that the player sees comes from Alan's mind.

144
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:42,056
So how do we build an environment from a mind construct?

145
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:51,502
The way we approach the world building and also asset creation is seen through the light of archetypes.

146
00:18:53,183 --> 00:19:00,308
So even though we reference New York of the 70s and early 80s, we do not refer to a specific timeline.

147
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:04,871
And that's because the construct does not belong to a precise timeline.

148
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:13,936
And we use the quintessential version of an asset instead of the more contemporary one.

149
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:18,418
And in general, we do favor timeless and iconic models.

150
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:29,043
And to give you an example, when we create one asset, we collect a lot of different reference photo and then we review them.

151
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:34,436
And in this example, we needed to decide what cache register we're gonna build for the game.

152
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:42,823
Although they look quite similar, the second one has few Bezier curves, and that makes the asset look too modern.

153
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:52,192
So we decided to go with the first reference, and then end up building something like this for the game.

154
00:19:56,533 --> 00:20:04,495
And this is another example where we choose a bit older model when it helps to build the right kind of atmosphere.

155
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:09,897
And then end up building something like this for the game.

156
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:23,341
And to support the construct of The Dark Place, every object with text is an opportunity to adapt into the story.

157
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:30,544
And graffiti is an important asset that contributes to the world building.

158
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:39,050
It is very characteristic of New York of the 80s, and it's also part of an archetype of any big metropolitan city.

159
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,834
But to be part of the construct, the words in the graffiti must come from Malin's mind.

160
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:53,520
And I grew up making graffiti, and I usually try to add them to every project I work on.

161
00:20:54,454 --> 00:21:00,737
And The Dark Place felt like the perfect opportunity to merge graffiti narrative and also video games.

162
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:08,381
And I did not want to just make street art, again, because it's too modern.

163
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:16,425
But instead, we wanted to create a nightmare version of the old school New York graffiti.

164
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,989
And then use them everywhere around the city in The Dark Place.

165
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:36,993
And the writers gave us a list of words coming from Alan's mind, and we were only allowed to use these words and nothing else.

166
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:46,899
So we hired a graffiti artist and then built the nightmare graffiti in the real world.

167
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:54,183
And then we took photos of them and then create textures and made projected decals out of it.

168
00:21:56,724 --> 00:22:03,547
And we've created this big convent with a lot of layer tags and color.

169
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:12,471
And a lot of the graffiti are dripping and leaking, again to reinforce the horror feeling of the game and the dark place.

170
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:24,857
We wanted to have also shadowy figures in the dark place, something that would complement the real enemy fade out in the game.

171
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:29,998
and also make the player constantly second-guessing what they're seeing.

172
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,383
The artists also experiment with different shapes and symbols.

173
00:22:41,905 --> 00:22:53,791
And we also reinterpret various symbols that have a deeper meaning with the Remedy-connected universe, such as the spiral and the triangles.

174
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,931
And then we added the graffiti into the dark place.

175
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:22,255
And as an example, this is the base environment without any projected decals.

176
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,637
And this is how it looks when we apply a layer of graffiti.

177
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:36,180
And graffiti can add a lot of color to the image,

178
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:43,612
but they also can be reused across most of the environment in the game.

179
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:51,580
They also add another storytelling layer to the world.

180
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:59,809
And they help the world building by blending all the environments together.

181
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,130
And another way to add words into the dark place is the use of newspapers.

182
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:16,131
And here the inspiration, again, comes from the photos of New York of the 70s, where the streets were filled with newspapers and trash.

183
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:21,552
But because they contain written words, the text must come from Alan's mind.

184
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:29,894
So we collaborated with a graphic agency called Lenin Hallami.

185
00:24:30,658 --> 00:24:34,879
and created a set of fictional newspaper to use in the dark place.

186
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,041
And all of the headlines in this paper, they have a narrative link to the story.

187
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:55,485
And billboards and posters are also a great opportunity to add big images to the world and make the city feel more believable.

188
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:04,917
So we created many posters and billboards, and then used them everywhere around the city.

189
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,041
And for another example, like this is the base layer of the city.

190
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:19,485
And this is how it looks when we apply papers, graffiti, posters, and also billboards.

191
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,709
And Alan Wake is a writer,

192
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:30,117
And words are very important to him.

193
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:36,923
So we wanted to give the impression that the whole Darkplace was talking to Alan and the player.

194
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:41,307
And there are no generic signs in the Darkplace.

195
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:51,956
And here are some examples of how we applied that idea to something that might feel generic as a license plate or construction signs or the subway indication.

196
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:58,800
And for example, the text in the construction sign on the right is what Alan wrote in the first game.

197
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:08,566
And neon sign are also one important aspect of building the atmosphere.

198
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,988
Same as the other text, they're also part of the construct.

199
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:18,292
We use neon to create the feeling of floating words in space.

200
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:25,270
At the same time, we were having a lot of trouble with player guidance, because the level is quite open.

201
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:30,073
So we decided to use the neon sign to guide Alan and the player.

202
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:36,896
And in this instance, we wanted the player to go left.

203
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:40,818
So I thought, what about adding a sign that says, this way.

204
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,482
And director did like the prototype idea, so eventually,

205
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:55,731
we implemented it, this is the implementation in the game, with the more meaningful narrative link.

206
00:26:56,291 --> 00:27:02,897
And we implemented various neon signs, all with a narrative link to the story or the mission.

207
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:16,128
And after covering the creative direction and the visual solution, we can talk a bit about the technical implementation.

208
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:22,496
So how do we create a looping nightmare environment?

209
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:27,637
The dark place progression is divided in loops.

210
00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:32,359
Alan always starts from the same location in the talk show studio.

211
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,702
And Alan is trying to escape the dark place by rewriting reality and the story.

212
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:47,143
And by doing that, he's able to change the environment around him.

213
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,030
The dark place can act in a dreamlike way.

214
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,611
At each loop, a building can appear and also disappear.

215
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:10,474
And this concept shows the state of the dark place during the first loop.

216
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:18,036
And then when Alan gets to the second loop, a new building has appeared in the space.

217
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:28,470
And one feature that we use to create a feeling of impossible transition is the seamless teleports.

218
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:31,193
And here is an example.

219
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:35,857
The Ocean View Hotel, my destination.

220
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,804
So, Holland is trying to enter the hotel.

221
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:54,479
But then he gets teleported back.

222
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,980
And this is another example of a teleport.

223
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,723
So when Alan enters the stairs, he gets teleported to another point in the level.

224
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:36,370
And the player does not notice the transition, and we wanted to create the feeling of being lost.

225
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:51,893
And the way this works, essentially we are using the same prefab in two different position, and this ensure the environment is exactly the same.

226
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:59,699
And then once the player hits the trigger in the middle of the stairs, they get teleported to the other point in the level.

227
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,181
We also use teleport as a transition in between levels.

228
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:12,363
And in this case, the Ocean View Hotel building, it's quite small compared to its interior layout.

229
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:21,606
And so after Alan passes the sky bridge, he gets teleported to the real layout, which is this, and it's underground.

230
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:29,481
And as you can see, this layout is way bigger compared to the small exterior building.

231
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:38,885
And so the seamless teleport allowed us to create impossible transition and also looping spaces.

232
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:46,667
But also was good to teleport the player to the actual layout without changing the structure of the level.

233
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:49,368
So it was good for creating looping environment.

234
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:53,210
But on the other hand, we had to constantly iterate on the teleports.

235
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,463
because all the system must behave correctly in both teleports.

236
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:04,305
So this feature required a lot of iteration and it did cause a lot of bugs.

237
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:12,227
And Alan can rewrite the story and change the environment.

238
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:22,750
And in The Dark Place we have defined areas in the environment where Alan can rewrite the story and change the reality.

239
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:30,744
So when he's in the writer's room, he has access to this plot board.

240
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:41,551
And in here, he can select a different plot element with different story, and then apply them to the scene.

241
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,695
And by doing so, the environment will change.

242
00:31:52,768 --> 00:32:03,413
And the way this work, we have, so each environment is divided into asset nodes, and they could be seen as some sorts of containers.

243
00:32:04,694 --> 00:32:12,898
So each asset node includes all the specific permutation of that plot element, and then we swap them dynamically via script.

244
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:22,223
And as you can see, in the scene, in the editor, it becomes very messy, because all of the elements are in the same space, one on top of each other.

245
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:38,601
And most of these scenes, they required a lot of concept art support, and we did multiple iteration on them to create the final image, and also to understand the narrative.

246
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:41,682
So they required a lot of concept art.

247
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:51,145
And also, each plot element increased the scope of the environment, because the propping is custom to each scene.

248
00:32:53,243 --> 00:33:05,787
And the scope does not just increase for the environment artists, but for all the crafts, because each element has a different lighting, a different sound, different narrative, and they all need to work in the same space.

249
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:08,947
So the scope increase for all the crafts.

250
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:21,111
And what we end up doing during production is that we scope down and then prioritize each scene and then focus mainly on the critical one.

251
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,331
And another key feature of the dark place are the light shifters.

252
00:33:31,653 --> 00:33:35,115
Light shifters are unstable lights that can change the environment.

253
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:39,857
They have essentially two states, charged and uncharged.

254
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:42,679
And each state has a different environment in it.

255
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:48,122
And I've been trying to explain

256
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:54,778
in a simple way, why the light shifter were a major challenge for the team.

257
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:58,259
And unfortunately, this is the best I came up with.

258
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,302
So, from the art direction point of view, the art director can require that light shifter are not just a door.

259
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,804
But then, most of our design were just a door appearing.

260
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:23,361
And then the lighting artist would complain, saying, I cannot just add the light on a door.

261
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:35,930
And at the same time, we had a lot of problem with game design and UR, because the player did not understand that this specific light was important, so they were stuck in the mission.

262
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:45,778
And what we end up doing during production is that we created a lot of different prototypes, and we constantly failed.

263
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:55,499
We asked concept art to help us and then we created some custom concept art for this.

264
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:03,001
And then on the design side, we decided the shifters are the only blinking light in the space.

265
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:10,844
But we also iterate a lot on the UI and the audio to improve guidance and also visibility.

266
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,626
And here you can see the uncharged light shifter.

267
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,872
and at the end of the alley, there is a charged one.

268
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:38,263
And because of the amount of lights in the space, our lighting team worked with the art director to establish a clear hierarchy of lights.

269
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:46,708
So, gameplay lights, they must be pure in color and they're brighter than any other light.

270
00:35:48,632 --> 00:35:54,254
And then we use neon sign that they have like a dimmer intensity and they are colored.

271
00:35:55,914 --> 00:35:58,995
And same for other backdrop lights.

272
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:08,798
My path was blocked.

273
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:10,918
I had to find a way through.

274
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,979
The lights would help me.

275
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:25,306
And the light shifters are the main tool we use to create environment puzzles, and also to create this feeling of being lost in a maze.

276
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:40,571
And the light shifters are also very expensive to build, and they require a full collaboration between design, audio, and VART, and also lighting.

277
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:47,425
And we did iterate an infinite amount of time because of player guidance.

278
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:54,170
In a city with a lot of lights, it was very hard to make the player understand that this specific light is important.

279
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:57,393
So this feature required a lot of iteration.

280
00:36:57,993 --> 00:37:06,160
And then during pre-production, we were seeing them as a reusable system that we could easily use to make a puzzle.

281
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,823
But in reality, each light shifter ended up being unique.

282
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:15,474
And this means that they all come with different problems, and they're very hard to debug.

283
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:22,739
And Alan was sad again.

284
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:31,264
So we have covered the three main features of The Dark Place, and moving towards the last section of the talk.

285
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:37,388
Let's talk about live action in the game.

286
00:37:41,588 --> 00:37:48,193
The nature of the dark place allow us to use live action footage to express a different layer of reality.

287
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:58,021
And live action is seamlessly integrated with gameplay, and it is just another manifestation of the dark place on a different level.

288
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:06,327
In this example, Alan is looking for Zane's room.

289
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:14,959
So we use live action footage to transition between these layers of reality.

290
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:23,102
So Alan is interacting with the projector and this allows a transition into the live action where Zane's room is.

291
00:38:38,604 --> 00:38:41,547
And this room only exists in the live action.

292
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,749
It does not exist in the 3D environment.

293
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:57,801
And the layer of reality in the dark place can be expressed in different forms.

294
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:02,425
For example, it can manifest as a supernatural musical.

295
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:48,774
He could write a story like Tom Zane before him And maybe they'd be happy once again Just one shot, one more chance for him to save their marriage Away from the city, a romantic getaway

296
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:56,482
So one of our main reference for the stage we were building was the movie Dogville.

297
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,825
And we wanted to use a minimal environment stage approach.

298
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:09,171
And this movie uses a theater technique to delimit different spaces with just a line on the ground.

299
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:11,193
They define the rooms and the streets.

300
00:40:14,476 --> 00:40:18,879
So we adopted the same minimal approach in the game environment.

301
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:27,187
But that's also because the projections, we're going to do a big part of the heavy lifting in the image composition.

302
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,393
And the way the projections are working, it's quite simple.

303
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:39,276
We have created a cube and then mapped an emissive video texture to it.

304
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:46,922
And then attached to the cube, we have a spotlight that uses a video as volumetric projection.

305
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,300
And here we can see the spotlight projection.

306
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:05,504
So we use a lower mipmap of the video, the video texture, and that creates this volumetric effect that match what's in the video.

307
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:18,148
The dark place can also manifest into our reality.

308
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:26,613
and some of the characters from the game escaped the dark place and started dancing on stage at the Game Awards.

309
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:53,517
We did not expect that when making the game.

310
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:05,644
And to talk a bit about the learning from this live action pipeline, it's good to keep in mind that the 3D environment and the live action set, they need to match.

311
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:08,826
And there cannot be a big discrepancy.

312
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:16,051
And for us, the most efficient way was to build first the 3D environment and then

313
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,962
let the live action crew recreate that on the set.

314
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,544
And this is one of my personal nightmares.

315
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:38,869
So, during previous projects, we have experienced some issues with the communication, and then ended up with a real white box lamp in the shoots.

316
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,221
That's not the final model.

317
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:46,683
And also it ended up in all of the live action materials.

318
00:42:48,884 --> 00:42:51,506
And this quickly became one of the top remedy meme.

319
00:42:54,748 --> 00:42:58,430
And so it requires a coordinated effort to plan the shoots.

320
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:10,417
And when we were creating this environment for the game, we gave priority to all the live action location in the game and created a special concept art

321
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:15,711
And then we build the environment in 3D up to alpha quality.

322
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:20,474
And then send all the assets to the live action crew.

323
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:29,140
And we've covered all the section of the presentation and we can talk about the conclusion.

324
00:43:31,381 --> 00:43:37,505
So I think the creative journey of making a game, it's similar to trying to escape a dark place.

325
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,723
And in both instances, you need to find the light to make it out.

326
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:47,526
So your first light can be the story.

327
00:43:47,787 --> 00:43:49,268
So let the story inspires you.

328
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,712
And then decide what kind of atmosphere you wanna create.

329
00:43:55,192 --> 00:44:00,036
In our case was a noir crime city, Acre of New York, dark and grimy.

330
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:04,219
Then find your own construct.

331
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:11,733
and decide what kind of asset can be used in your game, what kind of archetype can be used.

332
00:44:12,114 --> 00:44:18,638
For us it was a place built from memories where words have a deeper meaning and also the reality is subjective.

333
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,984
And then define what kind of experience you want the player to feel.

334
00:44:27,985 --> 00:44:33,569
And for us it was a horror story with a looping environment and Alan was trapped.

335
00:44:35,768 --> 00:44:40,412
And then in my experience, one of the biggest light will always be your team.

336
00:44:42,154 --> 00:44:46,017
So be truthful to them and be there for them all the time.

337
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:53,804
Try to be compassionate and understand other people's difficulties, because making game is very hard.

338
00:44:54,945 --> 00:45:01,051
And then be tolerant and kind, because building a world requires a lot of time, passion, and dedication.

339
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:06,594
So solve problems together and always strive to create something original and unique.

340
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:10,055
And whatever you do, stay in the light.

341
00:45:10,435 --> 00:45:10,795
Thank you.

342
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,760
Maybe questions?

343
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:30,142
Hey.

344
00:45:31,482 --> 00:45:32,083
That was really cool.

345
00:45:32,123 --> 00:45:38,529
And first of all, I got to say, this is one of the most unique and amazing visually speaking games I've ever seen.

346
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,530
Great job.

347
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:41,732
It's cool.

348
00:45:41,912 --> 00:45:47,157
I thought it was really interesting that you hired a graffiti artist externally.

349
00:45:48,037 --> 00:46:00,445
Especially since you already had a passion for that I was curious if you could just talk a little bit more about like what that like How did you why did you all decide to hire externally rather than I don't know maybe you making it or something like that?

350
00:46:00,765 --> 00:46:06,028
Yeah, and What you what in particular what kind of criteria you were looking for with that artist?

351
00:46:06,488 --> 00:46:15,354
Yeah, so the artist we hired is actually my best friend and Yeah, we grew up making graffiti together and then I

352
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:18,151
he ended up being like a real artist.

353
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:21,013
So he does painting and he's a street artist.

354
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:30,800
So when doing The Dark Place, I knew he was the right guy to do the job because he can do like a lot of different styles.

355
00:46:31,481 --> 00:46:36,845
And if you notice, if you know a bit about graffiti, there are so many different styles.

356
00:46:36,865 --> 00:46:38,466
So each person has his own.

357
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:42,649
And my friend has a lot of different personalities.

358
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:49,876
And he managed actually to create such a nice variety of different style of graffiti.

359
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:57,022
And he also likes to draw like monsters and like horror and like paintings.

360
00:46:57,062 --> 00:46:59,445
So I was like, he's the perfect fit.

361
00:46:59,645 --> 00:47:02,007
And I know him, so it's very easy to collaborate.

362
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:03,388
Very cool.

363
00:47:03,508 --> 00:47:03,809
Thank you.

364
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:04,109
Yeah.

365
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:10,516
Okay, thank you.

366
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:11,557
Game looks awesome.

367
00:47:11,577 --> 00:47:12,197
I still haven't played it.

368
00:47:12,298 --> 00:47:13,579
I'm like working my way through control.

369
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:17,603
So, you know, not enough time to play games when you make them.

370
00:47:18,944 --> 00:47:23,189
So, earlier on you talked about learnings in the early prototyping stage.

371
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:29,575
And you mentioned how the game had too much backtracking, confusing puzzles and things like that.

372
00:47:29,895 --> 00:47:30,456
It was too dark.

373
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:39,137
Yeah, how do you keep the focus on track?

374
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:46,141
Is there ever a point where people are like, well, it should be confusing, there should be backtracking, or something like that?

375
00:47:46,582 --> 00:47:49,644
Even if it's like, yeah, does that make sense, that question?

376
00:47:50,765 --> 00:47:51,425
Kind of, yeah.

377
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:52,986
I think we never really stopped the argument.

378
00:47:53,006 --> 00:47:53,126
Sorry?

379
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:20,771
It's about, I guess, the level layout being confusing, but the story is also confusing.

380
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,995
So how do you deal with that, I guess, kind of?

381
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:25,277
Was that your question?

382
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,681
But I know what you mean.

383
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:32,585
We constantly iterate.

384
00:48:34,784 --> 00:48:37,185
And we did a lot of play tests.

385
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:44,409
I also collaborate a lot with the level designer and game designer, and we constantly test every prototype.

386
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:57,395
And it's very hard because Alan is trapped and he's lost, so it's supposed to be confusing, and the environment is looping, but it's very hard to make it fun, in a way.

387
00:48:58,955 --> 00:48:59,776
It was very hard to

388
00:49:01,212 --> 00:49:04,935
to design, and we just iterated a lot.

389
00:49:05,336 --> 00:49:06,196
And then we had to ship.

390
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:07,938
So we're like, OK, this is fine, I guess.

391
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:09,039
All right.

392
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:09,679
Interesting.

393
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,380
Thanks.

394
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:14,475
Hello.

395
00:49:14,755 --> 00:49:15,555
Hi.

396
00:49:15,635 --> 00:49:16,596
Fantastic talk.

397
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:26,158
And as a native New Yorker, fantastic job creating a version of New York City that represented how dirty New York City was when I was living there.

398
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:31,399
I did want to ask a question about the collaboration between multiple teams.

399
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,700
You mentioned user research informing some of the decisions in the game.

400
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,901
And as a user researcher myself, I was just interested in understanding the cadence of user research.

401
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:50,223
and how that affected your teams and possibly some of the impact that that had on the work that you did specifically.

402
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:52,423
Yeah, thanks for the question.

403
00:49:52,483 --> 00:49:53,784
So it's about your testing.

404
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:59,525
We do a lot of your research throughout the whole project.

405
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:03,206
I would say maybe every two months or so.

406
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:08,347
Like as soon as we have something, we just organize like your test and then we can.

407
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,081
We can look at people playing and see how they play.

408
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:21,124
And then based on that, that's always very, very helpful, because we see when they get stuck, what happened, what do they do.

409
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:24,925
And most of the time, it's something that you don't expect that they do.

410
00:50:25,445 --> 00:50:31,367
And based on that, we actually iterate a lot on the level design side and on the layout.

411
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:34,388
So it helps a lot.

412
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:37,249
The more you can do it, I think the better it is.

413
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:45,006
Did you find that your teams took well to some of the findings that the user research team found?

414
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:53,552
And if so, what were some of the challenges adapting some of the findings that the user research team articulated to the various teams that you work with?

415
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,361
Yeah, it's a tricky question.

416
00:50:57,581 --> 00:51:03,305
In general, I think if something comes from UR, we do fix it.

417
00:51:03,565 --> 00:51:06,787
Especially if it's critical or major, we do fix it.

418
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:19,694
If we find out that something is on a minor level, maybe not, but we tend to react on that very quickly, so we don't wait time to fix those.

419
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:25,318
But there is a point in production where you cannot change so much the level,

420
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:33,835
So later on, at the end of alpha or so, you can do only like small adjustment, like lights.

421
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:39,823
There is one, there was one very, very painful light shifter that we I think iterate until

422
00:51:40,919 --> 00:51:41,979
the day before shipping.

423
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:48,982
And this light shifter was actually inside the plot element, and inside that there was also a teleport.

424
00:51:49,383 --> 00:51:52,724
So it was like a nested mess of things.

425
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:59,867
But then, towards the end, we did fix the UR issue with audio and lighting.

426
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:06,590
Because usually those are actually kind of easy to add later on without changing the layout.

427
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,791
So that was one example.

428
00:52:10,124 --> 00:52:11,093
Awesome, thank you so much.

429
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:11,860
No problem.

430
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:24,525
I had a question about how level design and environmental art work together.

431
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:30,670
I'm currently working at a very small team, so it's basically one designer and one artist.

432
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,994
And we don't really know where one thing turns into the other.

433
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:47,384
So I wanted to know what do you normally receive from the level design department, and what do you normally get, and that back and forth to define the layout and how it affects gameplay and narrative.

434
00:52:48,507 --> 00:53:03,663
So the way we structure the team, the mission team is that we have, it goes in couples, so we have one artist and one designer and they all work together on the same location and it's up to them to iterate on the layout.

435
00:53:06,104 --> 00:53:20,913
To me it should be almost like a married couple, because they really need to solve the problem together and understand that art is important, but also level design layout and gameplay is also very important.

436
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:25,026
And in general, they sit in the same room.

437
00:53:25,106 --> 00:53:29,769
So we have the mission team structure is divided into hubs.

438
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:33,992
So we have Darkplace, Cauldron Lake, Water, and Brightfold.

439
00:53:34,032 --> 00:53:34,952
That are four rooms.

440
00:53:35,153 --> 00:53:39,335
And in those rooms, we have artist and designer, level designer together.

441
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:46,299
So I would suggest keep them as close as you can and let them iterate a lot.

442
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:47,640
OK.

443
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,621
Thank you very much.

444
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:50,542
Hi.

445
00:53:51,535 --> 00:54:06,508
I was curious about the live action pipeline, like kind of how you decided where those transitions happened, or if you had to, I guess, kind of like chicken and the egg, what comes first?

446
00:54:06,548 --> 00:54:13,755
Do you guys decide, oh, we really want a live action sequence here, and then transition to a new level?

447
00:54:16,008 --> 00:54:20,350
kind of like how much oversight does the 3D team have over the set production?

448
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:24,391
Because I assume those are completely different studios or pipelines.

449
00:54:24,872 --> 00:54:26,832
Yeah, they are two separate pipelines.

450
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:34,996
So for The Dark Place, we decided that all the cinematics, almost except one, they are in live action.

451
00:54:36,496 --> 00:54:39,678
So we decided all that pipeline was going to be live action.

452
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:49,033
It's not just for a scoping or a budget point of view, but it's also because it fits the dark place.

453
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:53,959
So because of the reality and the different layer, in that sense,

454
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:58,413
It makes a lot of sense to use live action as cinematic.

455
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:02,776
And I think in general, 3D cinematics are very, very expensive.

456
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:05,818
Live action was actually cheaper in a way.

457
00:55:06,058 --> 00:55:09,000
But it also fits the narrative and the story.

458
00:55:09,761 --> 00:55:14,584
And then in the real world, we have the normal cinematics.

459
00:55:16,205 --> 00:55:17,907
So that was our thinking.

Did you have any like issues with just like if one gets like ahead of the other or did you just kind of have Them all self-contained enough or like it didn't you know you could just work on concurrently, and then I'm asking because like I'm interested I'm a small indie team, but like we want I want to do like you know that kind of like sequencing, but I'm curious like do it But I'm just curious.

461
00:55:42,498 --> 00:55:44,720
I like you know what that level is

462
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:55,726
kind of like how much of an effort is it to like just coordinate both of that because that's obviously like very very different like Yeah, I'm not very familiar with that.

463
00:55:55,746 --> 00:56:10,534
We have a team that Deals with the whole live-action pipeline and Also for the game it was defined from the story point of view so from the narrative team actually decide when the cinematic happens and where and

464
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:16,364
And for the environment artists, we only knew that, OK, that space needs to be in live action.

465
00:56:16,865 --> 00:56:20,147
So let's build it fast, and let's review it a lot.

466
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:22,869
And then let's send it to the live action.
