00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:08,304
Good afternoon and welcome to today's classic game

2
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:10,065
post-mortem on Paperboy.

3
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:12,726
My name is John Solwitz.

4
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:16,207
I am a principal technical director at Electronic Arts.

5
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:20,089
But today, you will not, in fact, be hearing anything

6
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:23,230
about Paperboy Frostbite or Paperboy Origin.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,811
Actually, my credentials to do this presentation

8
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:30,053
have very little to do with Electronic Arts.

9
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:32,834
I hope I am qualified to give this presentation

10
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:34,975
because I was part of this really wonderful team.

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,569
the team that created the original arcade version of Paperboy.

12
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:50,534
In putting this presentation together I interviewed most of the members of the

13
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:53,115
team and it is my goal today to share with you our

14
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:57,236
our shared memories of making Paperboy.

15
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:01,938
And just to be clear my talk today is mostly going to be about

16
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:04,139
the original version of Paperboy.

17
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:06,572
the one hopefully you played somewhere

18
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,933
in some dingy arcade somewhere,

19
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,413
one or two quarters at a time.

20
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:13,654
For the purposes of today,

21
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,355
I broke up my presentation into the seven parts

22
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:18,156
of the seven days of the week,

23
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:20,157
each part representing a different phase

24
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:21,537
of development of Paperboy.

25
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:25,558
I thought this was cute and somehow appropriate.

26
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:27,419
So, without further ado,

27
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:32,241
the story of Paperboy in seven days.

28
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,941
On Monday, we go to.

29
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,653
Ideation.

30
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:40,715
I started work at Atari Games in October of 1981

31
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:43,677
as a microprocessor programmer.

32
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:46,979
I was actually rejected the year previous

33
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,620
by Postcard, no less,

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,241
but I was a diehard arcade game player

35
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:55,283
and even more a diehard Atari Games player,

36
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:58,405
so I reapplied, somehow got an interview,

37
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:01,047
and miraculously got through that interview.

38
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:03,733
That was the start of my video game career.

39
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:07,096
I ended up working at Atari for about 10 years.

40
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:11,740
For my first assignment, I was paired up with this guy,

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,442
a designer named Dave Ralston.

42
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:17,585
Dave is actually a designer artist

43
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:19,446
who started his life in games

44
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:21,888
as a pinball designer for Atari.

45
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:26,091
He started at Atari almost exactly a year before I did.

46
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,333
Turns out it was my great fortune and pleasure

47
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,935
to work with Dave for the next 18 years.

48
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:34,448
It is rare indeed to find this kind of partnership.

49
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:36,308
I feel very blessed indeed.

50
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:40,930
Dave had been working on this new hybrid pinball video game

51
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,591
called Aka-R. Aka-R, by the way, took its name from Rich Adam,

52
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:49,913
who is the engineer, the creator behind Gravatar.

53
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:54,394
Rich had signed a creative document, aka Rich Adam, Aka-R.

54
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:55,575
So we took the name.

55
00:02:57,253 --> 00:03:01,094
A little time later, Atari renamed the game Sentinel

56
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,254
before we took it on field test.

57
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:05,494
Dave and I worked on that game for around nine months,

58
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:08,435
really tried to get the pinball video thing working,

59
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:11,516
never really did, so we went back

60
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:14,756
to a conventional video game.

61
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:15,916
And off to field test we went.

62
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,977
The game did not last long.

63
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:21,318
The test did not go well.

64
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,818
We were crushed by this other game.

65
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:25,318
Perhaps you've heard of it.

66
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:25,958
Robotron?

67
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:31,433
Thanks Eugene Jarvis. This once again proved

68
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:36,842
Toyer's Law, named after Dave Toyer, he of Missile Command and Tempest fame,

69
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:41,569
which states, your first game will be a real dog and ours surely was.

70
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:47,565
Shortly after the short-lived disaster of our field test,

71
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:51,766
I think we made around 70 bucks in a week or so,

72
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,847
I really felt my career was over.

73
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,068
And so we conducted a post-mortem,

74
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:00,069
which was typical at the time at Atari.

75
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,990
And so going into that meeting, I thought that was about it.

76
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,711
But Dan Van Eldren, who was then Vice President

77
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:10,592
of Engineering at Atari Games, instead told us,

78
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:11,352
amazingly.

79
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:13,958
Great try for a bunch of rookies.

80
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,959
What are you gonna do next?

81
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,661
This, by the way, in my opinion,

82
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:21,443
is how you start to build a great game team.

83
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:23,845
I wanna talk about Atari coin-op for just a second,

84
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:29,168
largely because as I interviewed the other people

85
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,251
on our team, a very common thing that they said

86
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,073
that was working at Atari was either the best job

87
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:38,835
they ever had or one of the best jobs they ever had.

88
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,223
And so for me, I'll tell you one of the real reasons

89
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:43,684
it was for me.

90
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,407
We worked at one of the few centers

91
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:50,250
of video game making on Earth.

92
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,132
And these games were all made

93
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:56,095
within spitting distance of each other.

94
00:04:56,095 --> 00:05:00,079
You could and would regularly walk out of your lab

95
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,742
and go into an adjacent lab and play somebody else's game.

96
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:05,964
And these were the games that were in development

97
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:06,885
during Paperboy.

98
00:05:07,353 --> 00:05:10,334
This was an incredibly creative atmosphere,

99
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:12,995
and you could learn about what it would take

100
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,655
for your game to be successful,

101
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:18,357
and frankly, get a little intimidated in the process.

102
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:19,197
I loved it.

103
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:20,658
Back to Paperboy.

104
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:24,099
Around the time of the sun setting of Akka,

105
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,259
our day presented a few ideas

106
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,280
at the Atari Cointot Brainstorming.

107
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,441
This is February of 1983.

108
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:33,902
This particular brainstorming was at Bajaro Dunes,

109
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,663
which is near Monterey, California.

110
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,702
Dave showed us this idea for a kid riding down the street

111
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:42,505
delivering papers on a single transparency

112
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,226
for an overhead projector.

113
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:46,088
PowerPoint was yours to come later.

114
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:48,950
And oh, at the end of his presentation,

115
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,772
he flipped the transparency over

116
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:54,635
and showed us what it would look like

117
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:57,957
for Paperboy to ride down the other side of the street.

118
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,981
Ironically, of course, he never did.

119
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:08,100
At the end of the presentation, Dave was awarded three

120
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,502
Atta Boys by Atari leadership and won the

121
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:14,883
brainstorming.

122
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:17,264
I freely admit it took me a while to come around

123
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:20,266
to a game about Paperboy, a game about a kid

124
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:21,867
delivering newspapers.

125
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:24,488
I, after all, was into games like Asteroids,

126
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:27,990
Battlezone, Missile Command, anything with a missile

127
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,610
or maybe a football in it.

128
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,072
So the idea of working on a game about paper delivery

129
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:33,272
was a little strange to me.

130
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,128
But Dave kept working on the idea,

131
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,009
and sooner or later I came around

132
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,850
and came to my senses and joined the team.

133
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,671
At Atari, to get a game started officially,

134
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,952
you had to survive what was known as an initiation meeting.

135
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:50,773
You would present a thin game description of the game,

136
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:51,793
you know, in our case, you know,

137
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:55,774
Paperboy delivering newspapers, avoiding characters,

138
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:57,795
some idea of your hardware,

139
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:59,815
and maybe a schedule, things like that.

140
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:04,159
Because Dave had successfully won the previous brainstorming,

141
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,540
us getting through the initiation meeting

142
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,820
was, in fact, pretty easy.

143
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,481
And so the day after we successfully

144
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:15,362
got through our initiation meeting, we began development.

145
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,943
So on Tuesday, we go to pre-production.

146
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:24,284
Let's talk about what the paperboy is made of.

147
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:26,525
First, to do that, I have to talk

148
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:29,825
about the people that made the hardware for paperboy.

149
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:31,792
The first is Doug Snyder.

150
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,833
He was the hardware engineer on the Paperboy hardware.

151
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,895
Doug was responsible for the design and the layout

152
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,935
of the hardware that was to become Paperboy.

153
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:42,917
It's an interesting thing about working on new hardwares

154
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,297
as a software engineer.

155
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,398
I am a programmer after all.

156
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:50,540
You never really know if the bug is hardware or software.

157
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,261
And I can remember many times trying to convince Doug Snyder

158
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:58,683
to argue with Doug Snyder about that it was in the hardware.

159
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:03,128
Let me just say I lost most of those arguments.

160
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:05,248
Doug ended up designing most of the hardware

161
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:07,569
that I would eventually use at Atari.

162
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,910
Linda Sigovic also joined our team at this time

163
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,851
as our technician.

164
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,972
Linda partnered with Doug to fabricate, debug,

165
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:19,653
and improve the hardware throughout development,

166
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:22,394
basically to keep the hardware alive.

167
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,974
A technician back then was about just as much

168
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:27,875
of a part of your team as, say, a build engineer is now.

169
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:32,390
Unfortunately, and not to the credit of Atari,

170
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,952
Linda was laid off not once but twice

171
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:38,074
during the development of Paperboy.

172
00:08:38,074 --> 00:08:42,056
She was, however, absolutely instrumental

173
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,897
in the making of the game.

174
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:46,638
At the heart of the Paperboy's hardware,

175
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:50,981
leader renamed system two was the T11 or Tiny11.

176
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,531
As this is a design-focused presentation,

177
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:59,373
I will not gush on about how cool the T11 was.

178
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,914
It was basically a PDP-11 on the chip.

179
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:04,835
But I will say, after working on a 6502 for a while,

180
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,136
this was awesome.

181
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:08,817
Also, for those who care,

182
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:14,359
the programming language in Paperboy is Bliss, not C.

183
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:17,380
My guess is that I have personally written more hit games

184
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,121
in Bliss than anyone else on Earth.

185
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:21,282
Sadly.

186
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,100
That skill set is no longer in demand,

187
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,620
and frankly, my knowledge of Bliss is long since gone.

188
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,961
Atari was moving away from vector-based games

189
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:32,922
when Paperboy began, so we went to a raster-based game.

190
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:37,983
Using a straight bitmap wouldn't have worked

191
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,904
for performance reasons,

192
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:41,764
so we went to a stamp-based hardware.

193
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:44,845
The Paperboy, or System 2 hardware, is

194
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:48,006
a very basic stamp-based hardware on today's standards.

195
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:50,467
There is a scrolling play field,

196
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,507
and on top of that, there are 32

197
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,228
what they used to call motion objects.

198
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,409
Now people call them sprites.

199
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:57,629
And on top of that, of course,

200
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,910
there is a two-bit alphanumeric layer,

201
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,311
all in eight-by-eight pixel stamps.

202
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,292
So pretty conventional there.

203
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,053
But Paperboy did have something new.

204
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:18,153
Typical raster arcade games at that time were displayed in 320 by 240 pixel resolution,

205
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:21,075
what was also known as standard resolution.

206
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:26,578
Doug Snyder, our hardware engineer, allowed one of the real big innovations of Paperboy,

207
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,839
the use of medium resolution.

208
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,702
Basically he increased the speed of the video circuitry, and in partnership with a company

209
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:40,325
called Wells Gardner, our monitor manufacturer, created a new monitor that could display.

210
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:44,460
not 320 by 240, but instead 512 by 384 pixels.

211
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,524
I suppose compared to high definition,

212
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:52,267
and certainly to 4K, this is downright quaint.

213
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:55,249
But to us at the time, it was awesome.

214
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:57,891
We knew pretty early on that we did not want

215
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,893
to have a conventional controller.

216
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,596
Atari Games actually pressed the teams

217
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:07,178
to do new and original controllers.

218
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:11,066
largely to differentiate the games in the arcades.

219
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:14,327
I mean, after all, what is the thing that you notice

220
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:16,907
when you walk up to an arcade game cabinet?

221
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,527
You notice the controller.

222
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,488
In building our controller,

223
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:23,928
we had the very good luck and fortune

224
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:26,149
to have a guy named Milt Loper join the team

225
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,249
as our mechanical engineer.

226
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:30,870
Milt and Dave had previously worked together on pinball,

227
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,970
and so they knew each other.

228
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,171
Milt is a seriously creative designer engineer

229
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,171
who was responsible for.

230
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:40,849
several of the Atari controllers.

231
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:42,331
Although I think the joystick,

232
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:45,953
excuse me, the handlebar controllers on Paperboy

233
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:47,134
are his finest work.

234
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:50,436
Although of course, he also invented

235
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:52,718
the salad bowl controller behind 720,

236
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,099
and I think that's pretty cool too.

237
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:58,041
Of course, Atari had a rich history of controllers

238
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:02,004
well before the handlebar controllers on Paperboy.

239
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:05,667
In fact, the Paperboy's controller has a rich ancestry.

240
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,028
It went kinda like this.

241
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:11,526
from Battlezone in 1980 to the Bradley Trainer,

242
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:12,787
also in 1980.

243
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:15,829
The Bradley Trainer was a project

244
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,831
that the Atari Games did with the DOT,

245
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:23,073
and so part of that was to take the Battlezone controller

246
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:25,054
and turn it into a more of a textile controller.

247
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,656
That controller you can think of being

248
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:31,558
as the stepdad of the Star Wars controller in 1983,

249
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,039
and the Star Wars controller,

250
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,120
think of the stepdad of being the Paperboy controller.

251
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:46,193
1985. In fact, Milt used, as a mock-up, the Star Wars controller and onto that he bolted

252
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:53,176
a set of red anodized bicycle handlebars that he got at a local bike shop. Probably a kid's

253
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:58,998
bike shop. But through this controller we were able to prove that you could in fact

254
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:04,000
control the motion of a kid riding down the street. So it worked. The Paperboy controller

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,501
went through several iterations.

256
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:11,979
The biggest iteration was the ever-shrinking width of the handlebars.

257
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:16,682
This was because you could apply an enormous amount of torque

258
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:19,824
onto the controller through those handlebars.

259
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:23,306
At Atari, we had a thing called the Steuben Test,

260
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:28,729
named after Dave Steuben, who was the head of engineering at the time.

261
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:31,271
Dave is a big guy.

262
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:34,053
And if your controller could survive Dave,

263
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:35,033
you could manufacture it.

264
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:40,065
Sadly, several of the Paperboy prototype controllers

265
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:43,167
died horrible deaths at the hands of Dave,

266
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:47,731
including one time where Dave actually removed

267
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:49,913
the controller from the cabinet.

268
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,256
Somehow, Milt was able to, through this process

269
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:55,738
of destruction and reinforcement,

270
00:13:55,738 --> 00:14:00,222
build a controller that could eventually survive

271
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:00,763
and was manufactured.

272
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:03,445
The controller had one other problem.

273
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,077
it had a problem with buttons.

274
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:09,859
You can't see them if you are slightly shorter,

275
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,000
say the height of a kid.

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,282
So we would regularly have people coming up to our game

277
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:19,484
and playing it without ever throwing newspapers.

278
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:23,106
This is kind of like Temple Run with bees

279
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:25,087
and you get fired at the end.

280
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:28,790
This we finally fixed by putting the start buttons

281
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,931
on the controller itself.

282
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,992
so that at least you had to find the button

283
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:35,412
to start the game.

284
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:38,954
Of course, we needed to build a street.

285
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:40,174
Dave and I were both big fans of Zaxxon,

286
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:41,815
which came out in 1982.

287
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,996
Zaxxon is an isometric game.

288
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:46,597
If you haven't seen it,

289
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:52,179
you basically fly a spaceship through essentially a maze.

290
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:56,781
It scrolls from upper right of the screen to lower left

291
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:58,922
in, as I say, an isometric perspective.

292
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:02,809
This was a very early example, maybe the early example,

293
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,410
of a scrolling isometric game.

294
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,494
But Zaxon presented us with a bit of a problem

295
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:12,456
because it is in a 60 degree,

296
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:16,800
kind of natural isometric perspective, 60, 60, 120, 120,

297
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,402
pretty standard drafting isometric perspective.

298
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:23,225
But this gave us a few problems.

299
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:26,888
First, it made scrolling for us more complicated because

300
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:31,304
we were scrolling at odd angle to the playfield hardware,

301
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:34,127
so that just meant drawing was a lot more complicated

302
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:34,367
for us.

303
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,769
Also, it meant that we would be showing just about as much

304
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,871
of the sides of the houses as we were gonna be

305
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,293
of the fronts of the houses,

306
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:44,794
and the sides of the houses are not playable surfaces,

307
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:47,977
so kind of a waste of a lot of real estate there.

308
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:52,820
Finally, the other problem was that the handlebar controllers

309
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,302
were gonna be at a pretty strong odd angle

310
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:56,983
to the direction of motion of the kid.

311
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,981
So that meant if you push the handlebar controllers forward,

312
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:02,883
the kid was going at a 60 degree angle to them,

313
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:04,404
which felt unnatural.

314
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,565
So this is what we did.

315
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,427
We crushed the x-axis and brought it down horizontal,

316
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,068
parallel to the bottom of the screen,

317
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,249
and also, of course, to the top of the screen.

318
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:16,251
This solved a few problems for us.

319
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,992
First, the lots now were built parallel

320
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:20,293
to the scrolling play field,

321
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:22,755
so we could draw this thing row by row.

322
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:26,309
Secondly, papers generally flew horizontally,

323
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,350
parallel with the bottom of the screen,

324
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,711
which meant aiming was a lot easier.

325
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:35,072
And at least now, the controller itself

326
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:37,853
was parallel to the fronts of the houses,

327
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:39,993
and the kid was only 45 degrees off angle.

328
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:42,174
So that felt a lot better.

329
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:44,475
It simplified some other systems too,

330
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:46,075
but those were the big reasons.

331
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,616
One of the first things we did, of course,

332
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,117
was to build a house.

333
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:55,600
Actually, the first house we built, I think I saw for like three months.

334
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,102
The houses, Dave was able to build houses extremely efficiently.

335
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,384
This is a lower cost house here.

336
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:09,848
There are 73 total unique stamps in the base construction of that house.

337
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:13,169
Houses range from around 70 to as expensive as about 135 stamps.

338
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:19,593
Of course, windows, doors, shrubbery, mailboxes, signs, trees, lamps.

339
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:22,123
These were all areas that were placed on top

340
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:24,784
of the base houses in the margin above

341
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,385
the scrolling play field.

342
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:30,466
They, of course, were also reused for the neighborhood.

343
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,667
The grass itself was randomized from around eight stamps.

344
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,627
That meant that Dave was able to build houses

345
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:39,608
in about a 10 by 10 stamp sheet

346
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,849
of about 80 pixels to 80 pixels.

347
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,389
Pretty efficient.

348
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:46,850
To our world, we added characters.

349
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:53,425
We were also very lucky to have a phenomenal character artist

350
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:55,545
animator join our team.

351
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:59,126
Will Noble was responsible for the development and creation

352
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:01,547
of pretty much every character in the game,

353
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,688
including the boy himself.

354
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:07,069
Creating characters at that time out of motion objects

355
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,589
was a painfully slow process.

356
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,510
You would go from concept sketch work to

357
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:16,772
grid paper, graph paper where you color in pixels,

358
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,372
to Will sitting over Dave's shoulder,

359
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:21,913
hand entering those pixels pixel by pixel

360
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:25,214
into a thing called the pixel processing system.

361
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:29,075
Those would get transferred to our main VAX

362
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,875
using a floppy disk.

363
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,896
Well, let's just say that for Will

364
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:35,196
to have created the number of characters

365
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:38,097
that the fidelity and richness that he did

366
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:40,217
speaks to, in that environment,

367
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:42,018
speaks to his wonderful talent.

368
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,316
First thing that Will focused on was, of course,

369
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:47,797
the paperboy himself.

370
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:52,321
The paperboy was, went through, was not that,

371
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:55,924
it looked very much like this early in development.

372
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:58,065
He was iterated on a bunch of times

373
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:03,150
to improve graphic fidelity, add a bunch of moves,

374
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,992
we did color cycling in the spokes,

375
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:08,114
but largely he looked that way.

376
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,935
He's a kid on a bike with a basket in front of him.

377
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:14,269
We saw the back of the paperboy for a very long time.

378
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,571
It was actually much later

379
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,672
that we finally got to see his face.

380
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:21,454
And that was because we finally started doing things

381
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:24,896
like title screens and side panel art for the game.

382
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,458
And so we always kind of wondered what he looked like.

383
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,419
In the end, I'd like to think that the paperboy

384
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,802
takes a bit of a likeness to Alfred E. Newman,

385
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:33,802
but that's just me.

386
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:39,106
Our first set of characters in the game were, well, weird.

387
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:45,212
They remember that most games in those days were pretty damn abstract.

388
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:48,935
But our first vision was not conventional, to say the least.

389
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:52,898
Traffic in the streets included rolling pianos and boats.

390
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:58,002
We had ginormous snails in some of the driveways.

391
00:19:58,002 --> 00:20:01,165
And in fact, we also had ducks in business suits.

392
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:06,174
By the way, if you want proof of the kind of creative space,

393
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:11,016
the kind of creative license that leadership gave teams

394
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,557
at Atari, this is it.

395
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:19,239
So with a single street and a very weird set of characters

396
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,360
and a very basic rule set, we went to Focus Group.

397
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,001
It did not go well.

398
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:26,042
We had built a game that did not resonate with the players

399
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:30,944
because the reality we created, well, was unreal.

400
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:34,013
We were, of course, mortified.

401
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:37,095
But then a couple of very good things happened

402
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:39,536
as two new people joined our team.

403
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:43,797
The first is a guy named Don Trager.

404
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:46,959
Don joined our team as our product marketing lead.

405
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:50,220
Don's first big task on Paperboy was, in fact,

406
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,181
to run the aforementioned disastrous focus group.

407
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:57,063
And instead of telling us how horribly we had done,

408
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,604
we all knew that because we had watched

409
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:01,085
the whole damn thing from behind a one-way glass.

410
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:05,549
He told us about the positive things that the players liked in the game.

411
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:07,650
They liked riding the bike down the street, kind of.

412
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,691
And they really liked knocking that one lady with the shopping cart over.

413
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:14,551
So those were good things.

414
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:16,972
He made us focus on the positive.

415
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:20,732
As a testament to how bad a focus group it was,

416
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:25,553
at the end of the focus group, one of the focus group participants, a kid,

417
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:29,134
walked up to Don and asked him where he might buy some acid.

418
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:39,029
I will talk about Don a little bit more a little bit later.

419
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:44,311
Second guy to join our team at that guy was Brighton Daw.

420
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:47,233
Brighton had been the project lead on a few games up to that point.

421
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:51,855
He was the project lead and lead programmer and mine behind Cloak & Dagger.

422
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:58,138
Atari management as you can imagine was having a hard time seeing the potential of our game.

423
00:21:58,138 --> 00:22:00,960
Including by the way the current project lead of the game.

424
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:05,892
But Brighton liked our game and volunteered to take over

425
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,273
as the lead of our project.

426
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:08,994
He was given that assignment

427
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,276
and immediately injected positiveness,

428
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:13,137
organization, brainstorming,

429
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:16,340
and just basically a jolt of energy to our team

430
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,181
that we very much needed.

431
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:19,462
Brighton stayed with our project

432
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,944
for the rest of the development of Paperboy.

433
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:22,724
And on Wednesday, we go to pre-production.

434
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:36,057
We needed to rework our game.

435
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:39,278
We needed to rebuild the only street that we had created.

436
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:43,519
But before we did that, the characters had to change.

437
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,799
In response to the focus group, we recast the game.

438
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,580
We did manage to keep a handful of characters.

439
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,722
Death, the wolfman, and the aforementioned lady

440
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:58,462
with the basket, they all stayed in the game.

441
00:22:58,462 --> 00:22:59,943
But we cut all the other characters.

442
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:05,203
We knew that we did not want to go with a purely conventional cast,

443
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:11,027
because after all, the average character you see in a neighborhood riding around

444
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:15,749
is neither very exciting nor something you probably want to throw a newspaper at.

445
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:18,811
But we did, so we kept it a bit strange,

446
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:20,852
and in the end of development of Paperboy,

447
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:27,176
we added about 18 more characters for a total of 21 characters in the game,

448
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:28,677
including the bees.

449
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:33,454
Dave was responsible in addition to this

450
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:37,516
to the creation and art of the six vehicles in the game.

451
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:41,577
Their role, of course, is to keep you out of the streets

452
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:43,818
and to run you over when you go there.

453
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:47,759
Streets needed to be reworked,

454
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,400
or one street needed to be worked

455
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
as response to this focus group.

456
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,781
Up to this point, we had built the street house by house,

457
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:56,922
but this was not gonna scale.

458
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:59,403
We needed a different solution.

459
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:06,005
Dave's answer to this was to construct two five-foot-long foam core storyboards and to

460
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:12,750
transfer the line drawings of our inventory of houses at the time to those two foam core

461
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,291
storyboards.

462
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,533
He did it kind of like this.

463
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:20,916
And then he put a plastic sheet on top of that so we could draw on them.

464
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,638
Onto these two storyboards we drew.

465
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:28,865
the characters, the obstacles, the paper bundles,

466
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:33,266
the paths of the objects as they moved into the world,

467
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:37,287
and triggers, anything that you would interact with

468
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:37,807
on that street.

469
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:40,587
And so it went from this to this,

470
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:43,208
and that that course became part of Easy Street.

471
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:49,389
We did this original layout on what would become Easy Street

472
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,229
outside on a sunny Saturday.

473
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:55,415
in a marathon creative session in the atrium

474
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:58,797
of the 1501 building, 1501 McCarthy Boulevard, Milpitas,

475
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,238
drinking beer.

476
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:03,979
This beer came from the previous night's

477
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:05,680
beer bash at Atari.

478
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,302
Both Dave and I remember this as being

479
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:11,603
one of the great creative days of our careers.

480
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:14,845
In a sense, the muse came to us with a keg.

481
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:19,027
This became our blueprint for construction

482
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:20,248
for our first street.

483
00:25:22,427 --> 00:25:24,268
We did have a bit of a problem.

484
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:26,811
We wanted to take score away from the player

485
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:29,833
for breaking the windows on his customers.

486
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,895
At the time, you could not lose customers,

487
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:34,277
you could only smash their windows.

488
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:37,160
But back then in the arcades, and probably true now,

489
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,602
you just don't take score away from players.

490
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:42,605
So Lyle Rains, who was the creative director of Atari,

491
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:44,907
who's one of the minds behind Asteroids, of course,

492
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:47,710
came up with the idea of separating out

493
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:50,998
damage bonus, breakage bonus, from the core score

494
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:54,861
so we could take score away from the player

495
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:55,361
and get away with it.

496
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:55,921
I think it worked.

497
00:25:55,921 --> 00:26:01,185
So, with a newly cast first road,

498
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,327
a fully laid out first road,

499
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:06,169
and a somewhat improved scoring system,

500
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:08,471
we went to our second focus group,

501
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:10,132
and it generally went well.

502
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:12,014
We got out of our focus group

503
00:26:12,014 --> 00:26:14,596
what we needed to get into production,

504
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:17,278
confidence that we were building the right game.

505
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:23,869
And so on Thursday, we go to production.

506
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:26,931
We went to production with key takeaways.

507
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,752
We needed more depth in our game.

508
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:30,373
We only had one road.

509
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:33,355
Paper delivery needed to be a whole lot more interesting

510
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:35,196
and more important.

511
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:37,738
And the sounds needed a lot of work.

512
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:41,720
So we used the same construction techniques

513
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,382
we had on the first street to build two streets.

514
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:48,004
But before that, we gave our first street its name.

515
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:51,685
Easy Street, it had been unnamed up to that point,

516
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:55,047
and to that we added Middle Road and Hard Way.

517
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,789
But, as with all games in those days, we had a problem.

518
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:03,631
ROMs were expensive, and we were running out of space.

519
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,573
I suppose that's true of games today, too.

520
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:10,855
The good news is that Paperboy is largely

521
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:14,257
a patterned learning game, so giving the players familiarity

522
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,978
by seeing some of the same house designs in the game

523
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:19,446
was really not a bad thing.

524
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:23,948
So we ended up leveraging our base house design significantly.

525
00:27:23,948 --> 00:27:26,728
This house here, which is, of course,

526
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:31,209
the first house you see in the street, of Easy Street,

527
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:33,630
is in the game six times.

528
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,730
This here house, 116 Easy Street, about halfway

529
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,512
down the first block, you see also about six times.

530
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:47,481
In fact, in Paperboy, there are 60 total street addresses

531
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:49,583
made of 11 base house designs,

532
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:54,206
and nine cross streets made out of one base cross street.

533
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:56,688
So we were able to fit the thing in ROM.

534
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:57,389
A popular idea at the folks' groups

535
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:59,450
was the idea of a training course.

536
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:05,415
Now, of course, the training course in Paperboy

537
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,396
is essentially a bonus round.

538
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:11,620
Paperboy was not the game that invented bonus rounds.

539
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:15,165
But it was a break in the action for us

540
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:16,926
and a way to bring in new game mechanics.

541
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:19,066
Our first idea here, by the way,

542
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:24,268
was to have a field covered in windows and mailboxes.

543
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:28,208
But we landed on a more pinball style theme

544
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,509
with knockdown targets, that sort of thing.

545
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,650
I don't think Dave was very happy

546
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,471
with the bonus round of the training course.

547
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:39,711
He wanted much more dynamic elements,

548
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:41,472
moving targets, that sort of thing.

549
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:46,451
and he wanted the training course to progress day to day

550
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:49,213
based on your previous actions from the previous day.

551
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:51,835
But I think it worked,

552
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:54,417
and I think it changes the rhythm of the game.

553
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:59,181
I think arriving at the end of the street to a grandstand

554
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:01,082
gives a little bit of magical surprise.

555
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:05,345
Paperboy is really, of course, three games in one.

556
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:09,688
The three streets are completely independent.

557
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,304
In fact, we were even considering for a while,

558
00:29:13,304 --> 00:29:15,426
a bit too late, releasing Paperboy

559
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:18,188
in three independent episodes.

560
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:20,889
But because we released it all as a single game,

561
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:23,531
we needed to tie those three streets together

562
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,553
and reward a high score for the player

563
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:28,935
who did the best on the accumulated score of all three.

564
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,517
We called this our Grand Slam high score table.

565
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:34,599
The Grand Slam system and much more

566
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,741
was written by a guy named Bob Flanagan.

567
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:40,503
Bob Flanagan was and is an outstanding game programmer.

568
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,963
Bob started at Atari on Paperboy,

569
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:48,467
but then is the only programmer to work on not only Paperboy,

570
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:51,849
but Marble Madness, Gauntlet 1, and Gauntlet 2.

571
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:57,112
Also, I should say, Bob and I are both currently employed

572
00:29:57,112 --> 00:30:02,215
at Electronic Arts, and we count three more alumni of Atari

573
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:03,776
at EA for a total of five.

574
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:09,385
The map screen we needed to add because we had given

575
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:12,166
the player at this time the ability to lose

576
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,347
and then gain back customers.

577
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:17,149
I think the map screen has to be one of the earliest

578
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,611
examples of a meta game, certainly in the arcades.

579
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:25,433
You were on a very basic level managing an economy.

580
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:28,115
That gave you a bit of a break in action.

581
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:31,056
But here's what I really think.

582
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:34,278
Real paper boys, if you remember them.

583
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:38,592
would start each day by getting a bundle of newspapers,

584
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,013
like you see in the game, cutting them open,

585
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:44,834
and then rolling each newspaper, newspaper by newspaper,

586
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,495
taking a rubber band, putting it over those rolls,

587
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:50,156
and taking those papers and putting them in their bags

588
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,277
as they go out on their day.

589
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:55,839
For me, I think the map screen is a metaphor for this,

590
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,079
because it prepares you for your next day.

591
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,400
So it is our homage to Real Paper Boys.

592
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:05,804
As a byproduct of these game systems,

593
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:11,148
we gave the player a choice between good and, well, evil.

594
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:14,671
We never really did think of the boy as a hooligan,

595
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:15,752
but you did have a choice.

596
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:19,174
You could spend your game trashing every house

597
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:21,957
on the street and just save one,

598
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:24,799
or you could focus on being the best paper deliverer

599
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,542
possible, but of course, to get the best score,

600
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,063
you needed to do both.

601
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:32,685
But I think this player choice, this trade-off,

602
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:43,332
kinda works

603
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:13,656
the paperboy. You must remember to deliver only to customers, not the non-customers.

604
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:21,101
If they are not your customer, break their window. Remember, death comes on a Tuesday.

605
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:29,487
Thank you Shadowcast Pictures and Freak Films. I have left for last, of course, the incredible

606
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:31,789
soundtrack of Paperboy.

607
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:35,427
After all, didn't we always leave sounds to the end?

608
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:37,648
We had two key people on audio,

609
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:39,428
both with the title sound designer.

610
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:43,429
On the left, you will see a man named Hal Cannon.

611
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,949
Hal Cannon was responsible

612
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:50,091
for the excellent Paperboy music, the soundtrack, the score.

613
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:53,371
Hal also composed the music for Marble Madness,

614
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,572
Gauntlet, 720, and a bunch of other games at Atari.

615
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:01,460
Hal mysteriously left Atari somewhere in the mid to late 80s

616
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,802
and basically was never seen again.

617
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:06,424
He's the only person of the original team

618
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:09,046
I did not interview for this presentation.

619
00:33:09,046 --> 00:33:12,189
I hear rumors that he's in Lake Tahoe, I just don't know.

620
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:17,573
Earl Vickers joined our team as the lead sound designer

621
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:21,196
and our main contact into the audio group.

622
00:33:21,196 --> 00:33:24,578
He is responsible for all the sounds

623
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:26,440
and the voice in the game.

624
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:28,558
He has not disappeared.

625
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:30,779
He is still active in the Atari community.

626
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:36,522
Earl Vickers was instrumental in the addition and usage

627
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:40,083
of the Yamaha YM2151 FM synthesis music chip.

628
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:45,066
Wiki says it was the first Yamaha single chip

629
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,546
FM they ever produced.

630
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:50,048
Earl just thought of it as freaking magic.

631
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:54,479
Added to this was a very cool speech synthesizer

632
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,300
from Texas Instruments.

633
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,401
Speech was being added to pinball at the time,

634
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:01,062
so it was natural that it would come to video.

635
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:05,043
Earl Vickers composed most of the lines of dialogue

636
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,744
you hear in the game.

637
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:10,425
Earl also conducted the auditions within Atari

638
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:13,946
for the voice talent we used.

639
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:16,707
We, of course, did not pay professional voice talent.

640
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,347
For the narrator, he chose a fellow game programmer

641
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:22,788
named Peter Thompson.

642
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:26,031
For the narrator, we were thinking we wanted to cover

643
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,394
and dramatize the character,

644
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:31,817
we wanted to over-dramatize the character of the kid,

645
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:35,981
to give the kid a gravitas not associated

646
00:34:35,981 --> 00:34:37,783
with paper delivery specialists,

647
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:41,186
to create a hero or perhaps an anti-hero.

648
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,100
The voice of the paperboy was done by none other

649
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,282
than our product marketing manager, Don Traeger.

650
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:52,842
By the way, a bit later, Don helped to start

651
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,804
the whole electronic arts sports business,

652
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,684
among other things.

653
00:34:57,684 --> 00:35:01,005
But I think him doing the voice of the paperboy

654
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:01,826
was his finest work.

655
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:06,447
Years later, Don was at a trade show

656
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:08,228
working for electronic arts.

657
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:10,329
He walked up to a Bally Midway booth.

658
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:14,148
and where they were demonstrating a sequel to Paperboy.

659
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:19,730
The booth guy demonstrating the game showed him the game,

660
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,050
and then at the end of the demonstration looked at Don

661
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,172
and said, sir, are you familiar with Paperboy?

662
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:32,154
To which Don said, sir, I am the Paperboy.

663
00:35:32,154 --> 00:35:35,055
And walked away.

664
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:38,316
The Paperboy's lines themselves are split

665
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,157
into basically three categories.

666
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:44,137
The first of which was as a response to dying.

667
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:47,318
These were pretty much, pretty easy hooks to put in

668
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:49,179
because after all we knew when they were dying

669
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,000
or he was running into something.

670
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,061
You hear them clearly because that's a good moment

671
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:53,762
of the game.

672
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:58,004
The second set of lines, next category was as a reward

673
00:35:58,004 --> 00:36:01,266
for putting newspapers directly into a mailbox.

674
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:04,047
Again, simple hooks for me to put in.

675
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,949
Again, a very nice moment in the game

676
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:08,170
and easy to recognize.

677
00:36:09,222 --> 00:36:13,744
The third set of lines, I think, were, well,

678
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:14,585
the most interesting.

679
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:18,206
They were basically the kids' observations

680
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:20,407
on the characters in the game.

681
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:24,809
This is basically a commentary as delivered

682
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:27,170
from the paperboy's perspective.

683
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,952
We were trying to anticipate what the player was thinking

684
00:36:29,952 --> 00:36:32,453
as they played the game, and then give it a voice.

685
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:39,992
Sadly, mostly because these cues stepped on other audio and the complexity of just figuring

686
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:45,035
out when a character was on the screen, a lot of these cues never made it.

687
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:48,176
Mostly because, in the end, we ran out of time.

688
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:54,920
Not too surprisingly, we crunched to get the boy ready for test.

689
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,803
I myself worked something like eight weeks of seven days a week in the lab.

690
00:37:01,443 --> 00:37:06,704
I want to take a moment now and pause and I'd like to thank my wife Donna for putting

691
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:08,544
up with me during this time.

692
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:10,645
She was my girlfriend at the time.

693
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,125
Without her doing that, I just would not have made it.

694
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:19,026
But in the end, us putting this game together was a labor of love.

695
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:22,527
One thing happened as we got close to field test.

696
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:26,508
People came into our lab and started playing our game.

697
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:30,297
At Atari, you knew you had a good game when at lunch,

698
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:31,877
people would come in and play your game.

699
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,158
After all, it was the only place

700
00:37:34,158 --> 00:37:37,778
that you could play this game in that lab.

701
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:39,979
And so we spent the weeks and months

702
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:41,619
getting ready for field test,

703
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:43,539
watching people play our game,

704
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:46,520
playing our game ourselves, and iterating on it.

705
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,140
And in the end, I think it prepared us

706
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,840
pretty well for field test.

707
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,860
And so on Friday, we go to field test.

708
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:04,152
First field test was conducted at Golf Land Sunnyvale.

709
00:38:04,152 --> 00:38:08,634
Tari did a lot of, this is on El Camino for those of you who know it,

710
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:11,775
Tari did a lot of field testing at Golf Land.

711
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:14,736
It was close to where we were, it was a big arcade.

712
00:38:14,736 --> 00:38:18,317
We knew our competition was there, and frankly, they knew we were there.

713
00:38:18,317 --> 00:38:22,239
Linda Sinkovic, our technician, was responsible for

714
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,660
the care and feeding of our game and the arcade.

715
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,421
So one of the core things she would do, for example,

716
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:29,561
would be to change ROMs as we did iterations.

717
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:34,957
She remembers quite fondly putting a bunch of credits

718
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:37,958
in the game for the kids that were waiting in line

719
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:38,558
behind her as she did that.

720
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:42,940
Due to the success of Marble Madness largely

721
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,981
and of System 1, Atari rebranded the Paperboy hardware

722
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:50,162
at this time to System 2.

723
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:54,323
The biggest change to the hardware was the splitting off

724
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:57,424
of a separatable ROM board, which is,

725
00:38:57,424 --> 00:38:59,645
you see on the right there.

726
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:03,818
so you could do a ROM change without changing the whole cabinet.

727
00:39:03,818 --> 00:39:08,462
The other biggest change was taking our very cool three-box cabinet

728
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:12,225
and turning it into a more generic one-box cabinet

729
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,707
and removing our very cool side panel art.

730
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:16,349
Oh well.

731
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:19,211
720, Accelerator, APB, Super Sprint

732
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:22,574
are among some of the games that got built on System 2,

733
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:25,396
but I think largely they were all built as whole games

734
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,578
and not as ROM changes.

735
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:34,451
Field tests for Paperboy lasted for about four months.

736
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:37,193
We spent that time watching people play

737
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:38,733
and doing iterations.

738
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:41,895
We collected data, games even then recorded

739
00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:45,157
and aggregated player statistics, and iterated.

740
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:46,758
We talked to players.

741
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:49,740
You could do that then as they played the game.

742
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,601
Paperboy earned well and consistently.

743
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,742
It didn't break any records,

744
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:58,024
but it held its earnings over a four-month period.

745
00:39:58,347 --> 00:40:00,628
such that at the end of that period,

746
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:03,089
we were able to convince,

747
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:06,410
or maybe the earnings were able to convince,

748
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,333
Atari leadership to build our game.

749
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,394
And then, of course, at that point,

750
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:14,014
it became Atari's game.

751
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:18,736
So, on Saturday, we go to manufacturing.

752
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:19,877
Paperboy was first shown

753
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:25,839
at the Amusement Machine Operators Association show,

754
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:26,220
AMOA.

755
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:29,201
in Chicago in the fall of 1984.

756
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:33,863
It was shown alongside of Marble Madness,

757
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:35,424
but not sold then.

758
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:37,426
Marble Madness was.

759
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:40,047
Paperboy was first sold at the Amusement Showcase

760
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:43,690
International show, ASI show, in the spring of 1985.

761
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,752
And manufacturing would have begun right about then.

762
00:40:47,752 --> 00:40:50,294
Here are some pictures of Paperboy

763
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:51,514
on the manufacturing line.

764
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:54,576
In the upper left corner, you will see Dave Rauston

765
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:55,717
playing the game on the line.

766
00:40:56,565 --> 00:41:01,488
In the lower right corner, you will see a row of Paper Boys on the line.

767
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:08,052
I cannot tell you how ridiculously wonderful and singular experience it is as a game maker

768
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:12,134
to see your game on a manufacturing line.

769
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:16,557
In the upper right hand corner, you will see a somewhat redacted picture of the Paper Boy

770
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,297
launch party.

771
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:20,579
This was an all day, all night affair.

772
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,041
Atari marketed the game as usual,

773
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,643
although there were a couple things that were a bit different.

774
00:41:27,643 --> 00:41:31,925
Typically, they would sell games through sell sheets and print ads,

775
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:33,066
and that was about the same.

776
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:36,409
But one thing that was different was that Dave and I were lucky enough

777
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:38,850
to actually be featured in some of these print ads.

778
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:43,393
I'm not sure that Dave and I were the first featured in print ads,

779
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:44,294
but we were pretty early.

780
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:48,457
You have to keep in mind that in a few years previous to this,

781
00:41:48,457 --> 00:41:52,980
Atari did not even allow credit screens in its games.

782
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:57,967
kind of made themselves, so this was a pretty big deal,

783
00:41:57,967 --> 00:42:02,089
and I think Dave and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

784
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:06,131
Another thing was that Atari, the summer of 1985,

785
00:42:06,131 --> 00:42:11,013
conducted a world's greatest paperboy competition,

786
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:13,374
complete with a fake neighborhood, summer 85.

787
00:42:13,374 --> 00:42:17,216
And in the end, around 3,000 units, 3,500 units,

788
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:20,857
were produced and sold for about 2,500 bucks each.

789
00:42:21,401 --> 00:42:25,704
We were all hoping for maybe more than 5,000 units,

790
00:42:25,704 --> 00:42:29,927
but the Paperboy was expensive,

791
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:31,768
and well, it was 1985 in the arcades.

792
00:42:31,768 --> 00:42:35,490
And now about the Nintendo Entertainment System.

793
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:42,855
In every reasonable, independent, quantifiable measure,

794
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:46,377
the System 2 crushes the NES.

795
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:47,618
It has more bits.

796
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:53,719
It has more speed, it has more pixels, it has more RAM, it has more ROM.

797
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:59,624
Hell, we had a custom controller, a beautiful medium resolution monitor, speakers, and everything.

798
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:03,989
Every single metric except one.

799
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:11,376
As I mentioned, the Paperboy arcade sold about 3,500 units in the spring of 1985.

800
00:43:12,194 --> 00:43:15,976
Three years later, in Mindscape, ported Paperboy to the NES

801
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:20,979
and to manage to sell, oh well, two million copies.

802
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:23,880
Obviously, we were all very glad of this.

803
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,103
We were very excited, frankly, quite blown away.

804
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,844
It took me, personally, years and years though,

805
00:43:30,844 --> 00:43:33,566
after this, to ever realize

806
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:36,087
that the days of the arcades were numbered.

807
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:39,489
Paperboy derivatives have been published

808
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:40,710
on lots of platforms.

809
00:43:41,097 --> 00:43:45,038
both as faithful ports and true sequels,

810
00:43:45,038 --> 00:43:48,819
but I think, unless your game has been ported

811
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:52,240
as an LCD video game,

812
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,160
you have not really made it.

813
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:06,944
And so now we come to the true post-mortem.

814
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:10,185
I'm not here to bury, paper away,

815
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:13,115
So on Sunday, the papers are heavier.

816
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:16,437
So in terms of a true postmortem,

817
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:19,859
first we have to talk about what we wish we had had less of.

818
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,260
This was a less than wonderful day, the day that we

819
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,361
learned we were being sued.

820
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:30,124
We learned this, by the way, first in the press.

821
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:33,606
Two kids claimed that they had sent to Atari

822
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:35,627
the idea for Paperboy.

823
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:36,647
Now we knew.

824
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,231
that Dave had shown us the concept for Paperboy

825
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:42,691
well in advance of when they even claimed

826
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:44,852
to have sent it to us.

827
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:49,033
And Atari was incredibly supportive in this,

828
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:50,194
but it still hurt.

829
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:54,255
I myself learned about this waking up one morning

830
00:44:54,255 --> 00:44:57,536
and hearing a news anchor on my radio tell me about it.

831
00:44:57,536 --> 00:44:58,736
This was just kind of interesting.

832
00:45:02,985 --> 00:45:06,868
In December of 1985, we were informed that folks at the CPSC

833
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:09,570
were concerned that perhaps we were teaching

834
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,693
bad bicycle riding habits.

835
00:45:12,693 --> 00:45:16,256
You know, riding down the wrong side of the street into traffic.

836
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:18,698
Actually, if you're interested in this kind of thing,

837
00:45:18,698 --> 00:45:21,961
almost exactly a year ago, The Daily Show, Trevor Noah.

838
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:26,061
did a thing about games teaching guns.

839
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:29,604
And he actually used Paperboy as a reference

840
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:31,245
for how kids don't actually learn

841
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:33,287
how to smash all the windows on the street through games.

842
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:35,289
So I recommend it if you're interested.

843
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:36,650
And in terms of what every programmer wants less of, bugs.

844
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,473
So if you see the newspaper going

845
00:45:40,473 --> 00:45:47,059
behind the back of the Paperboy.

846
00:45:47,899 --> 00:45:51,821
It is not, in fact, a wraparound Steph Curry throw.

847
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:55,144
It is, in fact, an ordering problem between the papers

848
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:56,565
and the paper boy.

849
00:45:56,565 --> 00:46:00,487
Similarly, if you see the paper boy riding

850
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:04,550
through solid objects, this is, in fact, a priority problem

851
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:08,713
between the paper boy and the planter

852
00:46:08,713 --> 00:46:10,675
that should be behind him.

853
00:46:10,675 --> 00:46:13,036
This is a great bug.

854
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,838
I learned about this bug two weeks ago.

855
00:46:17,626 --> 00:46:20,348
doing the presentation for this presentation.

856
00:46:20,348 --> 00:46:22,450
So you see on the screen two different houses

857
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,692
with this on the screen.

858
00:46:24,692 --> 00:46:27,875
What's interesting about it is, well, they

859
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:29,536
both have the same address.

860
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,598
The house on the left is properly

861
00:46:31,598 --> 00:46:33,279
numbered 111 Easy Street.

862
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:36,442
It is the last house on the first block of Easy Street.

863
00:46:36,442 --> 00:46:40,806
The house on the right should be numbered 110 Easy Street.

864
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:43,648
It is the first house on the second block of Easy Street.

865
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:52,280
Turns out if you get hit crossing the road between these two houses, it screws up the

866
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,521
addresses of every single house on the second block.

867
00:46:54,521 --> 00:47:03,604
But days after manufacturing began, and weeks and weeks after the ROMs were burned, we heard

868
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:06,145
about this rather amazing bug.

869
00:47:06,145 --> 00:47:11,647
For those of you who have not heard of this bug, I will describe it to you.

870
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:14,746
At the end of each round, of course, right in front

871
00:47:14,746 --> 00:47:17,768
of the grand stand, there is a yellow line.

872
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,910
You ride your bike up to the line.

873
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,490
The game ends for that round.

874
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:25,173
But instead, if you feel so inclined,

875
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:28,215
you may take a hard right turn at the end there

876
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:30,616
and cut into that grass area.

877
00:47:30,616 --> 00:47:35,459
It turns out if you do that, well, you ride forever.

878
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:37,680
And you get millions of points in this kind

879
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,462
of surreal stamp play field.

880
00:47:40,297 --> 00:47:44,178
As I mentioned, I learned about this literally the day

881
00:47:44,178 --> 00:47:45,339
of manufacturing began.

882
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:47,040
I learned about this and those cabinets

883
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,341
were on the manufacturing line.

884
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:51,742
I was, of course, somewhat panicked.

885
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:54,203
But it turns out this was a mode problem, of course,

886
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:55,844
because you're skipping the trigger line

887
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:59,125
that's under that line by doing that little cut.

888
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:02,667
But what's really more interesting and pretty neat,

889
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:08,450
I think, is that the fix to this bug was two bytes.

890
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,910
In fact, it was really.

891
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:12,473
four bits.

892
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:16,756
This was basically changing a constant 77 to a two,

893
00:48:16,756 --> 00:48:19,038
and a branch equal to a branch not equal.

894
00:48:19,038 --> 00:48:23,922
That impacted one and only one ROM, which saved my life.

895
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:26,925
In fact, this was the only ROM change

896
00:48:26,925 --> 00:48:29,307
that Atari ever did for Paperboy.

897
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:31,569
And I think you can still see this bug

898
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:33,891
if you'd like to in the arcades.

899
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:36,613
I know it's available on YouTube.

900
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:44,656
And in terms of things that I wish there were more of,

901
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,017
well, first this.

902
00:48:46,017 --> 00:48:48,460
David always wanted indirect shots.

903
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,244
He wanted the ability to kick things off of an obstacle

904
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:56,408
and break a second story window.

905
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:58,950
In fact, lots of the houses in our game

906
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,773
had fully functional windows.

907
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:06,315
that could have been broken if I could ever have gotten

908
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:07,796
the newspaper there.

909
00:49:07,796 --> 00:49:09,977
But unfortunately, this really screwed up

910
00:49:09,977 --> 00:49:12,839
the collision system, so we never really did it.

911
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:16,461
In fact, lots of targets up there never got reached.

912
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:19,683
This house was the poster child for that one.

913
00:49:19,683 --> 00:49:23,525
We always wanted to knock over

914
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:27,687
a potted plant at the top of that house.

915
00:49:29,697 --> 00:49:32,558
As you may have noticed in this presentation,

916
00:49:32,558 --> 00:49:37,699
there are initials of several of the team members

917
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:40,080
hidden in the vehicles of the game.

918
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,140
Dave's initials are hidden in the construction sign

919
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,860
in front of the dirt jump ramp.

920
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,201
Dave may argue with me on this one,

921
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:50,482
but to me it is not a random fact

922
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:54,563
that the hat color of player one is orange,

923
00:49:54,563 --> 00:49:56,983
and the second player is blue.

924
00:49:56,983 --> 00:49:59,584
Orange for player one, blue for player two.

925
00:50:00,232 --> 00:50:03,634
At Atari, Major League Baseball was a really big thing.

926
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:04,814
I myself am a diehard Giants fan.

927
00:50:04,814 --> 00:50:06,155
Dave was a diehard Dodger fan.

928
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:09,457
Orange for player one, blue for player two.

929
00:50:09,457 --> 00:50:10,298
I'm just saying.

930
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,739
In terms of things that I really wish there was much more,

931
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:14,500
our team stayed together for a while.

932
00:50:25,908 --> 00:50:29,830
Dave and I would not leave Atari for another six years,

933
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,691
and in that time, we managed to build

934
00:50:31,691 --> 00:50:33,772
three other games in that time.

935
00:50:33,772 --> 00:50:37,634
But in terms of things that I wish there were much more,

936
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:41,056
the joy of writing Paperboy,

937
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:44,057
the incredible creative freedom and license

938
00:50:44,057 --> 00:50:46,459
that Atari Games gave us in doing that,

939
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:50,781
the fact that I was the first person

940
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:54,543
to ever see anything in Paperboy, I do remember that.

941
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,222
This was not my only time at the rodeo.

942
00:50:57,222 --> 00:51:01,927
I've launched and shipped plenty of the games since then,

943
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:02,647
but it was my first.

944
00:51:02,647 --> 00:51:03,789
Over the years, I have heard the stories

945
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:05,430
of people who've played Paperboy.

946
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,012
I've heard people say,

947
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:11,756
hey, I just played your game in the lab.

948
00:51:11,756 --> 00:51:17,381
Hey, I played, hey man, this game is cool.

949
00:51:17,381 --> 00:51:19,043
When will it come out?

950
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:21,765
Hey, I played Paperboy in the bowling alley the other day.

951
00:51:22,419 --> 00:51:25,941
I remember that I used to play Paperboy as a kid.

952
00:51:25,941 --> 00:51:28,603
My son and I play Paperboy together.

953
00:51:28,603 --> 00:51:29,903
He really likes it.

954
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:31,744
Pretty cool, really.

955
00:51:31,744 --> 00:51:35,967
I hope you have had some joy in playing Paperboy 2.

956
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:39,809
And that's Paperboy in seven days.

957
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:42,130
I hope I will be able to answer some questions in a second,

958
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,632
but I wanted to leave you with this from Random Encounters.

959
00:51:53,884 --> 00:52:01,767
Whoa!

960
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:02,407
Woo!

961
00:52:02,407 --> 00:52:05,549
Whoa!

962
00:52:11,185 --> 00:52:14,807
Hey! Keep driving! Lo-ho!

963
00:52:32,056 --> 00:52:35,658
I'm on a walk with Junior like any other day

964
00:52:35,658 --> 00:52:38,900
I'm not sure how it happened but the babies rolled away

965
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,161
I'd positively panic but it happened last week too

966
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:43,802
Plus I'm just the babysitter losing children's what I do

967
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:45,463
Babies rolling down Easy Street

968
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:46,664
Oh that baby

969
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:51,667
I'm trying to get my pants on but they're really freaking tight

970
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,608
Why I'm in the street I haven't got a clue

971
00:52:55,635 --> 00:53:01,446
At precisely 9.08, I come out my door and wait, and leave out a luring bait, for the paperboy I hate!

972
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:01,787
Sing!

973
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:09,116
Steve Cars is what I do.

974
00:53:09,116 --> 00:53:12,698
Give me all your money and put it in this bag.

975
00:53:12,698 --> 00:53:15,900
I need it for my wife cause she's a shopaholic hag.

976
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,482
Hey come on make it snappy, this ain't no deja vu.

977
00:53:20,482 --> 00:53:24,404
I rob you almost daily because robbing's what I do.

978
00:53:24,404 --> 00:53:26,245
I don't get all this fuss, I'm just a normal guy.

979
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:29,167
Who takes his normal rocks and collects souls when people die.

980
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:32,749
I love to read the funnies on the entertainment news.

981
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:47,895
I'm not that weird, it's just a thing I do.

982
00:53:47,895 --> 00:54:02,081
I think we have a few minutes for questions if anybody's got any.

983
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:15,723
I have five minutes for questions if anybody's got any.

984
00:54:15,723 --> 00:54:16,163
Okay.

985
00:54:16,163 --> 00:54:16,363
Hello.

986
00:54:16,363 --> 00:54:16,904
Hi.

987
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:21,586
Hi. Fantastic talk. Really loved the whole process and hearing the story about it.

988
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:30,030
I was curious, after the release of the original paperboard, did you have any hand or work or influence on the derivatives or paperboard 2 that came out years later?

989
00:54:30,439 --> 00:54:35,061
Not at, Dave had some, I had none.

990
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:39,603
Atari, you did not do sequels at all.

991
00:54:39,603 --> 00:54:41,984
Imagine, I work for Electronic Arts now, so this is.

992
00:54:41,984 --> 00:54:43,484
Shh.

993
00:54:43,484 --> 00:54:47,426
So at Atari, they actually told you not.

994
00:54:47,426 --> 00:54:51,147
So Dave and I immediately started focusing on 720,

995
00:54:51,147 --> 00:54:54,069
and that became my life at that point.

996
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:58,070
And then Atari added Tengen to do derivatives,

997
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,791
and at that point, we got more involved.

998
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:04,487
but not a lot. Those games are really driven independently.

999
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:05,367
Thanks. Of course.

1000
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:06,848
I just noticed when you were

1001
00:55:06,848 --> 00:55:15,030
showing all the different vehicles with the associated people, the one with the motorcycle

1002
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:21,033
the initials didn't seem to match. What's the story behind that?

1003
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:24,174
Oh my god, I can't believe you asked that question. So that's

1004
00:55:24,174 --> 00:55:28,815
Milt Loper. That's CR on there.

1005
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:32,342
So I just talked to Milti about that for a while,

1006
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:33,463
really trying to get it.

1007
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:36,625
So he, I don't think I'm getting anything.

1008
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,988
So he was pretty heavy duty motorcycle gang kind of guy

1009
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:41,490
before he worked at Atari.

1010
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:45,013
And the best he told me was CR stands for Crazy Rooster.

1011
00:55:45,013 --> 00:55:47,595
That's all I got on that one.

1012
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:48,215
Thank you.

1013
00:55:48,215 --> 00:55:50,597
I don't think it stands for that, by the way.

1014
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,358
Anything else?

1015
00:56:02,213 --> 00:56:05,454
I was a paperboy when it came out and I loved this game as a kid.

1016
00:56:05,454 --> 00:56:09,455
I could never get more than about halfway through though, so my question is, can you

1017
00:56:09,455 --> 00:56:10,515
beat it?

1018
00:56:10,515 --> 00:56:13,336
Can I beat the game?

1019
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,697
I can get through it.

1020
00:56:14,697 --> 00:56:15,737
These days, hell no.

1021
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:19,758
Back then, yeah, I could get through most of the game.

1022
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:23,139
Hard way, it's a little hard for me.

1023
00:56:23,139 --> 00:56:26,080
Dave is an awesome player.

1024
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,941
Yeah, I've never been the greatest player on earth, but yeah, I did okay.

1025
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:32,623
There's great videos of people who are really good at the game, of course.

1026
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:34,304
That's pretty spectacular for me to watch.

1027
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:35,365
All right, so I'll throw two quick ones at you.

1028
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:40,548
So you cracked me up with the comparison of hardware on the Nintendo, but I'm probably,

1029
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:44,070
in fact, show of hands, who played the Nintendo version?

1030
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,291
Yeah, that's probably most of us.

1031
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:48,112
I never actually got to see the arcade.

1032
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:49,473
Wait, who played the arcade version?

1033
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:49,673
My God.

1034
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:50,754
All right, so 50-50.

1035
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:51,434
Hey, that's pretty good.

1036
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:57,058
But nevertheless, did you guys have any hand in the Nintendo port at all?

1037
00:56:57,058 --> 00:56:59,319
Did they at least consult you or anything or just kind of popped out?

1038
00:57:00,111 --> 00:57:02,393
to my recollection, it was magic.

1039
00:57:02,393 --> 00:57:07,898
In fact, look, so the byline at Atari Games,

1040
00:57:07,898 --> 00:57:11,681
the one I worked at was, coin up the real Atari.

1041
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:15,144
To say we were looking down on the home was,

1042
00:57:15,144 --> 00:57:16,685
that's an understatement.

1043
00:57:16,685 --> 00:57:20,048
So we were privileged kids working

1044
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:21,510
on these incredible hardware.

1045
00:57:22,097 --> 00:57:23,798
So, no, I really didn't.

1046
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:26,320
I think I would be dishonest if I said I did.

1047
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:26,900
No, that's fine.

1048
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,361
They did an incredible job on that game.

1049
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,403
Honestly, that's what I grew up liking.

1050
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:33,685
And then the other one is literally on my Nintendo Switch over there, there's a game

1051
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:34,326
called The Video Kid.

1052
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:35,627
Are you familiar with this game?

1053
00:57:35,627 --> 00:57:35,967
I am not.

1054
00:57:35,967 --> 00:57:37,488
Anybody in here familiar with The Video Kid?

1055
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:39,809
so a couple people, it's basically 80s nostalgia on Paperboy.

1056
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:40,770
Oh, excellent.

1057
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,691
So the fact that, and you didn't even know it existed, right?

1058
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:45,132
So I'll show it to you at the end because I got my Switch.

1059
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:48,813
But, I mean, how does that feel that you're still literally influencing games and styles

1060
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:52,695
and it's, you know, I'm sure there's mobile games and all these things based on this design.

1061
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:58,438
So it was that story I told at the end and that very much is, I don't make it through,

1062
00:57:58,438 --> 00:58:02,480
you know, I've been in the business a few years now, and I don't make it through a year.

1063
00:58:03,172 --> 00:58:04,612
without walking into some meeting.

1064
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:08,154
And it's typically an executive who's been playing my game

1065
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:10,595
when they were a kid, saying, well, here's John Solitz.

1066
00:58:10,595 --> 00:58:12,476
Yes, he's the technical director on this project.

1067
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:14,656
But what he really did, he worked on Paperboy

1068
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:15,217
back in the 80s.

1069
00:58:15,217 --> 00:58:16,497
I love it.

1070
00:58:16,497 --> 00:58:18,658
Isn't that exciting?

1071
00:58:18,658 --> 00:58:18,898
Cool.

1072
00:58:18,898 --> 00:58:19,198
Thank you.

1073
00:58:19,198 --> 00:58:23,180
So did Atari have any guidelines as far as, like,

1074
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,941
average gameplay per quarter?

1075
00:58:25,941 --> 00:58:27,242
Yeah.

1076
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,302
Yeah, you were trying.

1077
00:58:28,302 --> 00:58:30,063
So everything was about, um, uh,

1078
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:36,158
Yeah, you want to have 30 to 90 seconds per credit.

1079
00:58:36,158 --> 00:58:37,899
Paperweight actually came out at $0.50 a play,

1080
00:58:37,899 --> 00:58:40,720
somewhere in there.

1081
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,801
And what was really interesting was some of the stuff

1082
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:44,282
that I actually cut from the presentation was,

1083
00:58:44,282 --> 00:58:46,363
one of the things was that you knew

1084
00:58:46,363 --> 00:58:48,744
you had to hook the player in 30 seconds.

1085
00:58:48,744 --> 00:58:51,605
And the positive thing that that did for the team,

1086
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:54,967
it focused the whole team on core gameplay.

1087
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:57,008
I'm sure a lot of us have been on game teams

1088
00:58:57,008 --> 00:58:58,488
where they don't focus on gameplay,

1089
00:58:58,488 --> 00:58:59,989
they focus on everything around gameplay.

1090
00:59:00,265 --> 00:59:03,388
but if you got to grab somebody in 30 seconds,

1091
00:59:03,388 --> 00:59:04,750
it focused you.

1092
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,853
And so the idea was that if you didn't get the player

1093
00:59:07,853 --> 00:59:10,255
within 30 seconds, they'd walk away.

1094
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:14,219
So in terms of earnings, somewhere, as I recall,

1095
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:17,262
a couple other people probably, Franz, you know better,

1096
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,424
so 30 to 90 seconds, somewhere in there,

1097
00:59:19,424 --> 00:59:21,006
is what you kind of want to turnover rate.

1098
00:59:21,006 --> 00:59:21,326
Oh God.

1099
00:59:21,326 --> 00:59:23,028
Franz Lanziger.

1100
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:28,445
Hello. Thank you so much for this trip down memory lane for me.

1101
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:30,106
That was quite an experience.

1102
00:59:30,106 --> 00:59:34,269
I had the privilege of working with John at Atari for a couple of years.

1103
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:40,394
When you mentioned bliss, I thought, oh, my God, I totally forgotten about this.

1104
00:59:40,394 --> 00:59:44,818
So I used sixty five or two on Crystal Castles, but then I worked on Gremlins,

1105
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:47,560
which never made it out the door in bliss.

1106
00:59:48,135 --> 00:59:50,457
So I qualify my thing by successfully shipping.

1107
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:52,238
I just wanted to, yeah.

1108
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:53,639
So I do have a question.

1109
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:57,201
What other projects did you use Bliss on?

1110
00:59:57,201 --> 00:59:57,801
It was 720.

1111
00:59:57,801 --> 01:00:00,763
720, and then you moved on to C probably?

1112
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,344
Yep, C++, yep.

1113
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:01,884
C, straight C.

1114
01:00:01,884 --> 01:00:03,585
Yeah, so Bliss, for those of you,

1115
01:00:03,585 --> 01:00:06,327
I bet nobody knows what Bliss is.

1116
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:11,090
It was a high-level language, sort of like C.

1117
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,971
It sort of looked like C.

1118
01:00:12,971 --> 01:00:15,032
You could actually do if-then-elses and loops.

1119
01:00:15,648 --> 01:00:21,819
And the processor underneath was something entirely new, was 16 bits all of a sudden,

1120
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:24,443
not 8 bits. So, very exciting. Anyway, thank you so much.
