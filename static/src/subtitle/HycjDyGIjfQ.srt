1
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:08,603
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:12,465
Note to self, don't schedule yourself opposite destiny.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,667
So this is Patrick Zadel.

4
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:23,569
Patrick Zadel is a former professional e-sports athlete, e-sports player.

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,891
He's retired about a year ago.

6
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:28,511
He's 23 now, I think.

7
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:35,234
And when he was playing, he realized, wow, sometimes my ears ring a lot.

8
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:37,195
And then they started ringing more.

9
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:50,503
and then they started ringing more, and he did some Googling, and he realized, I have tinnitus, which is a constant ringing in his ear, and now the ringing doesn't go away, so he's now got permanent tinnitus.

10
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:56,585
And after some more Googling, he kind of realized, I think I gave this to myself.

11
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:04,288
So Patrick's game was a tactical five-on-five shooter, where hearing footsteps is his paycheck.

12
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:19,190
So in order to hear those really, really quiet footsteps that are asymptotically, logarithmically soft away, far away, he would crank the volume like insanely loud levels so he could hear those quietest footsteps.

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,972
But of course, when the flashbang grenade goes off next to him, it was really, really loud.

14
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:30,233
So a combination of playing really, really loud, because that's what his paycheck depended on,

15
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:34,036
and the fact that he plays for long hours.

16
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:35,457
He practices, he plays.

17
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:38,618
He realized he gave himself tinnitus.

18
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:45,320
I met Patrick in Geneva this last summer at the World Health Organization.

19
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:57,006
I started doing some pro bono work for them last May or June because they're very interested in video games as a potential source of hearing health problems.

20
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:05,075
And they've created something called their Make Listening Safe initiative to look at hearing health for the population in general.

21
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:07,017
And it's a big problem.

22
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:07,918
Hearing health

23
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:22,613
The inability to hear well has all sorts of downstream health ramifications from increased risk of Alzheimer's, depression, not to mention, of course, the fact that people are not able to enjoy the work that we all create here.

24
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:29,874
So who here either has an iPhone or an Android?

25
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,955
Yeah, 100% of hands go up.

26
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:32,455
I don't know.

27
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,015
You'd have to ask that question.

28
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:37,156
Has anybody with an Apple Watch ever had this pop up?

29
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:38,036
Yep.

30
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:39,035
Angles go up.

31
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:56,761
So a couple of years ago, the World Health Organization, working with Apple, working with Google, and working with the ITU, actually created something, a specification, for hearing safety on these sorts of devices.

32
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:59,562
People listen to music with their earbuds in.

33
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:02,543
They listen for too loud, for too long.

34
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:07,325
They've got their watches to tell them things,

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:19,165
And they implemented what's called the WHO ITU H.870 spec, Guidelines for Safe Listening Devices and Systems.

36
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,426
It first came out in 2019.

37
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,946
It was updated recently in 2022.

38
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:27,929
Here's the World Health Organization version of the spec.

39
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:31,391
Here is the little bit more buttoned up ITU version of the spec.

40
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:33,172
I kind of like that one better.

41
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:52,602
But what it does is it specifies, amongst other things, under what circumstances should devices that play music to your ears either provide some warnings or notifications to the user, to the listener, or perhaps automatically lower the volume down, which we'll do in some cases as well.

42
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,703
So that was a very, very successful initiative.

43
00:03:54,883 --> 00:04:02,848
They got something into devices that virtually every person carries through this WHO ITU 8.870 spec.

44
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,385
through their Make Listening Safe initiative.

45
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,627
So what are they doing now?

46
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:16,570
They deliberately left video games off of the ITU 870 spec.

47
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,611
They just felt they didn't know the space well enough.

48
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,272
They wanted to get something out.

49
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,853
What feature are you going to cut in order to ship?

50
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:26,995
They cut video game systems and devices.

51
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:33,218
So they are in the middle right now of writing a, there's no number for it yet or anything,

52
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:40,592
but writing an analogous specification for us in the video game industry.

53
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:51,978
So they started the ITU, WHO, Global Safe Standard for Listening in Video Game and eSports initiatives as part of the Make Listening Safe campaign.

54
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:58,601
So a goal is to create a spec kind of analogous to the one adopted by Google and Apple.

55
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,102
Another is that they do have an awareness campaign.

56
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:07,564
They just published an article.

57
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:12,107
It got picked up by most of the press in January about hearing safety in general.

58
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,249
So there's community awareness going on.

59
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:30,279
And also, they started reaching out to the development community, which is kind of how I got involved, again, to help them better understand how people play games, how people make games, how game systems work, and so on.

60
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:32,404
So that's kind of what they're doing.

61
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:48,897
And like I said, part of what they're going to likely be working on are what would analogous features to what we have on our iPhones and Apple iWatches and so on, what sorts of things would we put into things like game consoles or gaming devices and so on.

62
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:50,158
So that's part of what they're doing.

63
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:56,923
We're not going to talk really too much about that, except that if you are interested in that, I'll have some contact information at the end.

64
00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:58,064
Let me know.

65
00:05:58,164 --> 00:06:00,246
By all means, we would love you to be part of the conversation.

66
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,995
So one of the things I also did want to do was reach out to us, to game developers, particularly those on the audio side of things.

67
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:23,486
And towards that, for example, at GameSoundCon this last October, by pure happenstance, the head of this initiative at the WHO, Dr. Shelly Chadha, happened to be in Los Angeles.

68
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:24,847
And she actually took an Uber.

69
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:29,150
I invited her to become part of my opening remarks at GameSoundCon this year.

70
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:40,318
And literally, she took an hour, hour and a half Uber from southern LA up to Burbank, where she spoke for 10 minutes, and then went back to doing the business that she did.

71
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:43,840
So they're very, very passionate about this particular thing.

72
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,523
And her big point is that this is a very real threat.

73
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:58,168
WHO estimates that 3 billion human beings will have significant hearing damage in their life if things don't change on their current course.

74
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,830
And for us in games, it's kind of an interesting thing.

75
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:09,952
There's nothing necessarily more about games that makes games more damaging to your hearing than, say, watching a movie or something like that.

76
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:13,253
But we do kind of have a bit of a triple threat here.

77
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:19,954
One is that if we are successful, people play our games a lot.

78
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,895
I think Baldur's Gate is about 120-hour playthrough.

79
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:34,584
I certainly know people, very, very close family members who play many, many hours a week, tens of hours a week.

80
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:36,724
So that's one of the problems.

81
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:37,864
Not problems.

82
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:43,425
It's a success of us, but it's a potential thing to worry about that people play our games for long periods of time.

83
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:46,066
They play at loud volumes.

84
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:49,447
Many people play games pretty loudly.

85
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:51,987
And they're playing with headphones.

86
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:56,508
By the way, that's a chat GPT image, the guy with the sound waves coming out of his ears.

87
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,142
We got more.

88
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:11,645
And studies show, and in talking with some of the publishers and so on, that about half of our customers, about half of our players, play with headphones on.

89
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,526
That's up a significant amount from a dozen years ago or so.

90
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:22,228
In fact, so much so that a lot of us mix our games with headphones on as well as with speakers.

91
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:35,029
I had coffee with Emily Ridgway at Valve, and she's got this wonderful tree of headphones that, because they all sound so different, she wanted to figure out, oh, what do these different headphones sound like?

92
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,149
What sounds sound good in them?

93
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:38,770
So headphone listening is definitely a very, very big thing.

94
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,131
And to be frank, biology is going against us.

95
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,691
It's fun to listen loud.

96
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:50,652
This is another chat GPT image.

97
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:57,905
This is make me a realistic picture of somebody rocking out loudly while playing a video game.

98
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,088
Not super careful on how they count hands, but.

99
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:11,087
But so it turns out that there's part of our, we don't use it for hearing, but it's still part of our auditory system called the sacculus.

100
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:17,691
The sacculus is in the inner ear that's particularly sensitive to low frequencies at high dB levels.

101
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:24,436
Again, we don't use it for hearing, but it does sort of activate at about 90 decibels.

102
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,298
And it's got a connection to the hypothalamus.

103
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:33,402
And yeah, that's the part of the brain that deals with hunger, sex, and sort of hedonistic responses to things.

104
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:40,347
So it literally is more pleasurable to us to experience loud.

105
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:47,771
And anybody who's played in a band or been in a concert or loves Mahler without brasses blaring, it's just something, yeah, something that's really cool.

106
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:50,772
So it's something that we are definitely fighting against.

107
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:55,955
It's, we kind of want to turn ourselves up to, this is the first meme I ever made.

108
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:58,536
So for this talk here.

109
00:09:59,237 --> 00:09:59,557
All right.

110
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:03,639
So how does this, you know,

111
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:05,963
Super, super good on the biology.

112
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:07,964
This is what it looks like inside our ears.

113
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:10,345
I'm sure we've all heard that we have hair cells in our ears.

114
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,967
We actually have two different sets of hair cells.

115
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,608
Those top hair cells are called the inner hair cells.

116
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,690
Those are the only hair cells that are actually connected to nerves.

117
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,191
So those are the ones we actually use to hear.

118
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:25,454
Those bottom hair cells, those three rows, they're called the outer hair cells.

119
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:30,976
Their job is simply to mechanically amplify sounds.

120
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:32,558
We'll get to that in just a second.

121
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:46,990
But it's really that top line that is the thing that changes vibrating air molecules to transducing through the three bones in our inner ear to liquid in our cochlea that wiggle these hairs.

122
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:50,172
This is how we hear.

123
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:54,256
And of course, if we listen for a little bit too loudly for too long,

124
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:56,359
this is what happens.

125
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:06,226
In fact, the hairs stay bent over, and our body determines that they are dead, and that they don't regrow.

126
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:14,672
Instead, actually, literally, like a scab forms over where they used to be, which is why there's empty space, not sort of, you don't see the dead hair cells there.

127
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:19,316
So, those outer hair cells are really, really important.

128
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:22,258
Without our outer hair cells,

129
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,784
This would be our limit of our hearing.

130
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:31,665
So we literally would hear nothing below 60 decibels if we did not have those outer hair cells.

131
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:52,869
The outer hair cells act as a nonlinear amplifier for, and this is the curve that represents the amplification, it's a mechanical amplification that the outer hair cells do that bring the level of the vibrations up to the point where our inner hair cells can actually detect, move enough so that we detect sound.

132
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:58,910
And in the audio world, this is an upward compressor.

133
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,555
So literally, mechanically, we're providing variable gain.

134
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:10,218
At very, very soft levels, we're providing lots of gain.

135
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:15,661
At higher levels, our auto-rehearsals provide little or no extra gain.

136
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:21,966
And this is why, by the way, if somebody is hard of hearing, you don't shout at them.

137
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:35,904
Because the upper range of their hearing is normal like anybody else, it is just that the softer sounds are not amplified up to the range where our inner hair cells can actually detect sound.

138
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:38,345
So this is why hearing damage is so insidious.

139
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:44,488
They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, except in our case, there's no cure.

140
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:45,789
So it's kind of problematic.

141
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,987
So the thing that you want to track if we're talking about either our own hearing health or our players' hearing health is dosage over time.

142
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:55,589
It's like a Geiger counter.

143
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,034
You can be exposed to so much radiation for a certain number of minutes.

144
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:04,379
If you're exposed to twice as much radiation, you better be in the room half as long.

145
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:07,406
And it's just like that with sound as well.

146
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,668
And this is called the equal energy principle.

147
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:20,494
If I listen for four hours at 80 decibels on Monday and two on Sunday, that's the same as if I had listened for six hours in one day.

148
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:26,338
And here's an example, by the way, of some LUFS output from a couple of different games.

149
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,283
The second one, it's a little bit more steady, very, very high levels, where

150
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:41,220
dynamic range of the first one gives a lot more opportunity for our ears sort of to breathe and so on.

151
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:51,002
So the WHO and international standards have come up with what are safe listening levels?

152
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:54,603
How loudly can we listen for how long in a recreational setting?

153
00:13:54,903 --> 00:14:02,385
There are different numbers for occupational settings, right, where there's a factory stamping machine going 24 hours a day.

154
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:04,485
For recreational listening,

155
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:12,294
What they have settled upon is 80 decibels A-weighted, DBA, for 40 hours a week.

156
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:21,442
And every three decibels of increased listening level halves the amount of safe listening time.

157
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:26,746
So at 86 decibels, it's not 40 hours a week that is safe.

158
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:28,826
It is only 10 hours a week that is safe.

159
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:34,848
And at 100 decibels, it's like five minutes, six minutes that is safe.

160
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:40,690
So the WHO did a survey and also a survey of literature to kick this thing off.

161
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:48,093
And one thing that they found was people, when they are playing games, are playing louder than 80 decibels.

162
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:52,213
And they're playing for, in some cases, more than 10 hours a week.

163
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:55,954
So people generally are listening at unsafe levels.

164
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:04,195
Certain subsets of our players are playing loud and playing for long periods of time.

165
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,616
They do set different levels for children versus adults.

166
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:12,437
That's what the mode two was, is the same thing but for kids.

167
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:16,158
So it's definitely a little bit of a problem.

168
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:24,048
So some of the other results of their surveys were people did not perceive themselves as being susceptible to hearing loss.

169
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:25,368
That makes sense.

170
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:36,891
Gamers are, for the most part, kind of young, and young people kind of feel pretty invincible in general, much less for something where slow dosages over a period of decades will result in hearing loss when they're 75 or 80.

171
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,511
So that kind of makes sense.

172
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:45,092
They do believe that reducing volume would limit gaming enjoyment.

173
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:48,524
A year ago, I would have rejoiced at that statement.

174
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,546
But it is something we need to keep in mind.

175
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:57,349
Like I said, we're fighting against the sacculus and the fact that it's more fun to listen loud.

176
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:05,433
That said, half of the response to this survey said that they were interested in learning more about this thing, because it's sort of like smoking.

177
00:16:05,473 --> 00:16:09,175
People do not want lung cancer, so they realize they shouldn't smoke.

178
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,096
And so, yeah, I kind of want to know more about that.

179
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:19,984
Yeah, this is kind of the survey of the results there.

180
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:22,646
Now, some listening habits that they have.

181
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,549
These were done on Windows systems, and the average volume setting was 56%.

182
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:36,977
56% on Windows system volume is about, I measured it just the other day, I think it's about minus eight decibels from peak.

183
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,578
So they're down a little bit.

184
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,480
21% listen at high or very high

185
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:51,792
volume settings, where high was defined as the system volume was greater than 60% or very high, greater than 80%.

186
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:57,636
So one in five people, system volumes while they're playing games are pretty loud.

187
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:06,801
Of course, one thing that was kind of cool is three out of four said they believe that sounds are either extremely or very important.

188
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,222
That's yay us again.

189
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:09,563
So that's good.

190
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,645
But it is problematic.

191
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:14,725
Right?

192
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:20,168
Time spent with gaming is associated with higher odds of hearing loss.

193
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:21,949
That was one of the findings of the survey.

194
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:26,532
People who game more tend to start to have some hearing problems.

195
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:31,695
Gamers who played more frequently were more likely to game at higher volumes.

196
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:35,477
So that's that double whammy of dosage, right?

197
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:41,801
Time at a certain volume times the level at which you are actually listening.

198
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:51,612
Four, five, and ten reported having heard ringing in their ears after playing a game session at least once.

199
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:57,058
So there's definitely some things to look at here from a safety perspective.

200
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:03,484
So as game developers, are there things that we can do to make people play the games we have?

201
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,366
We want them to play long periods of time.

202
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:06,948
We want them to hear our stuff.

203
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:09,864
But are there anything we can do?

204
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:12,246
And to be frank, this is an open question.

205
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:13,847
This is one of the things we're trying to figure out.

206
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:15,709
This is a new topic for us.

207
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:26,256
Right, we haven't thought of this, another chat GPT image, except I did Photoshop the Wwise mastering plug-in into the Thought Bubble there.

208
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:31,856
So yeah, this is not something, I don't know about you, I had never really given this a second thought.

209
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:37,900
So it's not something we had thought about, the exception being Rob Bridget, who has thought about this, of course, because Rob Bridget has thought about everything.

210
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,025
But it does seem kind of close to some things that we have worked on.

211
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:48,728
So accessibility, loudness standards.

212
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:53,592
Boy, I remember being at the Fairmont talking about loudness standards at GDC.

213
00:18:54,952 --> 00:19:00,437
listening environments like nighttime mode, audio customizability, advanced audio settings, these sorts of things.

214
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:10,665
And again, you know, several years ago, Sony, Microsoft kind of joined forces to help create the mix recommendations that standard minus 23 lefts we're kind of at right now.

215
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:19,151
A lot of games have very cool audio options with headphone bass boosts and different kinds of customizability.

216
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,215
This is from, is this from God of War Ragnarok?

217
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:23,635
I think it is.

218
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,964
Yeah, of course somebody here knows that.

219
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:30,566
So yeah, different levels of dynamic range, right?

220
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:36,710
So that if I don't want my gunshots to be quite so loud, maybe I can play my game at a more limited dynamic range.

221
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,733
Some devices actually do implement some of these warning features already.

222
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:45,076
This is the manual from, I forgot if it's Oculus Go or Oculus Quest.

223
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:48,718
But to prevent hearing loss, do not listen at high volumes.

224
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:49,959
That's warning in the manual.

225
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:57,966
And actually, you will get a visual alert if you've been listening in this VR experience, in some VR experience, for too loud for too long.

226
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:04,171
Now, there obviously are a lot of challenges.

227
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:06,072
The biggest is the last mile problem.

228
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:12,558
It's all good for us to talk about how we create our games and the volume levels we set.

229
00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:15,342
We don't know what the person's headset is, right?

230
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:24,277
An 80-ohm headset versus a 30-ohm headset versus a 250-ohm headset are going to be massively, like orders of magnitude different SPL levels to the eardrums.

231
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:28,189
So WHO is fully cognizant of that.

232
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:43,095
There are some initiatives to try and deal with that that are kind of fun for us long term, like headphones that tell you the exact SPL level that are going to the ears, which we can then do things like, you know, Fletcher months and compensated listening, its volume controls and things like that.

233
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,535
So those are a little bit down the road.

234
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:52,218
But their idea is that we can make a meaningful impact while working on a little bit longer term solution.

235
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,731
So what we have here is a call to action.

236
00:20:57,411 --> 00:21:04,013
The idea of this talk, it's a 30 minute talk, so it's a quick one, is just to introduce the topic to the industry a little bit.

237
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:08,054
We had a little bit of a panel at GameSoundCon on it, continuing it here at GDC.

238
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:13,995
So part one is just, if you're interested in being part of the conversation, come join and be part of the conversation.

239
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:17,476
We'd love to get your input on this topic in general.

240
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:24,430
Consider hearing health in the same way you might consider accessibility, or those sorts of things.

241
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,212
Or it's something maybe we can start thinking about.

242
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:38,717
How might we change a little bit of the way we make our games, not to diminish the content we want to make, the emotional content we want to make, but with just something like this in mind.

243
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:43,419
I think also being aware of how our players are listening to our games could be really helpful.

244
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:48,902
There's a lot of not, we have a lot of opaque areas where we're not really quite sure what's going on.

245
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:52,169
So telemetry data, audio analytics, right?

246
00:21:54,010 --> 00:22:02,036
Have your games report back to you, back to home base, what people's volume slider settings are at or what their system settings are at and things like that.

247
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:06,600
Play testing, trying things out to see how it affects how loudly people listen and so on.

248
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,223
And the kinds of telemetry data we might want to collect.

249
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,401
Are you listening on a headphone or speakers?

250
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:15,082
What options are people setting?

251
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:16,363
And again, this is non-intrusive stuff.

252
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:19,064
This is stuff you can just get by calling APIs.

253
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:21,446
USB versus analog.

254
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:26,368
What's the level of chat versus game versus sound effects versus music and so on.

255
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:29,510
Game volume settings, system volume settings, things like that.

256
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:39,416
So another interesting call to action might be thinking about what kind of features might you want to implement in your game

257
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:48,976
that could lead to a lower sound pressure level experience for the player, less loudness at the headset, without compromising our experiences.

258
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:51,678
Loudness setups, more granular audio sliders.

259
00:22:52,898 --> 00:23:00,882
Back to Patrick, when he realized that he had literally damaged his hearing, he wrote a little piece of Windows software.

260
00:23:01,102 --> 00:23:02,202
He's a programmer, too.

261
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:07,465
And what this piece of Windows software did, again, the game he did was a five-on-five tactical shooter.

262
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:33,449
Which means that unless you win There are long periods of the game where you're just spectating right you die you're out of this round until the next round And he realized hey when I'm spectating after I've been killed I'm still hearing the game at this full volume and so he simply wrote a piece of software that detects when He is dead

263
00:23:34,718 --> 00:23:39,823
And it literally reached into the Windows system volume and lowered the Windows system volume by like 15 or 20 decibels.

264
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:46,608
And then when his software would detect that he was no longer dead and active in the game, it would bring it back up again.

265
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:52,474
So things like that might be something, you know, that was something he implemented so that he could practice.

266
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:57,478
He can't use that kind of software in a tournament, but when he was practicing, he would use the software such that

267
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,723
He could still get the experience, but only when he wanted it.

268
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:06,907
He didn't need that high volume dose when he wasn't even active in the game.

269
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:07,868
So things like that.

270
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,512
If you are an educator, definitely call to action for you all.

271
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:13,913
There's lots and lots of areas.

272
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:23,642
We could sit down and think of 15 to 20 either undergrad or master's thesis projects, things like listening habit studies.

273
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:53,362
the effects of left level on an in-ear SPL and you know what if we make our logo screens louder or softer how does that affect how loudly people play their games user behavior for different all sorts of studies that kind of could be done so if you're an educator and you have students who are interested in hey I might want to publish a paper that you know how we call this talk how to get a paper referenced by the WHO in three easy steps just make it about hearing health and video games

274
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:59,835
I can't guarantee anything, but boy, that will be read by the WHO within days of it being published.

275
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:06,897
Another call to action, be nice to your own ears.

276
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:14,879
What this graph is, is what's called TTS, or temporary threshold shift.

277
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,761
So when we expose ourselves to loud sounds, like

278
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:27,724
I remember being 22 years old and mixing my band in the studio, and it was cranked up, and it was rock and rolling.

279
00:25:27,744 --> 00:25:28,504
It was really fun.

280
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:36,286
After loud exposure to sounds drastically changes the frequency response of our ears.

281
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:40,087
So this is 115 dBA, which is pretty loud.

282
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:44,369
That's a loud band at a club, but for just 20 minutes.

283
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:45,989
After that,

284
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:54,066
You've got a 50 decibel notch at 3 kilohertz, which totally is going to screw up your mixes.

285
00:25:54,646 --> 00:26:08,452
And even 24 hours later, that top green one, even 24 hours later, you've still got 6 or 8 or almost 10 dB of a notch in your hearing a full 24 hours after going to a concert.

286
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:14,234
So yeah, long sound design mixing sessions, excessive levels will distort your hearing.

287
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:15,635
So take care of your own hearing.

288
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:22,973
You know, many mixers and so on never go anywhere without earplugs.

289
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:28,236
You mix, you're really loud in your mixing session, the next morning you come and listen to your mix, like, why is it so bright?

290
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:35,341
Well, it's bright because while you were mixing at the end of the night, you had a giant notch in your high mids there.

291
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:41,064
So if you are interested in this topic, drop me an email.

292
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:44,747
This goes straight to my inbox, hearing at gamesoundcon.com.

293
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:50,069
And with that, I'll open it up to any questions anybody might have.

294
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:58,761
Yes, please walk up to the microphone so that the folks at home can have a chance.

295
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:02,365
And we've got like four minutes for questions before we take it to the walk-up room.

296
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:02,626
Yes.

297
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:04,302
Hi.

298
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:06,104
Thanks so much for putting those in this presentation.

299
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:20,574
I'm just curious with regards to VR headsets like the Quest 3, the in-headset speakers, it's going to be very difficult for them to produce low-frequency information.

300
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:30,741
And as we discussed today, or as you discussed today, gamers like to hear, or everyone likes to hear that low-frequency information to make it feel good.

301
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:47,665
What would be the best practice to help reduce the chances of harm from players trying to boost the volume on their headset speakers to get that sensation?

302
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:49,526
Yeah, that is a great question.

303
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,428
And my guess is I saw Scott's cell phone out here.

304
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:54,391
My guess is there is like half of a team at Metta working on that.

305
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:59,096
Getting low frequencies out of small transducers is challenging.

306
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:04,101
And we do want to try and make sure our systems aren't designed such that people overcompensate.

307
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:08,608
for not having the low end by just cranking it up really loud.

308
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:11,591
There have been some attempts to work at this.

309
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:17,297
One is use of things like max space technologies, missing fundamental phenomena and so on.

310
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:20,881
But yeah, there's no perfect solution for that right now.

311
00:28:21,942 --> 00:28:24,545
So yeah, it's a great question.

312
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:26,667
And it's a creative challenge that we need to solve.

313
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:27,828
OK, thanks a lot.

314
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:33,542
Again, thank you so much for all of this information gathered in one place.

315
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:57,908
I'm curious what you or the WHO might be doing with eSports tournament organizers or leagues who will often put on a secondary set of headphones on top of the in-ears that a lot of the competitors are using for communications or in-game sound in order to blast white noise or pink noise at them to mute the audience, basically.

316
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,484
Yeah, that's a great question.

317
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:21,737
If you're in an eSports tournament, first of all, you're probably wearing deep in-ear monitors, over the top of which you're wearing acoustically, minus 30 dB things, to which they sometimes pipe in white noise so that the gamers don't get an advantage by listening to the shoutcasters, the announcers announcing the thing.

318
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:29,840
That is definitely something the WHO is looking at trying to have some more safety standards around for players, because it's not healthy for players.

319
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,242
Now, the only mitigating factor is that that is a pretty small scenario.

320
00:29:35,262 --> 00:29:41,165
It does not happen in the context of numbers of human beings playing video games at loud volumes.

321
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:42,786
It's a very, very small thing.

322
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:48,148
But it's definitely one of the things that they're working on, and it's probably one of the reasons Patrick's hearing got as bad as it was.

323
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:52,345
I think we've got time for one more question before we take it up to the wrap-up room.

324
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:52,985
Yes?

325
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:54,325
Hi.

326
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:11,032
From what I remember, the monitoring standard for speakers is around 85 decibels, at least for film and TV.

327
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:11,513
Yep.

328
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:34,813
and I'm not sure if there is one for headphones, but I was just wondering if in order to protect your own hearing and make sure that your mixes are as good as possible without the effects of

329
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:43,302
losing like having that notch effect that you were talking about.

330
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:52,893
Would you recommend a revision to that standard and or a different

331
00:30:55,035 --> 00:31:17,976
Behavioral change in terms of when you're mixing like Doing like a one-hour session here and there rather than a two-hour session like like wood spacing it out help Any long-term effects during during the week when you're working on a project

332
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,590
Yeah, it's a great question.

333
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:24,032
I definitely would not go as far as tell the entire audio industry that they should change their mixing level standards.

334
00:31:26,412 --> 00:31:30,134
That said, taking breaks is an important part of the mixing process.

335
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,274
Again, it gives your ears a chance to rest.

336
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,576
So 80 decibels is the recreational.

337
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:41,357
85 is actually the occupational, so if you're working.

338
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:47,459
And that said, again, when we mix to 85, that's kind of where dialogue level we want to have.

339
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:47,939
it's

340
00:32:06,568 --> 00:32:06,648
you

341
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,824
has enough softs versus louds that I don't see that as probably being an issue, as long as you take breaks.

342
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:39,251
Yeah, you need to give your ears a rest, not just for your hearing, but for your profession so that we're not making mixing decisions based upon the colorization because of TTS.

343
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:40,912
It's temporary threshold shift it's called.

344
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:42,773
So thanks so much.

345
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:44,734
Thanks for showing up and being interested in this topic.
