1
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:06,180
Hey, my name is Tim Keenan.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,723
I made a game called Duskers, which this talk is about.

3
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:11,586
Before that, I made a game called A Virus Named Tom.

4
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:14,228
Before that, I worked at DreamWorks Animation

5
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:17,292
for 10 years, making everything from Shrek 2

6
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,454
to How to Train Your Dragon.

7
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:22,217
And before that, I worked at a AAA game studio

8
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:23,818
called Rainbow Studios down in Phoenix.

9
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:26,683
And that's about it.

10
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,004
So this talk is called Finding Duskers,

11
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:30,325
as you guys can see.

12
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:33,606
And the reason that I named it that is because

13
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:35,606
I think that the process that I went through

14
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:38,728
when I was making this game was a little less traditional

15
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:40,288
that you go through a design process

16
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:42,749
where you have your design doc and you have all these ideas.

17
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:44,330
And it was more about finding the game

18
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,190
and discovering what it was.

19
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,291
And you'll see that there's like benefits and detriments

20
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,292
to the way of doing that.

21
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,272
But it worked out for me,

22
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:53,373
so I figured I would go over that with you guys.

23
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:58,117
So I guess the first question is, what is Duskers?

24
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,639
So Duskers is a game where you pilot drones

25
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,640
into derelict spaceships to try and figure out

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,742
why everybody's dead.

27
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:07,404
And I didn't want to play the entire trailer for you,

28
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:09,146
but I figured I would give you just a little bit

29
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:11,027
of gameplay footage here.

30
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:11,348
If, oh, no.

31
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:13,810
We're gonna do this.

32
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,535
So that's not as sexy as the trailer but I didn't want to make you guys watch the full trailer.

33
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:50,237
But that just gives you kind of a quick idea. You're piloting those drones and you're the drone

34
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:56,121
operator and you're dropping motion sensors and doing all these things to not die. So that's all

35
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:59,663
great. I made a video game. That's awesome. Why do I get to stand up here? What makes Duskers

36
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:04,546
interesting? There are a couple really weird things that came about in the design process. We

37
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:08,609
added a command line interface to the game. We don't have a soundtrack.

38
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:11,570
and we kind of made a real-time strategy game

39
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,430
that defies almost every convention

40
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,371
for real-time strategy games.

41
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:16,951
And it's not that I intended to do this.

42
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:19,332
This isn't part of my original design,

43
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:20,232
and as a matter of fact,

44
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:21,993
if you had told me I was gonna do this,

45
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:26,094
I would have been like, oh God, what have I done?

46
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:27,635
But it actually ended up turning out okay,

47
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,156
and the reason why is because this was all part of the game,

48
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:31,776
this is what I was listening to about the game,

49
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,077
and the game led me here.

50
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,577
And this talk is gonna kind of show you guys

51
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:36,518
how in the world we ended up here and why.

52
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:43,342
So the game was well received. A lot of people really liked it. And this slide is a little bit

53
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:49,786
easier. All of these represent some kind of end of the year award or game of the year, best of

54
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:54,349
2016, what not. You'll notice down here in the corner we are nominated for excellence in

55
00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:00,113
design. So if tomorrow, even if this talk is bad, if you guys could just like cheer and come to

56
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,494
the IJF ceremony when Duskers is called out, that would be great.

57
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:09,617
So, when we got all of these things, all these awards and accolades and stuff like that, it was great.

58
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:11,819
And I was trying to figure out, like, what did we do right?

59
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,663
And I think the two things I heard the most were these two words, is innovative and cohesive.

60
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:21,086
Not in these words exactly, but a lot of times we'd get, like, I've never played anything like this,

61
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:24,949
and everything in the game, the atmosphere in the gameplay, and the sound design,

62
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:28,012
and everything just kind of fits together in this, like, perfect whole.

63
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:29,693
And that, I think that's what we did well.

64
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:34,757
And I think the reason we did it well was because of the design process that we went through.

65
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:38,220
And this is sort of the three things that I want to talk about.

66
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,422
The ugliest slide you'll ever see at GDC.

67
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:44,846
But, before we get into that, I noticed that design pillars was in every single one of them.

68
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:48,529
And everyone might not know what in the heck I'm talking about when I say design pillar.

69
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,551
So really quickly, what is a design pillar?

70
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:56,315
So the notion behind a design pillar is it's something about your game that's like super core,

71
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:58,637
and everything in the game should sort of revolve around it.

72
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:00,399
And actually that's why I designed pillar

73
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,940
as kind of a weird bad word

74
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,242
because it to me is kind of emblematic

75
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,423
of this process that we have.

76
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,545
That's really good for some games and not for others

77
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,567
whereby you would erect these pillars first

78
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,949
and then you would build the game.

79
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,650
And I'm gonna show you guys that I didn't do that.

80
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,931
I was just sort of building the game

81
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,453
and then I would discover a pillar

82
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:16,454
and then I would kind of put it up.

83
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:18,776
So traditionally, like I'm saying,

84
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:20,697
they're established before production,

85
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:24,360
and they kinda use features and high level mechanics.

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,622
And the caveat here is that I'm not dissing on this,

87
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:28,163
I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing.

88
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:30,886
This is really good for games in established genres,

89
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:32,907
around tight deadlines, and I'm gonna say,

90
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,769
a lot of AAA games where you've got a budget,

91
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,910
and you've got a team, and a lot of burn,

92
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,991
and you can't just like, wander around

93
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,153
and think about feelings and stuff like that,

94
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:41,814
you really gotta kinda do these things.

95
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,875
So they're definitely not bad.

96
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:42,915
So,

97
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:47,577
I went on the internet and I googled design pillars

98
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:49,498
and I clicked on the first video,

99
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,098
because I'm a researcher.

100
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,439
And this is what came up.

101
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,119
It's actually a good video,

102
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,439
but he was giving an example of what design pillars are,

103
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,020
and this was a game, this was a beat-em-up,

104
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,721
kind of Double Dragon style,

105
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:03,341
and we've got arcade style,

106
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:05,802
we've got non-linear branching stage progression,

107
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:08,002
and we've got local and online multiplayer.

108
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,143
And for me, and you'll see as this talk goes on,

109
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,063
this stuff is kind of dry.

110
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:17,806
I mean, I'm not really super inspired to make a game that's just non-linear.

111
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:19,547
And I've never heard a friend come up to me and be like,

112
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:22,789
Oh my god, you gotta play this game, it's non-linear.

113
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,770
And so, I kind of feel like if you're gonna make a game

114
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,132
and this is gonna be the heart of your game,

115
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:29,933
it's gonna kind of shine through.

116
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:33,355
So these things should be way cooler, right?

117
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,916
So then, again, I googled and tried to find a design doc,

118
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:39,038
and I found what I think might be Assassin's Creed 2,

119
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,118
I don't know, this isn't official.

120
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:45,020
But fight navigation social stuff. This wasn't bad. This is a little bit better

121
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,923
But again this seems like you know these features on the back of the box and not something that's like going to inspire me

122
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:55,425
And I'm going to be able to tell my team about necessarily so I guess that starts to beg the question

123
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:58,066
What did duskers do differently like what did we do and real quick?

124
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:01,928
We created design pillars throughout development

125
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,509
rather than at the beginning,

126
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:06,571
so that I could kind of feel the game and have it evolve.

127
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:09,453
We had design pillars that were emotions and feelings

128
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,654
rather than features and mechanics.

129
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:12,815
And I'll tell you why I did that.

130
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:15,897
And then I think you're supposed to do this anyway.

131
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,278
Stay true to design pillars with every design decision,

132
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,860
but I don't think everybody's as OCD about it

133
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,160
as they could be.

134
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,861
And sometimes that's because there's a marketing guy

135
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:26,103
or there's like, you know, other reasons.

136
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:26,943
But if you're really like,

137
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,745
bat shit crazy about this, it can really pay off.

138
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:33,228
And that can really show, I guess,

139
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:34,989
your artistic intent will come through

140
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,671
even though it's subtle.

141
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:38,832
And this will make sense in a second, maybe.

142
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,714
Beg, borrow, steal, sorry, I forgot about this one.

143
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:43,056
So throughout this talk, I'm gonna kinda name drop

144
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:45,337
a lot of really cool game developers.

145
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:46,959
And that's because what I tend to do

146
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,060
is I just talk to smart people

147
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,742
and then I steal their ideas.

148
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:50,882
So.

149
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:55,187
Given that you're at GDC and you're sitting at a bunch of people at a design talk,

150
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:58,792
it might be good to shake some hands because eventually,

151
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,676
you know, when you're in your own thought process, it's hard to innovate just by yourself.

152
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:07,383
So it's really good to just bounce ideas off of other people and it really works out.

153
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:07,764
It did for me.

154
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:14,697
So, alright, let's go through these things one by one real quick, and then I'll get to examples of how we did this in Duskers.

155
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:19,139
So, creating design pillars throughout development. I call this listening to your game.

156
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,722
So, instead of establishing things up front, what I try to do is I think of it like a dance.

157
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:30,709
I might be sort of leading this dance, but if you've ever done any traditional dancing ballroom dancing or swing or whatever

158
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,391
There's there's a partner there

159
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:37,036
And you've kind of got to feel each other and you've got to kind of go with that flow and especially if you're imagine if

160
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:41,561
You're inventing a new dance right you're gonna step on each other's toes a couple times and things are gonna be bad

161
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,141
but you can't just

162
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:44,003
you know, bulldoze your way through it.

163
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:44,823
You've got to kind of feel it.

164
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:47,745
And so what I felt was is that I listened to Duskers.

165
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:49,426
And as Duskers went on, it was telling me.

166
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:52,328
And I don't mean, I do mean like almost every aspect of this.

167
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:54,949
I don't just mean we sat in front of like some focus testers

168
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,751
and you know, we got some data.

169
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,151
That's really good too.

170
00:07:58,151 --> 00:07:59,532
And listening to other designers,

171
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,034
but some of it is like almost psychological

172
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:02,935
profiling on yourself.

173
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:04,415
You're like figuring out what in the heck

174
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:05,656
you're actually trying to do with this game.

175
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:05,696
So.

176
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,840
have design pillars that are emotions and feelings.

177
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,402
Alright, now this is, I think this is really important, for me anyway,

178
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:17,044
because things can be so much more pervasive than, like, non-linear.

179
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:21,107
Like, imagine if I'm going to my sound designer,

180
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:22,828
and I'm like, alright, this game's gonna be non-linear.

181
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:25,430
Like, what are they gonna come back to me with, right?

182
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,332
If I'm like, this game is all about empowerment.

183
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,362
I think that gives them more.

184
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:31,804
And that can actually start to lead, or anxiety,

185
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:32,465
what have you.

186
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:35,748
You can actually start to use the UI,

187
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,829
and you can give the art direction,

188
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:39,771
and all of those things can feed off of that.

189
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:42,653
And that goes into this whole cohesive thing, right?

190
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,075
Where things start to feel cohesive.

191
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:47,357
It also leaves room to explore different solutions.

192
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,439
This goes into the innovative thing, right?

193
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:52,561
Like if non-linear can be implemented in a couple ways,

194
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:55,303
but if you're trying to implement anxiety, right?

195
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:57,125
There's lots of different ways to do that.

196
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,966
So the odds that you as a designer will come up

197
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,587
with something unique and different

198
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:03,149
because that's who you are, it's kind of greater.

199
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,411
So this will lead to sort of innovation.

200
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,652
And then it also, just by default,

201
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,453
it focuses on player fantasy.

202
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,094
And every game doesn't need player fantasy.

203
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:12,036
I think you can play Tetris without imagining

204
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:14,477
that you are a block or something like that.

205
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:14,597
Or.

206
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,280
the guy that stacks the blocks.

207
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,602
But I do think a lot of games can really lend themselves,

208
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,263
like player fantasy can make them very strong.

209
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:22,885
I think that was a big thing in Duskers

210
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:25,867
is that people really felt like they were a drone operator.

211
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,529
And so I think that when you're talking about emotions

212
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,090
and feelings, that's what you're trying

213
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,211
to get the player to feel.

214
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,413
So if that's your design pillar, that kind of makes sense

215
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:33,574
because it's sort of one-to-one, right?

216
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:37,016
And then finally, stay true to your design pillars

217
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,637
with every design decision.

218
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:40,878
And in the, I don't know if you guys have seen

219
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:43,459
the movie Finding Nemo, but there's a scene

220
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,221
where all these fish are swimming in different directions,

221
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,982
and then they start telling them all to swim down,

222
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:49,443
and they're getting towed up,

223
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:51,604
and then when all the fish start swimming down,

224
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:53,165
they become so much more powerful,

225
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:55,326
and then they basically break the beam

226
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,246
and they get out of the net.

227
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:59,828
Ironic, I worked at DreamWorks and this is a Pixar movie,

228
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:02,449
but when I was at DreamWorks, they said the same thing.

229
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:03,390
I would be working on a shot.

230
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,031
And I would be like, no one is gonna notice this.

231
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,092
I'm spending like two days on, you know,

232
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,273
this thing in the corner and no one's gonna notice.

233
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:11,953
And they were like, yeah, you're right,

234
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:14,494
no one's gonna notice that, but in aggregate,

235
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:15,434
they're gonna feel it.

236
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:16,775
And everything about this movie

237
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,135
is just gonna be visually beautiful

238
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,916
and like that's gonna come across.

239
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,497
And I started buying into that.

240
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,417
And you'll see that I had like a very,

241
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,178
I had some strange, like very esoteric

242
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,959
sort of artistic intents with this game.

243
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,140
And I wasn't overt about them in any one way,

244
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,681
but because every design decision focused around that.

245
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:37,628
it came through and people actually regurgitated that back to me and that was kind of amazing.

246
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:42,317
I don't know, as a designer and as a creative,

247
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,498
it's not often that I can do something.

248
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,160
Usually it's like, oh, did you feel anxiety

249
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,700
when you were playing it?

250
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,682
And they're like, yeah, I think I did.

251
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:52,063
That's usually what it is,

252
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:54,305
but I was getting people coming to me,

253
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,325
saying my artistic intent,

254
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:56,966
and that was blowing my mind away.

255
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:57,707
And I think that's why,

256
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:01,910
is because everything revolved around those things.

257
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,951
Let me give you guys a quick example

258
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,932
of a game that was very inspiring to me.

259
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,274
Adam Saltzman and Robin Arnaud made this game called Capsule.

260
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,321
And if this will play. This game blew my mind when I saw it.

261
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:20,948
Everything in this game is working together.

262
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,669
There is a bend of the CRT monitor,

263
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:26,330
there are boops and beeps,

264
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,211
there is a scan line that goes down.

265
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,151
The UI, the sound design,

266
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,292
everything about this game screamed to me

267
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:37,313
that I was in this claustrophobic little bubble in space

268
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,754
and I had this crappy little CRT monitor

269
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:41,954
and my instruments and that's all I had.

270
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:44,375
And this blew my mind and I was like,

271
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,256
if they can do this, then I can do this.

272
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:49,257
you know, and that's when you steal ideas.

273
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:52,559
So, and actually you don't only have to steal ideas

274
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,521
because at the end of the development of Duskers,

275
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,922
I got Robin to come over and help do sound design.

276
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:57,743
So you can steal people too.

277
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:00,124
So there's like a whole stealing,

278
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:02,926
it's like it's endless what you can steal.

279
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:06,028
So I just kind of wanted to use that as a quick example.

280
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:07,509
So now let's get into the fun stuff.

281
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,771
Let's talk about Duskers and how all of this stuff.

282
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:15,333
affected Duskers. So let's just at the beginning of Duskers I had this idea. It

283
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,834
was like you were Han and Chewie and you owed some gangsters money and there was

284
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:22,775
this Bermuda Triangle of destroyed spaceships and you were gonna go in and

285
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,077
basically tomb raid them and there were gonna be tower defense mechanics because

286
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:31,139
you were gonna make sure that as you opened up doors the bad things didn't

287
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:34,920
come out and eat you and so your little drones would you know fire on them and

288
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,061
all and you know so this was originally like kind of the concept and that's the

289
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:39,462
thing this this talk isn't really about

290
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:44,348
Ideation this is kind of like once you're kind of going like how do you find your way?

291
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,690
and so

292
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,794
Not much of this made it into duskers actually

293
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:53,140
As a matter of fact I remember at the beginning of this

294
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,522
in my initial prototype

295
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:58,188
So let's start with the simple premise, right?

296
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:00,510
Piloting drones into derelict spaceships, right?

297
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,053
So what I made initially was this simple,

298
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:05,795
all right, so we're gonna steal more ideas here.

299
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:08,518
So I made this, I jokingly called it boxes in space.

300
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:10,259
It was just cubes with a headlamp,

301
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,082
and you were going through this derelict spaceship.

302
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:15,484
And Randy O'Connor, who did Escape Goat 2

303
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:17,026
and a whole bunch of other stuff,

304
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:18,907
he was playing it, and he was like.

305
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:21,689
And after just a couple minutes, he got done with it.

306
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,350
And he was like, I'm really tense right now.

307
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,671
And his shoulders were up and he was just really tense.

308
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,933
And I was like, wow, that's really impactful for a game

309
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,774
with so little effort into it, right?

310
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:32,415
So I started exploring a lot of things.

311
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:34,916
I started exploring the combat and all that stuff.

312
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,717
And those things would kind of work,

313
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:37,838
but they didn't have that effect

314
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:41,139
that that simple initial prototype had.

315
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:41,980
And I actually remember...

316
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,664
Remember struggling with the the combat system actually and Alex Austin. He's right there

317
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:54,129
Who did gish and he's doing sub-roaster right now. I was like man. I'm really struggling with the combat

318
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,311
Like I don't know what to do, and he was like why don't you not focus on combat?

319
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:57,931
And I'm like what a dick like

320
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:04,503
That's such a jerk answer, but it was so right.

321
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:05,783
And I didn't focus on combat,

322
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:07,504
and actually the game doesn't focus on combat at all,

323
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:10,425
and that's probably one of the best things about the game.

324
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,286
So, steal ideas, people.

325
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,787
So, now that the, so the combat wasn't working,

326
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,328
but the drones were, so let's focus on those drones, right?

327
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:18,768
And moving them around in space.

328
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:21,770
That's when I got the idea, or actually,

329
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,071
I was suggested the idea, and no one will take credit for it.

330
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,031
No one will admit that they did this.

331
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,432
But they were like, what about a command line interface?

332
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,193
And I was like, that's a horrible idea.

333
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:30,593
And then I was like,

334
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:34,025
This is probably my last game, I'm an indie game developer,

335
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,406
why don't I do that?

336
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,066
So I threw in the command line interface,

337
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:39,067
and then the player fantasy started to become

338
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:42,508
about being a drone operator and commanding these drones.

339
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,329
And it was really starting to feel really good.

340
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:49,690
And this is when Pete Angstadt, who did Cannon Brawl,

341
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,951
and he's doing, is it Kingdoms and Castles?

342
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:56,106
Yeah, and he worked on Abzu.

343
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:57,428
So when you're getting design help,

344
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,391
it's not always that you want, yes man,

345
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,434
it's not always people that are affirming your ideas.

346
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,535
A lot of times it's really good

347
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,278
if they think your ideas are shit,

348
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,941
because you have to then justify what you're doing

349
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,323
or change what you're doing.

350
00:15:08,623 --> 00:15:10,724
So he completely crapped all over all of this.

351
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:12,444
He said drones are a horrible idea

352
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,125
because people don't care about drones.

353
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,605
If a drone dies, it's just a piece of metal, right?

354
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:18,966
If it's a scientist or a space marine or whatever

355
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,506
that's a human and they die, people care.

356
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:22,066
So that's a bad decision.

357
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,607
Command line interface, hey man, real time strategy games.

358
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,627
Drag select, right click, that's a convention.

359
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:27,427
Why is it?

360
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,628
It's because over like decades,

361
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,688
people have figured that this stuff works, right?

362
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:33,028
So hey, let's make people type this clunky interface.

363
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:34,089
That's really obnoxious.

364
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:35,129
That's a horrible idea too.

365
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:38,570
a drone operator.

366
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,031
He was like, nobody wants to be Tank,

367
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:42,252
everyone wants to be Neo.

368
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:44,253
This is a Matrix reference.

369
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:46,275
Everybody wants to fly through the air

370
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:47,735
and kick people in the head

371
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:48,856
and shoot them with machine guns.

372
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:51,378
No one wants to be that guy behind all the computers,

373
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:52,819
the operator, right, that you call.

374
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,780
And I realized I wanted to be Tank at that point.

375
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,443
But I was like, so how do I justify all this stuff, right?

376
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:02,844
Like, this was solid.

377
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:03,965
This wasn't him being a jerk.

378
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,286
This was really good feedback.

379
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:07,068
And these were really good arguments.

380
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:08,809
And I had to come up with a justification

381
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,170
or I had to change these things.

382
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,132
I couldn't just be like, oh, I'm just kicking over

383
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,254
design principles left and right because I'm an indie.

384
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:14,514
It's like.

385
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:16,256
you have to actually justify this stuff.

386
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:18,337
And I was like, why am I doing this?

387
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:19,799
Why am I doing all this stuff?

388
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,520
And it goes back to Randy feeling tense,

389
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,183
which was the strongest thing I'd had in the game so far.

390
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,825
And I was like, this stuff feels tense.

391
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,887
Why does this stuff feel tense?

392
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,529
This stuff feels tense because this stuff feels real.

393
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,752
If I hit up on a keyboard and a human moves up,

394
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:39,473
that doesn't happen in the real world.

395
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:41,635
That can happen with a drone.

396
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,176
Using command line interfaces to control robots

397
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:46,637
feels visceral and it feels real.

398
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:48,718
Being a drone operator to me feels more realistic

399
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:50,719
than flying through the air and kicking people in the head.

400
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,243
So, all of a sudden, it's all started coming together,

401
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:57,465
and I was like, that's what it is,

402
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,286
is that this game feels real.

403
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,868
So that became a pillar for me.

404
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,691
And again, that's sort of like a feeling or an emotion,

405
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,694
right, is this realism, that I'm really the drone operator.

406
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,795
So now the question is, all right,

407
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,097
we've come this far with realism,

408
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,460
now I'm talking about how these things can be pervasive,

409
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,621
where do we go from there?

410
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:16,862
How do we take realism and apply it

411
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:17,682
to the rest of the game, okay?

412
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:18,383
No music.

413
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:26,865
I come from a film background, and if you take a soundtrack out of a film, the film sucks.

414
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:32,191
It's like chopping off your legs. I don't know if you've ever watched a scene from a movie and then watched it without the soundtrack.

415
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:38,398
It's amazing how much you lose from that. So this isn't like, oh, I think I'll do this. This is like a strong decision.

416
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,921
But that was my pillar, it was realism.

417
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,342
And music is non-diegetic.

418
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:44,604
And what I mean by that is I don't walk around

419
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,426
and hear a score playing in my head every time.

420
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,608
It would be awesome if when I walked into a room

421
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,610
something like that happened, but it doesn't.

422
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,313
And so it's non-diegetic, and it doesn't fit in my game.

423
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,035
And that was a really scary decision,

424
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:57,617
but I was like, hey, if I'm gonna do it,

425
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:58,758
I'm gonna go all the way.

426
00:17:58,758 --> 00:17:59,979
I already put a command line interface

427
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:00,820
in the game, for Christ's sakes.

428
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,343
So that became a decision.

429
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:07,126
Another thing is that at the beginning of the game,

430
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:09,629
people, I started realizing I have to go further with this

431
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,171
because people were like, oh, I'm the drone,

432
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,195
or okay, now I'm playing as the drone operator.

433
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,037
And to steal another idea, David Rosen,

434
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:18,158
who does overgrowth, was like,

435
00:18:18,158 --> 00:18:20,901
why don't you have the player walk up to a bed of monitors

436
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,743
and sit down and then you zoom in on a monitor.

437
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:23,804
Now they know they're the drone operator.

438
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:25,364
And I liked that at first.

439
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:26,585
And then I was like, no, that doesn't work at all

440
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,346
because then I'm not the drone operator.

441
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,067
I'm playing the drone operator who's already in the game

442
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:32,787
because I'm not moving my head.

443
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:34,528
I'm not in that room.

444
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,629
I wanted your monitor to be your monitor.

445
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:38,629
I wanted your keyboard to be your keyboard

446
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:39,930
because that's real to me.

447
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,851
So what I did was when the game begins,

448
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,471
we'd show a boot screen

449
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,552
because we're letting you know this computer

450
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:46,973
you're sitting in front of is your computer.

451
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:48,973
This is you.

452
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:50,254
You're not playing the drone operator,

453
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,614
you are the drone operator.

454
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:53,815
And so you can see how this is just this notion

455
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,295
of realism is just starting to pervade

456
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:58,496
every molecule of this game, right?

457
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:01,857
Same thing, we originally had this closed circuit TV look.

458
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,778
And actually, and so slam imagery is a lot closer

459
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,698
to what you actually get when you're talking about robots

460
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:07,979
and how they see the world, you know,

461
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,619
casting out dots and doing edge detection

462
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:10,679
and stuff like that.

463
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,480
And I remember tweeting out, like, the comparison picture.

464
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,001
and being like, what do you guys like?

465
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:17,402
And most people like the CCTV better.

466
00:19:17,402 --> 00:19:20,623
At that point, I mean, we changed things a bit from here.

467
00:19:20,623 --> 00:19:24,905
But I was sitting there and I was like, you know what?

468
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,746
Like, that's just not what the game is.

469
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:27,206
That's not real.

470
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:31,248
There's not a camera hovering above the drone, right?

471
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:32,128
I would be getting back data,

472
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,089
and this feels more real to me.

473
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,851
So again, like a strong decision that we decided to make

474
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:39,071
so that everything is going in the same direction

475
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,312
and everything is revolving around this realism pillar.

476
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,213
Right?

477
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,253
So did this come across?

478
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:45,215
I would say that it did.

479
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:47,036
We got so many people, all of our fans,

480
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:49,878
they put on headphones, they turn off the lights,

481
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:50,899
and the monitor is their monitor,

482
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,540
and they imagine they're in a spaceship.

483
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,602
We have some people that'll go down into their basement

484
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,803
or they'll turn off the heat so that they're cold

485
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:59,225
and they have to wear like fingerless mittens.

486
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:00,626
It's crazy, right?

487
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,087
And you can even see in the second quote,

488
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:04,609
they're talking about the lack of in-game music

489
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,691
and how that made them focus on this stuff

490
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:08,492
and made it feel more real, right?

491
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:09,213
So this is something like,

492
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:10,994
How can I convey this?

493
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:12,335
And it got conveyed, right?

494
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,496
It's like you can do this, and it's kind of amazing.

495
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:16,837
It's like a drug.

496
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:18,978
So let's keep going, right?

497
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:21,600
So we've got this realism pillar, so what else can we do?

498
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,521
Piloting drones into derelict spaceships, all right?

499
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:26,743
Let's steal more ideas.

500
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,444
So I was on a plane with Jim Crawford

501
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:29,304
who made Frog Fractions 2.

502
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:31,817
And I was telling him about this game,

503
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,639
and he's like, oh, derelict spaceships.

504
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:35,020
He's like, you know, I don't know if anybody's done

505
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,841
like zombies in space.

506
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:39,163
And I was like, I don't want to do zombies in space.

507
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:41,264
But it made me think about the derelict spaceships.

508
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:43,726
And like, how I'm making a game

509
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:45,807
with all these derelict spaceships.

510
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:48,909
And like, the theming of it just seems a little bit weird.

511
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:51,111
And I also went to a talk that Robin Haneke did,

512
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:53,613
who did Journey, and she's doing Wattam

513
00:20:53,613 --> 00:20:55,214
and Luna right now.

514
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,395
And she was talking about emotions,

515
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:57,255
and she was saying how,

516
00:20:57,535 --> 00:20:58,816
Can we get deeper with our emotions?

517
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,457
Can we not just do like fear and joy?

518
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:03,858
Can we get like at something deeper and more subtle?

519
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:05,759
And that's like a challenge to an indie developer,

520
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,479
especially an arrogant one like me.

521
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:10,161
So I was like, maybe I could do that, right?

522
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,061
And that, so I started thinking about it.

523
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,102
And I was like, what emotion would that be?

524
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:15,943
Cause right now I got Chewy and Han, right?

525
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,063
And it's kind of like a buddy comedy.

526
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:21,285
But really, if they're all derelict spaceships

527
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,305
and people aren't around, that's more like Moon.

528
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,286
I don't know if you guys have seen the movie Moon,

529
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:29,007
but he's isolated on a space station, basically,

530
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:31,067
doing a tour, and all he has is an AI there with him.

531
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,528
And that kind of makes sense.

532
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:35,128
And so I started thinking about it.

533
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,309
And I'm like, all these aspects of the game

534
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,310
that I was talking about before, there aren't people.

535
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,650
There's no one there.

536
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,610
There are robots.

537
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,130
There's a command line.

538
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,951
You're a drone operator.

539
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:52,902
you're alone. This is isolating. So my next pillar became isolation. You could say that's a

540
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:57,768
little bit weirder than fear or joy or something like that. Can I convey isolation to people

541
00:21:57,768 --> 00:22:00,691
when they're playing my game? That would be cool. So let's try.

542
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:05,276
I mean, it's really interesting to start playing with this idea of technology.

543
00:22:05,276 --> 00:22:06,957
It kind of reminds me of Facebook, right?

544
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:10,099
Like where technology enables us to connect to each other,

545
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,661
but then we have like less face-to-face conversations, right?

546
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:16,464
So this technology is enabling you to explore these ships, but it's uncaring.

547
00:22:16,464 --> 00:22:19,186
You put the motion sensor down, it's just like it's red or it's green.

548
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:20,267
It's on or it's off. It's not like,

549
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,648
hey man, look out, there's bad things.

550
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:23,309
It's just like boop, right?

551
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,791
And there's something, there's a disconnect that happens right there, right?

552
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:26,992
And it's kind of interesting.

553
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:27,992
And look at what we have.

554
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,162
We've got a command line interface.

555
00:22:30,162 --> 00:22:31,763
You don't talk to people like this.

556
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:33,604
This is reminding you every time you type in a command,

557
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:34,725
you're not talking to a person,

558
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:37,027
because people you talk to differently.

559
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:38,729
And the slam imagery that I'm talking about,

560
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:40,010
that's not how we see the world.

561
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,951
Remember the closed circuit TV?

562
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:43,913
I mean, it's grainy, but that's how we see the world.

563
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,234
It's like video, right?

564
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,655
We don't see the world like edge detection.

565
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:49,257
So that's reminding you, even when you look at this,

566
00:22:49,257 --> 00:22:51,859
it's like I'm trying to interpret data

567
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:53,120
from something that's not human.

568
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:56,803
nobody here is like me, right?

569
00:22:56,803 --> 00:22:59,686
So it's kind of amazing, all these things already fit in,

570
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:01,948
right, with the realism stuff.

571
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,689
All these things kind of intersected,

572
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,090
so this was a perfect pillar,

573
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,893
so this came up as I was designing the game.

574
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:10,595
But now the question is, okay, can we push things further

575
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:12,297
now that we know about isolation?

576
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:15,219
Can we create things that are interesting like this, right?

577
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:16,220
So here we go.

578
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,844
Alright, we've got drones. Can we make these drones feel more like you're isolated?

579
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:22,605
Can we do that? And I think we can, right?

580
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:26,108
If you've seen movies like Cast Away,

581
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:30,852
I call it the Wilson effect where Tom Hanks has this volleyball and it's Wilson

582
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:33,974
and it's got like this blood hand stain on it or something like that and he talks to it.

583
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:34,234
I'm like...

584
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:39,707
What I have to do is make you act crazy

585
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:42,488
and then realize that you're acting crazy, right?

586
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:43,929
So originally this was gonna be R2D2,

587
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:45,810
like you were gonna tell it to go into a room

588
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,710
and it was gonna argue with you,

589
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,091
it was gonna beep and boop and be like,

590
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,192
you're gonna be like, get in there, right?

591
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:49,892
And it was gonna be fun.

592
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:52,774
But the problem is is that drone has autonomy

593
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:54,075
and intelligence, right?

594
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:54,655
If you're doing that,

595
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:57,476
you kind of have someone to talk to really, right?

596
00:23:57,476 --> 00:24:01,719
So what if I could make it that you imbue the drones,

597
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,959
you anthropomorphize them,

598
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,280
you imbue them with personality?

599
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,722
and you are aware that you're the one doing it,

600
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:09,144
then you would feel crazy, and you'd be like,

601
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:10,385
I need to talk to people.

602
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:13,268
So what we did was we started giving them names,

603
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:14,929
and we gave them call signs that were different,

604
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:16,170
higher pitch, lower pitch,

605
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,852
but it never did that on its own,

606
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:19,693
only in response to a command.

607
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:21,074
But every time you asked it to go into a room,

608
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:22,696
it would give its little tweet, and you'd be like, that's.

609
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,997
That's Ron, right?

610
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:25,897
And that goes into the room.

611
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,078
Also the fact that they only did things

612
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:29,278
that you asked them to do,

613
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:31,999
made this weird pet slash child relationship.

614
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,379
It would go into a room,

615
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:35,060
and if there was something bad in there that attacked it,

616
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,160
it wouldn't run away.

617
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,800
There was no autonomy.

618
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,821
It would just kind of sit there and be like,

619
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:39,961
this hurts, Dad.

620
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:42,442
Why did you put me in this room?

621
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:44,563
And everyone felt really, really bad when they did that,

622
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,063
when they would suck it out the airlock or whatever.

623
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:46,803
They'd be like, oh no, Ron.

624
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:53,751
That was my bad. You were such a good drone, right? And they knew

625
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:57,457
Everybody knew that I did it was them. They were like, this is just a drone

626
00:24:57,457 --> 00:25:02,244
I hit up it goes up, but somehow I love this thing and I'm crazy and that was really important

627
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:09,074
Logs, okay. This is another thing where we're let's talk about realism and isolation, right?

628
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:14,642
If you're if you're not around people all the time, you'll forget it eventually you'll be like I'm playing a video game, right?

629
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:19,810
But if I bring up a log where people are talking you're like, oh wow. Hey, there are people. Oh, but they're all dead

630
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,571
and I'm the only one left.

631
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:24,152
And so it reminds you that you're alone, right?

632
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:25,613
And then the realism part of it,

633
00:25:25,613 --> 00:25:28,794
if there were like NPCs that were talking to you,

634
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,335
that you know, you can't ask them a question

635
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:31,436
and have them talk back.

636
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,257
But if they're in a log, that feels real

637
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:34,517
because someone could have written this

638
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:35,338
and I can't talk to them

639
00:25:35,338 --> 00:25:37,599
because they left the log behind, right?

640
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,160
So this is kind of where both of these emotions

641
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,560
are kind of working together.

642
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,522
And it's so this is part of this like

643
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:46,803
sort of cohesion thing, right?

644
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:47,523
So did it work out?

645
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:49,339
Right?

646
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,600
I mean, I literally have,

647
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,403
like people mention the word isolation in reviews.

648
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:55,945
This guy's talking about tabbing onto Facebook

649
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:58,387
and writing emails in the middle of playing the game

650
00:25:58,387 --> 00:25:59,828
because he felt so alone

651
00:25:59,828 --> 00:26:01,009
and that there wasn't anybody to talk to.

652
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:04,652
Like, that blows my mind, right?

653
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:07,135
That like you can sit here and you can target these things

654
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:09,857
and you can convey them if you make like bold decisions

655
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:10,898
and you stick with those decisions

656
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:13,300
throughout everything that you're doing.

657
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,161
And like people will get it.

658
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:18,064
It's kind of like, I don't know, it's kind of amazing to me.

659
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:21,348
So, I don't know where we are on time.

660
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:22,188
I think we're okay.

661
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:23,810
All right, we're okay right now.

662
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,913
So let me go into, you can not only steal ideas

663
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:29,956
from other designers and your mom and stuff like that,

664
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,818
but the community is totally willing

665
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:33,079
to let you steal their ideas.

666
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,742
So we had radiation in the game,

667
00:26:35,742 --> 00:26:37,023
and it would flood in a room

668
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:38,545
and you would have to get out of there.

669
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:41,506
and players were complaining about it

670
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:42,307
because they were like,

671
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:44,448
oh, I don't know when it's gonna happen.

672
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:46,769
And I'm sitting here thinking about my realism pillar.

673
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,230
And I'm like, when you went into that spaceship,

674
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,070
we tell you that it's unstable,

675
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,211
so you gotta close doors behind you

676
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:54,213
and just get ready just in case radiation floods.

677
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,474
So basically I wasn't listening to them.

678
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,935
But then after they kept whining about it,

679
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:01,576
I was like, I guess whining isn't a good word to use.

680
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:06,098
after they kept telling me about this issue,

681
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:07,458
I was like, you know what?

682
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,959
Everything in the game right now is about planning,

683
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:14,840
is about having a plan and adapting to survive, right?

684
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,641
But when you adapt, you always create a new plan.

685
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:20,742
And so if a monster would chew on the door, let's say,

686
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:23,062
you'd have about 60 seconds to figure out a new plan.

687
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:24,423
That's why the game is real time,

688
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:25,403
is to create that tension,

689
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:26,963
but really it's a strategy game.

690
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:28,584
So the problem with radiation,

691
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,741
was they weren't creating a new plan.

692
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:32,822
The new plan was instant,

693
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:35,284
and it was get out of that room and close all the doors.

694
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:38,005
It wasn't, okay, if any of these rooms

695
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:40,247
flood with radiation right now, what am I gonna do?

696
00:27:40,247 --> 00:27:41,768
Like, let me come up with a plan

697
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:43,168
just in case that happens.

698
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:44,769
So I was kind of violating a pillar

699
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,330
that I didn't even know about,

700
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,111
which was that everything was about

701
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:49,933
having a plan and making a new plan.

702
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,674
And so what I did was I added in an audio cue

703
00:27:51,674 --> 00:27:52,934
of the ship creaking.

704
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:56,896
And then I did a really fun thing where it doesn't always flood with radiation

705
00:27:56,896 --> 00:28:02,138
So that you sometimes you would just freak out you'd come up with a plan and nothing would happen

706
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,979
But a lot of times it would and so now you're sitting there and you hear this thing and there's this Pavlovian response

707
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,480
And then you're coming up with a plan

708
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,622
So that was the community basically telling me because they had played the game more than me what a pillar was

709
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:17,163
So and this came late in development and that most of the things adhered to this

710
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:21,184
But there were a few things that didn't and so I went back and changed them and everybody liked those changes

711
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:24,066
So yeah, so in summary

712
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:29,890
Create I created design pillars throughout development instead of starting with these design pillars

713
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,654
I had these design pillars that were emotions and feelings rather than like features and mechanics

714
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:38,436
And I tried to stay true to those design pillars with every design decision

715
00:28:38,436 --> 00:28:43,760
Even if it made me make decisions that I thought were a little bit crazy, and I feel like that that all paid off

716
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,520
And that's kind of my talk

717
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,750
How are we around questions?

718
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,292
Okay, well I guess we can take about two questions

719
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:04,515
and then the rest we'll have to take in some other place.

720
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:06,436
So, I don't know if anybody has any questions.

721
00:29:06,436 --> 00:29:10,680
Oh man, I thought everything was thoroughly explained

722
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,761
in this talk.

723
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:21,511
That was great.

724
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:27,217
So it sounded like you had a lot of different ideas going

725
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:29,399
through it, but they all seemed really good.

726
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,701
And that might have just been because this

727
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:32,902
was a curated talk.

728
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:36,425
So I'm wondering, the one thing it said you abandoned

729
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:37,526
was the combat.

730
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,489
Was there anything else during the development

731
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:44,072
that you thought was a pillar and then later didn't end up

732
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:45,013
really working out?

733
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:46,403
Yeah, no, there were a lot of things.

734
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:49,827
So that slide, I only added it like literally today.

735
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:51,068
Cause I was like, I didn't talk about all the things

736
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:51,748
that didn't work out.

737
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,749
But if you look at that slide,

738
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,472
like my whole story of like a buddy comedy kind of thing

739
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:56,533
didn't work out.

740
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:57,694
The combat didn't work out.

741
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,217
The tower defense stuff didn't work out.

742
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:01,778
It was just like, it became that it was,

743
00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:02,799
there was an optimal strategy,

744
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,001
which was place your turrets at the pinch points,

745
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:05,482
which are doors.

746
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:08,364
and open the door, you know.

747
00:30:08,364 --> 00:30:10,626
So it was like those things didn't work out.

748
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,548
And those were, I think what happens is that,

749
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,009
I think at the beginning when you're designing,

750
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,190
you need something.

751
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,991
You can't just sit there and be like,

752
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:17,892
you know, what are, so you,

753
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:19,694
it's almost like you just need to pick a direction

754
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:20,834
and start swimming.

755
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,316
And then eventually you'll be like,

756
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:23,397
okay, I'm going in the wrong direction,

757
00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:25,859
but at least I know that I'm going in the wrong direction.

758
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:25,959
Right?

759
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,660
And so I think that's,

760
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,241
initially you just kind of need some stuff.

761
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:30,883
If that answered it, I don't know.

762
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:31,063
Go ahead.

763
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:37,815
So, Duskus has a pretty unusual control scheme.

764
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:39,176
Yeah.

765
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:43,039
And I was wondering, just over the course of development

766
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,523
with testers and then later with players,

767
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:49,245
if you got a lot of kickback on that?

768
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:49,585
Oh yeah.

769
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:54,150
And how did you, I guess, prime your players

770
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,511
or just adjust to that?

771
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:56,972
Yeah, so that was a big thing,

772
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,052
and I actually couldn't believe that.

773
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:59,714
These people invested in my game,

774
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:03,196
and they knew all of these things, which is nuts to me.

775
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,298
But the thing was is that at the beginning,

776
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,159
we kind of, you're kind of afraid of it,

777
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,540
so we put the command line interface in,

778
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,422
but I still had mouse for a lot of other things.

779
00:31:12,422 --> 00:31:13,582
And then eventually, it's just like,

780
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:14,683
make those strong decisions.

781
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:16,764
Eventually, people would grab the mouse,

782
00:31:16,764 --> 00:31:17,365
and they would do things,

783
00:31:17,365 --> 00:31:19,086
and they would want to do certain things with the mouse.

784
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,527
And I kept backing it out and backing it out,

785
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:22,508
and then eventually I was like, we can't have any mouse.

786
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:25,210
Like, as soon as we let them use the mouse,

787
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,730
they're gonna wanna use it for other things.

788
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,812
And right on the beginning, there was just no mouse anymore.

789
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:31,933
Like, the opening menu, we have like, you know,

790
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,274
the bracket with the letter so you can hit it,

791
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:34,254
or you can do up and down.

792
00:31:34,254 --> 00:31:36,295
And that was really important, and that took a while

793
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:37,916
to come up with all of that, even,

794
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:38,417
cause I was just.

795
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,537
I was afraid that it was also development time

796
00:31:40,537 --> 00:31:43,778
because it sounds weird, but most interfaces on PC

797
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:46,758
are using mouse, and so to actually go back

798
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:49,239
and redo it the way that it used to be done

799
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,900
took a little bit of processing and stuff like that,

800
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,500
and things weren't out of the box.

801
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,540
So I kind of wanted to avoid it at first,

802
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,261
but we just kind of had to go all in.

803
00:31:57,261 --> 00:31:59,221
And once we did that, once we made it

804
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:01,702
that the opening menu, you didn't use the mouse,

805
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:02,062
it was fine.

806
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:04,783
Everyone was complaining about it,

807
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:07,063
and then all of a sudden we took it completely away,

808
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,363
and then no one expected it, and it was fine.

809
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:12,948
Well, fine for the kind of audience that would play this kind of game anyway.

810
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:19,316
Alright, those are my two questions, so I guess the others, I guess we'll have to take...

811
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:23,801
Right. Somewhere. In the other corridor. Okay, thank you.
