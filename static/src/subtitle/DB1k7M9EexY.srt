1
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:07,756
So animation.

2
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:13,040
Like what Mike said, it's more of a personal, what we're

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,122
going to do today is not we're not going to be talking about

4
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:17,764
how we do it in the books or how we even learned it.

5
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:20,285
We're going to talk about how we actually do it ourselves,

6
00:00:20,465 --> 00:00:22,547
all the good habits and bad habits of animation.

7
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:26,630
And what makes animation, what makes an animator successful?

8
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,233
The goal for animation, all of us, we

9
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,868
We just want to make an audience believe.

10
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,069
We just want to go out there and fool somebody

11
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:39,431
into believing the performance that you're doing.

12
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:45,693
And when I was preparing for a beginning class

13
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:47,314
not too long ago, and I asked myself,

14
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:49,054
I was like, if I was starting animation

15
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,315
and I didn't know anything about it,

16
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:54,196
someone asked me, what's animation?

17
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:56,957
What do I need to know to get a job in animation?

18
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:58,658
And I said, well, you gotta learn

19
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:00,118
the 12 principles of animation.

20
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:02,903
you know, that's really boring.

21
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:03,904
That's by the book.

22
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:05,505
You know, I said, how would I do it?

23
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:07,167
It's changed now.

24
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:10,429
It's been, what, 60 years since the 12 Principles of Animation.

25
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,691
So I started jotting down notes.

26
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,312
How would I do it?

27
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:14,373
What are the things that I do?

28
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:17,175
And I've got about five pages of stuff.

29
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:18,897
I'm like, oh, man, this is rough.

30
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:20,458
I can't tell my students that.

31
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:23,280
So I started breaking it down into categories.

32
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:29,676
And eventually, I got four categories of animation

33
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:34,419
that I felt was what I would do as an animator.

34
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,019
And again, that's a very personal thing.

35
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,860
I'm sure everybody does it in a different way.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,481
But that's how I do it.

37
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,982
So the four aspects of animation I

38
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:46,204
think everyone needs to know is to become

39
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:49,185
successful as an animator is, so the first one,

40
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:50,506
the creative aspect of animation.

41
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,412
And that's the easiest one.

42
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:54,272
Everyone knows this.

43
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,473
This is when you get the idea.

44
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:56,974
This is when you make your choice.

45
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,716
That's the creative part of animation.

46
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:02,738
Anything you can think of that gets you excited to go into

47
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:05,960
animating, the actual arc, when you're doing an arc, how

48
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,201
do you push exaggeration, how do you push your animation.

49
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:10,643
All this is part of the creative aspect of animation.

50
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,044
The second one is the logical aspect of animation.

51
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:14,465
How does it actually work?

52
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:18,648
So it's important to know if you're doing a lion walking,

53
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:19,208
for example.

54
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:20,649
Can you guys hear me?

55
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,252
If you're doing a lion walking, for example,

56
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:27,555
you can go in there and just make the lion walk

57
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:28,556
just because you have a cat.

58
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:29,757
And you're thinking about it, you're like, yeah,

59
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:30,778
I can push this and push that.

60
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,580
But you've got to know exactly how a lion walks,

61
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,701
because they are really lazy

62
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:36,543
and how they roll their paws when they're walking.

63
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:39,466
All that's part of the logical aspects of animation.

64
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,152
You need to know how things move.

65
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:42,752
That's the science behind animation.

66
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:45,313
The third one is the methodical aspect of animation.

67
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,213
So you get the creative side.

68
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:48,453
You get the logical side.

69
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:50,314
Now, how do you actually do it?

70
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:54,514
How do you actually sit down, open Maya, open Softimage,

71
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,015
open any software that you flash?

72
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:57,775
How do you actually do it?

73
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,435
And that's the tough part, I guess.

74
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:01,316
That's what everybody wants to do.

75
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:03,096
Because the creative side is probably the easiest one.

76
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,016
So that's the methodical side.

77
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:06,617
Then there's the critical side of animation.

78
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:11,108
That's probably the most frustrating part of animation,

79
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:13,589
because this is when you're done with everything,

80
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,791
and you need to look at your stuff critically

81
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:20,714
and tell yourself, is this the best you can do?

82
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:22,715
So I'll be talking about each of them

83
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:25,957
and giving you guys examples of where I've used them

84
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:27,278
and what I do as an animator.

85
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:30,366
So, there's no order to do these.

86
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,147
A lot of what I'm going to say is, you know,

87
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,787
you can actually crisscross that.

88
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:35,708
You can actually, a lot of that stuff, for example,

89
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:36,988
squash and stretch.

90
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:40,129
That's a creative part as well,

91
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,270
because no matter how you exaggerate it,

92
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,250
that's being creative.

93
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,451
How it actually works, the logical aspect,

94
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,031
is because of the weight, you know,

95
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,051
that's why it's going to squash,

96
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,512
because of gravity, all that's part of it.

97
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:51,913
And the methodical aspect is how do you actually do it?

98
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:54,333
A ball will squash, you...

99
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,680
artistically you'll squash the ball, but a human being, you can't squash the bones.

100
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,426
That doesn't work. So human squashing is different than a ball squashing.

101
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,630
So how do you actually do that? That's part of the methodical aspect.

102
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,875
So just a ball squash falls into three categories itself.

103
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:09,358
All right.

104
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,881
So there are no rules to this.

105
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:15,362
There's no secret.

106
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:19,063
There's no magical formula to how to succeed as an animator.

107
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,464
But as long as you follow all four and you try to be as good

108
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:23,724
as you can in all four of them.

109
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:26,265
How many of you guys are already professional animators

110
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:27,246
working in the industry right now?

111
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,167
All right, so you guys already know all that.

112
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:33,308
How many of you guys are aspiring animators who want to

113
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:33,728
be working?

114
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:35,168
Rick, get your hand.

115
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:39,815
How many of you guys don't really care about animation?

116
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:41,876
Awesome.

117
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:42,256
Cool.

118
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:43,577
So we're all good then.

119
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:44,798
All right.

120
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,498
So last year, I don't know if you guys were here.

121
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:47,499
Anybody was here last year?

122
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,059
Awesome.

123
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:55,943
So you guys remember when I talked about a performance from an actor that I really respect,

124
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:57,763
Marlon Brando, and I'm sure you guys know him.

125
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:58,704
You guys know Marlon Brando?

126
00:04:59,224 --> 00:04:59,364
Yeah.

127
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:00,064
He's a cool actor.

128
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:01,705
So he...

129
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,875
He had a performance from the Godfather,

130
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:07,617
I think it was the first one,

131
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:10,739
and I was talking about a little bit how he,

132
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,460
you know, he's a method actor,

133
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,283
he's an actor who acts, you know,

134
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,144
who performs by instinct.

135
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:19,266
And today I'm gonna talk about a different actor

136
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,588
who I really, I really enjoy watching,

137
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,671
and I learned a lot from his performance as well,

138
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,292
but there's a debate out there

139
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:29,353
if he actually was a good actor or not.

140
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:31,655
You guys can, you know, you guys can.

141
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:37,364
talk about that as well. It's, um, I believe he would have been an amazing actor

142
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:41,690
if he had done more movies. Unfortunately he died after doing three films.

143
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,277
That's James Dean, James Dean, you know, known as the bad boy of Hollywood.

144
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:50,646
And watching him, honestly, he lacks maturity in his performance.

145
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:52,308
And you can tell that.

146
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:57,292
But he's an actor who was reacting to whoever was around him.

147
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,595
And that's something which is really important in animation.

148
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:02,277
It's not about just delivering a line.

149
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:05,660
And you see that a lot in animation today, even in professional animation.

150
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,781
A lot of amazing films out there,

151
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,022
there's not quite, there's no acting in there.

152
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:13,524
You're just performing, you're just delivering the line,

153
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:14,484
you're just hitting the notes.

154
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:18,066
So knowing how to react to another actor

155
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:20,227
is incredibly important.

156
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,688
And even though James Dean is not the best actor ever,

157
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:24,949
but he was an actor who was actually reacting

158
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,910
to the other actors.

159
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,331
And I'm gonna show you guys a scene

160
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:29,992
from Rebel Without a Cause.

161
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:30,973
Have you guys seen this film?

162
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:32,593
Anybody?

163
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:33,814
Yeah?

164
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,331
Good, good movie.

165
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:38,835
So this scene.

166
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,981
So, just so you guys know, this movie is about, a lot of it is about honor and not being a coward.

167
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:59,463
Because Jim, who's James Dean in there, his character, so his father, is known in the town to be a coward.

168
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:06,745
And he's trying to shed that away. He's trying to push that away. He's trying to be a bad, you know...

169
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,086
a cool guy, he's trying to be different from his dad,

170
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:11,707
and he's really embarrassed by this.

171
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,509
So this is a scene where he comes back

172
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:14,769
and he just had an accident,

173
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,071
and I think he killed a boy, I think, in that scene.

174
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,633
So he's coming back and his parents

175
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,074
disagree with what he wants to do.

176
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:22,534
So let's just watch this scene.

177
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:27,198
Got it.

178
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:34,222
All right, I got it, I'm almost there.

179
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:37,124
And there's no sound.

180
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:40,645
Yeah?

181
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:48,988
Oh, there should be something.

182
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,088
I think it's going to work.

183
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:55,930
No.

184
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:03,332
Let me try another video just to make sure.

185
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:06,313
Sorry about that, guys.

186
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:08,774
It's what?

187
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:20,771
Yeah, it's plugged in.

188
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,136
Is that just it?

189
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:35,699
Computers.

190
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,340
All right, let's see.

191
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:46,514
Really? Oh, yeah. No, wait.

192
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:51,955
Now it's on 100.

193
00:08:51,995 --> 00:09:01,599
Nope. Help?

194
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,560
Help?

195
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:09,781
Anyone?

196
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:14,323
It's weird.

197
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:16,592
I don't know.

198
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:32,655
Let me just try another video here.

199
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:34,055
Everything's plugged in.

200
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:44,097
Nope.

201
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,606
Sorry guys. Any questions?

202
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,270
Yeah? I'm not as good as James Dean.

203
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,992
Oh yeah, go for it.

204
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:18,739
So the critical aspect, is that like how you can kind of see your own work and react to its plausibility?

205
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,481
Yeah, yeah. So the critical aspect is, I call it...

206
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:27,839
The question is, the critical aspect of animation, is it when you react to your own animation?

207
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:31,943
Yes. It's when you go away from your animation, you look at it with a fresh eye.

208
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:35,967
And that's, I mean, I'm going to talk about that more in detail later on.

209
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:41,352
It's everything that has to do about you analyzing your animation and see if it's actually the right choice that you made.

210
00:10:41,832 --> 00:10:44,995
You know, that comes from your director, that comes from your supervisor, you know, yourself.

211
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:50,943
your peers, anything. Or is it the right thing to do for the actual game or movie? Is it

212
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:55,624
the right choice that you made? That tends to be the most annoying part of animation

213
00:10:55,684 --> 00:11:00,245
because if it happens too late, you have to go back and, you know, change it all and redo

214
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:00,765
the whole thing.

215
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,206
I'm not tearing me loose again.

216
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,086
Well, this is news to me. Just why are we moving?

217
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:06,986
Oh, yeah.

218
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,106
Just why are we moving?

219
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,707
How do I help?

220
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:12,027
Awesome.

221
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:13,628
Yay.

222
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:15,068
Thank you.

223
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:16,799
Thank you.

224
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,242
Feel like Lois Lane right now.

225
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,146
All right, I'm just gonna move this back here.

226
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,168
All right, so let's watch this scene.

227
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,470
There's no sound in the beginning, don't worry.

228
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:35,971
It's all good.

229
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:37,652
Accept yourself.

230
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:39,133
Wait a minute.

231
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:40,293
Accept yourself.

232
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,355
You don't want me to go.

233
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:43,936
No.

234
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:46,625
No, I don't want you to go to the police.

235
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:49,707
There are other people. Why should you be the only one involved?

236
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:52,890
But I am involved. We are all involved.

237
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,653
Mom, a boy, a kid was killed tonight.

238
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,916
I don't see how I can get out of that by pretending that it didn't happen.

239
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:04,618
Well, you know that you did the wrong thing.

240
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,360
That's the main thing, isn't it?

241
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,842
That's nothing. That is absolutely nothing.

242
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:12,945
Dad, you told me. You said you want me to tell the truth. Now, didn't you say that?

243
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:18,895
You can't turn it off.

244
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:20,476
Well, he's not saying that.

245
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:22,218
He's saying, just don't volunteer.

246
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,280
Just tell a little white lie.

247
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:27,782
You'll learn when you're older, Jim.

248
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:32,146
Well, I don't think that I want to learn that way.

249
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,367
Sure, we go too far.

250
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,708
I mean, what do you guys think?

251
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,190
Eh?

252
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:37,751
Eh?

253
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:38,211
OK.

254
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,275
So what's cool about this is, watch how he's, you know,

255
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,536
whenever he's performing, and he's

256
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,443
the change of emotion in him saying, you know, when he's explaining about that boy,

257
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:52,667
you can tell he's, you know, I mean, we're talking about a really old film here,

258
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:55,909
and his performance, when you compare him to actually the two parents,

259
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,651
I'm going to play it again, watch the two parents' reaction to him,

260
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:01,033
watch how they're actually waiting for their lines.

261
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:03,856
They're looking at him, there's no thinking process going on there,

262
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:05,057
but then watch his performance.

263
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:07,218
And like I said, you know, he lacks maturity there,

264
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:09,340
I mean, you can tell after a couple more movies after this,

265
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,041
he would probably be incredible as an actor.

266
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:15,643
But watch his change of emotion when he's about to describe that little boy,

267
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:17,844
how he uses his whole body to describe this.

268
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:21,385
He changes, you know, his whole pose is changing when he's doing this.

269
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:24,847
And then watch when he tells the dad,

270
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:29,368
Dad, you know, speak, you know, didn't you tell me to do this?

271
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,069
And then watch how he goes.

272
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,322
He just uses his whole body and just drops,

273
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:34,863
you can't turn it off.

274
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,765
He says you can't turn it off,

275
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,367
and then he does the gesture.

276
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,028
It's after he said it.

277
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:41,730
If we had that line animation,

278
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,892
you know, let's say we get the dialogue

279
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:46,694
and the audio goes, you can't turn it off,

280
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:49,017
I bet you all of us would go, you can't turn it off.

281
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:49,998
Right?

282
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:51,999
We'll animate on the line.

283
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,782
But the thing about this guy, he says, you can't turn it off.

284
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,839
and the body continues his thinking process.

285
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,001
And that's incredibly important in animation.

286
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:03,103
It's, you know, you find all the good stuff in animation

287
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:06,345
is when the body keeps the performance going

288
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:08,306
and not just you're delivering a line,

289
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:09,046
you're just saying it.

290
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,188
You gotta keep the thinking process going.

291
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:13,349
Let's just watch this moment again

292
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:14,110
and you'll see what I mean.

293
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:23,756
Mom!

294
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,071
Oh boy, a kid was killed tonight!

295
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:31,352
I don't see how I can get out of that by pretending that it didn't happen!

296
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:34,033
Well you know that you did the wrong thing.

297
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,794
That's the main thing, isn't it?

298
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:36,354
That's nothing.

299
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:36,534
That's...

300
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,275
That is absolutely nothing.

301
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,696
Dad, you told me, you said...

302
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:40,136
You...

303
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:42,437
You want me to tell the truth. Now, didn't you say that?

304
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,419
You can't turn it off.

305
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,560
Well, he's not saying that. He's saying, just don't volunteer!

306
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,721
Just tell a little white lie.

307
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:57,202
You'll learn when you're older, Jim.

308
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:00,403
Just look at the mom and the dad, how they are waiting.

309
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,223
They are theater actors.

310
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:04,684
And it's not bad, it's good.

311
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:05,805
But look at the difference between them.

312
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,885
I want to learn that way.

313
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,066
Well, it doesn't matter anyway, because we're moving.

314
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:12,127
You're not tearing me loose again.

315
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,127
Well, this is news to me, just why are we moving?

316
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,128
Oh, do I have to spell it out?

317
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,268
Well, I'm not going to use me as an excuse again.

318
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:17,609
I don't.

319
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:19,969
Every time you can't face yourself, you blame it on me.

320
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:20,670
That is not true.

321
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:24,457
You say it's because of me, you say it's because of the neighborhood?

322
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:24,717
No!

323
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,538
You use every other phony excuse!

324
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,341
Mom, I just once, I want to do something right!

325
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,003
And I don't want you to run away from me again!

326
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:33,083
Dad?

327
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:38,827
This is all going too fast for me, son.

328
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,007
You better give me something.

329
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,509
You better give me something fast.

330
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,210
Jimmy, you're very young.

331
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:46,669
A foolish decision not good wreck your...

332
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:47,550
I love that bit as well.

333
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,890
Dad, he doesn't even turn.

334
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:51,372
It's way more powerful when he doesn't turn to...

335
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:54,113
I mean, you don't have to always be acting to camera.

336
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:55,634
You know, you can spend some more time.

337
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:57,235
Let the audience believe in that character.

338
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,596
Let the audience really feel what the character is saying.

339
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:01,817
That's why this moment is way more powerful.

340
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:03,978
In 10 years, you'll never know this even happened.

341
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:04,599
Dad, answer her.

342
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:06,019
This is awesome.

343
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,841
He's completely dismissing, you know, his mom.

344
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:11,362
And just by lowering his head down,

345
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:13,723
Dad, answer her, you know, and then he just tenses up.

346
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:15,568
just so, so powerful.

347
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:17,250
Just watch this little section again.

348
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,117
I'm too fast for you Sam.

349
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:27,098
You better give me something.

350
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,600
You better give me something fast.

351
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,341
Jimmy, you're very young.

352
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,444
A foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.

353
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:36,585
In 10 years, you'll never know this even happened.

354
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:37,226
Dad, answer her.

355
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:40,188
Tell her.

356
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:43,391
10 years.

357
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,750
Dad, let me hear you answer her.

358
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,550
Look at the dad's performance. There's nothing.

359
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:52,991
Dad.

360
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:03,195
Dad, stand up for me.

361
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:04,975
What a great line.

362
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:09,797
If you guys have seen this movie, this moment is really, really, really incredible when he says,

363
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:13,598
Dad, stand up for me. That's everything. That's everything he's been wanting, you know,

364
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:14,878
that his dad stands up for him.

365
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:21,676
And in this moment, you know, just that slow look up, eye, you know, looking at his mom is just incredible.

366
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:23,397
Watch that movie if you get the chance.

367
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,378
You have some really, really nice stuff in there.

368
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,600
Cool. So that's this performance.

369
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,083
And we're going to watch another one with the same movie, James Dean.

370
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,805
And this is when he gets back home.

371
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:42,689
He returns home and his dad, something just happened.

372
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,270
And watch his reaction there.

373
00:17:57,985 --> 00:17:58,226
Mom?

374
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:01,049
Mom?

375
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:02,350
Hi, Jimbo.

376
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:03,972
You thought I was Mom?

377
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:07,135
Yeah.

378
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,999
Well, the curls out I was getting Mom some supper.

379
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,281
She doesn't feel too well.

380
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:16,745
What'd you do? Drop it?

381
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:17,506
Yeah.

382
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:18,447
She dropped it?

383
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:18,787
Yeah.

384
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,211
Let her clean it up before she sees it.

385
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:31,152
Let her see it.

386
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:32,153
What?

387
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:34,574
Let her see it.

388
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,096
What can happen, she's...

389
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:40,619
Dad.

390
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:42,940
Dad.

391
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:00,864
Don't. I mean, you shouldn't. Don't.

392
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,510
What are you...

393
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,777
It's awesome. I mean, he... he basically...

394
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:14,018
He's talking to his dad, he can't finish his lines,

395
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:16,059
you know, it's all in his body when he goes,

396
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,119
dad, stand, picks him up.

397
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,140
You know, he's basically saying, dad, stand up.

398
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,081
You know, that little breath he takes at the end,

399
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:23,941
he's not finishing any of his lines, you know.

400
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:28,163
So don't be a coward, you know, stand up for yourself.

401
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:29,203
Don't be scared, you know.

402
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:32,905
and he never finishes it. He lets his body do it.

403
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:37,487
Today in movies we see that. We describe everything that we're doing.

404
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:40,528
I mean right now, even in Dragons 2, there's some lines in there that's just

405
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:43,970
like, you don't need to explain this. We get it.

406
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,372
But, you know, I mean producers want to be as clear as possible to five-year-olds

407
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:51,914
and they want to make sure that even kids understand what the movie's saying.

408
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:55,616
Kids are not stupid, they're smarter than we are as adults.

409
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:58,058
We've got to give them credit and then the movie will last forever.

410
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:03,021
When I used to watch movies when I was a kid, I watched again 10 years later,

411
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,683
things I didn't get, it's awesome when you get it.

412
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:09,585
It's, oh, that's awesome, now this makes sense.

413
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:14,028
That's great that this whole discovery process, instead of just feeding me everything,

414
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,670
and then I watch the movie 10 years later and go, yeah, this movie's cheesy.

415
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:18,253
it doesn't stand anymore.

416
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:21,139
So that's the kind of performance

417
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,682
that we're looking for in animation.

418
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,586
If ever you're doing a demo reel and you're sending work.

419
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:28,915
Make sure you have these kinds of change of emotion

420
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:29,935
in your work.

421
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,396
You don't want to just move well.

422
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:35,696
Just your animation moving well is not what,

423
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:37,697
what right now the animation is going.

424
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,737
It probably will change again.

425
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:40,818
It probably will go back to what it used to be,

426
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:44,018
where it was more about the appeal of how it looks.

427
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:46,519
But now, performance is becoming so important,

428
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:47,339
especially in visual effects.

429
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,040
You know, with movies like Rise of the Apes

430
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
and Avatar and all that stuff.

431
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,192
So let's watch another performance by another actor who,

432
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,455
incredible actor, I'm sure you guys will agree,

433
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:01,557
Gary Oldman.

434
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:05,781
He's probably good in every single freaking movie that he does.

435
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:10,165
And I think last year, I probably showed a scene by him.

436
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,089
You know, from a scene that he...

437
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,070
This is a scene from Leon the Professional.

438
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,711
Have you guys seen this?

439
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:23,320
This is one of his early performances and he's playing this guy who's actually on drugs

440
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,606
and you'll see that he's very fidgety a lot, he's moving a lot in this performance.

441
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,268
But just watch his timing in there.

442
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:35,474
Just watch how his body just keeps the thinking process going.

443
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,762
I have a lot of respect for your business, Tony.

444
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:50,344
When you've killed for us in the past, we've always been satisfied.

445
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:55,766
And that's exactly why today is going to be very, very hard for me.

446
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:58,306
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

447
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:06,549
My man was killed right here, on your turf.

448
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:11,370
And the chinks tell me that the hitman was kind of the, uh...

449
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:15,853
Italian type so we figured that

450
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,434
Tony might know something wait

451
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:20,335
There's more

452
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:25,359
You're gonna love this a

453
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:26,179
Few hours later a

454
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,602
Little 12 year old girl comes into my office armed to the teeth

455
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:37,626
With a firm intention of sending me straight to the morgue and you know who came and got her in the middle of the afternoon

456
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:39,247
Right there in my building

457
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:40,968
the very

458
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,101
same Italian hitman.

459
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:51,266
I'm dying to meet him.

460
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:57,410
So, I mean, just that last bit when he's smiling,

461
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,051
I mean, we all know that a smile is when you're happy, but...

462
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:02,226
I mean, he wasn't happy there.

463
00:23:02,386 --> 00:23:03,367
He was being sarcastic.

464
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:07,271
I mean, he was just making fun of the whole situation

465
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,814
of a hitman walking into a police station

466
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:13,218
and taking a girl and leaving and no one stopping that guy.

467
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,063
So his real emotion is that frame right there.

468
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:22,742
After all that smiles, he ends his emotions on this one.

469
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:23,843
It's amazing.

470
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:29,245
Whatever he's saying, whatever his facial is actually doing

471
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:30,406
is not what he's feeling.

472
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:32,167
But it's right after he's done is

473
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,128
when he goes into his real expression, right there,

474
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:36,289
where he's like, I'm going to kill this guy.

475
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:37,849
That's his real feelings.

476
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:41,031
So this shows us that you don't really

477
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:44,172
need to put the emotion right onto exactly what

478
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:44,932
the person is saying.

479
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:50,295
choose different moments to do it because you could be showing another kind of emotion that

480
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:53,277
that person is trying to show. You know, he's trying to scare the other guys, trying to show

481
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:57,199
that he's cool, and many other things that you could do. There's another bit in there that I

482
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:01,482
actually really enjoy is the section where he asks for the picture. Check this out.

483
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:03,203
My man is going to...

484
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:16,767
He grabs onto it, shows it nothing, doesn't say anything, puts it down, hits on the table,

485
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,650
basically saying, check this out.

486
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,835
So my man, so he basically said a lot of things.

487
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:25,924
without voicing it.

488
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,266
And that's something that I do a lot in animation.

489
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:32,631
Whenever I get my dialogue, let's say I have a dialogue

490
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:37,076
that's the guy saying, let's say, random,

491
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:39,238
hey man, how you doing, right?

492
00:24:39,418 --> 00:24:40,199
This is my dialogue.

493
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,243
What I do is I always imagine what the character

494
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,005
is saying before and after.

495
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:48,248
put myself into that mood.

496
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:49,690
So if, let's say, my kid would say,

497
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,432
hey, how are you doing, but I'm upset,

498
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:55,276
I would walk around the room, get into that mode,

499
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:55,797
and just going.

500
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:58,012
I can't swear here, right? No.

501
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,613
I would go, crap, crap. Is that bad? No.

502
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:01,233
Crap, crap.

503
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:03,575
I would go, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,

504
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:05,676
you know, getting the really worst words on that.

505
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:07,477
You know, it'd be crap, crap, crap.

506
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,218
And then I'd say the line.

507
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:11,619
And then I'd keep going, crap, crap, you know.

508
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:15,501
And it gets you into that mode

509
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:18,023
of being that character.

510
00:25:18,223 --> 00:25:19,603
And it really helps me out.

511
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,644
You always add lines.

512
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:22,005
For example, if your character is saying something,

513
00:25:23,265 --> 00:25:23,626
hey man.

514
00:25:24,643 --> 00:25:25,204
How are you doing?

515
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,184
There's a break in the middle.

516
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:28,405
Don't ever leave this break empty.

517
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:29,226
Don't ever do that.

518
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:30,766
Just fill it up with stuff.

519
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:31,567
Say it.

520
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:33,808
Because even if you're shooting your reference

521
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:37,370
and you're looking for a performance to animate,

522
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,430
things you'll do while you're saying it,

523
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,412
you can still animate that without doing the lip sync.

524
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:43,913
Let's say you're saying, hey man, how are you doing?

525
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,294
Let's say you're tired.

526
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:50,096
You say, hey man, how are you doing?

527
00:25:51,346 --> 00:25:52,346
So you voice it.

528
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:54,127
Hey, man, I'm so tired.

529
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:55,247
How you doing?

530
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:58,669
So me saying, I'm so tired, I just,

531
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:02,570
the way I move my head, now if I just take the dialogue out,

532
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,351
I go, hey, man, how you doing?

533
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,713
So that's a thinking character.

534
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,193
That's a character who's actually in the moment.

535
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:11,254
He's actually feeling it.

536
00:26:11,354 --> 00:26:12,194
You voice it out.

537
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:12,854
Just voice it.

538
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:14,275
Just don't do the lip-sync in your animation.

539
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:16,276
But you're keeping the flow going.

540
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:18,657
A lot of animators I see today, they'll go, hey, man,

541
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:21,563
Little hold.

542
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:22,684
How you doing?

543
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:24,365
You know?

544
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,645
So you don't want to be doing this.

545
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,706
You want to really get into your performance.

546
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:29,187
And that's, we'll talk a little bit more

547
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:29,807
about that eventually.

548
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:33,149
So, let me see, what time is it?

549
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:33,809
Okay.

550
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,690
Just gonna move on to a different performance.

551
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,531
So this is one of the last video, I promise.

552
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:40,892
And we'll have, we'll move on to a different thing.

553
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:45,594
So this one is, I don't know if I showed this last year.

554
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:46,995
I love this movie.

555
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:48,496
Anatomy of a Murder.

556
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:49,076
Have you guys seen this?

557
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:50,294
Anybody?

558
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,017
Come on, guys.

559
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:54,639
All right, awesome.

560
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:56,941
So this is an incredible film.

561
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:59,343
I mean, George C. Scott, and I think he probably won the

562
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:01,245
Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this scene.

563
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:02,826
Just watch his performance.

564
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:06,270
He's an actor where, honestly, in that movie, he, I love,

565
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,130
was it Jimmy Stewart?

566
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:07,971
Yeah, it was Jimmy Stewart, right?

567
00:27:09,273 --> 00:27:10,133
Jimmy Stewart's great.

568
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:10,934
He's a good actor.

569
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:12,055
But watch him.

570
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:28,555
Hold on.

571
00:27:32,397 --> 00:27:32,757
It's coming.

572
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,840
I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.

573
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,801
Would you describe this article of clothing to Corfi?

574
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:47,623
They were nylon and had lace up the sides.

575
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:50,485
There was a label in them of the place I got them.

576
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:52,806
The Smart Shop in Phoenix, Arizona.

577
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:53,746
What was the color of the panties?

578
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:55,427
I believe white.

579
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:55,807
You believe?

580
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:58,944
I have white and pink. They may have been pink.

581
00:27:58,964 --> 00:27:59,524
You're not sure.

582
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:02,366
Haven't you checked your lingerie to see which pair of panties is missing?

583
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:03,187
No.

584
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:05,329
When your husband came home late from his work,

585
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,850
you had this little spat.

586
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:08,732
Were you already dressed to go out?

587
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:09,652
No.

588
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:10,593
When did you dress?

589
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,455
After dinner, when he was asleep.

590
00:28:12,475 --> 00:28:15,157
It's been stated here that you were bare-legged in the bar. Is that true?

591
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:16,218
Yes.

592
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:19,761
In your anger at your husband and your haste to get out of the trailer,

593
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,342
perhaps you didn't put on any panties, I...

594
00:28:21,462 --> 00:28:24,365
Objection! Witnesses already testified what you were wearing.

595
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:29,365
So this scene is why I think it's just really beautiful,

596
00:28:29,465 --> 00:28:32,366
is the fact that the whole first part of that shot,

597
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:36,609
he's really drilling his questions,

598
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:40,111
he's really being firm on this, he's looking for something.

599
00:28:40,571 --> 00:28:42,172
And you can tell he's searching for it,

600
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:48,015
he's really, he's asking that lady specific questions

601
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:49,636
because he's looking for an answer.

602
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,057
And right before he gets it,

603
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:57,529
Which is very subtle, you'll see there's a tiny little smile like he does.

604
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:59,350
His muscle basically flexes.

605
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,351
Watch this.

606
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:03,592
It's really tiny, see if I can actually find where it happens.

607
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:05,553
If you guys can see, let me know.

608
00:29:05,573 --> 00:29:08,575
I think it happens somewhere...

609
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:14,958
It happens somewhere right there, and you'll see that's where he actually goes,

610
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:16,539
I got you now.

611
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,081
I had lace up the sides.

612
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:21,882
There was a label in them of the place I got them.

613
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:24,216
The smart shop in Phoenix, Arizona.

614
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:25,176
What was the color of the panties?

615
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:26,897
I believe white.

616
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:27,337
You believe?

617
00:29:28,178 --> 00:29:29,558
I have white and pink.

618
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:30,418
They may have been pink.

619
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:30,979
You're not sure.

620
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:33,800
Haven't you checked your lingerie to see which pair of panties is missing?

621
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:34,660
No.

622
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,921
When your husband came over...

623
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,001
And now, was it there?

624
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:38,101
You guys see it?

625
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:42,763
It is somewhere in there.

626
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:43,904
The thing is, I'm looking at this dagger.

627
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:45,144
Let me go find it first, and then I'll show it to you guys.

628
00:29:45,164 --> 00:29:45,824
Sorry, that's planning for you.

629
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:46,084
I'm not sure.

630
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:46,345
I'm not sure.

631
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:46,605
I'm not sure.

632
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:47,945
I'm not sure.

633
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:48,505
I'm not sure.

634
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:48,806
I'm not sure.

635
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:49,066
I'm not sure.

636
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:49,326
I'm not sure.

637
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:49,626
I'm not sure.

638
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:49,906
I'm not sure.

639
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:55,652
Alright, right there.

640
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:59,714
So right before, right there, you'll see,

641
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,694
right before he says it, there's a tiny little,

642
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,295
he needs to keep his cool.

643
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,796
I mean, he's the guy who's questioning the lady,

644
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:07,937
so he can't just start smiling too early.

645
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:10,598
I got them. The smart shop in Phoenix, Arizona.

646
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:11,659
What was the color on the paint?

647
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:14,480
Right before, his little flex right there of his muscles,

648
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,000
that little detail, and that stuff,

649
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,281
when you get into a close-up shot,

650
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:18,662
these are very important.

651
00:30:18,962 --> 00:30:21,503
You've got to pay attention to all these little details.

652
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:27,206
And what I love is as soon as he knows he gets the lady, now it becomes almost like a dance.

653
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:30,748
Puts his pen in his pocket, he walks away, and you see when he's walking,

654
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:35,970
he just completely arches his, you know, he's just like almost like a lion, really, you know, proud.

655
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:42,294
Yeah, yeah, I got you now, he's walking. The way he grabs onto the, it's almost like a dance,

656
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:47,216
and so well balanced, the contrast in his body. I believe white. You believe?

657
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:50,738
I have white and pink. They may have been pink. You're not sure.

658
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:53,696
Haven't you checked your lingerie to see which pair of panties is missing?

659
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:54,456
No.

660
00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:56,257
And I love his choices of saying,

661
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:57,077
you're not sure.

662
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:58,178
He does hit the note.

663
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:00,019
You know, stuff that we do all the time.

664
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:00,619
You're not sure.

665
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:02,720
But then, there's no note hitting again.

666
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,220
You know, he just, there's no accent anymore.

667
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,301
He just goes into performance.

668
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,102
When your husband came home late from his work,

669
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:08,442
you had this little spat.

670
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:09,623
He knows at this point he's already got the girl.

671
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:10,483
Were you already dressed to go out?

672
00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:11,404
No.

673
00:31:11,684 --> 00:31:12,304
When did you dress?

674
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:13,565
Look at the confidence in his pose.

675
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:14,225
After dinner, when he was asleep.

676
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:14,705
Yes.

677
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,366
So he stated here that you were bare-legged in the bar.

678
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:16,926
Is that true?

679
00:31:17,646 --> 00:31:17,926
Yes.

680
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:23,045
In your anger at your husband and your haste to get out of the trailer, perhaps you didn't put on any panties, huh?

681
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:25,828
Objection! Witnesses already testified what you said.

682
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:28,671
I love that holding, where he's holding onto the jug there.

683
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:31,214
He just leaves it there as he's delivering the line.

684
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,376
Amazing secondary action. I mean, you guys...

685
00:31:33,956 --> 00:31:36,139
This is exactly what we look for in animation, you know?

686
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:38,281
When do you move stuff that's not distracting?

687
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:39,322
It's all part of staging, right?

688
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:42,544
You can't have stuff moving all over the place.

689
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:44,286
The audience, they don't know where to look at.

690
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:47,688
You gotta make sure that you have a focus

691
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:49,530
where the audience's eyes will go.

692
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,951
For example, in a shot like this,

693
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:53,332
if he was just doing too many things at the same time,

694
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,514
you won't know where to look at.

695
00:31:55,634 --> 00:31:58,116
Right now, this jug thing

696
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,058
becomes a secondary action completely.

697
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:01,218
You're not paying attention to it.

698
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:02,920
It's part of his performance.

699
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,221
You're always looking at the face.

700
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:09,586
And that kind of stuff is tough to do in animation, and I don't think he was actually thinking about all this.

701
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:10,567
He just performed it.

702
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,849
After dinner when he was asleep.

703
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:14,571
It's been stated here that you were bare-legged in the bar, is that true?

704
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:15,572
Yes.

705
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:18,466
In your anger at your husband and your hastiness...

706
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:21,808
He was... So he got into a pose, delivers the line.

707
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,590
You're not looking at that, you're looking at his performance.

708
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,772
Then he stops, puts it down, delivers the line again.

709
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:31,834
It's so well balanced and I don't know if he was actually planning this. He might have.

710
00:32:31,974 --> 00:32:33,455
I don't think he was.

711
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:34,996
Perhaps you didn't put on any pantyhose either.

712
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:36,097
What's your action?

713
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:36,337
Anyway.

714
00:32:36,682 --> 00:32:37,522
This performance is awesome.

715
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:39,603
Go watch this.

716
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:42,305
So this is all part of that creative aspect of animation,

717
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:43,546
you know, when you have to study.

718
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:46,127
You need to go find performance out there

719
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:46,968
that you really enjoy.

720
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,329
See why it's really good.

721
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:51,350
Find the things that you need to add in your own performance.

722
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,392
Because when you get a shot, you're

723
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:55,513
not going to go pick a movie and go, all right,

724
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:57,474
I need to study this and do my shot.

725
00:32:57,494 --> 00:32:59,615
You're going to have to perform yourself or find someone else

726
00:32:59,655 --> 00:33:00,456
that can perform for you.

727
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:05,037
So I'm going to show you guys a little chunk, like a couple little shots.

728
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:08,199
I won't show you anything that I showed last year just to make it a little different.

729
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:14,741
So when I was on... what's that movie called?

730
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:16,442
Rise of the Guardians. Anybody see it?

731
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:19,823
Come on. No wonder that movie flopped.

732
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,795
So, I'm going to spoil it for you guys, because it's your own fault.

733
00:33:26,776 --> 00:33:32,139
So, we shot a lot of reference for Jack Frost, and Jack Frost was a very realistic character.

734
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,243
We don't know if that was the right choice to do, because I do believe we should have pushed him a little bit more than what we did.

735
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:46,648
We went a little too realistic, and the reason for that was because we felt his proportions were very tricky to push.

736
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,131
I don't think that was the right way to go, but we went very realistic with him.

737
00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:53,529
So reference shooting was incredibly important.

738
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,590
We needed to get a real performance.

739
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,991
We didn't want to just hit accents,

740
00:33:57,031 --> 00:33:57,892
you know, that would be too easy.

741
00:33:58,932 --> 00:34:01,374
So, you know, I shot, I had this little sequence

742
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,315
where Jack Frost is, sorry,

743
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:09,819
where Jack Frost is, he just got his butt kicked by pitch

744
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,582
and he fell into a hole and he's waking up from that.

745
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:17,984
And so I shot reference.

746
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:22,866
of me waking up from just falling into a hole.

747
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:25,749
And so this is my, I did probably a whole,

748
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,372
maybe a whole four or five hours of shooting reference

749
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:29,193
of myself doing it.

750
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:31,496
And this is one of the performance.

751
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:33,558
Play.

752
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:44,955
So that watch down there, that's Tooth Fairy.

753
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:47,916
That's a little baby Tooth Fairy that was there.

754
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:49,757
And we just put a watch there to represent this.

755
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:53,199
So Jack is supposed to wake up, then notice the baby tooth,

756
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,800
and then go to that baby tooth.

757
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,647
So anyway, so that was the first performance that I did, and that was the best one I got.

758
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:13,089
So as soon as I showed it to a group of animators, they were all laughing.

759
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,430
I was like, what?

760
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,771
What's so funny about it? Because, dude, you look like an old man.

761
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,669
So I was like, alright, well, you know, I got to reshoot reference.

762
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:22,411
So I did maybe another couple hours of shooting reference.

763
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:24,153
I just couldn't get out of the whole old man thing.

764
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:26,015
Um, you know, that's who I am.

765
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:29,398
So I had to find someone else to do this for me.

766
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,521
You know, if you can't do it yourself, you know, if you have a shot where there's a character doing Kung Fu

767
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:35,463
and you don't know Kung Fu, well, you have to find somebody who can do it.

768
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:37,245
Or you find a video that does it.

769
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:41,488
So I had to find someone else that actually can, you know, has, you know, a young...

770
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:43,670
He's 10 years younger than me. No wonder he would be better.

771
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:50,639
So I got Jacob to do it for me, and he basically did,

772
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:55,320
we did about 15 takes, maybe about 20 minutes,

773
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,121
and I got about three takes that actually worked really well.

774
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:00,302
So this was the first take.

775
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:07,124
Yeah, much more energy, much better.

776
00:36:07,544 --> 00:36:08,264
Second one as well.

777
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:13,266
And the third one.

778
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,980
Alright, so when I got these three, I was like,

779
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,141
alright, these are the good ones.

780
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:23,742
When you shoot your reference now,

781
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:26,304
you don't just take one reference and you copy it.

782
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:28,706
You don't want to do this.

783
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,849
You find a good reference, you find what you like about it,

784
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:34,651
and for the most part, there's never a perfect reference.

785
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:37,414
You'll never shoot reference and just get the one take

786
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:39,596
that rules them all, you'll never get that.

787
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:45,678
You'll get a few takes, you'll get one thing you like in one take, one thing you like in another.

788
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:50,700
And then you have to actually take it, break it into pieces, and then use things that you like.

789
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:57,302
For example, in that first one, I really like his head accent that he did when he notices a baby tooth.

790
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:02,490
In the second one, I really like the way he slides his butt back right there.

791
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:05,054
I really like that, that he didn't do in the first one.

792
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:06,617
I was like, oh I can use this.

793
00:37:07,037 --> 00:37:11,324
In the third one, I really like the way he put his hand onto his forehead.

794
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:14,013
he doesn't quite touch the forehead,

795
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,595
and I think I pushed it more in my animation

796
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:16,315
to touch the forehead.

797
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:19,398
So I basically grabbed these little moments that I like

798
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:21,460
in all these performances and put it together.

799
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,683
And then, you know, I kept working on this.

800
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,085
So I didn't do, in this sequence,

801
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:30,929
I didn't do Baby Tooth.

802
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:33,631
I only did Jack Frost in this sequence.

803
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:36,274
And Baby Tooth was done by Joe Bowers.

804
00:37:37,014 --> 00:37:41,259
So, as you can tell, you know, I use the hand, you know, to touch the forehead.

805
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:44,403
I use the energy of the body going forward.

806
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:48,147
Sorry.

807
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,390
All I can do is keep you cold.

808
00:37:51,484 --> 00:37:56,327
So in that movie we were trying not to hit accents and we were trying our best and I think that was our mistake.

809
00:37:56,367 --> 00:38:01,130
We went the other way. There's hitting accents which is bad and then there's not hitting at all.

810
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,292
We were trying to stay away from hitting too many accents.

811
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:09,676
And I think that was a big mistake because we were losing a lot of animation.

812
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:13,799
When you're animating, you want to animate. You want to just push things and move things around.

813
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:16,581
This movie we were too tame. We didn't do enough.

814
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:19,163
On dragons, I think it got a little better.

815
00:38:19,223 --> 00:38:20,684
I think we were pushing things a little more.

816
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:24,186
But I still feel things look a little too realistic

817
00:38:24,206 --> 00:38:24,887
from time to time.

818
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:26,468
That's why we have motion capture, right?

819
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:28,529
So we don't have to be doing realistic performance.

820
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:30,651
We need to, when we animate, let's animate.

821
00:38:31,912 --> 00:38:34,334
So this little chunk is an example

822
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,816
of how we would take a performance, break it up.

823
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,758
And here's another example of this is a group of friends

824
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,239
and I get together.

825
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:42,860
We got together.

826
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:45,078
to shoot tons of reference.

827
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:50,022
And basically what we did is we just put the dialogue away.

828
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:52,023
Like I never shoot with dialogue in the background

829
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,425
because whenever you shoot dialogue in the background,

830
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,226
you pay attention.

831
00:38:56,387 --> 00:38:57,568
You're waiting for your cues.

832
00:38:58,068 --> 00:38:59,529
And I'm sure everyone, we all do that.

833
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:00,790
And I learned not to do that.

834
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:03,893
Whenever you're shooting reference, don't ever,

835
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:04,754
I'm going to pause it there.

836
00:39:05,574 --> 00:39:07,576
Whenever you, this is really, really important.

837
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:08,577
Whenever you're shooting reference,

838
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:09,758
and I think I said that last year,

839
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,900
Don't ever put the dialogue playing in the background

840
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,740
and then you're trying to act to the dialogue,

841
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,300
to the audio.

842
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,041
Honestly, this will hurt your performance

843
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:21,221
way more than it helps.

844
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:23,842
Memorize your dialogue, remember it.

845
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:26,282
Get the intent of the audio.

846
00:39:26,662 --> 00:39:28,903
Get the feeling around that audio.

847
00:39:28,943 --> 00:39:30,603
If your character's saying, hey man, how you doing,

848
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,024
get into the feeling of, hey man, how you doing,

849
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:35,464
even if you're saying, hey dude, what's up?

850
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,205
It's the same intent.

851
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:41,548
The only thing that will be different is the lip sync, which you can do later.

852
00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:44,731
But the performance, the body performance, will be the same, the same intent.

853
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:49,114
If someone is angry, if you're saying crap, you're saying poop, you're saying whatever you want,

854
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:53,458
it's the same anger that you're saying, so the intent is the same.

855
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:57,461
If you actually have the dialogue and the audio in the background,

856
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:58,923
you're paying too much attention to this.

857
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:01,445
I find animators shooting reference are waiting for the audio.

858
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:02,426
Oh, my time.

859
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:05,024
When you're waiting for the audio, you're not performing.

860
00:40:05,104 --> 00:40:06,986
You're just, whoa, okay, I'm just gonna jump into it.

861
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:09,970
You're putting too much thought, you just be the character.

862
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,614
Don't let, remember the audio, get to know the character,

863
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:15,236
get to know the intent of the scene,

864
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:17,219
and then somebody's yawning, oh, that's bad.

865
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,901
All right, so this is a.

866
00:40:19,845 --> 00:40:22,347
This is, you know, just us, you know, shooting reference.

867
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:24,950
Just, we spent all day doing this, you know,

868
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,191
all day shooting reference.

869
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:29,854
And this was a shot where Jack was telling the guardians,

870
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:31,595
you know, I don't need you guys, you know.

871
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:34,177
You guys don't, sorry, you guys don't want me, you know.

872
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:34,938
Why would you want me?

873
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:37,340
You guys are all about hard work and deadlines.

874
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,242
I'm more like a freestyle kind of a guy, you know.

875
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:40,422
So.

876
00:40:42,717 --> 00:40:44,459
So after doing a whole day of this,

877
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:46,581
I realized that none of it was actually

878
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:47,862
what I was looking for.

879
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,204
Then I spent another day doing this.

880
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,446
And this shot I actually had about a week to do.

881
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:55,148
So we're talking five days.

882
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:03,465
And I spent about two or three days shooting reference.

883
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:05,967
So that leaves me with about two days to animate.

884
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:09,691
And a shot that long could easily take you a week,

885
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:12,734
but we were on very, very strict deadlines for that film.

886
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:18,599
So I eventually did a performance that I enjoyed more,

887
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:21,722
and then I cut it, cut pieces that I actually liked.

888
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:25,534
with what he was supposed to do.

889
00:41:25,554 --> 00:41:27,655
So, you know, as you can tell, you know,

890
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:29,856
I just go in Premiere and just cut little bits and pieces

891
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:31,657
that I actually enjoy and just put it together

892
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,318
and then that's the performance that I'm gonna do.

893
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:36,260
So this shot, I honestly did it in one day,

894
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,761
block it out, show it to the director,

895
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:42,203
he had a big note, and then I had another day to finish it

896
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:43,463
and it went in the film.

897
00:41:43,944 --> 00:41:46,025
So it's not a shot that I look now and I'm like,

898
00:41:46,105 --> 00:41:48,266
oh wow, this shot is awesome, not even close.

899
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,967
I think this shot, you know, needs a,

900
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:53,008
now when I look back, it's like, oh God, this is terrible.

901
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:54,649
But it is what it is.

902
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:58,632
Wait, there's no sound?

903
00:41:58,712 --> 00:42:00,553
Ah, there's no sound on that one.

904
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:00,733
Oh.

905
00:42:00,753 --> 00:42:00,833
Oh.

906
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:03,794
Deadlines, and I'm snowballs and fun times.

907
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,155
I'm not a guardian.

908
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:08,577
So this shot has a lot of problems with it, you know.

909
00:42:08,797 --> 00:42:10,858
Looking at it in hindsight, and there's one problem

910
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:13,860
I'm gonna talk about, you know, later on during this talk.

911
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,341
So this is what it turned out to be, and...

912
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:18,723
Ah, I just closed it.

913
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:21,384
Terrible.

914
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:21,765
So...

915
00:42:23,272 --> 00:42:25,655
This is an example of the creative aspects of animation

916
00:42:26,015 --> 00:42:29,619
where you need to get, you don't need to copy

917
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:33,603
any of your performance, you actually get it together,

918
00:42:33,923 --> 00:42:36,205
take the stuff that you like, and then do your animation.

919
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:36,265
So.

920
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:41,917
Now, Hitting Accent, I know I've been talking about how bad it is,

921
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:46,120
but I've had my finest moment of Hitting Accent, of bad animation.

922
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,803
And there's a lot of great movies out there, very popular movies,

923
00:42:50,223 --> 00:42:53,225
movies that make a billion dollars recently,

924
00:42:53,626 --> 00:42:57,909
that has not very good acting in it, so never let it go.

925
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:01,732
So let me show you guys.

926
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:04,454
I know I love these guys.

927
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:05,234
I love them.

928
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:07,196
They just don't get acting.

929
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:12,947
So this is my finest hour in acting Garfield 2.

930
00:43:13,768 --> 00:43:16,332
And you know, I was learning animation at that time.

931
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:17,113
You know, don't blame me.

932
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:19,357
Play.

933
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:22,662
You do realize I'm a cat, don't you, sir?

934
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:28,324
Do you realize I'm a cat, don't you, sir?

935
00:43:28,604 --> 00:43:29,584
Hey, great arcs.

936
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:31,505
I mean, great squash and stretch.

937
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,586
No freaking acting in there at all.

938
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,227
I'm just hitting accents, you know?

939
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,448
There's nothing in there.

940
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:37,929
It's just me going, hey, you do.

941
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:39,029
There's nothing.

942
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,891
Honestly, when I did this, I was like, yeah, I'm awesome.

943
00:43:41,931 --> 00:43:42,811
I'm working on movies.

944
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:44,692
But do I get animation?

945
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:45,273
Not really.

946
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:47,935
It's only when I got to Weta is when I actually learned,

947
00:43:48,015 --> 00:43:49,016
you know, learned animation.

948
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:51,118
I remember my first week at Weta,

949
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:53,401
I was doing a shot and I was all proud of it.

950
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:54,642
I was like, look guys, I can animate.

951
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:56,104
And all the guys were like, oh, you're so cute.

952
00:43:56,124 --> 00:43:57,505
You think you can animate?

953
00:43:57,785 --> 00:43:59,427
This guy just finished Lord of the Rings and King Kong.

954
00:43:59,467 --> 00:43:59,927
They get it.

955
00:44:00,428 --> 00:44:02,670
So, you know, it took me a while to understand,

956
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,913
you know, it's not just about the motion animation.

957
00:44:04,973 --> 00:44:07,896
It's, you know, it's very, wow, it's already time.

958
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:08,216
All right.

959
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:11,916
I have three more aspects to talk about.

960
00:44:13,037 --> 00:44:15,879
So, you know, it's important to get that

961
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,062
performance is not just moving on screen, you know.

962
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:20,523
It's more than just that.

963
00:44:20,883 --> 00:44:22,084
All right, so how much time do I have?

964
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:24,986
20 minutes? Oh, awesome.

965
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:26,988
We've got five minutes each.

966
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:31,872
So, let's move on to the logical aspects of animation

967
00:44:32,232 --> 00:44:34,694
and how things happen.

968
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:37,596
Sorry guys, I just need to find where I am.

969
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:39,774
Questions?

970
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:48,719
When you go back on your old work,

971
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:49,139
Yep.

972
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:53,141
Do you ever feel that you can learn more from it?

973
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:55,403
Like let's say you do do dragons too,

974
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:58,985
will you ever like go back to your old work in guardians

975
00:44:59,085 --> 00:45:01,066
and be like, I could have done that better,

976
00:45:01,086 --> 00:45:03,167
I could have done that better in reading it,

977
00:45:03,227 --> 00:45:04,548
try it out and like note it down?

978
00:45:05,592 --> 00:45:07,633
Oh dude, yeah, all the time man, all the time.

979
00:45:07,713 --> 00:45:10,115
And honestly, we do that, that's what makes us better.

980
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:11,636
That's the whole critical part of it.

981
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,637
You know, you want to look at your work

982
00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:16,539
and see what wasn't working and what works.

983
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,160
As an artist, you probably will figure out,

984
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,441
you know, after one year,

985
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:20,681
you look at stuff you've done before,

986
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,202
there's none of it that you actually really like.

987
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:23,503
And that's good.

988
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,605
You know, it's harsh because you tend to become someone

989
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,246
that you can't appreciate what you do,

990
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:30,067
but it's important.

991
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:31,608
It's good and bad, because it's important

992
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,229
because you always want to get better.

993
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,851
If you find an artist who goes,

994
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,055
I'm good, I'm awesome, I don't need to know anything else,

995
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,659
that person is not going in the right direction.

996
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,441
You always want to be critiquing your own work

997
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:45,365
and make sure that you're getting better from that.

998
00:45:45,685 --> 00:45:46,927
So yeah, we always do that.

999
00:45:47,147 --> 00:45:49,270
We can't go back to it, movies are already out in theaters, right?

1000
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,253
But we try to in the next film to do that.

1001
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:54,730
Like right now, Kung Fu Panda 3, we're learning from the second one,

1002
00:45:55,191 --> 00:45:57,894
and we're going to apply what we've learned in the second one to the third one.

1003
00:45:57,994 --> 00:45:59,836
Same for Dragons. Dragons was a little different because

1004
00:46:00,597 --> 00:46:05,382
the characters grew up, you know, they're different physically as well.

1005
00:46:06,804 --> 00:46:08,405
We had to approach it in a different way.

1006
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:09,967
They were not little kids anymore.

1007
00:46:10,007 --> 00:46:11,448
They were teenagers at that point.

1008
00:46:11,488 --> 00:46:14,291
So already there, we had to change.

1009
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:15,492
We were forced to change it.

1010
00:46:15,872 --> 00:46:17,554
But a movie like Kung Fu Panda, we're not forced,

1011
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,455
because they're not growing up.

1012
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:19,556
They're still the same characters.

1013
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:20,977
But that's when we learn.

1014
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:22,559
We learn from previous films what we did wrong,

1015
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:23,680
what's working, what's not working.

1016
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:26,903
So the logical aspects of animation,

1017
00:46:29,468 --> 00:46:32,910
Why do things happen? The science behind it is extremely important.

1018
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,673
Before you can break the rules, you have to know what these rules are.

1019
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:39,155
And that's logical aspects of animation.

1020
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:42,197
That's the one we underestimate as animators or any artist.

1021
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,160
We just start, I just want to do a character running around.

1022
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,802
You just go into it. I just want to animate a character jumping.

1023
00:46:48,262 --> 00:46:51,584
You don't know how this character, what's the physics behind it, you actually do it.

1024
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:53,426
And you just use whatever you already know.

1025
00:46:54,387 --> 00:46:55,868
You kinda know how a person jumps,

1026
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:57,930
but you don't know exactly how the foot will twist

1027
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:58,771
when they're jumping.

1028
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:00,933
These little details, you can only see it

1029
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:03,695
when you actually shoot reference and you see it happen.

1030
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:06,718
So I was, again, we're gonna go back to Rise of the Guardians

1031
00:47:06,738 --> 00:47:09,441
because that's where I did a lot of that

1032
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:11,583
adding stuff later on to it.

1033
00:47:12,123 --> 00:47:13,985
I was working on this shot where Jack

1034
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:15,587
was flying for the first time.

1035
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,790
And in this shot, he,

1036
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:24,523
He just, he was learning, you know, he just woke up.

1037
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:25,983
I don't know if you guys saw Rise of the Guardians.

1038
00:47:26,003 --> 00:47:27,204
He just woke up and he's running around

1039
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,924
and he just gets taken by the wind and he's flying.

1040
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:32,245
And he's a little out of control, you know.

1041
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:33,705
He's not quite knowing what's happening.

1042
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,145
He's not fully out of control, he's a little bit.

1043
00:47:35,726 --> 00:47:37,806
And when I got the shot, I just jumped right into it.

1044
00:47:38,186 --> 00:47:39,466
Creative aspect of animation.

1045
00:47:39,486 --> 00:47:41,007
I just went into it and just started animating it

1046
00:47:41,127 --> 00:47:42,307
without any kind of knowing.

1047
00:47:43,187 --> 00:47:44,748
I did a little bit of YouTube.

1048
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,790
I went on YouTube and looked at people gliding, flying.

1049
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,291
I was like, all right, that's good enough.

1050
00:47:48,391 --> 00:47:49,192
I can just jump into it.

1051
00:47:49,572 --> 00:47:51,333
And I did a pass at it, and it looks something like this.

1052
00:47:51,353 --> 00:47:55,496
Oh, oh!

1053
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:55,617
Oh!

1054
00:47:55,637 --> 00:47:55,677
Oh!

1055
00:47:55,697 --> 00:47:55,737
Oh!

1056
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:55,797
Oh!

1057
00:47:55,837 --> 00:47:55,897
Oh!

1058
00:47:59,379 --> 00:47:59,419
Oh!

1059
00:47:59,439 --> 00:47:59,479
Oh!

1060
00:47:59,499 --> 00:47:59,539
Oh!

1061
00:47:59,559 --> 00:47:59,599
Oh!

1062
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,621
So that was my first pass at it.

1063
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:03,682
And when you look at this, at this moment right there,

1064
00:48:04,043 --> 00:48:05,144
he's too much in control.

1065
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:06,785
You know, he got to a place up there

1066
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:09,587
that he's a little too, almost superman-ish.

1067
00:48:09,607 --> 00:48:11,028
You know, he's gliding a little too much.

1068
00:48:11,048 --> 00:48:11,508
He's a little too...

1069
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:14,390
So when we all look at it, we're like,

1070
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,751
no, it's missing a little bit of that out of control.

1071
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:19,472
And I tried to go in there and do it on my own,

1072
00:48:19,492 --> 00:48:20,593
but it wasn't looking right.

1073
00:48:20,973 --> 00:48:22,154
So what I did is I had to go in

1074
00:48:22,254 --> 00:48:23,354
and shoot a bunch of reference.

1075
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:26,196
And I just got it onto a stool, a broken stool,

1076
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:30,538
and tried to put myself out of balance.

1077
00:48:30,738 --> 00:48:32,058
But I wasn't falling, right?

1078
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:33,059
So to put myself out of balance,

1079
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,119
I put the stool far away.

1080
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,180
Then I tried to run to it, jump on it,

1081
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,721
and try to get out of balance.

1082
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,682
That's really dangerous to do, so just so you know.

1083
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,719
I fell a couple times, I don't think I kept any of that.

1084
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,781
I would just run, try to jump on it, get in bands,

1085
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:48,143
just to find all that, and that's me really trying

1086
00:48:48,163 --> 00:48:50,685
to keep in bands, that stool was really broken.

1087
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:51,986
Coulda hurt myself.

1088
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:55,368
But all these little things, these little trying to

1089
00:48:55,568 --> 00:48:59,511
not fall, this is the mechanical,

1090
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:02,153
this is the logical stuff that you don't think of

1091
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:04,414
as the artist, as the artist you just want to have

1092
00:49:04,514 --> 00:49:07,196
nice arcs, but this little sharp motion,

1093
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,837
this is stuff that when you see it, you go,

1094
00:49:08,998 --> 00:49:10,298
oh yeah, I gotta add this in there.

1095
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:13,436
And this is the stuff that actually I went back

1096
00:49:14,296 --> 00:49:16,357
and added that again in my animation.

1097
00:49:18,617 --> 00:49:21,578
And eventually it looked like this.

1098
00:49:21,598 --> 00:49:27,120
Oh, sorry for the sound.

1099
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,681
So you see I've added more of the arms,

1100
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:35,822
you know, trying to catch himself,

1101
00:49:35,882 --> 00:49:37,842
and eventually it worked out really well.

1102
00:49:37,922 --> 00:49:39,363
I mean, not really well, but better.

1103
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:45,591
So, yeah, so you can later on add stuff to your animation.

1104
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:47,472
You can actually go the artistic way first.

1105
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,633
Be creative, start putting stuff,

1106
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,635
and then later on go and find stuff that's not working.

1107
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:53,775
Don't be scared to do this.

1108
00:49:53,795 --> 00:49:56,036
Don't get attached to your work when you've done a shot.

1109
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:57,837
Always remember, you can go back,

1110
00:49:57,877 --> 00:49:59,558
you can come back to it, add more stuff to it.

1111
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:07,841
So, here's another example of that logical aspect,

1112
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:08,462
but also,

1113
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:12,431
Oh, people are leaving already.

1114
00:50:12,451 --> 00:50:14,812
I'm going to mix the logical aspect of animation

1115
00:50:14,832 --> 00:50:16,053
with the methodical aspect of animation.

1116
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,115
How you think about it, how it works,

1117
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:21,256
and how do you actually make it happen.

1118
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:24,978
So, on Avatar, the first shot in production,

1119
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:26,018
I don't know if you remember that, Keith,

1120
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,239
was this shot.

1121
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,111
This was the first shot in production.

1122
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:34,653
And there's no sound, so that's good.

1123
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:37,776
And we didn't have any motion capture for this

1124
00:50:37,836 --> 00:50:40,318
at that point, and it was just all key framed,

1125
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:42,700
and we were learning, this is the first official shot,

1126
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,262
and it was at that point just me and my animation director.

1127
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:49,066
And we were focusing on the eyes in this shot.

1128
00:50:49,106 --> 00:50:51,307
We needed to make sure that Netiri's eyes

1129
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,370
were feeling alive, because that's the biggest problem

1130
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,033
in full CG feature animation,

1131
00:50:57,473 --> 00:50:58,674
is the fact that the eyes look dead.

1132
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:03,639
And Andy Jones, who was my animation director,

1133
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,420
he's also the animation director on Final Fantasy,

1134
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,380
The Spirit Within, so he knows about Dead Eye.

1135
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,161
And he knows really well.

1136
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,762
So when he came to Avatar, he was like,

1137
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:16,643
I have to make sure this doesn't happen again.

1138
00:51:17,043 --> 00:51:18,784
So we sat down and we tried to figure out

1139
00:51:18,944 --> 00:51:20,224
how do the eyes work.

1140
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:28,368
And as we were learning this, you know, I would sit down and really focus on eye motion.

1141
00:51:28,408 --> 00:51:33,350
And we would do a lot of eye tests, and I realized that you can actually break the eye motion into three sections.

1142
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,211
The first section is the actual looks that you do.

1143
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:40,972
You actually, I want to look at over there, so I turn my eye and I look there.

1144
00:51:40,992 --> 00:51:41,813
I want to look over there.

1145
00:51:42,153 --> 00:51:46,174
These are the actual you yourself telling your brain, telling your eye where to look.

1146
00:51:46,495 --> 00:51:47,195
That's the first part.

1147
00:51:47,255 --> 00:51:48,295
The second part is eye darts.

1148
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:49,536
When you look at something...

1149
00:51:50,488 --> 00:51:53,310
You never just look at the thing as a whole.

1150
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,290
When you look at something, for example,

1151
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,431
let's say you look at a tree.

1152
00:51:57,071 --> 00:51:59,552
I did a little 2D animation just to illustrate that.

1153
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:01,813
When you look at a tree, for example,

1154
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:05,494
right, you're looking at a tree,

1155
00:52:05,514 --> 00:52:07,035
heh, you like my little eye blink?

1156
00:52:08,546 --> 00:52:23,811
You're looking at the whole tree, but your eye will actually, from time to time, go to the top of the tree, look at the top of the tree, and then it will look at a branch on the tree, then it'll probably go down at another branch, back at the top of the tree, then it'll probably go to the root of the tree.

1157
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:29,413
And then it will keep doing this, over and over and over, until you're building that picture in your mind.

1158
00:52:30,053 --> 00:52:31,874
That's what causes these eye darts.

1159
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:33,075
So whatever you're looking at...

1160
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:35,595
You never just look at the whole thing.

1161
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:36,975
You guys know that probably.

1162
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:41,376
You look at every bit and pieces on that person,

1163
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:43,177
but that's what creates these eye darts.

1164
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:45,197
So that's the second thing in the eye.

1165
00:52:45,877 --> 00:52:49,558
The third part, the third section of the eye is what we all miss.

1166
00:52:50,178 --> 00:52:54,379
And that's the thing that, honestly, it took me forever to try and figure that one out,

1167
00:52:54,759 --> 00:52:55,819
is eye keep alive.

1168
00:52:56,459 --> 00:52:58,500
How do you make, because you can get the eye dart,

1169
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,280
you can get the eye looks,

1170
00:53:01,093 --> 00:53:04,994
What's missing in all those movies like Tintin and

1171
00:53:05,134 --> 00:53:07,315
Beowulf and all those movies, why the eyes feel dead,

1172
00:53:07,335 --> 00:53:09,255
is because they're missing that eye keep alive.

1173
00:53:09,295 --> 00:53:10,836
And that's extremely important.

1174
00:53:11,256 --> 00:53:13,796
So, as we were playing with it, by mistake,

1175
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:16,197
we were finding something in between these eye dots

1176
00:53:16,217 --> 00:53:17,377
that was keeping the eye alive.

1177
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:19,358
And we're like, wow, why is this working?

1178
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:21,918
And we tried to do it, and it wasn't working anymore.

1179
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:22,978
It was feeling like vibration.

1180
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:24,479
And we're like, no, this is not the right thing to do.

1181
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,959
So I spent weeks trying to figure it out,

1182
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:28,600
how to make it work, like a formula,

1183
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,640
to give all the other animators for them to figure it out.

1184
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:35,362
And eventually I figured out, and that's the methodical aspect, how do you solve that problem,

1185
00:53:36,182 --> 00:53:39,003
is I realized that if you do, if you basically look at a tree,

1186
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:44,986
and you do the eye darts, big eye darts, you use the same animation,

1187
00:53:45,846 --> 00:53:52,428
you squash it, you make it much smaller, and you make it way tinier in terms of the amplitude of it,

1188
00:53:52,788 --> 00:53:53,829
you get your Keep Alive.

1189
00:53:54,549 --> 00:53:57,931
So it's not random, but it is control random.

1190
00:53:58,491 --> 00:54:02,333
It's very important to actually not make it vibrate,

1191
00:54:02,353 --> 00:54:04,734
because that becomes really, really distracting.

1192
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:05,814
So that's what we started doing.

1193
00:54:05,854 --> 00:54:07,595
We realized that if you do eye darts,

1194
00:54:07,935 --> 00:54:10,476
and you tone them down, you speed them up a little bit,

1195
00:54:10,716 --> 00:54:12,237
you get this really cool keep alive.

1196
00:54:12,257 --> 00:54:14,418
Because eye darts, it basically hits something,

1197
00:54:14,438 --> 00:54:16,099
stays there for a few frames, hits something else,

1198
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:17,079
comes back down.

1199
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,100
It's random, but it's also control.

1200
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,400
You never want to go back to a place

1201
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,441
and then come back to the same place.

1202
00:54:21,861 --> 00:54:23,122
That's when it becomes like a vibration.

1203
00:54:23,162 --> 00:54:23,742
You don't want that.

1204
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:25,623
So when we figured that out, we're like,

1205
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:26,844
oh man, this is awesome.

1206
00:54:27,025 --> 00:54:28,446
So this is something that we can start adding

1207
00:54:28,486 --> 00:54:29,347
in all our animation.

1208
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:33,310
So I went back and added this in this shot.

1209
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,533
And we were all happy, it was looking great.

1210
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:38,135
And then as soon as it got rendered,

1211
00:54:38,215 --> 00:54:39,736
motion blur killed all the animation.

1212
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:43,359
So as you can see, the eyes are still dead.

1213
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,622
So it was a learning process.

1214
00:54:46,642 --> 00:54:48,464
We looked at it and went, oh man, motion blur.

1215
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:50,205
Because when you put all this time in motion,

1216
00:54:50,546 --> 00:54:51,346
motion blur kills it.

1217
00:54:52,117 --> 00:54:53,979
So the next shot that I did,

1218
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:58,341
I decided I'm gonna go crazy and put a lot more in it.

1219
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:04,566
And you can see I put probably a little too much in this one.

1220
00:55:07,868 --> 00:55:09,909
So her eyes are moving a little too much in this one.

1221
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:11,570
And I did spend a little too much time on this.

1222
00:55:11,831 --> 00:55:15,413
It still works, but if I redo this shot,

1223
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:16,334
I probably won't put as much.

1224
00:55:16,394 --> 00:55:19,476
But we were learning, and this is all part

1225
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:21,717
of that methodical aspect of animation.

1226
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:28,254
Cool. So then when I got to DreamWorks, we all did it.

1227
00:55:28,314 --> 00:55:30,535
You know, we were all doing tests, you know, eye tests.

1228
00:55:30,555 --> 00:55:34,658
For example, I did a tooth fairy test, you know, with just my eyes and, you know,

1229
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:37,180
showing how this method, how...

1230
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,762
If you look at my eyes, you look at the animated one,

1231
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:41,983
there's a difference every time my eye actually stops.

1232
00:55:42,003 --> 00:55:45,406
If you look at tooth fairy, her eyes keep moving even though my eyes stop.

1233
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:47,687
Realistically, your eyes will stop.

1234
00:55:48,568 --> 00:55:50,790
But if you do this in animation, you get the dead eye feel.

1235
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:53,552
That's the whole thing is animators go,

1236
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:55,393
I've done exactly what my eyes are doing.

1237
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:56,074
That's the problem.

1238
00:55:56,094 --> 00:55:58,315
In animation, you have to push it a little bit

1239
00:55:58,335 --> 00:55:59,276
because it looks dead.

1240
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,558
A lot of stuff goes on top of your animation, just kills it.

1241
00:56:02,899 --> 00:56:04,600
So adding that little keep alive really

1242
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,862
keeps your eye from feeling dead.

1243
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:09,844
That make sense?

1244
00:56:10,744 --> 00:56:10,945
Yeah?

1245
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:11,485
Cool.

1246
00:56:12,766 --> 00:56:16,709
So here's another example of that methodical aspect.

1247
00:56:17,368 --> 00:56:34,754
Let me just turn this one off. So many videos. Sorry guys, give me one second. Questions?

1248
00:56:40,135 --> 00:56:44,017
I don't remember. Keith, were they rigged? Yes, they were rigged.

1249
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,113
So you're saying that I didn't animate that?

1250
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:53,837
Alright, so,

1251
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:58,880
Rise of the Apes, that's another one that I learned

1252
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:03,383
a lot in terms of how to, oh, is it there?

1253
00:57:07,005 --> 00:57:10,487
So this is a shot, hopefully it will play in real time.

1254
00:57:11,448 --> 00:57:14,390
So in this shot, which was actually a really simple shot,

1255
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:15,070
I thought it would be.

1256
00:57:16,081 --> 00:57:18,162
is when I got that shot, it was basically

1257
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:19,803
Caesar coming back from, again,

1258
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:21,164
there was no motion capture on this one.

1259
00:57:21,644 --> 00:57:23,705
A lot of the shots, a few of the shots that we had

1260
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:26,326
on Rise of the Apes, the motion capture data

1261
00:57:26,346 --> 00:57:28,607
was just not working, so, but we had the video

1262
00:57:28,647 --> 00:57:30,068
of Andy Serkis doing the performance.

1263
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:33,090
So we were able to, so we were able to actually,

1264
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,691
you know, use his videos and match the videos

1265
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:37,252
to actually get his, you know, his motion.

1266
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:39,793
And when I got this, I was like, ah, easy,

1267
00:57:39,813 --> 00:57:41,154
I'll just copy whatever Andy did.

1268
00:57:41,854 --> 00:57:42,455
I said, I'm done.

1269
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:44,796
I was like, that's a couple days of work and I got it.

1270
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:47,037
So I did it, took Andy's performance,

1271
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,518
copied it to my animation, I was like, done.

1272
00:57:48,538 --> 00:57:49,478
Then I looked and I was like, wait,

1273
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:51,740
that looks like a guy in a monkey suit.

1274
00:57:52,524 --> 00:57:53,826
it just didn't look right.

1275
00:57:54,466 --> 00:57:56,388
And if his body felt too light,

1276
00:57:56,468 --> 00:57:58,610
I was like, something in this is not working.

1277
00:57:59,331 --> 00:58:01,533
So, you know, Andy's proportion,

1278
00:58:01,573 --> 00:58:04,235
he has human's proportion, not quite like Caesar,

1279
00:58:04,255 --> 00:58:06,177
you know, way bigger, you know, torso,

1280
00:58:06,597 --> 00:58:07,698
much bigger shoulders.

1281
00:58:07,939 --> 00:58:09,680
So when Andy's moving, he's, you know,

1282
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:12,002
he was acting ape, you know,

1283
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,604
he wasn't, he's not an ape, you know,

1284
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:14,364
he can't quite do it.

1285
00:58:15,285 --> 00:58:18,969
But, you know, again, all credit, in terms of performance, this is all Andy's performance.

1286
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:22,391
I mean, the look away, that's all his stuff, that I just pushed the timing, you know, to make it work.

1287
00:58:22,472 --> 00:58:25,274
All credit goes to him in terms of acting. I did not shoot any reference for this.

1288
00:58:26,315 --> 00:58:27,816
But, so...

1289
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:31,394
I started watching chimps walk.

1290
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:33,936
When they walk, they really move their bodies.

1291
00:58:34,276 --> 00:58:34,896
That's what we all do.

1292
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:35,516
We all know that.

1293
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,878
If we have to act, Abe will do this, right?

1294
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:39,278
So we all do this.

1295
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:41,380
So I decided, artistically, I'm just gonna grab this

1296
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,300
and add this to that.

1297
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,341
I just started doing this to it when he stands.

1298
00:58:45,202 --> 00:58:46,162
It looked too cartoony.

1299
00:58:46,282 --> 00:58:47,783
It just didn't work.

1300
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,884
The more I was putting side to side,

1301
00:58:50,445 --> 00:58:51,585
the more cartoony it felt,

1302
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:54,947
and I was fighting my creative side and my logical side.

1303
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:56,868
I was just fighting to just get the right thing.

1304
00:58:57,689 --> 00:58:59,951
So, even though I was watching videos, like, I just couldn't get it.

1305
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:05,395
So, we went to the zoo to actually do some reference shooting of chimps.

1306
00:59:06,316 --> 00:59:09,479
And one of the videos that we had, there was this alpha chimp that was,

1307
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,944
there was a trainer feeding the alpha, feeding the chimps apples.

1308
00:59:15,725 --> 00:59:18,527
And the alpha chimp was there and he got an apple, he cut the apple,

1309
00:59:18,947 --> 00:59:21,229
and then this little baby chimp jumped and grabbed the apple and left.

1310
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,172
He looked at the little baby chimp go, he looked back and he goes,

1311
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:27,202
You know, he'll ask for another.

1312
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:29,383
And that shot, we actually used it in Rise of the Apes.

1313
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:30,524
We actually did that in there.

1314
00:59:31,124 --> 00:59:33,685
And so, the way he moved was amazing.

1315
00:59:33,705 --> 00:59:35,006
The way he shifted his weight,

1316
00:59:35,786 --> 00:59:37,907
he's, basically he did side to side,

1317
00:59:38,047 --> 00:59:39,828
and then he just stops and asks.

1318
00:59:40,308 --> 00:59:41,709
His weight did not keep going.

1319
00:59:41,749 --> 00:59:44,510
It just stopped, and he was so stiff and rigid.

1320
00:59:45,391 --> 00:59:47,812
And it's not something that I would do as an animator.

1321
00:59:47,832 --> 00:59:49,353
I was like, I don't know if I would do that.

1322
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:50,153
It feels too rigid.

1323
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:51,754
And I tried it in here.

1324
00:59:51,774 --> 00:59:55,015
Oh, it's choppy.

1325
00:59:59,540 --> 00:59:59,940
Getting in?

1326
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:05,002
So if you look at when he walks in, he shifts to the...

1327
01:00:05,522 --> 01:00:05,642
Oh!

1328
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:07,222
Oh!

1329
01:00:08,523 --> 01:00:09,003
Terrible.

1330
01:00:14,025 --> 01:00:14,845
Oh, do I need to do that?

1331
01:00:15,265 --> 01:00:15,705
Okay.

1332
01:00:18,186 --> 01:00:19,286
Okay, that's going to be a...

1333
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:25,208
Yeah.

1334
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,769
It's hard. I can't see it.

1335
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:29,250
Yeah.

1336
01:00:30,613 --> 01:00:30,973
Warmer?

1337
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:33,414
Nope.

1338
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:35,395
Yeah.

1339
01:00:37,797 --> 01:00:38,037
Yeah.

1340
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:42,739
Yeah. Yeah.

1341
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:46,941
Like it?

1342
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:51,264
All right, here we go.

1343
01:00:52,404 --> 01:00:54,986
You know what? I'm gonna make this smaller because this is too big. Let's see.

1344
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:58,487
Oh my God.

1345
01:01:02,977 --> 01:01:03,337
All right.

1346
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:05,058
Anyways, you guys believe me, right?

1347
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,038
Yeah.

1348
01:01:06,118 --> 01:01:06,819
Yeah.

1349
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:09,220
This is not going to be easy.

1350
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,881
I can't get to the bottom of it.

1351
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:15,603
All right.

1352
01:01:15,623 --> 01:01:16,263
Let's watch this again.

1353
01:01:16,283 --> 01:01:18,144
Maybe hopefully this will work.

1354
01:01:18,164 --> 01:01:18,985
It's the slow computer.

1355
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:21,846
Let's go.

1356
01:01:22,506 --> 01:01:24,627
It's right at the very beginning of it when he moves.

1357
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:26,608
And he goes to the left, and then he

1358
01:01:26,688 --> 01:01:27,749
stops when he goes to the right.

1359
01:01:30,927 --> 01:01:32,829
Left, and he just stops.

1360
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,672
So that harsh stop is what actually I learned

1361
01:01:35,813 --> 01:01:37,154
watching an ape doing it.

1362
01:01:37,855 --> 01:01:40,017
And I tried that in there, and really,

1363
01:01:40,037 --> 01:01:44,162
I got that really strong, powerful feel of an ape.

1364
01:01:44,842 --> 01:01:48,686
And so this is an example of how you have that battle

1365
01:01:48,726 --> 01:01:50,648
between the creative aspect where you just want to keep.

1366
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:53,250
You just want to keep all that overlap going,

1367
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,110
which looks really animated, looks great,

1368
01:01:55,151 --> 01:01:57,811
but does it fit in a movie like Rise of the Apes

1369
01:01:57,852 --> 01:01:58,872
where it's very realistic?

1370
01:01:59,172 --> 01:02:01,053
Because you have to think about it,

1371
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:04,194
is not animation, different styles,

1372
01:02:04,394 --> 01:02:05,334
you have to mix.

1373
01:02:06,795 --> 01:02:08,876
You can't mix styles if it's a realistic film.

1374
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,237
Whoa, five minutes left.

1375
01:02:11,257 --> 01:02:15,059
If you're realistic film, you have to do a different style

1376
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:15,419
of animation.

1377
01:02:15,439 --> 01:02:16,019
All right, let's move on.

1378
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,340
So methodical aspect of animation,

1379
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,061
how do you actually do it?

1380
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:22,202
So I talked about the eye, us learning how to do the eye

1381
01:02:22,222 --> 01:02:22,823
darts and stuff.

1382
01:02:24,383 --> 01:02:27,345
Another thing that I do actually is I never

1383
01:02:27,405 --> 01:02:28,685
show the eye performance.

1384
01:02:30,526 --> 01:02:30,907
Where is it?

1385
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:33,169
Whenever I'm shooting my reference,

1386
01:02:33,189 --> 01:02:34,389
whenever I start my animation,

1387
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:35,810
I always start it without the eyes

1388
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:37,671
because eyes are distracting.

1389
01:02:37,711 --> 01:02:39,111
As an audience, that's what you look at.

1390
01:02:39,491 --> 01:02:40,732
You know, you always look at the eyes.

1391
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,373
So, as an animator as well,

1392
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:44,773
if you have the eyes on,

1393
01:02:44,834 --> 01:02:46,074
if you're actually looking at the eyes,

1394
01:02:48,595 --> 01:02:50,376
it's very distracting whenever you're animating.

1395
01:02:50,796 --> 01:02:53,577
So, for example, this is the same shot

1396
01:02:54,377 --> 01:02:55,878
with the face turned on

1397
01:02:55,978 --> 01:02:57,639
and there's no animation in the eyes.

1398
01:02:58,379 --> 01:02:58,739
Check this out.

1399
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:03,919
Sorry, the sound is broken.

1400
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,283
So I bet you everybody was looking at his eyes, right? At the facial.

1401
01:03:09,964 --> 01:03:13,967
No one was paying attention to the body and that's because the eyes are so distracting.

1402
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:17,971
So when I'm animating, I actually turn off the eyes and it really, really helps me out.

1403
01:03:19,644 --> 01:03:20,745
All right, let's move on.

1404
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:23,347
So, what else?

1405
01:03:24,288 --> 01:03:25,208
What else?

1406
01:03:25,609 --> 01:03:27,630
Methodical aspect, we can move on.

1407
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:29,031
Critical aspects of animation.

1408
01:03:29,452 --> 01:03:30,973
So this is probably, like I said,

1409
01:03:31,033 --> 01:03:32,374
the most important aspect of animation.

1410
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:33,975
You need to come back with a fresh eye.

1411
01:03:34,535 --> 01:03:37,397
And, you know, in a studio, you don't have that luxury.

1412
01:03:37,638 --> 01:03:40,900
You can't quite just take a break from your animation

1413
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,001
and come back in a couple days.

1414
01:03:42,581 --> 01:03:46,724
You have to actually pay, really pay close attention

1415
01:03:47,145 --> 01:03:48,906
to taking, what was I saying?

1416
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:52,832
Sorry, I just saw the two minutes and I just completely lost what I was going to say.

1417
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,033
You're making me panic there.

1418
01:03:54,993 --> 01:03:56,074
So, what was I going to say?

1419
01:03:56,134 --> 01:03:56,514
Take breaks.

1420
01:03:56,594 --> 01:03:57,915
Take breaks, come back with a fresh eye.

1421
01:03:57,975 --> 01:04:00,336
What I do is sometimes I put a mirror in front of my animation.

1422
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:01,497
It really helps me out.

1423
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:06,240
Sometimes I flick my animation and most importantly, you ask your friends to come and look at your work,

1424
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,161
you know, give you ideas, you know, helps you out.

1425
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:10,502
Is there music that's going to play when I have to go?

1426
01:04:10,682 --> 01:04:11,243
Cool.

1427
01:04:11,563 --> 01:04:12,223
So I can keep going.

1428
01:04:12,643 --> 01:04:19,187
So, you know, here's an example of, you know, things that I talked about that Jack Frost shot.

1429
01:04:20,372 --> 01:04:27,514
where he, at the end there, whenever he floats down from the table...

1430
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:32,475
Why I didn't like that shot was because the director, when he floats down, I asked the director,

1431
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:37,736
do you want him to be floating down with magic or do you want him to fall down like a real boy?

1432
01:04:37,756 --> 01:04:40,937
He goes, I don't want him to fall down like a real boy, it's going to hurt him.

1433
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,497
Falling from that top, it's going to hurt him.

1434
01:04:42,737 --> 01:04:45,758
Or, magically, I don't want this to be too magical.

1435
01:04:46,438 --> 01:04:49,359
So he didn't give me an answer, so I went back to my desk and I was like,

1436
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:50,419
alright, I'll do halfway.

1437
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:52,820
Never go halfway. Commit to an idea.

1438
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,000
When you go halfway, it looks shit like this.

1439
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,441
So, you know, make sure you commit to an idea.

1440
01:04:58,481 --> 01:05:01,022
You know, you go, it's either gonna fall or it's gonna float down.

1441
01:05:01,042 --> 01:05:02,622
You commit to it. You want this to be awesome.

1442
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:03,543
I've got one minute left.

1443
01:05:04,423 --> 01:05:05,583
Here's another example.

1444
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:09,625
This is a shot of Jake where we all had to do

1445
01:05:09,685 --> 01:05:10,965
tail animation on the avatar.

1446
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,206
And this was a shot that I did tail animation

1447
01:05:13,226 --> 01:05:14,487
and I spent like about an hour on it.

1448
01:05:14,547 --> 01:05:15,787
I was like, ah, super, super easy.

1449
01:05:16,507 --> 01:05:19,028
And I sent it through and people were laughing about it.

1450
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,289
They're like, Jalil, you can't swing the tail like this

1451
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:22,970
all over the place because we haven't modeled

1452
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,270
anything in between his legs.

1453
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:27,231
So, you know, we can't show anything.

1454
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:29,772
So I had to make sure that I hide

1455
01:05:30,532 --> 01:05:32,473
as soon as he turns around and you're gonna see

1456
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:34,412
There!

1457
01:05:35,093 --> 01:05:36,797
I turn the tail and hide whatever is there,

1458
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:37,940
so you don't see underneath, like...

1459
01:05:38,502 --> 01:05:41,228
So, all that stuff, you know, is stuff that, you know, that...

1460
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:42,030
that you learn.

1461
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:42,812
I need one more minute.

1462
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:46,789
And so right now, a group of friends and I,

1463
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:48,470
we're working on a game, I just need to plug this in there.

1464
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:52,272
We're working on a game, and it's called Deadwood,

1465
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:54,694
and again, this is another one where we had a cool idea,

1466
01:05:55,274 --> 01:05:59,197
and we were doing this little wooden guy,

1467
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:02,018
and the performance was an idol

1468
01:06:02,038 --> 01:06:03,459
when he's just doing his fist like this.

1469
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,200
And we blocked this in, and I was like,

1470
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,041
yeah, this is gonna be great,

1471
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:07,942
this is gonna work in the game, and we can totally do this.

1472
01:06:08,282 --> 01:06:11,865
But the problem is, the game's, the angle of the game,

1473
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:16,156
It actually.

1474
01:06:18,627 --> 01:06:20,789
the angle of the game is actually from this angle.

1475
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:23,731
So for the most part, you'll be seeing the character

1476
01:06:23,811 --> 01:06:24,352
in this angle.

1477
01:06:24,412 --> 01:06:25,253
He does turn around.

1478
01:06:25,693 --> 01:06:27,995
So you have to realize there's a lot of stuff

1479
01:06:28,015 --> 01:06:29,496
that you do that you can't actually,

1480
01:06:30,036 --> 01:06:33,719
you have to work with the angle of that character.

1481
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:36,321
And so what we did is, you'll see eventually,

1482
01:06:37,102 --> 01:06:39,124
we have a better angle of that character where

1483
01:06:39,284 --> 01:06:41,966
I tried something a little broader, a little more,

1484
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:43,768
a little bigger that actually works.

1485
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:44,268
Almost done.

1486
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:45,349
The animation's coming.

1487
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:46,970
And it's right at the end of this.

1488
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:51,413
All zombies killing, blah, blah, blah.

1489
01:06:51,493 --> 01:06:51,853
Here it is.

1490
01:06:52,454 --> 01:06:54,615
So we decided to go a little broader with the animation.

1491
01:06:54,815 --> 01:06:56,696
So from the back, you can actually see what he's doing.

1492
01:06:56,716 --> 01:06:58,317
The animations are great, but hey, it's

1493
01:06:58,337 --> 01:07:00,318
going to work for a little game like this.

1494
01:07:00,898 --> 01:07:01,158
Cool.

1495
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:03,340
I think we are done.

1496
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:04,540
So that's the four aspects of animation.

1497
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,121
Really important.

1498
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,802
All you guys, think about this whenever you're animating.

1499
01:07:07,922 --> 01:07:08,863
There's no rules to that.

1500
01:07:08,923 --> 01:07:10,424
You can add your own things if you want.

1501
01:07:10,824 --> 01:07:11,884
Find the principles of animation.

1502
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:12,645
Fit them wherever you want.

1503
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:13,785
But incredibly important.

1504
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:14,026
Cool.

1505
01:07:14,066 --> 01:07:14,506
Thank you very much.
