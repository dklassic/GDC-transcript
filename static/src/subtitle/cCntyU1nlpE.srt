00:00:08,906 --> 00:00:14,370
Morning guys. How many of you have read the Shank Postmortem at the Game Developer Magazine?

2
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:21,456
I'm trying not to repeat too much of that. I think it's available to everybody. So you guys can read that.

3
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:29,483
I really tried to get this talk around things that I didn't get to talk to about or things that I found out after I'd written that postmortem.

4
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:36,148
So for people who don't know me very well or have seen the work that we've done...

5
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,018
It's interesting that we've gone basically more and more violent over time.

6
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:43,361
We started with eats, and it was family-friendly.

7
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:48,145
And then Sugar Rush was a game, it was teen, and then we did the mature thing.

8
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:52,989
So I'm not really sure what we're going to go to next, but I think it's going to be fun.

9
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,172
We're pretty good at stabbing people now, I think.

10
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:58,973
People seem to resonate with that for us.

11
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:00,235
It's good.

12
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:06,058
You know, I was presenting this, preparing this slide, and people kept asking me what

13
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:08,719
Shank looked like when we first started.

14
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:11,960
And you know, I thought, you know, it pretty much always looked the same.

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:20,283
And then I realized that there was this one test that I did with Jeff over a weekend when

16
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:22,523
we were first thinking about what Shank was going to be.

17
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:25,064
And so we built this thing.

18
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:28,425
And this is actually what Shank looked like right from the beginning.

19
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:34,758
uh... actually if i can just get the uh... this will work i want to show you

20
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:35,579
guys the actual

21
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,280
uh... demo here

22
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,763
try real quick and see if i can get there

23
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:42,385
uh...

24
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:43,146
like right up here

25
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,748
maybe i'll do it right at the end

26
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:47,210
but uh... it was all done in flash

27
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,353
and uh... we did it over a weekend and you can move around

28
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:55,037
basically all the moves were the same you could kind of get a feel of how

29
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:56,018
things were going

30
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:58,467
And that's what gave us confidence to move forward.

31
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:02,330
And then a few weeks later, we had a new character design,

32
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,391
and it was basically Shank.

33
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,294
And it was basically the same from then on.

34
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:09,977
And in fact, so much so that what you saw here

35
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:12,480
is in early January.

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,082
What you saw here was also in January.

37
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:16,804
And then the next thing I'm gonna show you

38
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:19,806
was in early March, so two months later.

39
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,109
You can see there's a double jump in there.

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,173
Some of the little differences that we had.

41
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:39,598
Basically, it looked like...

42
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:09,673
So in any case, that was, you know, when I look back at it, I'm like, what did we do for the next year?

43
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:17,140
But, you know, it was a lot of engine work, there's a lot of tweaks, you know, the animation was different over time,

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,883
we fixed a lot of bugs, we put it on three platforms, all sorts of things.

45
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:27,508
But it's still pretty amazing that we got to that point in two months, and it basically stayed the same.

46
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:31,952
I don't think I've ever worked on a game where it basically, from a visual standpoint and a feel standpoint, stayed the same.

47
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:33,735
after two months of development.

48
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:40,217
Of course, Monaco is going to follow me, so whatever I did.

49
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:45,180
So, some other really important things that happened to us is Pax 2009.

50
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,020
A lot of you guys have heard about that.

51
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:50,722
I wanted to show the picture of what really was there.

52
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:55,024
We were talking to a lot of publishers at the time,

53
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:57,605
trying to get a deal done for Shank,

54
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,386
because we really needed funding to finish the game.

55
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,222
because we're a team of six and growing,

56
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:06,845
and we were doing other side jobs at the same time,

57
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:08,286
we really wanted to close the fan this thing.

58
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:13,111
And the publishers were telling us to not show Shank,

59
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,132
and I think you guys have all heard this before,

60
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,513
this kind of thing, where they're like,

61
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,795
oh, hey, don't show your game out,

62
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:22,859
because that will hinder our efforts to promote your game.

63
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,461
Of course, in my experience.

64
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:31,255
they're kind of a multiplier on your own efforts, so if you put in zero, then they multiply on your zero.

65
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:32,816
And you just get zero.

66
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:37,399
And that happened to us previously on Eats, so we're like, no, you know, we're just going to show the game.

67
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,660
We haven't even signed anything yet, so it's ours to show.

68
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,483
By the same time, we couldn't announce what platforms it was going to be on.

69
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:47,466
Again, a lot of you guys have run into that.

70
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:51,388
So we just kind of made this box from staples.

71
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:56,215
and spray painted it and covered it up and it was,

72
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:59,077
you know, stuck whatever controllers in there that we could,

73
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:01,879
including Atari, hey, maybe it'll go on the Atari,

74
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,520
maybe it'll go on the Dreamcast, that'd be pretty sweet.

75
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:07,423
And actually it was a big hit because of that,

76
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:08,944
well, partly because of that.

77
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:10,926
People really enjoyed that kind of story.

78
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,350
So talking about some of the technically hard things.

79
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,362
uh... right there on the right you can see our very first playstation image

80
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:25,645
that we that was actually rendering anything that resembles uh... shank

81
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:27,487
uh... so i took a picture of that

82
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:30,669
and you can see the prettiness that it was

83
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,730
uh...

84
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:33,652
we shipped uh...

85
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,215
on the playstation 3 simul ship with the xbox

86
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,036
uh... but we didn't start

87
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,038
porting until february

88
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:42,779
about mid february

89
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,901
and then we shipped in june

90
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,624
So we had no code on the PlayStation and then we shipped in June.

91
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:53,227
So that was pretty fun. It worked out well for us.

92
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,349
Another thing was 2GB downloads. I don't think I'd do that again.

93
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:00,451
There was 1.4GB of movies in that game.

94
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:05,034
So the rest of it was the game. 600MB game.

95
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:10,017
And fragmentation, I didn't... I had no idea that...

96
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:14,039
I mean, like, logically thinking, of course, all the hard drives were fragment,

97
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:15,420
but I didn't think it was going to be a problem.

98
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:17,710
uh... we actually had problems up to

99
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,353
where uh... we have a magnitude of difference so one person would take

100
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:25,055
ten seconds to load the level and another person would take a minute to load the level

101
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:27,037
and it was literally that bad

102
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:28,478
uh... and

103
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:33,482
none of these certification caught that all our internal testing, EA's testing

104
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,444
Microsoft's testing, our external testing, none of it caught it

105
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:39,226
because they were all using fresh uh... xboxes

106
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:42,288
so you know if you're going to do an xbox you test the fragmentation thing

107
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:46,565
So that's what we learned and we had to fix that post-launch.

108
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:51,888
It also took us a week and a half to fix it and a month to deploy the thing.

109
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:54,230
So that's another really annoying thing.

110
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,033
But it was a really bad experience for the people who had it.

111
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:06,037
We also almost went broke while making Shank.

112
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:12,661
It was enough that we had to do temporary optional wage increases.

113
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,592
uh... we paid back we paid all the wages back with interest

114
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,174
uh... so that was pretty awesome actually

115
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:22,156
uh... and uh... it was kind of around uh...

116
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,499
that was in january 2010 when that happened

117
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,342
we also had a shareholder loan to uh... to tide things over

118
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:34,044
uh... a bank loan against my house

119
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:35,625
and jeff's house

120
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:36,986
uh...

121
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:41,529
and uh... you know the reason one of the big reasons why we did it was because

122
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:41,869
we felt

123
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:45,672
Not only did we want to get the best deal for ourselves,

124
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:48,734
but when we were negotiating the publishing deal,

125
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:50,574
things just didn't feel right.

126
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:53,235
It really felt like we were getting squeezed.

127
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,977
And I felt like even if I took the deal and it worked out for us,

128
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,879
it wouldn't bode well for the next person who came in after me.

129
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,381
And so, the deal that we were looking at just wasn't really right.

130
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,002
We would have survived and that's about it.

131
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:17,515
So that's why we stepped away and we said no because not only did I think that it wasn't a great idea for us,

132
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:25,041
but more importantly I really felt like we have a responsibility, all of us have a responsibility in our actions on how it affects the industry.

133
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:33,368
And so, you know, with some contingencies in mind of what would happen if shit really went down,

134
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:39,192
you know, that's when we took the bank loans and reduced the assets and everything and we just said no to...

135
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:44,607
to the publisher deal and went with EA instead, that had a much more fair deal. And I really

136
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:50,071
do think that that affects the industry, and everybody who does that affects the industry

137
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:56,797
in quite a significant manner, in fact. And so, you know, we're pretty proud that we were

138
00:08:56,857 --> 00:08:57,417
able to do that.

139
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:06,564
There's other random things that had happened in there. We built the levels in...

140
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:12,676
In PAX East last year, we had this one great level.

141
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,397
And it was the Butcher level, if you guys have played it.

142
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:17,117
And it was just really polished.

143
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,078
It worked out really well.

144
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:19,438
And then we also had the first level.

145
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:20,618
And we showed this to the press.

146
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:21,719
And they were like, oh, this is great.

147
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:22,839
And they're like, when is it coming out?

148
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:23,359
I'm like, summer.

149
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:24,239
It's going to come out in the summer.

150
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,960
I'm shipping in like three months.

151
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,080
But that was actually all the content we had.

152
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,341
We showed them everything.

153
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:33,882
So after that, between March and June,

154
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:36,663
we built the rest of the game, which was 13 more levels.

155
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:40,298
So we had two levels and then we built 13 in three months.

156
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,441
And dishwashers, halfway through the development we had a flood as well.

157
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:49,941
That was fantastic.

158
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:57,023
I was actually on vacation at the time, the first vacation in some time, and I was in Hawaii actually.

159
00:09:57,384 --> 00:10:01,445
And then I got a call and they're like, your office is flooded.

160
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,406
What do you want me to do about it?

161
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:04,586
I'm not even there.

162
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:08,025
And this picture here is actually the aftermath.

163
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:13,267
So the water was much higher than this before someone actually ended up taking a picture.

164
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:16,669
What happened was the next-door neighbor's dishwasher had exploded.

165
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:24,293
And what's really interesting is I think we were protected or something.

166
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,594
I mean, we were just really, really lucky.

167
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:30,196
Because first of all, our servers were in the other room that didn't get flooded.

168
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:32,577
So that was awesome.

169
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,418
And then the second thing is...

170
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:39,736
If you look, maybe, of course you can't see them because we lifted all the computers,

171
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:41,898
but the computers are actually on the floor.

172
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,380
And the power supplies are on the bottom of the computer.

173
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:49,283
And then the water level went like three, four inches or something.

174
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,264
That's what I heard anyway.

175
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:56,188
Again, I wasn't there, but all the computers miraculously still work today.

176
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,392
And I honestly don't understand.

177
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:03,706
Maybe it was, you know, we were trying to figure out what happened.

178
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:07,949
Maybe there was like enough dust stuck in there that would protect it or something.

179
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:10,170
So, you know, thankfully we don't clean anything.

180
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,491
All right.

181
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:12,131
I'm not sure.

182
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:16,434
Anyway, so somehow we were, you know, there was an angel or something,

183
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:19,515
because otherwise that would have been some big disaster.

184
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,277
I mean, at least our servers weren't affected anyway.

185
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:23,578
So it was good.

186
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,772
Some other stuff here cinematics is one of the big big problems that we had because we had such big cash flow issues

187
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,773
you know all the

188
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:38,054
cinematic team right at the end. This is a mouth chart for scissor and

189
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,315
And you see you know

190
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:44,377
This is some of our storyboards and you see it just kind of gets more and more rough as time goes on

191
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,558
It's the last one. It's like what the hell is that you know?

192
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:54,301
And and so you know they were really meticulous at first you know directing everything and doing the proper storyboards

193
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,881
And then at the end, it was just like, OK, we have to animate now.

194
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:01,242
So here's some scribble, and then you go off and do it.

195
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:09,004
Some post-launch data that I wasn't able to put out.

196
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:12,085
30% of the people completed the game.

197
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:16,647
It took people around three or four hours for the first play through.

198
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,554
And then they had the co-op mode and stuff like that.

199
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:23,935
So that obviously played into whether or not

200
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:24,976
you complete the game.

201
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:29,697
Only 1% of people beat the hard mode, 1.9, or 1.6, rather.

202
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:33,359
Yeah, our conversion rate is pretty good, 26%.

203
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:37,881
And I think in my next game, I'm going

204
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:39,321
to have a smaller download size.

205
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:43,363
Well, at least not 1.4 gigs of movies anyway.

206
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:46,830
Actually, even that was, as we were developing it,

207
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:48,632
the movies just kept peaking up.

208
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:50,293
And I would compress it some more

209
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,075
and do other tricks to push it down.

210
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,977
And then the animators would go, hey, look, more cinematics.

211
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:55,778
And then push it up.

212
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:56,979
And then I had to push it down.

213
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,240
It just kind of bobbled along.

214
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,883
And then we just finally squeaked by at 1.9 gigs

215
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:01,323
kind of deal.

216
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:11,113
The last point is aggressive versus defensive players is another really interesting thing that we learned after launch,

217
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:14,275
which kind of shows that we didn't do enough testing before launch,

218
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:20,398
was that there's aggressive players and defensive players,

219
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:22,079
because I would get people saying,

220
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,001
the controls are just the most amazing things ever, this is just so sweet.

221
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:29,243
And then other people are like, I'm stuck, I don't know why I can't move.

222
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:33,819
And we realized it was because it was a different style of player.

223
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,120
So if you were really offensive and you wanted to kill people and stab things,

224
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,241
which is what we wanted you to do, it would feel really good

225
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,881
because all the transitions were working really well.

226
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,822
And you could just get into the groove of it really well.

227
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:51,683
But if you wanted to run and you wanted to just get out of the fight,

228
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:54,224
that was not something that we anticipated, really.

229
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,922
So that's when the controls got sticky, when it's like, you know, I do a move and I want to run away.

230
00:14:00,662 --> 00:14:02,843
That didn't work out so well, and we didn't realize that.

231
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:09,505
But, you know, it was definitely a data point for us for the future on things to think about, you know, just the different play styles.

232
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:17,127
Another thing is, you know, everybody asks me how the relationship between us and EA was.

233
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:24,090
And, you know, I always catch that with context, which is that, you know, it works really well for us, and sometimes it can work really well.

234
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:26,254
And sometimes, obviously, it doesn't work so well.

235
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,894
So I've got some stuff going on here.

236
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:31,735
And I wanted to start with the less good and then go to the

237
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:35,455
good, because, well, usually it's the good and the bad.

238
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,216
But people are interested in about the less good.

239
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:43,917
So we had a deadline that was two months before we really

240
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:44,517
had to ship.

241
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:47,537
And that was some internal thing from EA that they really,

242
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:49,958
really wanted us to get it out on a certain time for other

243
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,498
financial reasons that had nothing to do

244
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:53,198
with the actual game.

245
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:53,358
So

246
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:57,048
You know, that was maybe a month, actually,

247
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:58,309
before we had to ship.

248
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:00,770
But anyway, that extra month would

249
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,272
have been put to good use in terms of testing and tweaking.

250
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,493
So that was unfortunate.

251
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:09,095
And I think they understand that that was unfortunate.

252
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:13,377
And I don't think they'd do that with us again anyway.

253
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:20,941
And old-style PR is something that I'm really passionate

254
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:21,881
about, is that the PR.

255
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:26,887
side of things in the old ways when they're doing the box product stuff.

256
00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:32,789
You know, they set up these time slots that the media can meet with you.

257
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:39,132
And it's like, you know, listen to us talk as opposed to, you know, talk to the media.

258
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:42,914
And I really think that it's important for us to talk to the media

259
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:47,916
and actually have a conversation and have everybody understand where you're coming from.

260
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,737
And obviously as an indie, that's one of our strengths.

261
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:55,806
But just as digital download continues to go, that, I think,

262
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,947
is the way that it's going to go, as opposed to this press

263
00:15:58,987 --> 00:15:59,388
release thing.

264
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:00,788
I mean, press releases are horrible.

265
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:05,390
I mean, I just never really want to do a press release,

266
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,951
and I'm always against it, pretty much.

267
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,492
But sometimes I get coaxed into it.

268
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:17,376
And we did a press release where Marian Krawczyk, it was

269
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,577
announced that Marian was our writer.

270
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:20,157
And she

271
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:23,149
actually wrote God of War as well and then she wrote Shank.

272
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,751
And she had written Shank like way back when we started,

273
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:28,552
with us, right in the beginning.

274
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,914
And then when we did the press release of it and it said,

275
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:34,136
you know, Marian Krozek signed to do Shank, right?

276
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:39,279
And the media rightfully so said, why are you hiring a writer

277
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,239
at the end of the project?

278
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,240
Why are you doing that?

279
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,542
And the reason is because the press release was a one-way

280
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:45,242
communication.

281
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:48,024
There's no way to talk back and say, or no way

282
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,765
to have a discussion and say, actually, no, no, no.

283
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:53,904
We actually had her on right from the beginning as she was involved, but instead, you know,

284
00:16:53,924 --> 00:17:00,329
the news just spread out that, you know, this game Shank, after signing with EA, decided

285
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:03,932
that they need a high-profile story writer, which totally wasn't the case.

286
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:12,458
So anyway, it's a big rant that can probably go on for quite some time with APR, but kind

287
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,840
of preaching to the choir here, too.

288
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,902
Consumer expectations, you know, signing with a publisher, suddenly you're an EA game.

289
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:22,135
and that brings with it all sorts of other things.

290
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:24,696
It's just, you know, they have different expectations

291
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:26,877
of what the game might be or might have

292
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,318
or the features it might have and the length it might be

293
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:30,139
and all that kind of thing.

294
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,240
And we definitely felt that from everybody.

295
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,142
And that means it's just something you have

296
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:37,642
to keep in mind.

297
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:39,203
It's just a thing that's there.

298
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,205
And of course, there's a possibly reduced upside

299
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:45,306
if you're not self-funding it, but I mean, the fact is

300
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:47,467
that we wouldn't have shipped Shank without.

301
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:52,671
some funding. So, you know, it's not really something that's on my mind.

302
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:58,534
I mean, the fact is that we ended up keeping, we kept the IP, we kept the creative freedom,

303
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:04,977
here's the good stuff. You know, they really trusted us to do what we wanted to do, and

304
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:08,718
we just went and did it. And, you know, part of the reason that that was possible was because

305
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:13,981
we had created Shank so far already. I mean, in two months it was basically the same game

306
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:14,461
as The End.

307
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:18,350
And so nobody was going to come in and say, I want a different game than that.

308
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:25,112
Although, back in the day when I pitched Eats, we got like, hey, can you make it into a Super

309
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:25,772
Monkey Ball game?

310
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:26,913
And things like that.

311
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:33,274
Maybe they did want Shank to be, I don't know, Machete or something.

312
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,857
So we had other great things as true support.

313
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:44,738
I mean, I felt like it was actually a supportive team as opposed to most of the time,

314
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:46,618
I mean, I've been working with publishers for a long time.

315
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:51,041
So a lot of times it can get to the point where the publisher

316
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,903
has become a cost center for you rather than a support

317
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:54,724
network for you.

318
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:59,707
And for us, this specific time, it was definitely a

319
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:00,708
support network for us.

320
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:03,730
Because I guess the stars aligned.

321
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,711
I mean, it was just a really great fit.

322
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,694
Multi-platform was absolutely huge.

323
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:15,707
You know, it's very, very difficult, if not impossible, to do a multi-platform simultaneous

324
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:17,748
ship without a publisher.

325
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:21,051
They actually did do marketing, which is pretty cool.

326
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:25,474
And they actually spent money on marketing, which is a novelty.

327
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:29,698
You know, reduced risk and less platform requirements.

328
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:35,442
I mean, I didn't have to localize Schenck because, you know, we knew that it wasn't

329
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,324
really going to make much of a difference in sales.

330
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,181
So we didn't localize it.

331
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,743
And right up to the last moment, we still changed

332
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,024
tweaking text to make it a little bit better.

333
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:49,165
And we wouldn't have been able to do that if we were not with

334
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:49,826
a publisher.

335
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:51,587
So all good things.

336
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:55,289
And of course, everyone asks, how did we do?

337
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,551
Well, in the first 24 hours, we sold more than Eats

338
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,671
Chowdown in its lifetime.

339
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:02,352
So that's pretty awesome.

340
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:10,535
It was reported and I'm not privy to talk about the actual sales numbers, so here it is.

341
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:17,637
XBLA reported 41,000 units in the first week, which is respectable and profitable for everyone.

342
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:24,298
But the main thing there is that multi-platform was key to our profitability.

343
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:27,979
It really was a difference for Schenck specifically,

344
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,480
it was the difference between profitable and not profitable.

345
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,429
uh... so you know it's it was a really great thing to see

346
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:36,830
uh... and uh... and on steam

347
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:37,670
you know uh...

348
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:41,012
i think everybody here loves steam it just it just works so well

349
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,613
uh... and it just uh... it's got a really long tail and it just keeps on going

350
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:46,054
as well

351
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:47,214
uh...

352
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,255
so as an overview uh...

353
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:51,856
the uh...

354
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:56,318
we had prototyping for three months we did tools forever so that we could

355
00:20:56,398 --> 00:20:57,819
actually build those thirteen levels

356
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:58,719
in three months

357
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:04,896
The demo that you saw in two months was really cobbled together with old tools and things

358
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,856
like that, and we couldn't have finished the game with that.

359
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:11,318
There was six months of just madness.

360
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,079
You know, one of the great things, though, is that the engineers actually did such a

361
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:24,321
great job during the first nine months of tools making is they never had to, I mean,

362
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:26,461
I think they worked three weekends throughout the whole project.

363
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:28,682
So that was pretty amazing.

364
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:32,033
And even in the weekends, it's like one day out of it.

365
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:34,494
It was really the designers and the artists

366
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,034
that got the crunch of it because of the content crunch.

367
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:41,095
We're also working on another project at the same time

368
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:45,957
that we're doing Shank, and that really went awry

369
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:48,157
trying to do two projects with not enough people.

370
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,118
And that was definitely one of the hardest times in my life.

371
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,479
You know, listening to the Meat Mortem

372
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,940
and talking about their stress levels and things like that.

373
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,520
For people who know me,

374
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:00,874
it's actually pretty hard to stress me out.

375
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:03,975
But that was probably one of the most stressful times,

376
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:08,996
and having to go in the office and just work it out

377
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:12,696
and not show how stressed I was to the rest of the staff,

378
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:15,877
because that affects everybody.

379
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:17,057
If you're stressed, you're just gonna

380
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:18,737
permeate that with everybody.

381
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:22,038
So when everybody left, and it was just me and Marcus,

382
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,598
who's my high school buddy who started the company with me,

383
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:27,939
he'd stay late with me to finish things

384
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:28,539
until like 1 or 2 a.m.

385
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,112
And I tell him, you know, I just don't know how we're going to get this done.

386
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:33,853
How is this going to work?

387
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:40,597
And, you know, we just kind of fought through it, really, and took a look at the risk.

388
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,899
Yeah, it was a pretty tough time.

389
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,141
It was around April of last year.

390
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:53,624
And I wanted to finish off with some of the thoughts of the future,

391
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:56,106
which I've been thinking about a lot, you know.

392
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:00,770
There's a whole wall of text here, so I'm just going to talk about it here.

393
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:07,393
The best breakout hits on Xbox Live and PSN, they made $10 million, which for us is like,

394
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,594
holy crap, that's a lot of money.

395
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:14,557
But when you're talking about the lower number of games, the best games make $10 million

396
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:17,178
or $20 million, whatever it is.

397
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:22,701
And the publishers look at that, and they look at their investment into it, and the

398
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:24,161
whole economy looks at this.

399
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:27,563
And it's like, the number's just not really adding up.

400
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,998
all that much and the ceiling is pretty low.

401
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,160
But there's so much potential there that could work.

402
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:35,902
And I think the platforms really need to...

403
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:39,864
Well, we've been talking about this forever,

404
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,685
and they've been talking about it forever,

405
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,106
to improve the platform time over time,

406
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:49,329
which is create new ways to micro-transactions

407
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,231
or subscription or better ways to find games.

408
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,572
And they need more and more things.

409
00:23:54,612 --> 00:23:55,373
That's what they need.

410
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,161
and you need to continually improve that platform,

411
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:01,082
you know, like Steam and iOS have.

412
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:02,962
And I think that that's how you're going to be able to

413
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:06,564
create this proper ecosystem.

414
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:10,345
And, you know, I think that one of the flaws there,

415
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:11,406
actually, is the king-making.

416
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:15,527
You know, the Summer Arcade frenzy is, you know,

417
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,948
I mean, if I got in Summer Arcade, great,

418
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:17,988
I'm not going to complain.

419
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:21,389
It is king-making, that's what it is, right?

420
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,310
It's a huge boost, but everything around it.

421
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:29,294
kind of falls to the side and you gotta do whatever you can to kind of pull yourself

422
00:24:29,354 --> 00:24:30,195
back up a little bit.

423
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:36,659
And I think that it's definitely a double-edged sword.

424
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,043
It's a dangerous thing to rely so much on king making, on all these promotions where

425
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,665
it's all focused on this two-week period.

426
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:47,587
You really need to be able to spread out so that everybody can win.

427
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:53,635
And we've been talking about it forever.

428
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:56,637
All of us have been talking to Microsoft and PlayStation, and

429
00:24:56,657 --> 00:24:58,558
they've been talking back and saying, yes, we know we need

430
00:24:58,578 --> 00:25:00,439
more, we need recommendation systems.

431
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,920
Literally about five years ago, they were talking to us

432
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:10,023
about recommendation systems and other ways to find games.

433
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:13,145
Instead of top-selling game of all time, top-selling last

434
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:16,986
week, last month, last 35 days, whatever, just more ways for

435
00:25:17,027 --> 00:25:17,507
people to.

436
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:27,907
for games to organically get found is the way that we're going to be able to actually have a proper system

437
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:31,890
where people can take risks and also have a much longer tail.

438
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:38,074
I mean, Eats, when it shipped, I think it made like $20,000 or something when it shipped.

439
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:41,397
And over time, that's when we really started making the money.

440
00:25:41,777 --> 00:25:43,258
So we were able to take that kind of risk.

441
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,520
We're saying, OK, we're going to launch this game and over a long period of time we can make money.

442
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,421
But actually on the consoles, it's not so much.

443
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:49,742
It falls off a lot faster.

444
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,888
you know, unless you're one of the top.

445
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:55,570
And so you really need to be able to find new ways

446
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,631
of being able to make money on it.

447
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:00,833
And, you know, free-to-play micro-selections, that's one.

448
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:03,075
You know, Steam style, you know,

449
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:04,215
all the recommendation systems,

450
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:06,156
all the different ways to get people back.

451
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,298
You know, instead of deal a week, it's like deal a day,

452
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,298
you know, all that kind of thing.

453
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:11,680
You know, it's all important things.

454
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:17,085
uh... and you know that the main thing there is just the abundance mentality

455
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:21,187
you know it's not it's it's not trying to squeeze down it's it's like

456
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:22,727
is

457
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:26,548
steam understands that if your game is out on more platforms will actually sell

458
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:27,209
more on steam

459
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:27,889
not less

460
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:30,050
so you know this exclusivity thing

461
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,470
doesn't actually help

462
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,131
that i mean it helps hardware sales and i guess that's the motivation

463
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:36,052
between uh... for it

464
00:26:36,732 --> 00:26:39,313
uh... but if they if they want you know games to sell

465
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,434
exclusivity isn't going to sell it in my opinion

466
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:49,616
uh... and uh... and codes you know free codes just so easy right at the other day

467
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:51,698
asked for twenty five thousand free codes on steam

468
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:55,302
five minutes later here you go here's a twenty five thousand free codes of eats

469
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:57,164
uh... and uh...

470
00:26:57,184 --> 00:26:59,006
uh... you know it's

471
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,148
it's just such a slow process when you're working

472
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:02,709
uh... in the console

473
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,472
anyway that's exactly twenty five minutes so i guess i'm

474
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:07,594
uh... but i hope that was helpful
