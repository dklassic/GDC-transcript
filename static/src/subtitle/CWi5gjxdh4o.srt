1
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:06,431
Yeah!

2
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:06,591
Yeah!

3
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:07,031
Yeah!

4
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:07,311
Yeah!

5
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:07,471
Yeah!

6
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:07,631
Yeah!

7
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:08,472
Yeah!

8
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:12,313
What's up?

9
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:13,313
What's up?

10
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,974
It's time!

11
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:15,594
It's time!

12
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:16,294
Is my mic working?

13
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:17,335
Alright, good, it's working.

14
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,636
Real quick guys, that was Kyoko Higo.

15
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:22,797
Kyoko has been in the industry for a while.

16
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:24,557
She used to work at Squaresoft,

17
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:26,058
and then she co-founded Enhance.

18
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:27,799
And it's really thanks to her,

19
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,519
and all of our friends at 8Four.

20
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:34,887
that we even get any really cool Japanese talks at GDC here.

21
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:36,949
So, I mean, I just want to say thanks to you guys,

22
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,411
Kyoko, 844, for bringing us over here

23
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:41,192
and always bringing over all these cool,

24
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:42,573
legendary Japanese developers.

25
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:43,934
And with that said.

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,821
The time has come!

27
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:55,684
Yes!

28
00:00:55,944 --> 00:00:57,025
We got some DMC fans.

29
00:00:57,445 --> 00:00:57,785
Guys.

30
00:00:58,986 --> 00:00:59,426
Alright.

31
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,620
My name is Matt Walker, I'm the producer on DMC5.

32
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,721
I've brought here today with me from Osaka, Japan,

33
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:08,241
the senior producer, Michiteru Okabe.

34
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:08,982
Hello.

35
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:09,122
Woo!

36
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:10,962
Woo!

37
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:11,162
Woo!

38
00:01:13,162 --> 00:01:13,402
Woo!

39
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:13,683
Woo!

40
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:13,983
Woo!

41
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:15,103
Woo!

42
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:15,203
Woo!

43
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,843
So how many people play Devil May Cry 5?

44
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:18,223
Woo!

45
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:20,044
Woo!

46
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:20,424
Nice!

47
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:20,964
All right.

48
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:21,504
Thank you.

49
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:22,104
Thank you.

50
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:22,364
Thank you.

51
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:22,724
Thank you.

52
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:23,124
Thank you.

53
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:23,565
Thank you.

54
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:29,586
And the main event, a legend in the game industry, a man.

55
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,637
who's been around since 1994.

56
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:36,079
He's directed games like Street Fighter Alpha,

57
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,762
Rival Schools, Capcom vs. SNK, my personal favorite,

58
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:41,984
Dragon's Dogma, and of course,

59
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:46,588
Devil May Cry 5, Hideaki Itsuno!

60
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,832
Thank you, thank you for coming.

61
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,075
Itsuno-san, let's rock.

62
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,137
Let's rock!

63
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,483
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA Yes.

64
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:13,327
So, this is going to be a talk for game designers, so please bear with us.

65
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:20,411
Alright, you guys may feel differently after seeing that, but honestly, we did bring a proper GDC presentation here.

66
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:24,253
This is going to be based on game design. This is going to be for game designers.

67
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:27,015
We're going to talk about Itsuno-san's approach to designing games.

68
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:28,175
Alright.

69
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,050
We'll start with this theme,

70
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,351
game design by reverse engineering of emotions.

71
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,412
We'll start with this theme,

72
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:35,293
game design by reverse engineering of emotions.

73
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:36,314
We'll start with this theme,

74
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:39,156
game design by reverse engineering of emotions.

75
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:44,180
Oh, there's one thing.

76
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:47,062
Actually, there's one thing before we get into that.

77
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:49,003
We've reached 2 million sales.

78
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,406
Yeah!

79
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:56,665
Applause! Applause!

80
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,647
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

81
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:03,508
We just really want to thank everybody for playing the game.

82
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:04,568
It's been a great honor.

83
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:05,748
Alright, let's go.

84
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:14,031
So Itsuno-san first wants to start with the idea of, okay, designing a game by trying to reverse engineer an emotion that you felt in your life.

85
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:27,327
What can you do to make people feel that way?

86
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:33,552
In other words, how can you get a player to feel that feeling that you felt?

87
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,816
In other words, how can you get a player to feel that feeling that you felt?

88
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:40,518
And when we're talking about...

89
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,533
emotion here. We're talking about emotion, we're talking about being moved, we're talking about potentially creating a feeling

90
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:59,095
that will motivate the player to continue playing the game.

91
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:22,988
So the first important thing is do not mix up means and objectives.

92
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:27,070
We're going to start by assuming that we want to invoke emotion A in the user.

93
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,051
That's the objective. 日本語

94
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:39,819
And so then we want to consider what are the means,

95
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,181
what are the things that must be done to invoke emotion A. 日本語

96
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:59,680
What you want to be careful about is remember that there is one objective here, but there

97
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,282
could be multiple different means of achieving that objective.

98
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:04,764
Japanese translation

99
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,861
One thing that Isosan has really found throughout his years in developing games is that it's

100
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:30,184
really easy to get the two confused, and you end up getting so focused on a particular

101
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:34,867
means that you forget what the true objective was, and you end up spending a lot of time

102
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,870
trying to get a certain means implemented before realizing, actually, you know what?

103
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,950
This isn't what we're going for.

104
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:55,876
But what Ito-san usually tries to do is come up with both the objective and the means at the same time.

105
00:05:55,976 --> 00:06:03,241
And by doing that, he can usually implement it in a way that is likely to succeed and actually be something that is implementable.

106
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:08,425
In order to achieve that, it is important for him to think of a means, or priority ordering,

107
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:11,628
that will work out and lead to success.

108
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,600
And then what you can do is you can think up

109
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,961
a lot of different kinds of means,

110
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,262
and you can kind of prioritize them

111
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,784
based on how easy they might be to implement,

112
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,365
how hard they might be to implement.

113
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:23,968
And with different priorities like that,

114
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,350
you can kind of decide what's going to be the best approach.

115
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:32,874
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA-KONCHALAEWAGENA

116
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,976
So here we go.

117
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,778
We're going to say that we're going to assume here

118
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,500
that our objective this time is invoking a particular emotion

119
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:40,840
in the user.

120
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:46,005
As a game designer, you need to fill your library of emotions.

121
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,486
When you make a game, you want the user to feel this way.

122
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:52,228
It's natural for the creator to prepare a lot of emotions.

123
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:14,770
I mean, of course that makes sense, right? Because what we're trying to say is our objective here is to invoke an emotion.

124
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,091
It only makes sense that you want to have as many emotions as possible to draw upon.

125
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:26,255
So, get out there and experience everything you can.

126
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:32,358
For example, a traditional event, a popular event,

127
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:32,819
and also...

128
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:44,416
I want you to experience an event that you have never experienced before.

129
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:47,138
At the bottom, it says skydiving.

130
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:11,367
Ojiisan, Obasan no shito wa yannakute iidesu. Wakai shito ga yatte kurereba iidesu.

131
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:17,132
And we have skydiving on here, but if you're pretty old at this point, that's okay. You probably don't have to do that one.

132
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,654
I'm gonna leave that one for the young people if you want.

133
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:23,357
Wakai uchi ni shika daiken deken koto de ippaa aru to omoundesuyo.

134
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:28,301
Occhan, Obachan wa shiaanai desu kedo, wakai shito wa taiken shita koto no nai,

135
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,724
wakai uchi ni shika deken youna koto wo, wakai uchi ni ippai ko chokin shito ite kudasai.

136
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,067
So for all you young people then, get out there! Now is your chance!

137
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:37,228
Do everything you can.

138
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:48,543
And then remember, remember what you felt when you had that experience.

139
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:51,585
Keep that in memory, because that's what you're going to draw upon.

140
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:59,530
Now before that though, before you actually have the experience, Itsuno-san wants you

141
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:15,420
to think and visualize what you expect that experience to feel like before you actually have it.

142
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,401
And it's going to be that experience and that expectation that you're going to take and you're

143
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:22,441
going to reflect on, because the difference in

144
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:37,103
how different that was to actually feel versus what you expected to feel,

145
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:39,085
is going to be key to this process.

146
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,107
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA And so the idea then is that

147
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:05,789
Let's say you expected something to be incredibly fun, really fun,

148
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,450
but then you actually did it, and it wasn't as fun.

149
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,610
It's this difference right here.

150
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,071
This difference here is going to be what you can use to draw upon.

151
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,552
On the flip side,

152
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:35,375
Let's say that you expected it to be this fun, but it was actually this fun.

153
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,057
I look like an idiot.

154
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,321
It's more fun. It's more fun than you expected it to be.

155
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,243
That's also going to be important for you too, because that was something that

156
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:51,026
you yourself, you didn't have the ability to envision how fun that was going to be

157
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:54,288
until you actually experienced it.

158
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:55,288
I have something to say about this.

159
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:55,629
I buy games.

160
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:01,190
I saw the magazine and heard about it on the internet,

161
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,811
and I thought it was a great game, so I bought it.

162
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,772
And this was when it was a shitty game.

163
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,912
So imagine that you bought a game.

164
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:11,253
You've read a lot about it, you've seen a lot about it,

165
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:12,273
it looks awesome.

166
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,873
And you're like, you know what, I'm going to buy this game,

167
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,054
and I'm going to have a ton of fun with it.

168
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:15,914
This is going to be sweet.

169
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:17,695
You bought it, and then it was crap.

170
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:21,376
This is a very lucky thing.

171
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:22,756
That's a good thing.

172
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:24,797
You are lucky for having that experience.

173
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:26,917
Got that.

174
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:34,326
I thought it was a great game, so I spent $69 on it.

175
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:35,947
I won because I thought I could win.

176
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,608
I had the $69 in my head.

177
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:40,429
But I couldn't win because I was solo.

178
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,912
So, your imagination won.

179
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:46,934
So imagine, you spent 69 bucks on this.

180
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,354
You're like, this is going to be awesome.

181
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:49,435
I can envision this is going to be sweet.

182
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:50,896
There's going to be all this cool stuff happening.

183
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:51,917
And it wasn't.

184
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,638
That's okay, because...

185
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:59,515
It's that expectation that you had, you're going to be able to draw on that expectation.

186
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:00,435
You're going to be able to use that.

187
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:09,678
You're going to be able to draw on that. By drawing on that, then, you're going to get more out of the game than you actually would have gotten from that $69 otherwise.

188
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:12,679
So, what Itsunzana is trying to say is...

189
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:26,443
Buy games, buy as many games as you can.

190
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:28,423
I forgot, with your own money.

191
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:30,364
But please, with your own money.

192
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:39,467
I would like to look back at my experiences

193
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:43,388
where I have had a big impact on my emotions.

194
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:46,269
So Iso-san is going to give a couple of examples of

195
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,751
experiences he's had that have provoked

196
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:51,391
different feelings that he's been able to draw upon.

197
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:52,712
Have a look.

198
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,055
So for instance, finishing a triathlon.

199
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:00,595
That's actually him.

200
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:00,975
That's him.

201
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:10,518
He finished that triathlon.

202
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:16,500
I didn't translate this, but having an expensive full-course dinner.

203
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,240
For anybody who's had fugu before, it's really good.

204
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:31,015
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA If you've ever had a fugu dinner, you'll know that this is actually just the first portion of the dinner.

205
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,957
And for anyone else that hasn't, that's okay.

206
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:36,720
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA But also, TV shows and movies that moved Itsuno-san when he was young.

207
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,081
I think that's what moved him the most.

208
00:13:54,562 --> 00:14:02,866
So let's take a look at a couple of examples from TV shows or movies that have actually moved Itsuno-san.

209
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,148
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

210
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:20,517
Now, unfortunately, we weren't able to get the rights to use the actual footage from this,

211
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:26,740
but our art director, Koki Kinoshita, has done a great job of drawing up a couple little slides

212
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,441
to illustrate just what this scene is all about.

213
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:37,486
Now, the actual naming here is completely fictional and is in no way related to any brand, living or dead.

214
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:56,815
So we have this anime, this Japanese anime, where a super robot is just getting the crap

215
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,296
beat out of it.

216
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:05,078
This is the most famous robot in anime at this time.

217
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,458
This is the robot that everybody, all the little kids look up to.

218
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:20,656
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA So he's getting the crap beat out of him,

219
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:26,439
and then his father, who's been missing, who's been missing, turns up out of nowhere and

220
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:27,920
brings out a new machine.

221
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:36,063
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA A completely new robot that no one has ever

222
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:36,843
seen before.

223
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:39,124
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA

224
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:49,268
Of course, of course, on top of a cliff.

225
00:15:54,409 --> 00:16:00,391
And then this new super robot comes out and destroys each and every one of those enemies

226
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:02,931
that was beating the crap out of the hero in one fell swoop.

227
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:07,684
Speaking in Japanese.

228
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:12,945
So what little kids don't really know when they're watching this is that this is all

229
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:13,765
planned, right?

230
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:42,315
by bringing in the new robot as the old robot is basically dying off.

231
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:44,797
They're able to continue that new series,

232
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,559
and then the series that was originally playing,

233
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,240
well, that's going to kind of be retired anyways.

234
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,521
So it's this great marketing tactic.

235
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:54,343
But for Itsuno-san, when he was a little kid, he was like,

236
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:55,604
oh my god, this is amazing!

237
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:56,265
What's happening?

238
00:16:57,826 --> 00:16:58,707
He was four years old at the time.

239
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,008
The title is different, and the A is different.

240
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,890
And this is also from a different series.

241
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,612
And again, any relation to any series or brand, Living or Dead,

242
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:22,878
is completely coincidental.

243
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,742
So this time, we have another robot show

244
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,683
where three different robots usually

245
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:32,005
fight together against a particular enemy.

246
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:45,617
And of course, Ito-san is watching this expecting that the three robots are going to beat the

247
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:46,698
crap out of the enemy, but no!

248
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,481
This enemy is so powerful, this enemy can destroy all three of them at once!

249
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:52,083
And then...

250
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:11,227
Again, this time a princess from space has come from out of nowhere and said,

251
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,888
don't worry, I have something that can save you.

252
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:14,988
We're going to link together.

253
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:27,054
And the three robots with the new robot combine into one giant robot.

254
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:31,896
And without lifting a finger, obliterates the enemy

255
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:33,277
that was giving them such a hard time.

256
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:36,179
This is the one from the TV show, the theater version,

257
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,421
that was shown during the summer break.

258
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:41,804
It was originally a robot that would appear

259
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:43,345
for the Christmas show at the end of the year,

260
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:46,909
but it was shown a little during the summer break.

261
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:49,131
This was also a big surprise for adults.

262
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:54,936
What's interesting about this one is usually the way these robot shows work then, is that

263
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:59,879
they show the kind of combined super form usually later in the year, usually somewhere

264
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:04,863
in about fall or so, so that they can really start to gear the kids up to buy all the cool

265
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:05,723
toys for Christmas.

266
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:11,987
But this was a little taste of that combination in a movie that came out over the summer.

267
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:16,190
When I saw this in the theater, I was so moved I almost cried.

268
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:22,114
Ito-san was so impressed by this, so moved by this, that he cried in the theater.

269
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:23,616
It was just that cool.

270
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:24,577
He was 32 at the time.

271
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:24,937
Ha ha ha.

272
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:49,189
So let's now take those emotions that he felt when watching those, let's analyze that,

273
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,792
and see if we can't use that in a game.

274
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:56,416
Which scene, which line, the character's personality,

275
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:59,139
did you have similar experiences and emotions?

276
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,421
Why is it cool? Is the pose cool? Is the voice cool?

277
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:02,842
Let's analyze all of this.

278
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,965
And so, when you're drawing upon a...

279
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:12,364
emotion like that. You want to think about everything, everything that is surrounding that situation.

280
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:16,306
What was happening? What was what had happened beforehand? What were you thinking? What was the

281
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:20,127
character thinking? What were the motivations for the character? Other stuff that I can't read from here.

282
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:23,248
What was missing? What was missing to make you feel moved?

283
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:25,669
If you don't have these elements, you won't be able to feel moved.

284
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:26,349
Think about it that way.

285
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:27,630
If you don't have these elements,

286
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,491
what was missing to make you feel moved?

287
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:31,831
If you have these elements, you can feel moved.

288
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:32,711
If you look for those elements,

289
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:44,050
And then what you can do then is you can try to replicate that situation, take all the

290
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,074
different elements that you found in that situation and then kind of one by one, take

291
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:54,658
one away, basically use the scientific method, take one away and then see does that affect

292
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:55,218
the experience?

293
00:20:55,298 --> 00:21:00,943
Is that going to make the experience any less relevant or is it still relevant with that

294
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:01,483
taken away?

295
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,642
If you can understand the logic behind the emotions,

296
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:11,026
it will be easier to create similar emotions for the user.

297
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:14,189
You just need to recreate that logic in the game.

298
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:17,592
And then using that, then, you can basically figure out the logic

299
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,733
that triggered that emotion in you.

300
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:23,377
And then you can take that logic and apply that to your own game.

301
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:25,879
OK, let's move on.

302
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:45,045
感動した要素そのものとその感動を増幅させている要素を 混同しないようにしてください。 One of the important things is you're going to want to remember that as you're looking at all these different elements,

303
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:48,828
you don't want to confuse the elements that triggered the emotion

304
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,450
and the elements that simply amplify that emotion. まあ、例は書いてるんですけど。

305
00:21:56,394 --> 00:22:03,356
and you can see some examples in the slide here.

306
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:07,617
But really the important part is that you'll want to distinguish between those two,

307
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:12,177
and then you can then take different elements and further amplify that feeling

308
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:13,438
once you've gotten that figured out.

309
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:16,678
Let's try it with Devil May Cry 5.

310
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,519
So here's something we need to be aware of.

311
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:27,298
SUGOI netabare ga... ...

312
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,640
...arimasu.

313
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:32,062
Ehh...

314
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:33,804
Moshi...

315
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,424
...mada...

316
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:36,626
...kono game wo kuria shite nai hito ga itara...

317
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:37,447
...minai...

318
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:39,148
...moshika mimi wo usagu toka...

319
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:40,129
...yatte kudasai.

320
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:41,910
But before that, please understand...

321
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:43,832
...we are going to spoil the crap out of this.

322
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:46,654
So, anybody that hasn't played the game yet...

323
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:47,935
...and wants to experience it for yourselves...

324
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,917
...now's a great time to maybe take out a podcast...

325
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,198
...listen to that, close your eyes...

326
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,060
...and just enjoy the ambience of the room.

327
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:15,509
I mean, really, this is the point of the presentation, but there's a huge difference in having seen this here and actually played the game and actually played and felt that experience of beating the enemy yourself and then seeing the cutscenes and whatnot.

328
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:21,691
I've heard a lot about the theme of Devil May Cry 5 in interviews and stuff, but I'd like to hear more about the photorealism and stuff.

329
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,997
I'm just lying, but this is the real theme.

330
00:23:25,318 --> 00:23:28,240
Well, now to reveal a little something to you guys.

331
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,462
We've had all kinds of great interviews about the game,

332
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:32,563
and everybody always asks us,

333
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:34,144
what's the theme of Devil May Cry 5?

334
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:35,946
And we've said stuff like,

335
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:37,647
oh, you know, we're going for photorealism,

336
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:38,427
this, that, and the other thing.

337
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:40,769
Honestly, though, that's all a lie.

338
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,851
And we can finally say,

339
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:44,192
now that we're going to spoil the crap out of the game,

340
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:46,814
that the real theme is set back in Awakening.

341
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,515
Because there is a setback,

342
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:53,952
I wanted to do this in Devil May Cry 5.

343
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,375
It's because of the existence of that setback

344
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:01,138
that the awakening is relevant and so poignant.

345
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,503
This is the picture I wanted to show the most.

346
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:13,167
For Devil May Cry 5, basically, the whole scenario was written

347
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:15,689
specifically for this one moment in the game, right here.

348
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,507
Before we made the video, we rehearsed it.

349
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:25,628
We wanted to make this picture.

350
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:31,190
We wanted to make the user cry with emotion.

351
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,671
This particular photo, this is from the previews.

352
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:34,471
This is what we do before we actually start making the cut scenes.

353
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:37,232
But this basically shows that moment.

354
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:38,333
That moment where we said, okay,

355
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:40,774
this is going to be the moment where I want to move people.

356
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,014
I want to move them to tears.

357
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:44,015
Let's take a look.

358
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:45,195
Now let's take a look.

359
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,801
I don't have sound.

360
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:56,824
Let's see.

361
00:24:56,844 --> 00:24:56,944
Oh no.

362
00:24:57,324 --> 00:24:58,585
Oh God.

363
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:08,874
One more time.

364
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:10,336
Will it play?

365
00:25:10,536 --> 00:25:11,217
Let us all pray.

366
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,532
I'm not letting you die!

367
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:01,463
This, this right here.

368
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:03,085
This ends right here.

369
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:06,008
Thank you.

370
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:08,310
Yeah!

371
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,412
You know, when you're doing this,

372
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:30,018
Long hair goes like, whoosh!

373
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,239
It's that moment when he's doing this and the hair slowly, very slowly floats back down.

374
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,261
That is the only reason that he has hair in that form.

375
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:44,242
Yes.

376
00:26:45,902 --> 00:26:52,984
In a normal game, the main character is full powered up in the middle of the game.

377
00:26:55,297 --> 00:27:08,284
So in terms of game design, then, usually what you would expect to do is you would have a character, and that character would probably have their full, their kind of full-powered state, somewhere a little over half the game.

378
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:11,225
So in terms of a Devil May Cry game, maybe about Mission 12 or so.

379
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:15,888
And then you'd be able to then play in that full-powered state until the end of the game.

380
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:28,773
Even for Itsuno-san, that makes perfect sense. That is fairly common.

381
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:38,638
But in Devil May Cry 5, we threw out the theory and we said,

382
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:42,901
no, we're going to achieve Nero's full-powered state at the very end of the game.

383
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,131
So we threw out the theory and we said,

384
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,973
OK, mission 20 is going to be where you're going to get into that state,

385
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,934
and people are going to go, oh my god, what is this?

386
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:57,555
This is nuts.

387
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:00,056
But then we got cocky.

388
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:03,979
We said, actually, you know what?

389
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:06,381
No, let's add even more stuff during the credits.

390
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:18,729
We wanted to convince the team that we were going to change the theory.

391
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:24,796
So in 2015, when we were preparing for the training camp,

392
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,519
we apologized to the team, saying,

393
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:31,703
I'm sorry, but I have something I want to do, but I want to change the theory.

394
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:34,667
And so as we were kind of coming up with a concept for the game,

395
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:37,189
this was in September 2015, we had this little retreat, Nisei Shima.

396
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:40,371
And that's where Isuno-san basically said to the team,

397
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:42,072
look, I know what we're supposed to do here.

398
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:44,874
We're usually supposed to get you in a full-powered state somewhere a little over half the game.

399
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:47,356
Please, just listen to me, just let me do this.

400
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:48,977
I want to do it this way.

401
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:53,741
This is actually a video from about three and a half years ago.

402
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,222
At this point, we were actually thinking about

403
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,072
We decided where and how to power up, and we haven't changed anything until it's complete.

404
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:29,117
By the way, this is a tip.

405
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:33,478
Gather all the main members of the team and say,

406
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:35,438
I'm going with this.

407
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,139
Do you have any opinions?

408
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,499
It's okay, I'm going with this.

409
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,499
And when you're busy at the end of the game,

410
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,300
you can shut the mouth of the person who complains

411
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,560
that you thought it was wrong.

412
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,241
Now, this is a pro tip from Isuno-san.

413
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:47,921
If you do something like this, we have a retreat,

414
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,322
and you have all the leads together,

415
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:50,762
and you say, okay, all right, we're going to do this, right?

416
00:29:50,782 --> 00:29:53,343
We're going to do it this way, we're going to do it this way.

417
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:54,503
Then near the end of development,

418
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:56,563
when everybody really doesn't want to do that,

419
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:57,223
they know well.

420
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:00,130
I did tell him we could do it, so I guess we have no choice but to do it.

421
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:05,231
So, Nero. Let's look at Nero's setbacks in Waking of the Dead.

422
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:08,452
For Nero, we have he's lost his Devil Bringer at the beginning of the game,

423
00:30:09,593 --> 00:30:11,353
he's been obliterated by Urizen while impaired,

424
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:15,534
and then he loses to Urizen even with Devil Breakers.

425
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:29,313
And then his awakening.

426
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:35,279
He loses one arm, but he gains two, so he gains a total of three.

427
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,720
But then his awakening.

428
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,503
Not only does he get his arm back, he grows two more.

429
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,068
And then the other things that we wrote there.

430
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:47,610
By the way, this is a picture that we shared with everyone

431
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,271
including the image of Nero with wings positive.

432
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,651
And this is actually the photo that we used then as we were kind of working through development

433
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:56,452
and sharing with the team.

434
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:58,152
This is what we're going for with Nero.

435
00:30:58,172 --> 00:30:58,972
What is he going to do?

436
00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:02,213
He's got these two arms!

437
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:02,873
Look at these things!

438
00:31:02,893 --> 00:31:03,573
They're like wings!

439
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:06,694
Alright, now let's look at Dante then.

440
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:43,567
I...

441
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:45,009
can't...

442
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:49,933
get out!

443
00:31:54,736 --> 00:31:57,018
Who dares interfere?

444
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:42,557
So maybe you guys remember, earlier we were talking about a TV show where a robot was getting the crap beat out of it, and then the new more powerful robot showed up.

445
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,059
Just this mysterious new hero comes out of nowhere.

446
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:48,119
So...

447
00:32:53,795 --> 00:32:58,748
That really moved Itsunosan to tears and so he kind of hoped that by making this he'd

448
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,235
be able to move everybody that plays this game to tears in the same way.

449
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:07,634
In the actual game, after a mysterious hero appears,

450
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:11,915
you clear the mission and continue on.

451
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:14,856
You can bring the player's feelings to the next mission.

452
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:17,016
And this comes at the very end of the mission.

453
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,277
So at the very end of the mission, you beat that mission,

454
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,797
and then this cutscene plays.

455
00:33:21,138 --> 00:33:23,658
And the idea there is that we've put you in a state where

456
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:25,619
you have no choice but to play the next mission.

457
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:26,679
You've got to know what's going on.

458
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:28,580
Yes, that's the theory in Dante's case.

459
00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:30,773
He can easily defeat Yurizen.

460
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,173
He can also use Devil Trigger to defeat him.

461
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:33,013
He'll be in the FMA for a month.

462
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:33,553
Then, Kakusei.

463
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:35,354
The birth of the Demon Sword Dante.

464
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:36,414
The birth of the Shinmajin.

465
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:37,014
Yurizen's second form.

466
00:33:37,054 --> 00:33:39,955
Yurizen's final form.

467
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:01,934
And then for his awakening, we have the birth of Devil Sword Dante.

468
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,655
The birth of Sin Majin Dante.

469
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:07,295
Then he obliterates Yuruzen's second form, and then his third form!

470
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:10,916
Okay, let's go to V now.

471
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:11,416
Let's go to V now.

472
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:31,258
In order to defeat his younger brother, he could only do one thing with the crumbling flesh and feelings.

473
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:36,240
He needed to separate man from devil with the strength of the Yamato.

474
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,563
And eventually, the man became a true devil.

475
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,806
This is my last request.

476
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,014
I told you we were going to spoil the crap out of this.

477
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:27,456
So what ends up happening then is V's awakening is the return of Vergil.

478
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:51,616
And to really play that up then, we have both V and Urizen in incredibly weakened states.

479
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,917
They are both near death.

480
00:35:55,858 --> 00:36:08,364
V's setbacks then are that he's been thrown out as the unneeded portion of Vergil.

481
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:10,505
He doesn't have the power to fight for himself.

482
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:12,986
He needs these familiars to fight for him.

483
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,848
And his body is continuously falling apart.

484
00:36:21,022 --> 00:36:30,069
But then the awakening is that he returns as Vergil.

485
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:38,575
And this is how we have our three different player characters, our three different heroes,

486
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,658
how they have their different setbacks and different awakenings implemented in this game.

487
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:46,281
The purpose of all of these projects is to

488
00:36:48,048 --> 00:36:52,090
It's important to make clear what your goal is.

489
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,471
Here's one really important thing, though.

490
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:59,333
You want to have a clear objective for every scene, every event, every element in your game.

491
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:01,754
What is the goal?

492
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:04,235
This time, we're moving the user's emotions like this.

493
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:06,616
If you don't have a clear goal, you can't create a scene.

494
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:08,456
Think about what your goal is for this scene.

495
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:20,398
Without a clear objective, you can't create your scene.

496
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:23,442
You absolutely need that objective or else you're just kind of creating willy-nilly.

497
00:37:23,462 --> 00:37:26,825
You need that objective to have a clear idea for what to do with that scene.

498
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:30,429
If you're working on a scene and you don't know what the purpose is,

499
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:32,872
ask the person who ordered the work,

500
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:33,993
what the purpose of the scene is.

501
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:42,736
So for any of you guys that are making something right now, maybe you're working on a scene, maybe you're working on something,

502
00:37:43,336 --> 00:37:48,178
and maybe somebody's told you, like basically given you this as work, like make this scene, do this thing in this game.

503
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:52,060
If you're not clear on what that objective is, please go to that person and say,

504
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,402
hold on, hold on, what is the objective here? What are we trying to accomplish?

505
00:37:55,422 --> 00:38:03,525
I haven't talked about the action part at all, but I think we should talk a little more about the action part.

506
00:38:05,135 --> 00:38:07,977
So I mean I guess a lot of you guys probably know Ethan O'Suhan.

507
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:10,499
You know that he's a big action game director.

508
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,561
So I would assume that a lot of you guys came here

509
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,902
because you wanted to hear about action game design, right?

510
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:15,062
Right.

511
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:17,944
All right.

512
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:18,285
All right.

513
00:38:18,325 --> 00:38:18,665
I'll do it.

514
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:21,087
Yes.

515
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:22,447
I'll do it about action.

516
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:24,509
Here's the action part.

517
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:29,172
This is what happens when you clear an action game after a lot of hard work.

518
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:29,312
Look.

519
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:29,452
Yes.

520
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:42,618
This is the feeling you want to go for when someone's playing your action game.

521
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:48,900
This is the feeling you want to go for when someone's playing your action game.

522
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,541
The way we see it, this has not changed at all in the last 30 years.

523
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,662
Action games have always been about this.

524
00:38:56,402 --> 00:39:03,064
The way we see it, this has not changed at all in the last 30 years.

525
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:06,805
Everybody that is playing an action game, they are playing it so they can get this feeling.

526
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:12,396
What should we do to make the user feel this feeling of yes?

527
00:39:12,596 --> 00:39:13,877
We should find a way to clear the game ourselves.

528
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:16,658
And we should practice to realize this way.

529
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:20,979
And I think it's important not to give up on this practice.

530
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:36,266
So you want the player to be able to figure out the trick to beating that particular enemy,

531
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:38,127
to winning that particular event themselves.

532
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:43,030
And then you want them to be able to brush up that technique and get better at it,

533
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,091
so that they can then finally beat that thing.

534
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:49,212
And the other important thing is, make sure that the players don't give up on themselves.

535
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:52,414
And this is kind of vague, so it might be hard to actually envision how to do this,

536
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:53,434
but this is the way we see it.

537
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:11,557
So, let's go. To find a way to win with your own strength means to see through the enemy's actions.

538
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,479
So that first trick...

539
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,780
Sorry, I'm going to keep going.

540
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,240
Sorry.

541
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,842
Figure out the trick to winning yourself then. Well, what does that involve?

542
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:27,525
Well, we think that one way that you can implement it, it involves observing the enemy's behavior.

543
00:40:29,022 --> 00:40:33,963
And then you want to, as you can see here, provide a proper balance of risk and return for them as they're playing.

544
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:38,445
Make the player feel like they figured that pattern out on their own, without any help.

545
00:40:39,465 --> 00:40:47,387
And you'll want to design your enemies in a way that the player can look at that enemy and instantaneously know,

546
00:40:47,427 --> 00:40:49,668
okay, this is probably maybe envisioned.

547
00:40:57,983 --> 00:41:01,205
this is probably how the enemy is going to act or behave.

548
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:05,988
I think we need to design a design that doesn't make a difference in the ethnic or national areas.

549
00:41:06,909 --> 00:41:10,732
So you want to make sure that ideally, ideally, you can create that design

550
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:16,736
based on concepts that aren't influenced by differences in regions, cultures, whatever. Ideally.

551
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:19,378
Finding the enemy pattern by the user itself

552
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:22,140
leads to the feeling of, I'm great, right?

553
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:40,563
We do think that having the player be able to actually observe the enemy's behavior and

554
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:45,145
actually kind of figure that out on their own, that really does link to that feeling

555
00:41:45,165 --> 00:41:47,286
of accomplishment when they've beaten that enemy.

556
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,841
Also in terms of enemy design, as we just talked about here,

557
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:55,203
if you have, say, you have an enemy that is powering up for an attack,

558
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,284
you know that attack is probably going to hit pretty hard.

559
00:41:57,645 --> 00:42:01,587
So the player then will almost instinctively know to get the heck out of the way.

560
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:04,428
Speaking of enemy design,

561
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:09,511
it's natural for big guys to punch and attack with their fists,

562
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:10,251
but this is very important.

563
00:42:10,271 --> 00:42:11,372
Or, as another example...

564
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,416
enemies with really, really big fists are probably going to punch hard.

565
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:22,557
That kind of thing.

566
00:42:22,577 --> 00:42:26,360
I've had a design with a big blade on my elbow before.

567
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,664
I thought, you're not going to attack with your elbow,

568
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:34,626
but when I was told it was different, I was like, that's not right!

569
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:39,330
Well, we actually had one enemy at one point in one of Isono-san's games

570
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:43,133
where there was an enemy that had a really long blade.

571
00:42:43,881 --> 00:42:44,701
coming off the elbow.

572
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:45,702
And he's like, oh, OK, OK.

573
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:46,984
So this enemy is going to go like this

574
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:48,105
and is going to attack like this, right?

575
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:49,066
And the game designer was like, no.

576
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:51,829
He was like, what are you talking about?

577
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:53,290
Of course, that's what he has to do.

578
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,953
All right.

579
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:56,533
JAPANESE SPEAKER 1.0

580
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:58,555
JAPANESE SPEAKER 1.0

581
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:10,219
Now, some more examples from Devil May Cry 5 now.

582
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:12,501
We have a couple of different designs that we were looking at,

583
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:16,024
some thumbnails that we were looking at for a character called Riot,

584
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:17,104
an enemy called Riot.

585
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:19,606
We used this one.

586
00:43:21,328 --> 00:43:23,389
For Riot, we ended up going with this one.

587
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:28,993
This is important because on the right side,

588
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:31,435
there is a circle with a picture of a rotating saw drawn on it.

589
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,975
This is important.

590
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:39,875
So we decided to use this design because we knew that the enemy would definitely roll, charge, and attack.

591
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:42,557
Now we ended up going with this one for this particular enemy that we're talking about.

592
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:47,480
The reason we did that is because the enemy is going to have this spinning, spinning like hedgehog-like attack.

593
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:49,501
A certain blue hedgehog perhaps.

594
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:56,166
And because they have that attack, this design clearly communicates to the player that

595
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:58,027
that's what they're going to do when they come at me.

596
00:43:59,228 --> 00:44:00,289
Next, we used this red one.

597
00:44:03,029 --> 00:44:10,251
And we have this other one called Fury. You can see this red guy here.

598
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:17,033
And the reason that we designed this one like this, you'll notice that he's standing up

599
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,694
straighter than the other ones. And the reason he does that is because

600
00:44:27,546 --> 00:44:34,150
the player sees that and instantaneously they know that this one is going to act more intelligently than the other ones.

601
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:41,353
In Capcom, the red enemy is strong, and this one is red, so it's a symbol of strength.

602
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:44,015
It was called the Red Alimer during development.

603
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:50,098
We also have this thing in Capcom where basically whenever we have a really strong enemy, that enemy is probably going to be red.

604
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:52,599
Red seems to be the symbolism we like to go with that.

605
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,581
So during development, we called this guy the Red Alimer.

606
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,422
I didn't say much.

607
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,043
Okay.

608
00:45:02,063 --> 00:45:06,246
So next, we need to practice the techniques to achieve the strategy.

609
00:45:06,326 --> 00:45:07,928
We need to practice the operations.

610
00:45:07,948 --> 00:45:10,950
We need to have intuitive operations.

611
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:15,933
Okay, so then how do players then brush up the technique that they need to succeed

612
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:17,414
while they can practice moves?

613
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:23,299
To do that, we need to be able to implement direct, responsive, and tactile control.

614
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:26,241
We've got to have proper tutorials as well so that the players...

615
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:28,213
are able to understand what they need to do.

616
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:42,059
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA But then, we also need to be able to design the game in a way that they

617
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,922
can practice good judgment, that they've made the correct decision when they're fighting

618
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:47,982
against a particular enemy.

619
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:52,124
And one thing that we found is that success should be non-binary.

620
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:55,901
Even if players are having trouble with an enemy,

621
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:58,703
they should be able to tell if they're doing a little better

622
00:45:58,783 --> 00:45:59,864
or not doing as well.

623
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:11,113
YOSHIMASA ENJI, SPEAKING JAPANESE Now, an example of that

624
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:12,494
is we have this move called Max Act.

625
00:46:12,594 --> 00:46:15,717
So in Devil May Cry 5, there are three different ways

626
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:17,858
that you can succeed in actually pulling this move off.

627
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:19,940
YOSHIMASA ENJI, SPEAKING JAPANESE

628
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:24,256
So take a look at this first.

629
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:25,136
This is what happens.

630
00:46:25,257 --> 00:46:26,177
He's about to play the video.

631
00:46:26,557 --> 00:46:29,419
This is what happens when you hit that perfect frame.

632
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:34,162
You get a full charge on your weapon.

633
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:40,527
And then if you don't quite get the timing,

634
00:46:40,827 --> 00:46:45,430
oh, you don't quite get the timing,

635
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,151
then you can see in the second one

636
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:50,393
there that you get basically one out of one charge out of three.

637
00:46:50,613 --> 00:46:52,534
And then finally, if.

638
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:58,040
If you at least try it but you completely fail, you'll still get a tiny tiny bit of a charge.

639
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:10,205
Well, here's a fun fact. In Devil May Cry 4, we had the same move. We had this move called Max Act.

640
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:15,708
And it turns out basically there was one frame where you could hit that button and you would actually get that charge.

641
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:27,417
But we thought was basically, if it's that hard and there's absolutely no way to get any kind of benefit from it,

642
00:47:27,457 --> 00:47:30,900
unless you hit that very specific frame, people just kind of gave up.

643
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,702
They just kind of stopped doing it because they could never really pull it off well.

644
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:38,607
In Devil May Cry 5, the number of frames for big success hasn't changed much,

645
00:47:38,627 --> 00:47:41,649
but we've made it so that the wider range of mid-success and small success is possible.

646
00:47:41,669 --> 00:47:45,213
When a user challenges something, the closer they get to success, the better feedback they get.

647
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:51,655
And so this is where we implemented some of that non-binary design.

648
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:53,556
We said, OK, for Devil May Cry 5, then,

649
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:55,858
let's make it so that there are these three different stages.

650
00:47:56,338 --> 00:47:58,819
There's the perfect stage if you hit it with just the right frame,

651
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,542
and then gradually have more and more frames

652
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:04,143
where you're going to get less of a benefit,

653
00:48:04,183 --> 00:48:06,264
but you're still going to get something out of trying it.

654
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:12,228
We're doing a few things to make sure that we don't give up on the challenge.

655
00:48:15,163 --> 00:48:20,787
So what do we do then to try and make sure that people, players, don't give up on themselves as they're playing the game?

656
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:28,511
Well, for DMC5, we've changed the continue system.

657
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,432
So that's one way that we've kind of tried to do that.

658
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:32,433
We're going to go into a little bit more detail on that in a second.

659
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:34,775
Another thing is giving the battles a balance where players...

660
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:43,720
hopefully aren't just totally obliterating the enemy,

661
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,342
and vice versa, the enemies aren't totally obliterating a player.

662
00:48:46,362 --> 00:48:49,926
That there's, that, hopefully they're having a pretty decent challenge,

663
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:53,190
and it's not too one-sided.

664
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,791
As we showed Dante earlier,

665
00:48:54,811 --> 00:48:57,374
we're going to add the next part that we're curious about,

666
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:58,475
so that he doesn't give up.

667
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:03,331
And then another thing that we do then is, just like we showed you earlier with Dante,

668
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:09,675
try to lay out the game so that you have these key moments where players get to that moment

669
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:14,459
and then they want to find out on their own what is going to happen next.

670
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:20,743
We do high-end graphics simply because we want to see more of the game.

671
00:49:22,932 --> 00:49:28,237
For Deadly May Cry 5, we tried our best to really make a game that looked as visually stunning as possible,

672
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:32,060
and we feel that that also kind of fed into that same idea of,

673
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,943
well, if it looks this good, people will kind of want to keep playing to see what comes next.

674
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:43,169
So now we'll talk a little bit about the continue system that we just mentioned.

675
00:49:51,773 --> 00:49:54,954
In Dead Man Cry 5, you have a couple of different options when you die in battle.

676
00:49:54,994 --> 00:49:57,135
You can use a gold orb if you want, and that'll bring you back.

677
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:00,155
But we also gave players the option to actually use red orbs this time.

678
00:50:12,316 --> 00:50:14,577
And we very specifically made sure to, again,

679
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,598
take that non-binary approach with this design.

680
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:20,498
So that there were three different amounts of orbs

681
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,679
that you could spend, and then amounts of life and whatnot

682
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:25,620
that you could get back when you revive.

683
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,641
When a game is over, the user is the one who is most stressed.

684
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:32,502
So if you give a new, bigger stress,

685
00:50:32,622 --> 00:50:36,903
the user will stop trying, so we took this approach.

686
00:50:37,423 --> 00:50:40,764
We did this because we realized that players

687
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:41,805
feel the most stress.

688
00:50:42,697 --> 00:50:44,458
when they get a game over.

689
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:48,379
And we don't want them to feel any more stress beyond that

690
00:50:48,419 --> 00:50:51,439
because that is certainly going to be plenty of reason to quit playing the game.

691
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:55,580
So we give players the chance to choose themselves here.

692
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,820
They can say, OK, I'm going to bet on myself.

693
00:51:13,058 --> 00:51:15,639
I think I can beat this enemy now with this much life left,

694
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:18,100
so I'm not spending any more orbs than I absolutely need to.

695
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:27,663
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA And ideally what happens then is,

696
00:51:27,983 --> 00:51:30,384
if they get a game over after that, well, it was their decision.

697
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:32,445
They bet on themselves and they lost that bet.

698
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,765
So they hopefully don't blame the game.

699
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:39,607
They blame themselves for not quite measuring up their own ability.

700
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:47,556
I think it's important to have the feeling of hitting your face, not the controller or game console.

701
00:51:47,576 --> 00:51:48,456
That's all. Thank you very much.

702
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:21,698
While we're doing Q&A here, how are we doing on time?

703
00:52:21,718 --> 00:52:22,698
Let's see here.

704
00:52:22,718 --> 00:52:24,159
All right, we've got seven minutes or so.

705
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,081
We'll just keep using the room until people kick us out,

706
00:52:28,121 --> 00:52:28,421
I guess.

707
00:52:28,441 --> 00:52:29,882
And then if anybody has anything else,

708
00:52:29,922 --> 00:52:32,263
or if anybody wants Ito-san to sign anything,

709
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:33,424
we could probably go out into the hallway.

710
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:37,006
In the meantime, during the Q&A, we

711
00:52:37,026 --> 00:52:39,727
had this video that we made that we would show internally

712
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,448
for different events.

713
00:52:42,548 --> 00:52:45,569
approval meetings, green light meetings, and that kind of stuff to kind of show how the game's going,

714
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:50,290
maybe a first party, and we thought it'd be really fun to kind of show that in the background here

715
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:56,632
as we're doing Q&A. So with that being said, Kyoko, you're better at interpreting than I am.

716
00:52:57,453 --> 00:53:04,955
Okay, we have people lined up. Let's get to it. Okay, hello. When you are designing a system

717
00:53:05,895 --> 00:53:11,917
and you have a certain objective that you want to achieve, but your system is too complicated

718
00:53:12,736 --> 00:53:19,080
and takes too long to complete, how do you go about pairing that down to achieve your objective?

719
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,423
So the question then is, when we have a system that we're trying to implement, we expect that

720
00:53:24,483 --> 00:53:28,125
we have a specific way that we want to implement it, and it turns out that it's not, it's going

721
00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:32,128
to be too complex to actually implement it that way, how do we then pair it down the right way,

722
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:38,792
right? Actually, I mean more for the, it's too complex for the player, it will, and it's too

723
00:53:38,852 --> 00:53:40,633
drawn out in gameplay. Okay.

724
00:53:41,229 --> 00:53:43,271
So it's too complex for the player to turn on and out of gameplay.

725
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:46,694
So for the player then, we want to adjust this system.

726
00:53:46,934 --> 00:53:48,535
Yes. How do we cut it down?

727
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:54,040
What is the purpose of the game?

728
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,062
The purpose and means are like a tree.

729
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:57,283
There are ways to achieve your goal.

730
00:53:57,383 --> 00:54:01,026
I don't think it's a problem if the means become your goal.

731
00:54:01,186 --> 00:54:02,887
But if you are conscious of the fact that it becomes a fine tree,

732
00:54:07,774 --> 00:54:09,895
What do you want the player to do next?

733
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,656
How do you want them to feel?

734
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:13,356
What do you want them to do?

735
00:54:14,537 --> 00:54:15,978
This is called reverse engineering.

736
00:54:16,038 --> 00:54:19,920
If you go back to what the user thinks at that moment,

737
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:25,022
you can go back to a bigger goal and simply reverse the calculation.

738
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:25,743
Was it difficult?

739
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:29,745
It might have been difficult.

740
00:54:29,765 --> 00:54:32,926
Good luck.

741
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:34,047
So, yeah, we were talking...

742
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:35,588
Oh, someone asked a question.

743
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:40,875
So yeah, we were talking earlier about the goals and the steps

744
00:54:40,935 --> 00:54:42,776
and how to get to that.

745
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:46,158
And there's not always just one solution or one answer to it.

746
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:50,401
So what we do is we sort of map out the trees, the branches,

747
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:51,601
on how we can get there.

748
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,083
But like we said at the very top,

749
00:54:54,123 --> 00:54:56,484
we use this sort of reverse engineering tactic

750
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:59,886
of thinking about how the user is going to experience

751
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:01,327
and what we want them to feel.

752
00:55:01,935 --> 00:55:06,618
And when we see that big picture and we sort of land on or nail on that idea of

753
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:11,760
this is how we want them to feel and get to it, then it actually becomes a lot

754
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,762
more simpler and we're able to simplify it into the system.

755
00:55:16,823 --> 00:55:18,544
Thank you.

756
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:19,064
Who's next?

757
00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:21,125
We'll go left to right.

758
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:21,405
Okay.

759
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:26,241
All right, so a lot of things that we see with Delta Blade Cry as a series,

760
00:55:26,261 --> 00:55:30,245
you know, Dragon's Dogma, is that these games have a lot of after content.

761
00:55:30,345 --> 00:55:33,449
Like, you know, in three you could play as Vergil, in four you could play as Vergil,

762
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:35,011
you could play as Trish and Lady.

763
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,014
And as games get more expensive and high fidelity...

764
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:44,462
Has this posed problems in production? Because in 5, you know, we don't, like you had just mentioned, we don't see

765
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:51,024
Nero's devil trigger until the end of the game. But this makes your next playthrough on Son of Sparta potentially something completely different.

766
00:55:51,044 --> 00:55:52,084
You have the devil bringer,

767
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:57,506
the entire game now. There's new enemies and what's surprising the most about this new boss moves.

768
00:55:57,946 --> 00:56:02,827
And that there's this whole new level of the game. The essentially the entire experience is redesigned.

769
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:09,965
for a post 15 hour experience. So in this new industry, well not new industry, but you know

770
00:56:10,046 --> 00:56:13,569
as games get more and more expensive, how did that affect your design philosophies or how did that

771
00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:18,254
affect design in general? So the question then is how do we take into account the idea that we were

772
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:25,401
going to have all of this post game content, post game content, either way, basically that

773
00:56:26,222 --> 00:56:27,323
we were going to have new stuff.

774
00:56:27,892 --> 00:56:32,454
that the players would be able to do, new content that players would be able to experience

775
00:56:33,054 --> 00:56:34,295
after you've beaten the game once, right?

776
00:56:34,635 --> 00:56:34,835
Right.

777
00:56:43,238 --> 00:56:44,798
Question in Japanese

778
00:56:56,087 --> 00:57:00,931
So, in my case, all the content, even post-release, that's already planned out from the very,

779
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:02,432
very beginning.

780
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:27,878
And so it's already in the planning stages of the planning document.

781
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:32,140
And it comes down to what timing we're gonna be able to release it.

782
00:57:32,601 --> 00:57:34,922
And there's sort of a cycle or pattern to that.

783
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:37,724
So it's all very much a calculated effort.

784
00:57:37,784 --> 00:57:41,226
From the very beginning, we have a roadmap, and we kind of slot that in.

785
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:45,408
I even take into consideration, if we run out of time,

786
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,229
this is what's gonna happen.

787
00:57:47,249 --> 00:57:51,032
That is even included in our planning from the very beginning.

788
00:57:51,728 --> 00:57:53,749
And if I can elaborate on that a little bit, for DMC5,

789
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:56,791
I mean, this goes back specifically to that retreat

790
00:57:57,731 --> 00:57:58,891
that we showed you guys the picture of.

791
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:01,593
It was at that retreat that we kind of laid out

792
00:58:01,613 --> 00:58:03,333
the foundation for what this project was gonna be.

793
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:07,775
And also, DMC5 being a DMC game, there are expectations.

794
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:09,376
There are expectations that people are gonna be able

795
00:58:09,396 --> 00:58:12,177
to have new experiences on their playthroughs

796
00:58:12,377 --> 00:58:13,158
after the first playthrough.

797
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:16,859
So Itsuno-san totally had that in mind from the beginning

798
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:18,540
in terms of this is all the content

799
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,640
that needs to be in this game.

800
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:21,261
Right, thank you.

801
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:22,280
Cool.

802
00:58:23,661 --> 00:58:27,223
Maybe one more until they kick us out, like Matt said.

803
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:28,963
OK, hi.

804
00:58:29,544 --> 00:58:31,264
My question is about technique.

805
00:58:32,185 --> 00:58:34,926
Devil May Cry games are really known for their really deep

806
00:58:35,046 --> 00:58:36,046
combat systems.

807
00:58:36,507 --> 00:58:39,528
And so my question is whether Itsuno-san

808
00:58:39,568 --> 00:58:41,529
is aware of the ongoing conversation

809
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:46,111
around the changes from DMC4 with regards to DMC5 inertia?

810
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:49,512
And what he thinks about those unintended advanced player

811
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:51,093
techniques like guard flying?

812
00:58:51,857 --> 00:59:01,686
OK, so you're curious to hear very specifically from Sun's opinion on the idea that inertia has been kind of changed since DMC4.

813
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:06,590
And we've changed it for what in DMC5 we do it a different way, right?

814
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:09,632
There's inertia doesn't necessarily show up in the same moves that you would expect.

815
00:59:09,973 --> 00:59:13,736
So is he aware of that discussion that players are having on the Internet?

816
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:18,199
Yeah. And how like as a designer, you sort of approach those ideas of.

817
00:59:19,178 --> 00:59:21,819
players finding these sort of edges of a system.

818
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:22,780
OK.

819
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,880
OK.

820
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,283
Japanese overlapping dialogue

821
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:57,445
Japanese overlapping dialogue

822
00:59:57,485 --> 00:59:59,386
Japanese overlapping dialogue

823
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:00,687
Japanese overlapping dialogue

824
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:02,729
Japanese overlapping dialogue

825
01:00:02,749 --> 01:00:04,010
Japanese overlapping dialogue

826
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,331
Japanese overlapping dialogue

827
01:00:11,932 --> 01:00:13,713
check it and if it's interesting, we'll adopt it.

828
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:18,776
This is a tradition in Capcom games.

829
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:21,897
So even if we find bugs,

830
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:26,280
if it makes sense, and action-wise,

831
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,881
we feel like we can keep it in,

832
01:00:28,981 --> 01:00:31,823
we'll be like, okay, well, this makes sense and it works,

833
01:00:31,883 --> 01:00:32,723
so let's keep it in.

834
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:39,847
We go through a very thorough, obviously, quality control and check process,

835
01:00:40,347 --> 01:00:40,547
but...

836
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,573
Amongst our, I think he meant dev team staff,

837
01:00:43,613 --> 01:00:44,855
we have top, top players.

838
01:00:44,955 --> 01:00:48,359
So we're very, very thorough with the checking.

839
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,383
But even with that, if we find something

840
01:00:51,503 --> 01:00:54,927
that actually works, then we have done that,

841
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:56,168
not just in Devil May Cry,

842
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,171
but we have sort of a tradition at Capcom

843
01:00:58,211 --> 01:01:00,674
that we'll wing it, we'll put it in there if it works.

844
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:02,159
And I'll elaborate on this one too.

845
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:06,222
Devil May Cry 1 is famous for really starting from a bug.

846
01:01:06,242 --> 01:01:08,684
The idea that you could launch the enemy into the air

847
01:01:08,724 --> 01:01:10,445
and then juggle them with these moves.

848
01:01:10,886 --> 01:01:13,828
So we've had different instances like that

849
01:01:13,948 --> 01:01:16,070
in Devil May Cry games and Capcom games throughout time.

850
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:19,052
For the momentum that you're talking about specifically,

851
01:01:19,793 --> 01:01:22,795
our designers, obviously they play the heck out

852
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,196
of all the different Devil May Cry games

853
01:01:24,256 --> 01:01:25,577
before we even start working on DMC5.

854
01:01:27,442 --> 01:01:30,364
They very specifically implement these systems with a reason.

855
01:01:30,825 --> 01:01:32,827
So you're talking about momentum, right?

856
01:01:32,847 --> 01:01:36,711
You're talking about how Nero, for instance, Nero can have certain moves where he can keep

857
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:38,272
that momentum even after he does enemy step, right?

858
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:43,237
Well, our designers decided that they didn't want that to happen because they want to give

859
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:46,600
players, the players, more choice when doing that enemy step.

860
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,512
If you have that momentum and you do the enemy step,

861
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:52,054
OK, now you're forced to go in that direction.

862
01:01:52,194 --> 01:01:54,616
But by taking that away, now the player can jump up.

863
01:01:54,656 --> 01:01:55,377
They can jump straight.

864
01:01:55,417 --> 01:01:56,057
They can jump back.

865
01:01:56,077 --> 01:01:56,778
They can jump forward.

866
01:01:57,218 --> 01:01:59,520
And they wanted to give players choice.

867
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,622
So that's specifically for this instance,

868
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:02,783
that's what we had in mind.

869
01:02:06,926 --> 01:02:07,167
Done?

870
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:08,027
Yeah.

871
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:09,088
You're giving me the sign.

872
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:10,117
OK.

873
01:02:10,878 --> 01:02:12,439
So yeah, we can go outside.

874
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,082
And again, if anybody wants to have Itsuno-san sign anything,

875
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:18,305
our lovely brand manager Charlene might have some pins for people.

876
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:18,885
Woo!

877
01:02:20,547 --> 01:02:21,147
Thanks a lot.

878
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:24,811
Thank you.

879
01:02:24,831 --> 01:02:25,171
Thank you all.

880
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:27,373
Hideaki Itsuno is back!
