1
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:07,485
Hello guys, thanks for coming out.

2
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:11,111
So yeah, this talk is called Hitman Levels of Social Spaces,

3
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,074
the Social Anthropology of Level Design.

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,940
My name is Mette and I'm from IO Interactive.

5
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:21,142
Oh, and I've also been told to just ask you to put your phones on silence.

6
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:23,324
Just in case.

7
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:26,146
So this talk is divided into three parts.

8
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,168
The first is the context.

9
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:30,870
I just want to tell you just a little bit about me and

10
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:34,153
IO, what Hitman is, in case you haven't played.

11
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:37,156
What it means to be a level designer at IO Interactive.

12
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:40,263
Then I want to tell you the story.

13
00:00:40,883 --> 00:00:42,864
So this is pretty much about how I,

14
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,486
when I started IOWN, we launched HITMAN 2016

15
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:46,926
and how that went down.

16
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:49,187
I want to talk about a specific level

17
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,008
that was super popular and a level

18
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,849
that is super close to my heart as well.

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,310
And then I want to introduce you

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,971
to the concept of social spaces.

21
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:00,173
And then we have the learnings.

22
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,693
I want to tell you about how we used social spaces to look at all the levels and compare

23
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,097
them in Hitman 1 and what that meant for us going into creating Hitman 2.

24
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:16,127
All right, so this is me some years ago.

25
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:18,669
I just got my first computer.

26
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,811
I was sitting in an exciting day

27
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,632
and I got to paint the walls of my room as well.

28
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:24,394
It's a jungle theme in case you can't see it.

29
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:29,118
So I work at I-O, which is right there.

30
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,260
That's Denmark in case you don't know.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,723
Denmark, we made Lego.

32
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:37,985
That's us, so you're welcome.

33
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:43,200
Then there was an incident with a giraffe a few years ago.

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,041
I don't know if you remember.

35
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:45,823
We killed a giraffe and showed it to a bunch of kids.

36
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:46,504
It was awful.

37
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:49,528
But anyways, in case, maybe now you remember us.

38
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,152
And we have a queen.

39
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,013
It's a monarchy.

40
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:53,734
It's very weird.

41
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,117
She doesn't really decide much,

42
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,040
but she's pretty cool, actually.

43
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,491
And we make Hitman, very proud of Hitman.

44
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:05,073
So what I'll be talking about is Hitman

45
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:07,574
that we call internally Hitman 2016.

46
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:12,016
And I'm going to talk about Hitman 2.

47
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:14,897
So what's special about these two particular installments

48
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:15,517
of the series?

49
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:17,338
That's a quite old series.

50
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:18,538
The first Hitman was in 2000.

51
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:25,469
But here's where we really defined the game in a way.

52
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,837
Like we went back to the concepts of blood money,

53
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:33,343
like where we make these deadly sandboxes as we call them.

54
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,432
We went back to a different recipe, a different design

55
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:36,893
mantra.

56
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:40,215
We wanted to talk about freedom of approach and creativity,

57
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:43,757
really giving the player the chance

58
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:46,539
to design how they want to play the game

59
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,860
and do their own approach.

60
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,681
And of course, that meant a lot for the level design as well.

61
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,537
So level design at IAO.

62
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:55,238
The reason why I have this slide,

63
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,558
because I know a lot of you probably know

64
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:57,339
what level design is,

65
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,121
is because I heard that it's a little bit different at IAO

66
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,562
and I assume it's different everywhere.

67
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:05,583
It seems like such a broad field.

68
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:07,884
So I thought I would just want to try and explain

69
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,345
what is it actually we do at IAO.

70
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:12,357
So we think.

71
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:14,758
Design is, of course, as you know,

72
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:18,019
about coming up with different approaches, like ideas,

73
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,060
and solving different problems.

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,981
And the level designer is quite central in just coming up

75
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:25,502
with stuff for the levels.

76
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:29,163
We're often being asked to pitch the levels, pitch targets,

77
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:31,264
locations, anything.

78
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:34,305
We're a really central part of the early process of this.

79
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,906
And preferably, we should try and do

80
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,247
something a little bit different, little creative,

81
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:39,527
little stuff, right?

82
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:47,493
Then we're part of the layout process of course and this is where we work very closely with environment artists our artistic counterpart

83
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:52,497
the ones who knows how things should actually look and

84
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:53,717
How it looks realistic

85
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,940
Yeah, and yeah, it's an important process

86
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,681
that we try and keep outside the editor.

87
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,261
We do a lot of paper prototypes

88
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,462
and a lot of different markups, layouts,

89
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:05,263
to see how it feels.

90
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:08,444
And I will say, when we do it for Hitman levels,

91
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:10,265
we talk a lot about the different activities

92
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:11,285
that we want to have in a level.

93
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,166
So we mark up activities first,

94
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:16,167
like different disguises and stuff like that,

95
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,528
and then we try to look at how would it actually feel,

96
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,509
like how would you represent it

97
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,730
in a physical way afterwards?

98
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:26,068
Then we mark up in the editor with gray box, white box,

99
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:27,269
all that stuff, whatever you call it.

100
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,873
And then the environment artist tells us that's weird.

101
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,875
You wouldn't have that many covers everywhere.

102
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:39,539
And then we implement pretty much everything.

103
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:43,322
My producer said when she had to explain what level design means

104
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,143
for other people, or to other people,

105
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,585
she would say it starts and ends with the level designer.

106
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,141
or starts and ends with level design.

107
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:52,603
We implement pretty much everything

108
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:53,524
that goes into the game.

109
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:56,727
We touch everything at some point,

110
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,870
and that's everything from set pieces

111
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,452
that game designers make for us,

112
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:04,214
and different acts that the animators make for us,

113
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,496
dialogue, everything.

114
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,200
And then we talk.

115
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:13,924
Meetings and stand-ups, and we constantly, constantly

116
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,706
talk to other people.

117
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:17,948
The level designer is a product owner at IOM.

118
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,092
So as the main level designer on a project, you own the level.

119
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,635
And you're responsible for making sure

120
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:26,577
that everything flies and that you talk

121
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,859
to everyone in the team.

122
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:33,481
And we have an awesome team, really, really talented people.

123
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:36,584
And then we do janitor work.

124
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:39,166
I guess this is the same everywhere.

125
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:42,850
People ask me at the end of a production, what do you do?

126
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,011
I just say I'm a janitor.

127
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:44,852
I'm a janitor.

128
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:47,635
Just walk the halls of the levels

129
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,656
and make sure things are still working.

130
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:54,954
Yes, this is what it looks like when we're in the editor.

131
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:58,716
And this is just like a small, simple setup.

132
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,216
But the reason I'm showing you this

133
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,298
is because it's a really central part of what we do.

134
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:04,919
Apart from mocking everything up,

135
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,680
one of the most important things that we do

136
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,622
in a game like Hitman is making life,

137
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:14,224
creating drama situations, as we call them.

138
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:17,305
We borrow it a little bit from the world of theater.

139
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:20,027
We talk about dramas and acts and roles.

140
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,789
And this is just like a simple setup where you just have a guy who's on the phone.

141
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:28,530
I just want to show you this just for context so you know what it looks like.

142
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:34,553
All right, so another thing that's super central when we design levels.

143
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:37,735
is looking at trespass.

144
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:42,097
Where can you actually go when you start the level?

145
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:46,259
And this is a situation from Miami in Hitman 2,

146
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:47,319
it's the first level.

147
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,180
You're at a race event,

148
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:53,342
and right now I'm trying to get into a backstage area,

149
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:56,543
but I'm not allowed because it's a big public event

150
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,965
and back here it's like for employees only.

151
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:04,186
But if I become the mascot of the event, this cool flamingo,

152
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:07,409
obviously I can go there.

153
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,151
And all of a sudden, I'm allowed.

154
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,652
This is what we call social stealth.

155
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:12,694
So you try to blend in.

156
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:15,597
And this is what makes Hitman the best

157
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:17,779
assassin in the world, in our world,

158
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,283
is that he's willing to do anything to get

159
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:22,624
wherever he needs to go.

160
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,223
I just want to show you a quick video because I think someone else did a really, really

161
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:34,228
good job of showing you the different ways that you can infiltrate in our games.

162
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:37,810
Yeah, and I'm just going to show you this quick video.

163
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:45,756
All this time with each attempt, each creative assassination and each unique exit, you're

164
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:46,197
learning.

165
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,018
You're learning the level.

166
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:54,243
You know that you can get into the mansion by dropping down here or climbing over here

167
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,872
or popping in this window,

168
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,895
or going up from the pier,

169
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,458
or using a keycard,

170
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,380
or blowing up this wall,

171
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,044
or just walking in the front door.

172
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,727
You're learning the schedule of your targets.

173
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:19,391
You know that Francesca will come down to the lab on her own if the virus is destroyed,

174
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:23,095
or that Caruso will come to the observatory if the roof is opened up.

175
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:27,698
you're learning which disguises will let you into which parts of the mansion,

176
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:30,680
ways to separate the targets from their guards,

177
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,203
where to get keys and key cards, and which exits you can take.

178
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:42,048
Yes, and I actually recommend that video if you're into Hitman level design.

179
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,368
He's super talented.

180
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:48,310
So yeah, so that was the context,

181
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,272
me, IO, Hitman, level design rule.

182
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:52,893
You know everything now, so it's good.

183
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:54,655
Now I wanna talk about the story,

184
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:55,616
what actually happened.

185
00:08:57,257 --> 00:09:00,499
Yeah, and talk about this level that did really well.

186
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:07,053
Okay, so in 2016, sorry for the white screen, we launched.

187
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:09,936
And what was so special about this launch

188
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:12,779
was the fact that it was episodic.

189
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,721
It was the first AAA episodic game.

190
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:17,183
Maybe probably still the only one, I'm not sure.

191
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,267
And I had just started, right?

192
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:22,407
I was a new designer.

193
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:23,928
I was an intern at the time.

194
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:27,251
I was just trying to figure out how do you make a good level

195
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:28,972
in this crazy game?

196
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,352
Like, how do you actually do that?

197
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:36,436
And what happened was that we would get a Mesa score

198
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:38,257
for each level we launched.

199
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:41,479
And that makes for a super excellent case

200
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,522
for actually trying to find out how do we do it,

201
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,243
what works, what doesn't work.

202
00:09:49,244 --> 00:09:51,105
It's a little awkward for the work environment,

203
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:51,806
I will say.

204
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,927
At like two tables down,

205
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:55,848
someone got a different meta-score than you did.

206
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:56,789
That was really weird.

207
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:59,070
So I can't recommend it.

208
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,912
But it was super interesting.

209
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:04,673
And this got me started thinking, okay,

210
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:07,976
like what worked.

211
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:11,318
And Sapienza, which was the second level that we shipped,

212
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,661
was where we really seemed to convince at least the reviewers

213
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:19,725
that this was working out really well.

214
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:23,929
And it was really everyone that seemed to love this level.

215
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:28,092
It was our fans, and it was user research.

216
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,634
And I love that level personally as well.

217
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:33,176
It's this Italian coastal town you just saw.

218
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,178
It was the same one in the clip before.

219
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:40,860
And it was actually just awesome to go and work in that level because it was like sunny and awesome

220
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,540
So I just feel like I was on vacation when I was working on it was really strange

221
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:52,622
But yeah, I tried to sort of dive into you know, what makes this cool because it's it was it's you know

222
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:57,003
The weather is nice. It's a nice place. It's beautiful to look at this all these things

223
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:03,135
The village is, like you have this big villa in the middle

224
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:05,375
and then you have like this village that's surrounding it.

225
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,756
And the objective is to kill Silvio Caruso

226
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,917
and Francesca de Santis and destroy the virus

227
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:12,898
that they have in the basement.

228
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,518
But when I looked at the reviews,

229
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,019
everything they seemed to talk about

230
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,060
actually didn't have anything to do with the mission.

231
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:27,882
Like they were all describing how it felt to just be there.

232
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:31,184
to just walk around in this beautiful little village

233
00:11:31,564 --> 00:11:35,666
that had all these little stories and these weird characters

234
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:37,927
and these nice little places to visit.

235
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:41,912
So I love the ice cream guy.

236
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,633
He's going to figure it out.

237
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,117
So my question became, instead of like,

238
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:51,498
how do you make an awesome level,

239
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,720
I decided to dive into something a little bit different.

240
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,282
I wanted to find out how do you design everyday life,

241
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:00,024
and how do you design believable everyday life?

242
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:03,205
Because that really seemed to be what people were describing.

243
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:07,320
So I looked at my level design toolbox,

244
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,904
and I had all these cool concepts and terminology

245
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:16,406
to describe the gameplay elements of it,

246
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:19,108
like how do you make nice trespass and send trees

247
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:19,708
and blah, blah, blah.

248
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:21,650
But I didn't actually have anything

249
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,831
that could help me solve this problem

250
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:25,672
or answer this question.

251
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,054
So I went back to the books.

252
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:34,196
I had one semester of social anthropology in university,

253
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:37,598
and some of this stuff just seemed to click for me

254
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,639
when I started to think of it in that way instead.

255
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:45,501
So I went back to Pierre Bajeur and Erving Goffman.

256
00:12:47,122 --> 00:12:50,024
who are specialists within sociology,

257
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,706
and Evan Goffman is also from the field of anthropology.

258
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,849
And they describe some pretty cool things.

259
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,172
Pierre Bojo, he talks about social capital.

260
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,834
He also coined the term social space.

261
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,397
And his idea is basically that...

262
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:09,179
that we are all in this social marketplace exchanging capital.

263
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,561
And if you do one thing in one social group,

264
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:17,203
that's going to get you in, in a way, right?

265
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:22,545
Like, for instance, if I buy a fur coat in one social group,

266
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,286
that's going to make me look super cool.

267
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,007
In another one, they're going to hate me for it.

268
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:29,608
So you have to choose wisely as you're navigating

269
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:30,989
this social marketplace.

270
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,385
And Evan Goffman, he talks about front stage, back stage,

271
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:38,067
which I think is one of the most applicable things also

272
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:38,588
to Hitman.

273
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:42,912
So that's the idea that we have different personas depending

274
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,313
on where we are and what we're doing.

275
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,335
So when I'm standing here talking to you,

276
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:47,976
I'm front stage meta, but when I'm

277
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,498
crying in the bathroom afterwards,

278
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:52,620
I'm back stage meta.

279
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:52,841
So.

280
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:58,285
And I think this is really interesting when you start just looking at spaces.

281
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,807
What are the rules of spaces in general?

282
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:05,251
When you're in a job interview, it's a super tense situation.

283
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,473
The space has kind of been laid out for you.

284
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:08,533
It's going to be four chairs.

285
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:09,714
You're not allowed to sit in those.

286
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:11,676
It's going to be a table between you, and you're

287
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:15,459
going to sit in that one chair being judged by the other.

288
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,081
That is the setup of that room.

289
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:21,144
And you just know what that's going to be like.

290
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:22,625
It's going to be uncomfortable.

291
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:27,467
And it's designed to be uncomfortable, I think, in a way.

292
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,768
And the square, I think these are really interesting

293
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:34,729
because they don't have rules in a way.

294
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:37,730
Like, it's, they have them, but they're very vague.

295
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,950
There's no owner of it.

296
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,830
There's like not, like that one person

297
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,051
who's gonna be like, you know, put those pants back on.

298
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:45,632
You know, it's a lot more,

299
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:49,132
a lot of different spaces can meet in a space like this,

300
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,393
and a lot of different people,

301
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:52,353
and it can change depending on who's there.

302
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:55,507
a sports event.

303
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,250
You know, it's that, you know,

304
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,831
you can almost do anything in a sports event

305
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,132
as long as you're just, you know,

306
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,314
voting for the right team and doing it at the right time.

307
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,057
And I think this really applies to games as well.

308
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:14,140
When we design these spaces, and that could be any game,

309
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,301
it doesn't have to be Hitman,

310
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:19,805
we're designing rules of behavior,

311
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:24,629
and we're designing something that's going to tap

312
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:28,552
into your knowledge of how should I be in this space.

313
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:29,954
And it's very subtle.

314
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:32,576
Like, people walk into these spaces and they don't go like,

315
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:35,258
oh, now I'm in a church, I'm gonna be like this.

316
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,100
No, they just do it without.

317
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,421
without thinking about it.

318
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,523
And that's very, very powerful, I think.

319
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:44,787
OK, so I tried to.

320
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:50,446
take these concepts and make it applicable to Hitman levels.

321
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:55,450
So I divided it into two different categories,

322
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,471
so public-private.

323
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:59,634
Private just being anything that's trespass.

324
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,996
Public is anything that's available to you

325
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:03,137
when you start playing the game.

326
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,540
And then I defined it a little bit further than that.

327
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,301
I'm just going to go through all six of them,

328
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,943
just so you know, and give you examples.

329
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:12,785
So the first one is a public space.

330
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:21,800
This is the square. It's the park. It's like the space where you feel like you can kind of do anything and you won't be judged

331
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,321
There's going to be no expectations towards you

332
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:28,063
This is where the player can just like

333
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,924
Relax, wait, take their time

334
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,586
You know look in their inventory and not feel like an idiot

335
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:41,670
And these are just really great spots to just let the player breathe. They're great for starting locations

336
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,071
Then the next one is the public purpose space

337
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,993
and this is where we just ramp it up just a little bit.

338
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,396
Like there's still no one who owns the space necessarily,

339
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,958
but you feel like you should be doing

340
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:56,239
maybe a specific activity when you're here.

341
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,882
Like this, like a back alley, it could be a cul-de-sac,

342
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:01,223
it could be like a marketplace,

343
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,384
anything where you kind of,

344
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,606
you feel like you should have a purpose when you're here.

345
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:07,408
And these are great spaces for just like creating life

346
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:09,750
and flow in the level.

347
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:12,364
And we have the public rules space,

348
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,585
this is one of my favorite spaces.

349
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,585
So these are the spaces that are, again,

350
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:19,406
still available to you from the start,

351
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,607
but they have super strong social rules.

352
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:24,428
Like this is where you know that you should behave

353
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:27,309
in a very specific way, like the church or an ice cream shop.

354
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,187
And they're great for role playing, because they,

355
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,810
you know, as you walk in, the player knows,

356
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,412
like, this is the way I should behave,

357
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:37,054
but I can also go against it and break,

358
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:39,657
you know, break the rules, act like an idiot.

359
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:40,559
And that's fun too.

360
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,182
And they're really, really good for us

361
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,264
when we have to communicate trespass rules.

362
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,666
Because often when you have a super powerful rule space,

363
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,228
then the player will just know, OK, I'm not allowed

364
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:59,511
behind that door into the priest's private room.

365
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,632
Of course I'm not allowed there.

366
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:02,132
And I know there's going to be a priest.

367
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:03,513
I know there's going to be a choir boy.

368
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:05,194
I know all this stuff.

369
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,135
I don't have to tell the player anything.

370
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,177
It's awesome.

371
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:10,978
It's ripe for the picking.

372
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:14,944
Then we have the private space, kind of like the first public space.

373
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:15,765
It's very vague.

374
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:18,367
It's just, this is just trespass.

375
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:21,730
It's not necessarily going to be a lot of people or someone who owns the space or

376
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,452
any special activities.

377
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:26,655
But these are really, really important too.

378
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,798
Really important because these give you little breathers.

379
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:32,721
So you need to make sure that they're there as well.

380
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,782
They're represented as well.

381
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:36,204
You don't want to cram it with too much stuff.

382
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:39,424
Private professional.

383
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:43,587
Yeah, so these are like the most important for us

384
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:44,767
when we design spaces,

385
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,789
because this is where we can just,

386
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:48,950
there's gonna be specific rules.

387
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,612
You're probably not gonna be allowed there when you start,

388
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,174
but the player can easily figure out who's allowed here.

389
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:57,935
Like the kitchen,

390
00:18:57,956 --> 00:19:00,017
the kitchen is like one of our favorite rooms in Hitman,

391
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:00,297
because...

392
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:02,914
So many things can go wrong in a kitchen.

393
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:05,937
It's a nice place for accidents.

394
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:09,099
And you can find poison there and all that stuff.

395
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,680
They're nice.

396
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,042
But they're really good for social still.

397
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:13,123
They're good for role-playing.

398
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:15,284
Because again, you can just walk in and you know,

399
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:16,005
I'm going to be a chef.

400
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:17,847
I'm going to stand here and chop some onions.

401
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,927
No one's going to notice me.

402
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:19,748
Yeah.

403
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:23,894
And then the private personal space.

404
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,134
So this is the reward for the player.

405
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:29,075
Like, we don't have a lot of these and we shouldn't.

406
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:32,516
They're like these little gems in the level.

407
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:33,396
This is where you,

408
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,597
where we tell you who the target is through the environment.

409
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:39,117
This is really where you feel like,

410
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:42,398
whoa, okay, I've gotten super close to the target now.

411
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,738
I'm not allowed to be here.

412
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,598
There's so much stuff here that's gonna tell me

413
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:49,179
how to manipulate them or...

414
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:50,480
or take them out.

415
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,400
And these are just, yeah,

416
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,202
great for stealth, social stealth, and role-playing.

417
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:55,943
But you shouldn't have too many of these.

418
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:57,804
They need to feel special.

419
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:01,246
Okay, so I tried applying all of these

420
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:04,548
and tried to map it out on Sapien

421
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:06,349
so to try and see is there anything

422
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:08,610
that stands out from doing this.

423
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,773
And one of the things that struck me,

424
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:18,434
was the fact that the public area is just enormous in this level.

425
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:22,095
Square meter wise, it's not half,

426
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:28,236
because the mansion has many different storages,

427
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:30,316
and you have the whole cave and all that stuff,

428
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,217
and as you get into the church, there's more stuff.

429
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,198
But it's an enormous area,

430
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:39,819
and it really allows the player to get all the way around the mansion,

431
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,339
which we coined the fortress,

432
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,459
because we have lots of these fortresses in our levels.

433
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,884
and you have a chance to just traverse

434
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:50,385
and you have a chance to just see,

435
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:51,846
well, how do I want to get in?

436
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:55,190
I really have a chance to just find all of these

437
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,773
different opportunities to either infiltrate our fortress

438
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,534
or try to pull out our targets.

439
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:05,879
Yes, so now you know.

440
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:08,677
about all this stuff, you're experts.

441
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,801
And now we can talk about the learnings

442
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,143
of where I just want to compare it

443
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,166
to the other levels in Hitman 1

444
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:18,590
and just talk about what did we decide to do for Hitman 2.

445
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:21,419
So I did this on all of them.

446
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:22,980
Took a while.

447
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,862
Looks simple, but it took a while.

448
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:30,044
To try and see what can we learn from this.

449
00:21:30,064 --> 00:21:31,885
And there's tons of little things.

450
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,566
I'm not gonna go too much into details,

451
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,868
but I am gonna talk about two levels

452
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,449
that are really sticking out.

453
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:40,230
One of them, Sapienza, the other one

454
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,731
is Colorado down here in the corner.

455
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:46,505
So what is of course super obvious as you look at it

456
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:49,189
is the fact that Colorado is only trespass.

457
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,515
When you start the level, you're trespassing.

458
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:53,817
It's a hostile environment.

459
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:55,399
You're not allowed to be here.

460
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,221
Good luck.

461
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,964
And I just want to say first of all,

462
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,344
I think this is an awesome level,

463
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:03,445
but it did get a lot of critique

464
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:06,426
and it got a lot lower meta score than Sapienza did.

465
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:07,926
Meta scores are not everything,

466
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:09,247
I'm really not trying to say that,

467
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:10,967
you should always be critical,

468
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:15,289
but I think it's interesting to see what happens

469
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:19,490
when you take away half of our tools

470
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,291
in making a Hitman level.

471
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:23,692
Yeah, this is basically what we're doing.

472
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:25,254
We're only using half of the palette.

473
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:27,936
And the way that this looks from the top

474
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:30,979
is actually quite representative of how

475
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,201
it feels when you're playing it.

476
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:35,884
Everything is kind of, it's very hard

477
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,265
to define the different areas.

478
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:38,206
It's sort of murky.

479
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,389
Everything is soldiers.

480
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:44,712
It's this orchard that they've taken over.

481
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:48,695
And it's really hard to figure out, OK,

482
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,555
these soldiers are allowed here, but they're not

483
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:51,455
allowed over here.

484
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:55,516
But in Sapienza, the ice cream guy is allowed over here,

485
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:56,696
and the priest is allowed over here.

486
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,477
So it's a different metaphor that we're using.

487
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,117
It's very hard to tell apart.

488
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:05,498
OK, so I'm just going to go through the findings,

489
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:07,578
just so you know where we are.

490
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:09,699
It was four.

491
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:14,544
big things that we felt like were worthwhile highlighting.

492
00:23:15,284 --> 00:23:17,625
So public spaces are just very useful for us

493
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:22,607
because it just represents the initial agency of the player.

494
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:24,487
It shows you where the player can actually go

495
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,348
when they play the level, just when they start.

496
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,269
And they have a chance to just get an overview,

497
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:30,410
figure out what they want to do.

498
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:35,973
The public rules space are just they're just so powerful

499
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:41,594
When playing into player expectations and and we we enjoy

500
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:47,015
When our expectations are being fulfilled, it just feels nice. It's like oh, it's an ice cream shop

501
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:50,316
I wonder what's oh, it's there was ice in here. Like, you know, it's it feels nice

502
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,576
You're kind of like I already know what I'm doing

503
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,730
The private personal spaces are just so rewarding

504
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,511
because they create this backstage experience

505
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:03,092
that Evan Goffman is talking about, right?

506
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:05,173
Where you feel like I'm onto them now.

507
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,194
They're super expensive to make

508
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:11,816
because it's just so many special unique assets

509
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:13,357
and all that stuff, but they're worth it.

510
00:24:13,977 --> 00:24:15,017
They're really, really worth it.

511
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,036
Yeah, and by using the whole palette,

512
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:23,159
it's just way easier for us to just create interesting levels

513
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,101
and where players can figure out what to do

514
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:28,862
and how the whole thing ties together.

515
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:33,445
It feels more believable and, yeah, and more rich.

516
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:35,846
So we turned this into four objectives.

517
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:39,668
We wanted to create large and meaningful public spaces.

518
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:43,551
We wanted to create rural spaces that play with the player

519
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:44,191
expectations.

520
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,452
We want to create these rewarding personal spaces.

521
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:50,834
I want to use the whole social space palette.

522
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:53,817
And I think we did that.

523
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,013
We've all got barcodes on the back of our heads.

524
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:20,138
Most people just never notice.

525
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:28,963
I know...

526
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:41,330
what it's like to have everything taken from you.

527
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,232
It's a dangerous thing...

528
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:46,373
having a conscience.

529
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:55,711
Why are you doing this?

530
00:25:55,871 --> 00:26:00,816
I like to think no one's untouchable.

531
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:10,087
Yes.

532
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,008
OK.

533
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:13,150
So I just want to take you through what

534
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,832
Hitman 2 looks like now.

535
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:21,170
So this is Miami, this is the first level of Hitman 2.

536
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:23,352
It's an innovation race,

537
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:27,394
and you're here to eliminate the CEO of Kronstadt,

538
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:30,016
who is in that big building on the top,

539
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:32,478
which we call the Expo building,

540
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:33,518
the Kronstadt Expo building,

541
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:36,440
and his daughter, Sarah Knox, who's a race driver.

542
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,661
She's driving in her car, and at a point,

543
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,303
she's gonna sort of roam around in these public areas.

544
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:46,686
So I did the same thing to just try and see what it looks like.

545
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:52,529
And it's okay if you don't go like, oh, okay, and instantly you have all the information.

546
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,671
I just want to show you, this is the public space.

547
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:07,337
And I really feel like we took all these findings and I really think we applied them in a really

548
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:07,537
good way.

549
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:09,386
really good way.

550
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:14,129
And even though you can go this far right when you start,

551
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:15,770
it doesn't mean that it's an easy level.

552
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,391
I don't know if any of you have played it,

553
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:20,973
but there's still a lot of work to do.

554
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,736
And I think it's just really enjoyable

555
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,857
that you can get this far

556
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:29,159
and basically get all the way around our fortress

557
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,141
to get an idea of how the whole level is shaped out.

558
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,334
So I'm just gonna show you some pictures

559
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:38,635
of our large and meaningful spaces.

560
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:40,216
What I feel we created.

561
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:41,837
Yeah, this is also from Miami.

562
00:27:41,857 --> 00:27:43,758
This is Mumbai.

563
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:45,458
Also an enormous level.

564
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:47,899
I think it must be the biggest level we've ever made.

565
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,721
And almost like so much of it is public.

566
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:54,262
You have these big two fortresses on either side

567
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:57,264
and everything else apart from a few areas is just public.

568
00:27:57,284 --> 00:28:00,045
You can get almost everywhere to just.

569
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:01,581
Get an idea.

570
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:06,704
Santa Fortuna, this is kind of our Colombian Sapienza.

571
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:10,166
It's also, it's an amazing level with this,

572
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,487
this drug cartel mansion in the middle

573
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:15,668
and you have like jungle you can explore

574
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:17,829
and you have this whole fishing village.

575
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,892
Wilton Creek, the suburbia level in Vermont.

576
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,374
Yeah, and as long as you don't trespass

577
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,815
on people's like property, then you can just,

578
00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:30,036
you can just keep.

579
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:35,214
Traversing, our social spaces, I think we, yeah.

580
00:28:35,574 --> 00:28:37,615
There's some really interesting ones in season two.

581
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:41,857
We have the stands where you can watch the rays.

582
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:45,858
There's a pretty cool moment in the barbershop.

583
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:47,839
I don't want to kill anything.

584
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:49,000
Whoops, Freudian slip.

585
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,681
I don't want to reveal anything.

586
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:53,482
Yeah.

587
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:59,104
Yeah, the bar in Santa Fe Tuna, the barbecue.

588
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:00,885
Of course, you need a barbecue when you're in suburbia,

589
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:01,065
right?

590
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:03,532
I wonder what's going to happen here.

591
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:07,293
Oh, and this is, I think this is a cool example.

592
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,374
I love scale.

593
00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:15,697
So I talked a lot about sort of using everyday life experiences

594
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,298
for creating real spaces.

595
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:19,559
Obviously, you don't always have to do that.

596
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,540
You can also, like, we have all these expectations based

597
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,001
on movies and fiction.

598
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,982
So here we're going a little bit with an ice white shot

599
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:28,903
and all that stuff.

600
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:35,092
Yeah, in our personal spaces, I think we,

601
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:36,313
yeah, there's some really,

602
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,494
I feel like I'm spoiling a lot right now

603
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:39,414
by showing you these.

604
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:41,675
It feels different when you're there,

605
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:43,176
so I think you should go try them out.

606
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,898
Our slum queen in Mumbai.

607
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:50,460
She's taken over this huge train yard.

608
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,820
It's a super cool location.

609
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,582
And where we have our CEO of Kronstadt.

610
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:02,347
Yes, okay, so I just want to do a little quick reflection

611
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:06,056
on what happened when we did this.

612
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:10,776
Obviously, someone made Sapienza before I

613
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:13,618
started drawing colors on it.

614
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:17,019
Someone did all this stuff without having

615
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:19,820
these social spaces being so formalized.

616
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,942
So this was just an exercise of formalizing knowledge

617
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:24,362
that was already in the company.

618
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,964
It just wasn't accessible to me as a new designer.

619
00:30:27,984 --> 00:30:32,226
So by doing this, you help new people get into it faster.

620
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:36,848
And we use this analysis also for our embedded teams in Sumo.

621
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:41,490
And yeah, just for new people joining the company.

622
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:44,732
It helped us develop a terminology

623
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,554
and words started popping up

624
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:49,195
that had nothing to do with this thing.

625
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,335
I've used some of them already.

626
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,436
We have the fortress.

627
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:54,037
The dweller is a target that lives in a fortress

628
00:30:54,098 --> 00:30:56,119
and won't come out, so you have to go in and get them.

629
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:58,280
Then we have a roamer, which is a target

630
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,622
that's gonna roam around in the public spaces.

631
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:03,963
And this, like, we're forcing the player

632
00:31:03,983 --> 00:31:05,064
to try different approaches.

633
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:07,886
If they got super good at infiltrating,

634
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:09,407
well, maybe you have to think about

635
00:31:09,747 --> 00:31:11,909
how you're gonna do it when they're out and about,

636
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:13,189
but you can't do anything, right?

637
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:13,970
Because they're in public.

638
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,993
And the snail house, it's like an idea

639
00:31:18,113 --> 00:31:23,357
of how we create shapes, like general level shapes.

640
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:26,659
And we found out that the snail house shape

641
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,561
is just super awesome for making Hitman levels.

642
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:30,662
Yeah.

643
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,904
And then it just got us talking.

644
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:37,628
we started like, you know, we actually started reflecting

645
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,109
on what is it actually we do.

646
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:42,090
And I think that was just really, really valuable.

647
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:47,031
So all this in mind, I just, yeah, I want to promote this.

648
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:48,472
I think you should try it out.

649
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:51,132
It doesn't have to be a social approach.

650
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:54,434
It can be whatever you think could be interesting

651
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:56,694
and try and apply it to your game and see what happens.

652
00:31:58,475 --> 00:31:59,295
Yes, that's it.

653
00:31:59,495 --> 00:31:59,755
Thank you.

654
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:14,217
All right, I guess we have lots of time for questions.

655
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:14,577
I don't know.

656
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:18,818
Do you have any questions?

657
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:20,759
Not sure how this goes on.

658
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,480
Yeah, oh, I think there's a mic up there

659
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,620
if you want to go to the mic.

660
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,581
Sorry, I was supposed to say that.

661
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:28,141
Do you want to start?

662
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:36,915
Yeah, because you used larger public spaces in Hitman 2, did you notice during playtesting

663
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:42,380
that people explored more options within the level sooner because they started in a more

664
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:43,962
safe and low stress environment?

665
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:44,803
Yes.

666
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:51,605
Yes, it could also be overwhelming.

667
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,248
Because I was saying that we had a new problem

668
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:57,872
all of a sudden that we hadn't thought of.

669
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,594
It was a little bit overwhelming for players.

670
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:03,197
So we had to find ways to kind of...

671
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:06,900
quickly give them something they could go with,

672
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,741
and then say, okay, for the more seasoned players,

673
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,622
we're not gonna run over to that guy

674
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:13,202
with the exclamation mark over his head.

675
00:33:14,123 --> 00:33:16,864
They can just keep going and keep discovering cool stuff.

676
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:20,565
But we had a new challenge all of a sudden, yeah.

677
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:21,546
All right, thank you.

678
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:22,126
Yeah, you're welcome.

679
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:25,565
I'm wondering if you could elaborate on the snail house

680
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,125
bullet point.

681
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:29,607
Is that where the layers begin to, I saw in Sapienza,

682
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:31,567
goes in a half circle of sorts.

683
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:31,768
Yes.

684
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:37,550
Yeah, I think it's easier for people to navigate in them.

685
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:43,292
When we did this analysis, Bjarne from the company,

686
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:45,693
who's also a level designer, he joined in

687
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,194
and we started looking at season two.

688
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:55,678
And he realized at a point that our levels in Hitman 1

689
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,640
was either like, either they were like flat

690
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,421
or they were like horizontal.

691
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:03,383
Like we have like Paris as horizontal

692
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:04,863
and we have Bangkok as horizontal.

693
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:06,564
And then we have these other shapes

694
00:34:06,764 --> 00:34:09,466
where it seems to be a little bit askew

695
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:11,527
and it helps players navigate.

696
00:34:12,087 --> 00:34:14,549
It's easy to figure out where you are basically.

697
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:19,291
And there's also something about that we create a path, right, of infiltration,

698
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,292
and then we allow you to kind of...

699
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:24,013
We talk a lot about Swiss cheese at IO as well,

700
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:25,914
that you constantly need to have a way out.

701
00:34:25,974 --> 00:34:27,734
We hate dead ends.

702
00:34:27,974 --> 00:34:29,495
Dead ends is forbidden.

703
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:32,776
So I guess it's the same in other games as well.

704
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:35,718
So yeah, so it's basically about...

705
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:39,540
giving you a path, but allowing you to kind of learn

706
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,103
these little other ways in,

707
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:45,045
and then the other fortress at the end, right?

708
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:47,047
So it also depends on what kind of level you're making,

709
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,128
but we will often have a fortress in our levels.

710
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:51,110
Did that answer everything?

711
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,790
Yeah, totally.

712
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,451
Okay, cool.

713
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:53,772
Yeah?

714
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:55,553
Yeah.

715
00:34:56,665 --> 00:35:00,406
So it appears that the level designs are very much geared

716
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:02,227
towards the actual primary targets.

717
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:05,388
Was there any ahead of time consideration

718
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:08,629
for the elusive targets or kind of escalation missions

719
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,150
where targets are all over the place?

720
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,810
Yeah, yes.

721
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,951
So when we're designing these, that's a really good question.

722
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:15,292
When we're designing these levels,

723
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:17,473
we're constantly trying to keep in mind

724
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:19,633
that these are supposed to keep on living.

725
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,716
right, that we have lots of content

726
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:23,997
that we want to keep adding.

727
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:27,359
So yes, definitely, that goes into it.

728
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:29,741
And often, if we have an idea for something,

729
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,143
where we go, oh, this doesn't really fit here,

730
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:35,306
but maybe we can use this in the future for an elusive

731
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:37,507
or for a bonus mission or something like that.

732
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,510
Yeah, we try to keep that in mind.

733
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,433
There's lots of stuff you have to design at the same time.

734
00:35:44,513 --> 00:35:46,575
And sometimes it feels completely impossible,

735
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:47,075
but it's a...

736
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:50,717
But creating these huge levels like Mumbai,

737
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:53,778
where you just have tons of real estate,

738
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:56,779
like you just have a lot of slum and lots of places.

739
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,559
And yeah, definitely, we try to do that.

740
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:00,080
Yeah.

741
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,680
Thanks.

742
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:01,880
Yes.

743
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,540
Hi.

744
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,040
Hi.

745
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,241
So I know that your goal is to make

746
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:10,263
these realistic environments to portray everyday life.

747
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,283
And a lot of the levels are based on

748
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:14,744
actual real life cities and places.

749
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,665
How strict are you with

750
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:25,509
trying to portray that city exactly how it is versus adding in fictional areas or fictional events, things like that?

751
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:29,431
Yes, that's a really good question. I think I'm actually supposed to repeat the questions.

752
00:36:29,992 --> 00:36:36,395
So this is about how detailed do we go in recreating levels and trying to make them real.

753
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,561
We, I think we have like this mantra

754
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:43,603
that we're not trying to create real levels,

755
00:36:43,623 --> 00:36:45,243
we're trying to create believable levels.

756
00:36:46,024 --> 00:36:50,186
And I think that's very important for this also to be fun

757
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:52,167
because it's also a pretty, you know,

758
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:56,149
It's basically a hitman game, right?

759
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:59,551
You don't want to go too real, because then it's not fun anymore.

760
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:05,634
And then we want to keep that sort of stylized aspect on most things.

761
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:09,476
We try to just take a lot of inspiration from these places.

762
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:16,001
But like a level like Sapienza, there is a town that looks a lot like Sapienza.

763
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,322
I can't remember what it's called.

764
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:19,944
But you can go visit that place.

765
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:23,666
And some of it at IO actually have.

766
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:27,489
So I mean, we draw inspiration from it.

767
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,573
And we go visit the places, like for Hitman 2,

768
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:37,456
people actually went to these places to kind of get that feel.

769
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:39,858
How does a slum in Mumbai actually feel?

770
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,619
And took tons of pictures and stuff.

771
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,701
But we have to make our own version of it, of course.

772
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,063
Did that answer the question?

773
00:37:47,283 --> 00:37:47,924
Yes, thank you.

774
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:48,804
Good.

775
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:51,006
Hello.

776
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:51,606
Oh, sorry.

777
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:53,548
Are we doing the back and forth thing?

778
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:54,428
I don't know who came first.

779
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:54,769
By all means.

780
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:56,609
Okay, you go.

781
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,310
Okay, yeah, thank you for the talk.

782
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:02,013
Just had a question on sort of streaming in Norway

783
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:04,674
that you actually put your levels together at IO

784
00:38:04,694 --> 00:38:06,155
because the levels are so dense.

785
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:09,457
Is that something that happens automatically

786
00:38:09,577 --> 00:38:10,718
or like when you're indoors,

787
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:14,300
you're kind of chunking out big parts of outside

788
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,321
or have you got big level streaming volumes

789
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:17,962
around the whole area or?

790
00:38:18,302 --> 00:38:19,423
What do you mean exactly?

791
00:38:19,443 --> 00:38:20,764
Sorry, just a...

792
00:38:21,244 --> 00:38:21,904
Level streaming.

793
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:30,219
Does it all happen automatically or are you turning off big sections of the world?

794
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:34,040
No, everything is just... I'm actually not completely sure.

795
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:39,602
Do you mean for the player and not when we're working in the editor, I'm assuming?

796
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:43,544
Well, yeah, sort of the development part of it, actually.

797
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:48,526
So are the level designers setting down level streaming volumes

798
00:38:48,646 --> 00:38:51,086
or do you just make the levels and that's that?

799
00:38:53,656 --> 00:38:56,618
I'm a little bit unsure what you mean,

800
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,921
like as in like when we design them from the get-go,

801
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:04,082
like how we, if we design everything at the same time,

802
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:06,564
or if we like go like from this area and then out,

803
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,264
or do you mean?

804
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:10,386
Just the technical side of it,

805
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:11,727
so if you're inside a building.

806
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:13,148
Ah, okay, like that.

807
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,029
It's outside unloaded?

808
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:15,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

809
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,351
So we divide things into rooms, that's what we call it.

810
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:17,612
Sure.

811
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,033
Yeah, sorry, it's just the terminology.

812
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:25,298
Yes, so everything is made in rooms, and then we have gates between those rooms, right?

813
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:29,801
So we try to not show as much as possible.

814
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:32,544
And then for some of these levels, there was a huge limit.

815
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:36,907
And for instance, in Miami, right,

816
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,010
you can't go and see the whole level at the same time.

817
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,731
We try to make sure that we put things in the middle,

818
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:46,011
and we divide it, and make sure you

819
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,452
have these super nice vistas, but we can't show you

820
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:49,612
everything at the same time.

821
00:39:49,692 --> 00:39:52,293
So yeah, that's a big part of it,

822
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:54,354
but it's something that sort of happens

823
00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:56,015
as you're designing it.

824
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:59,176
And we have people in the team that

825
00:39:59,276 --> 00:40:01,437
are worried about that stuff super early,

826
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:03,477
and like, oh, this is way too much.

827
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:04,598
We have to just drill back.

828
00:40:04,678 --> 00:40:06,258
OK, thank you.

829
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:10,376
Hello.

830
00:40:10,696 --> 00:40:10,856
Hello.

831
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:12,338
Oh, sorry.

832
00:40:12,398 --> 00:40:14,659
Sorry, I'm completely forgetting this guy.

833
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:14,959
Sorry.

834
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,441
Over here.

835
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:18,242
Great talk, by the way.

836
00:40:18,262 --> 00:40:19,203
Thank you.

837
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:22,705
So I'm curious if during the development process

838
00:40:22,785 --> 00:40:26,588
you categorized players based on their play styles.

839
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:26,868
Yes.

840
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:30,651
And based on that, how did you balance out the opportunities

841
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:31,451
that you designed?

842
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:31,872
Yes.

843
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,743
That's an excellent question.

844
00:40:34,404 --> 00:40:36,725
So this is about how we design for different play styles.

845
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:41,187
Well, we need a sneak path always, right?

846
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:42,608
We need to make sure that you can,

847
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,609
we need to make sure you can do it suit only

848
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:46,450
in Silent Assassin and all these things.

849
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,211
Like we need to make sure that that's doable

850
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:49,911
when we make them.

851
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:54,094
And when we do like social stealth,

852
00:40:54,154 --> 00:40:57,617
there are different types of players.

853
00:40:57,797 --> 00:41:01,920
Like we have the center stage social stealth,

854
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,602
like Helmut Kruger in Paris.

855
00:41:03,622 --> 00:41:04,362
I don't know if you played,

856
00:41:04,402 --> 00:41:06,584
but like where you're basically in the spotlight,

857
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:09,186
you're the main character, so like walking out there.

858
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:11,648
And you know, if you're a real hit man,

859
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:13,589
you'll be going, maybe that's not the place you wanna be.

860
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:14,930
Like everyone can kind of see you, but.

861
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:19,193
But it's awesome to have those experiences,

862
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:21,834
and it makes you feel like you really cheated everyone.

863
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:25,256
They think I'm actually the main attraction of this thing.

864
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:29,197
So we try to do that, and we try to do these more like,

865
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:31,859
you're doing social stealth, but you're more like sneaking.

866
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:32,619
You're the janitor.

867
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:38,582
we make sure that you have sniping opportunities

868
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:39,423
and all this stuff.

869
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:43,686
Yeah, we try to design these different paths,

870
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:47,608
but players can just, like, they find a way.

871
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:50,290
Like, you know, sometimes you just go, they did what?

872
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,451
You know, like, how is that even possible?

873
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,933
So I'm not, there's some players who are like,

874
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:57,775
we're not too worried, they're gonna find a way.

875
00:41:58,815 --> 00:41:59,496
They always do.

876
00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:02,097
So, but yeah, yes, we try.

877
00:42:03,118 --> 00:42:04,238
as much as we can.

878
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:05,779
Sorry, then back here.

879
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,920
So it sounds like a super intuitive

880
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,381
and really useful rule set, or philosophy rather,

881
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:14,563
and I'm a big fan of rules for making levels,

882
00:42:14,603 --> 00:42:16,063
it makes life a lot more simple, but

883
00:42:16,683 --> 00:42:19,465
is there a danger that it becomes potentially formulaic?

884
00:42:19,585 --> 00:42:21,545
Or like, can you break those, your own rules?

885
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:22,106
Yes.

886
00:42:22,146 --> 00:42:24,286
Can you disrupt the system that you've basically established now?

887
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:25,767
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes.

888
00:42:26,405 --> 00:42:27,706
That's a simple answer.

889
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:28,847
Because you're saying, like, Colorado.

890
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:29,348
You should.

891
00:42:29,368 --> 00:42:30,149
Yeah, true.

892
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:34,073
Yeah, and I want to say, these aren't rules for how, like,

893
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:37,256
we may want to make another Colorado.

894
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:39,138
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

895
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:40,560
Right, because I think Colorado had

896
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,641
some super interesting things.

897
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:44,242
And I think we just learned so much in doing this

898
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:46,163
that we know the pitfalls.

899
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:48,144
So we can do another Colorado now

900
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:50,925
and make sure that the players

901
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:53,426
have those same opportunities.

902
00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:55,387
So definitely, yeah, yeah.

903
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:56,807
I don't think this should stop anyone.

904
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,468
And as was also said before,

905
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:01,589
like did any issues come with actually following these rules?

906
00:43:01,629 --> 00:43:02,530
And they did, right?

907
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,091
Like we did this and we're like, oh, okay, right.

908
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:07,672
We need to make sure that they're not overwhelmed

909
00:43:07,772 --> 00:43:08,752
by public space, right?

910
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,553
So yes, definitely, yeah.

911
00:43:10,653 --> 00:43:11,033
It's cool.

912
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:19,467
Hi, I was kind of curious if there were any issues regarding player retention or hidden

913
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:25,433
challenges specifically regarding the proportionality of the particular zones, especially regarding

914
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:29,618
like the public zones, like if players would get less engaged if they were just walking

915
00:43:29,638 --> 00:43:32,040
around too much without any necessary challenges.

916
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:35,617
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

917
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:38,539
I think it's like, again, you need to make sure it's varied.

918
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:41,120
So I think the reason why big public spaces work

919
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,441
is because they're varied, that they change.

920
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:45,723
If it was just the same, same, same stuff,

921
00:43:45,763 --> 00:43:47,704
like if it was just a huge park

922
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:50,405
and there's two mansions on either side,

923
00:43:50,445 --> 00:43:51,626
that would be super boring, right?

924
00:43:51,646 --> 00:43:54,628
So I think it's about keeping the player engaged.

925
00:43:54,868 --> 00:43:56,509
And I think it's just what we learned

926
00:43:56,529 --> 00:43:58,050
was that you can keep the player engaged

927
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,711
without introducing trespassing.

928
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,937
that part of their brain is still going.

929
00:44:03,997 --> 00:44:05,279
Like, what should I do here?

930
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:06,020
Who's allowed here?

931
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,721
Who are these people?

932
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:07,723
What's going on?

933
00:44:07,743 --> 00:44:11,148
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

934
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:12,009
I think so.

935
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:12,770
Yeah.

936
00:44:14,658 --> 00:44:15,718
Hello, and thank you for the talk.

937
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:18,920
So in a previous talk, you guys spoke

938
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,481
about how you went through the process of creating

939
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:24,722
a tutorial for the stages, and how difficult it

940
00:44:24,782 --> 00:44:28,603
was for the players to figure out what all the actions

941
00:44:28,643 --> 00:44:30,004
in the stage are.

942
00:44:30,644 --> 00:44:33,445
Now, before you spoke about the Swiss cheese approach

943
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:37,047
to getting yourself in trouble, but being able to come out

944
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:37,267
of it.

945
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:37,707
Yeah.

946
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,263
relatively easily.

947
00:44:39,883 --> 00:44:42,864
So, could you tell us a little bit about how you

948
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:47,326
modulate the player motivation to fail

949
00:44:48,206 --> 00:44:50,347
and think of something else to try again

950
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:52,008
and keep going through that process,

951
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:56,049
even though there's very hard stops in those paths?

952
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:57,510
That's an excellent question.

953
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,490
So it's about how

954
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:03,384
when you do trial and error in the level,

955
00:45:03,464 --> 00:45:06,165
how do you make sure that the player keeps,

956
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:10,827
can get out of trouble and can keep going basically, right?

957
00:45:11,947 --> 00:45:16,449
Yeah, I mean, this is kind of a little bit more

958
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:18,049
over in the game design department,

959
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:19,370
because this is about systems, right?

960
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,811
When do we cool down the level and say,

961
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:24,712
okay, everyone's forgotten that guy got an ax in his head,

962
00:45:24,752 --> 00:45:26,232
we're fine now, you know, back to work.

963
00:45:29,913 --> 00:45:31,775
And that can get a little weird.

964
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:34,137
But we try, like I mentioned,

965
00:45:34,177 --> 00:45:35,858
like having lots of these,

966
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,460
making sure that you have these safe spaces.

967
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,622
Like making sure you have spaces that have,

968
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:44,486
that are not filled with rules and expectations or NPCs.

969
00:45:44,566 --> 00:45:47,048
Making sure you have places that are just like hallways

970
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:48,649
with not that many people or.

971
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:56,097
So you can get away and sort of feel like you're going from one social context

972
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:59,580
and moving away from it and maybe getting into an entirely new one

973
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,243
because then it's okay that they don't know about X, this guy.

974
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:07,188
So, you know, I think in the level design that's what we can do, but I think it's...

975
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:12,352
there's no perfect, like there's no like,

976
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:13,974
this is the way to do it.

977
00:46:14,935 --> 00:46:16,497
And I think it's something that we keep,

978
00:46:16,697 --> 00:46:18,380
like we need to keep getting better at,

979
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,222
because I think it's a really important thing.

980
00:46:20,242 --> 00:46:21,203
Yeah.

981
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:22,084
Thank you.

982
00:46:25,401 --> 00:46:29,143
Yeah, with the addition of multiplayer in Hitman 2,

983
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:33,746
how does that affect how you design the levels with the public spaces?

984
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:35,146
So you're thinking ghost mode?

985
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:35,607
Yeah, ghost.

986
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:37,308
Ghost mode, yeah.

987
00:46:37,688 --> 00:46:40,850
So that's a tricky question.

988
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:47,273
Because, yeah, that's a really hard question.

989
00:46:49,055 --> 00:46:52,869
I'm not sure I'm the right person to answer that question because I haven't worked on Ghost Mode.

990
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,842
But I would think that it's, okay, so what's really tricky about Ghost World is

991
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:04,625
that the game tension kind of stays even though you're playing again, right?

992
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:09,127
So that's like one of the challenges we're facing is that if we do the X

993
00:47:09,487 --> 00:47:10,748
head scenario again, right?

994
00:47:11,188 --> 00:47:16,110
So in big public space with a lot of people and

995
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:17,351
lockdown has happened, right?

996
00:47:19,032 --> 00:47:20,733
I think that's something that we need that.

997
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,634
especially when we design Ghost Mode,

998
00:47:23,654 --> 00:47:26,296
that we need to be mindful of that it's not,

999
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:28,977
that the area isn't entirely ruined

1000
00:47:29,477 --> 00:47:31,679
because there's so many people who saw you do something bad

1001
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:32,859
and now when you're playing it again.

1002
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,041
So yeah, I think it's, you know,

1003
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,363
when we design the levels, we need to, of course,

1004
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:40,563
worry about the main missions

1005
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:43,185
and we need to think about elusives and all that stuff.

1006
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:46,547
And now we also have to think about Ghost Mode.

1007
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:47,067
It's a lot.

1008
00:47:47,087 --> 00:47:47,127
So.

1009
00:47:49,173 --> 00:47:50,793
Yeah, I think it's about that, making sure

1010
00:47:50,813 --> 00:47:55,195
that you don't have too large open spaces with a million

1011
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:57,176
people in it, because that's going to feel weird

1012
00:47:57,236 --> 00:47:57,736
and go smoke.

1013
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:01,658
Hiya.

1014
00:48:01,718 --> 00:48:06,380
Because your level design and locales are so inspired,

1015
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,901
are there any settings that you really

1016
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:13,342
want to incorporate into a future Hitman game?

1017
00:48:13,702 --> 00:48:16,623
Or do you feel like you've already made your dream level

1018
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,944
with one of the previous settings?

1019
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:22,024
Oh, I'm working on my dream level right now,

1020
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:27,747
and I can't talk about it.

1021
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:30,168
So I'm sorry, but yes.

1022
00:48:31,348 --> 00:48:32,309
I look forward to playing it.

1023
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:33,049
Cool.

1024
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:33,790
Thank you.

1025
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:42,956
Hi, so my question is about when you create a level which has such a large amount of content,

1026
00:48:43,016 --> 00:48:46,158
such a large amount of different things you can do, different things going on, different

1027
00:48:46,178 --> 00:48:51,322
things happening, different ways of entering, different missions, there's so much variety

1028
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:52,262
and so much there.

1029
00:48:52,783 --> 00:48:58,106
How do you encourage a player to actually explore that as opposed to go down the path

1030
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:03,069
of least resistance and find just quickly how do I get to my target as fast as possible?

1031
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:03,410
Amen.

1032
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:06,631
A second follow-up question to that is,

1033
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:08,232
have you ever thought about,

1034
00:49:08,552 --> 00:49:09,552
or I mean, obviously you have,

1035
00:49:09,592 --> 00:49:12,113
but what are your thoughts about sort of reusing levels

1036
00:49:12,153 --> 00:49:15,435
to sort of encourage getting them to,

1037
00:49:15,615 --> 00:49:18,136
or getting a player to discover more about a level

1038
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:19,536
so that way they can actually use more

1039
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:20,977
of what they've previously learned?

1040
00:49:20,997 --> 00:49:21,197
Yes.

1041
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:22,878
Okay, so this is a good question.

1042
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,099
It's about replay and how do you make people explore

1043
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:27,399
and not just go down the beaten path.

1044
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,060
So we have challenges.

1045
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:37,379
I think challenges is an excellent tool for highlighting some of these things that we put in the level that we really hope that someone will see.

1046
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:45,750
But I will say, I like that there are these little pockets that you may not notice until the 10th time you play a level.

1047
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:50,516
Like there's still parts of some levels that I haven't seen and I get surprised when I see it

1048
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:52,999
And I think that's like a really cool experience

1049
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,082
but yeah, we have

1050
00:49:55,622 --> 00:50:01,550
Challenges the challenge system and we have these opportunities like our quest system where we can take them to some of these cool areas

1051
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,093
That they may not necessarily see from the get-go

1052
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,911
And the other question was, yeah, making sure,

1053
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:10,392
like, highlighting areas for bonus missions

1054
00:50:10,512 --> 00:50:12,352
and elusive targets.

1055
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:16,393
I think it's an excellent opportunity for us to do that.

1056
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:19,234
And I think that kind of answered the first question

1057
00:50:19,294 --> 00:50:19,794
in a way.

1058
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:22,014
Yeah, because I think there's like,

1059
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:24,435
if you played some of the bonus missions,

1060
00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:26,955
like, for instance, in Sapienza, there's

1061
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:29,156
like three bonus missions in that level.

1062
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:31,896
And each are, like, very different, I feel.

1063
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:34,097
And they highlight other...

1064
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:37,080
like really nice areas of that level.

1065
00:50:38,382 --> 00:50:41,807
So yeah, we try to do that as much as possible.

1066
00:50:42,528 --> 00:50:42,788
Thank you.

1067
00:50:44,932 --> 00:50:45,192
Oh, yeah.

1068
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:47,431
They were first.

1069
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:48,232
His first, sure.

1070
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:49,032
Sure, go ahead.

1071
00:50:49,052 --> 00:50:49,993
So polite.

1072
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:55,555
So you had all these great different space terminologies and you worked together with

1073
00:50:55,575 --> 00:50:57,516
the environment artists about how they set those up.

1074
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:02,519
But was there any sort of environment or LD make any visual indications as to the different

1075
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:03,239
space types?

1076
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:08,482
So like was there different lighting for the privates there versus the public spaces and

1077
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:10,903
did that continue through different levels?

1078
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:15,368
Right. Oh, it really depends on the level, right?

1079
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:20,295
I mean, we try to use these visual cues

1080
00:51:21,356 --> 00:51:23,800
like that could be just having

1081
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:27,044
things that aren't very presentable.

1082
00:51:27,545 --> 00:51:30,346
like, you know, like bags of trash or something like that.

1083
00:51:30,366 --> 00:51:31,487
It could be like stuff like that,

1084
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:33,888
or here they just put up some chairs for later,

1085
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:35,628
like fold up chairs or things like,

1086
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,789
we try to do these little things to make sure

1087
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:39,370
it very quickly feels like,

1088
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,171
oh, okay, I'm not allowed to be here.

1089
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,332
This is a backstage area or whatever.

1090
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:46,636
And then, like, we had all the different spaces,

1091
00:51:46,696 --> 00:51:48,738
and then a lot of the layouts that you showed

1092
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:51,481
had the public spaces sort of intruding on,

1093
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:54,264
or sort of wrapping together with the private spaces.

1094
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,727
Is there some sort of, like, percentage

1095
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:58,088
or anything that you followed?

1096
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:01,131
How much public space needed to, like, touch the...

1097
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:03,154
The private space? Yeah.

1098
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:11,257
Well, this is your chance to have the player see your private space, right?

1099
00:52:11,317 --> 00:52:16,882
This is where you get to really show them this is where you want to go and this is how you can get there.

1100
00:52:17,282 --> 00:52:21,405
So I don't think it's about how much, but I think it's about how clearly you do it

1101
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:24,328
and how you show who's allowed there.

1102
00:52:24,788 --> 00:52:27,411
In Hitman, that's a huge part of it, right? The disguises.

1103
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:31,094
So you have a chance to see behind the fence

1104
00:52:31,134 --> 00:52:33,196
that it's like chefs walking around there

1105
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:35,318
or whatever, backstage people, right?

1106
00:52:35,338 --> 00:52:35,718
So yeah.

1107
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:42,585
For implementing the stuff you talked about

1108
00:52:42,705 --> 00:52:45,488
in other games or other types of games,

1109
00:52:45,648 --> 00:52:49,331
do you have any ideas or recommendations

1110
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:53,555
for places that

1111
00:52:54,376 --> 00:53:01,519
might not fit what most people understand about like the people that work there where it's like

1112
00:53:02,139 --> 00:53:08,041
I am seeing someone do something and I want to either become that person or

1113
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:12,863
do what they're doing but I have no idea what they are doing like in

1114
00:53:17,002 --> 00:53:20,744
it's hard to think of many examples other than fantasy,

1115
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:26,367
but where we as normal people don't always have the ideas

1116
00:53:27,007 --> 00:53:32,109
of what is expected of a person in that area.

1117
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:33,090
Right, right.

1118
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:37,051
So you're thinking like if we go to like more exclusive,

1119
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,652
exotic places where you don't know

1120
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:40,333
what are they actually doing?

1121
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:42,494
Like what's their job or whatever?

1122
00:53:42,694 --> 00:53:42,934
Yeah.

1123
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:43,955
Yeah.

1124
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,604
Yeah, I mean, that's a challenge.

1125
00:53:46,984 --> 00:53:49,605
I think that's a, if that's a question you're asking,

1126
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,407
like how we deal with it or, yeah.

1127
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:54,128
So I think it's about, like,

1128
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:57,090
even if you're at this super exclusive weird place,

1129
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,191
like a Isle of Skye where it's like,

1130
00:53:59,231 --> 00:54:00,732
everything is over the top, right?

1131
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:03,353
And people are wearing robes and stuff like that.

1132
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,554
You still have waiters.

1133
00:54:05,174 --> 00:54:08,357
You still have kitchens, you still have bathrooms, they need to pee.

1134
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:12,720
You have all these things that's going to be there because they're humans

1135
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:15,202
that you can just play on from there.

1136
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:20,326
Or you use, like I mentioned, examples from movies and other games and fiction

1137
00:54:21,346 --> 00:54:26,250
so people can go like, oh, he's a cryogenics guy or whatever.

1138
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:29,232
or detective, you know, it's a,

1139
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:35,174
then you try and play on those stereotypes kind of, yeah.

1140
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,336
Yeah, but it is super difficult or you can,

1141
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:41,797
like again, then you have to invent something new,

1142
00:54:41,857 --> 00:54:44,899
but then you have to tab into other, you know.

1143
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,381
design tricks, like everyone has a different color

1144
00:54:49,521 --> 00:54:51,561
or something, and everyone who wears yellow

1145
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:52,642
will do this thing.

1146
00:54:52,682 --> 00:54:56,363
Like, it's super difficult when we do that,

1147
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:59,264
when we go out and explore those areas,

1148
00:54:59,564 --> 00:55:00,505
but I think it's doable.

1149
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:04,006
It's just making sure it's readable for the player.

1150
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:05,386
Thank you.

1151
00:55:05,687 --> 00:55:06,607
How long do we have left?

1152
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:07,827
Are we done?

1153
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:08,248
Four minutes?

1154
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:09,228
Four minutes.

1155
00:55:09,988 --> 00:55:10,628
Okay, cool, yeah.

1156
00:55:11,115 --> 00:55:16,477
Hi, I have a question actually about the integration of your design and art teams with as richly

1157
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:22,538
detailed environments as you have in Hitman and is how intrinsically linked gameplay and

1158
00:55:22,558 --> 00:55:24,058
mission design is to the environments.

1159
00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:28,919
How did you guys sort of integrate the work of your environment team and your design team?

1160
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,480
How closely did they work together?

1161
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,720
We work very closely together.

1162
00:55:34,963 --> 00:55:38,804
Very closely, yeah. We spend all our time together.

1163
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:40,284
Yeah.

1164
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:44,705
Like, the level designers and environment artists are buddies.

1165
00:55:45,246 --> 00:55:46,606
We're partners in crime.

1166
00:55:46,686 --> 00:55:49,547
We try to do everything together and make sure we're aligned.

1167
00:55:49,887 --> 00:55:52,488
Have our desks right up against each other and eat together.

1168
00:55:53,848 --> 00:55:55,029
smell each other and everything.

1169
00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:55,729
It's a...

1170
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:57,050
Right, well it shows.

1171
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,910
I think that's super important.

1172
00:55:59,811 --> 00:56:02,012
Like, the problem as a level designer,

1173
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:03,493
I think I was always, I want my,

1174
00:56:04,433 --> 00:56:07,875
like every, someone from the whole company,

1175
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,296
from each team representative,

1176
00:56:09,316 --> 00:56:11,057
to just sit around me in a ring.

1177
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:14,118
So I can just like, a writer, an animator,

1178
00:56:14,178 --> 00:56:16,119
like, cause you need to talk to all of them,

1179
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:17,980
all the time, all the time.

1180
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,781
But the environment artist is your,

1181
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:21,622
is the most important person for you.

1182
00:56:22,703 --> 00:56:23,366
All right, thank you.

1183
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:29,523
Hello. I have a question for the design of Hitman.

1184
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:33,145
You have so much possibilities and solutions to the level.

1185
00:56:33,905 --> 00:56:38,307
Even the system you can make many actions to solve a single problem.

1186
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:43,629
I was wondering how do you mitigate that as a level designer

1187
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:46,531
as you have your players so much possibility.

1188
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:52,993
Do you do some kind of technique in order to make it intentional?

1189
00:56:53,972 --> 00:56:57,333
So how do we decide when the level is done?

1190
00:56:57,593 --> 00:56:59,114
You mean like how do we show the player

1191
00:56:59,194 --> 00:57:01,976
or as we're designing or what do you mean?

1192
00:57:02,376 --> 00:57:05,037
When you're designing, you have a system

1193
00:57:05,237 --> 00:57:07,518
and a level that has so many solutions.

1194
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,939
Okay, like that, yeah.

1195
00:57:11,313 --> 00:57:12,114
Yeah, that's tricky.

1196
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:17,399
I think there's like many different ways of doing it,

1197
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,723
of trying to show you how this works.

1198
00:57:21,223 --> 00:57:22,665
Like there was one example,

1199
00:57:22,685 --> 00:57:24,647
I don't know if it completely answers your question,

1200
00:57:24,687 --> 00:57:26,248
but there was one I thought was a little funny

1201
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,451
where writing also helped us out a little bit.

1202
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:30,052
There's a place in Paris.

1203
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,135
where you walk, like you have,

1204
00:57:33,295 --> 00:57:34,796
you can just walk right into the building

1205
00:57:34,836 --> 00:57:37,758
and if you walk to the left and this is backstage area

1206
00:57:38,198 --> 00:57:41,160
and this is a chef who's like, wants to go in

1207
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:42,882
and the guide is like, listen buddy,

1208
00:57:42,902 --> 00:57:44,843
you don't have to keep asking me this question.

1209
00:57:44,863 --> 00:57:46,524
You're allowed here and you're allowed all the way up

1210
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,426
to the second floor and you can just walk right in.

1211
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:51,128
Like, and I was just listening to that.

1212
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:51,948
I'm like, all right.

1213
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:54,690
Fair enough.

1214
00:57:55,671 --> 00:57:58,433
So we do all kinds of little things.

1215
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:01,476
Sometimes it's not that much on the nose,

1216
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:04,418
but it is super hard to communicate.

1217
00:58:04,479 --> 00:58:05,680
Like what can you do here?

1218
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,101
And as you're saying, there is a system,

1219
00:58:07,141 --> 00:58:07,961
there's all these things,

1220
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:12,285
and the minute you knock out someone in front of everyone,

1221
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:13,706
then the AI takes over,

1222
00:58:13,846 --> 00:58:17,189
and it's anyone's guess what's gonna happen now, right?

1223
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:19,451
So we're trying to cater for all of it,

1224
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:21,973
and it's a crazy job.

1225
00:58:23,174 --> 00:58:25,416
It's so much fun, but it's a crazy job.

1226
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,577
Did that answer your question?

1227
00:58:27,777 --> 00:58:28,218
Sort of.

1228
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:28,618
Sort of.

1229
00:58:28,678 --> 00:58:29,959
OK, we can talk after this.

1230
00:58:30,259 --> 00:58:30,559
OK, good.

1231
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:30,760
Yeah.

1232
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,360
Thank you.

1233
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:32,841
And you're next.

1234
00:58:32,881 --> 00:58:33,061
Yeah.

1235
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:33,401
Hello.

1236
00:58:33,462 --> 00:58:33,642
Hi.

1237
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:33,982
Hi.

1238
00:58:34,362 --> 00:58:35,763
So I'd like to ask, because there's

1239
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:36,664
a lot of maps in the game.

1240
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:38,545
So every map's really different.

1241
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:41,147
So how do you guys decide on what kind of map to use?

1242
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:43,469
Do you think about reusable assets?

1243
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:46,391
Or you recreate every single different assets

1244
00:58:46,411 --> 00:58:47,091
for different maps?

1245
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:50,495
That depends on a lot of things.

1246
00:58:52,478 --> 00:58:55,062
Like we try to make them as different as possible in general

1247
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:58,667
and that's just expensive to do, but we try to do that.

1248
00:58:59,308 --> 00:59:01,812
Cause I think it's important that they feel different.

1249
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,375
we don't like reusing.

1250
00:59:04,595 --> 00:59:07,197
Sometimes you have to, if you're time pressured

1251
00:59:07,237 --> 00:59:09,219
or anything like that, or if it's just like,

1252
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:11,281
okay, we don't need a million different toilets.

1253
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:13,183
Like we can maybe reuse a few toilets,

1254
00:59:13,223 --> 00:59:15,365
like no one's gonna notice.

1255
00:59:15,525 --> 00:59:18,668
Like it can get a little insane once in a while.

1256
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:21,390
But I think it's super important

1257
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,711
to make them feel very different.

1258
00:59:23,012 --> 00:59:26,515
And we do lots of things to make sure it feels different.

1259
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:34,599
Sound and lighting and all this stuff making sure that the time of day is different and the mood of the level is different

1260
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:41,361
And how they look and how they act and how they talk like this so many aspects to making sure they feel buried

1261
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:49,924
But it but I think it's very very important that they feel different. Yeah. Thank you very much

1262
00:59:50,244 --> 00:59:52,665
And oh we're done can I one last question or oh

1263
00:59:53,266 --> 00:59:57,667
We're done. Oh, we got to go. Okay. Well good talk after this. Okay. Yeah, cool
