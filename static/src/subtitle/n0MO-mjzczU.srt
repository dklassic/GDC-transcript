00:00:06,303 --> 00:00:10,684
Thank you for taking the time to watch my presentation,

2
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:15,144
which is titled Creating Ghosts from Across the Pacific.

3
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:16,064
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:17,305
My name is Jason Connell.

5
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:21,165
I'm a creative director and art director at Sucker Punch

6
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:23,786
and was art director on Ghosts of Tsushima.

7
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:27,026
I have an art and background, art and computer science

8
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:33,447
background, roughly 17 years experience doing what I do.

9
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:35,848
I come from a background of lighting.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:44,244
shaders, lighting and color and cinematography. And yeah, and if you want to reach me, you can

11
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:51,228
reach me at my Twitter here at Art Envelope. I work at Sucker Punch Productions. Sucker Punch

12
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:58,231
Productions has been around for coming on I think about 25 years and they've made some super cool

13
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:04,975
action games. I've been there for about 11 years. I was a big fan of Sly Cooper and a super big fan

14
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:06,095
of Infamous.

15
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:11,370
And I came around the time that Infamous 2 was being created.

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,511
And eventually we went on to make a game called

17
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:16,313
Infamous Second Son, which is made in Seattle.

18
00:01:16,313 --> 00:01:19,414
And that's actually really about where we're located.

19
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:22,015
We're located across the water from Lake Washington

20
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,636
and Bellevue, which is just super close to Seattle,

21
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:26,357
for those who don't know.

22
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,238
And so that was kind of our backyard,

23
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:31,039
creating this open world action game with a guy

24
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,040
who has superhero powers.

25
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:37,293
And that power of doing right by the details,

26
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:40,014
not all the details, but the details to sort of capture

27
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:43,935
what Seattle could feel like was a great learning for us

28
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:47,056
because our next game was about bringing

29
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:49,956
the authenticity of an open world environment

30
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:53,257
to a place that is pretty far away from us.

31
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:56,218
And we had to really utilize some of our skill sets.

32
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,678
But really, frankly,

33
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:04,986
we had to develop a whole lot of new skill sets in order to make this work. This is very

34
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:09,711
very different from Seattle. So and it was also far back in time and I'm talking of course I'm

35
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:16,278
talking about Ghost of Tsushima. Now you know this time we're not creating Seattle we're creating

36
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:20,389
or representing a culture that we do not know.

37
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:21,690
It's not familiar.

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,311
It's not local by any stretch of imagination.

39
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,152
We are not inherently experts.

40
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:28,973
And it's certainly not anywhere close to 1274.

41
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,474
In fact, it's so long ago

42
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:33,255
that it's hard to actually dig up history about it.

43
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,716
You know, Ghost of Tsushima is an open world.

44
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:42,909
action samurai game inspired by real events in history. The Mongols invaded in 1274.

45
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:48,712
And to make this game, we really had to partner with people across the Pacific to make a game

46
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:55,316
that respects the genre and the culture. We effectively had to change the way we make

47
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:57,158
games and had a lot to learn along the way.

48
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,252
Now everything that I'm going to talk about today is super important but it probably could come off

49
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:10,814
at some point and it sounds like you know maybe each one of these topics is just too laborious

50
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:16,016
and you may ask yourself is why is this actually important you know um that I'm going to talk a

51
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:20,737
lot about how much time it takes to sort of solve some of these problems and you might think well

52
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:25,359
that's a huge tax on making fast decisions and you know we all want to fail fast it's video games

53
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:26,299
it's creative endeavors.

54
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:32,121
That's true, but it does take time to sort out some of these issues.

55
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:38,723
Simple things may seem more complex, but to us, solving these issues and developing these

56
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:43,505
relationships with our consultants and stuff was sort of the cost of entry.

57
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,906
So why is this important?

58
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:51,547
It's important because we felt like we had a duty to treat this with care, to fulfill

59
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,688
the expectations of the genre.

60
00:03:54,553 --> 00:04:00,797
and to do so with thoughtfulness, because that was our goal. We wanted to create something that

61
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:06,200
people who like this genre of movies or books or other games that could be excited about it,

62
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,743
but it was viewed as something that was done with thoughtfulness. So to this day, Ghost of Tsushima

63
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:15,226
has won some various awards, including some specific accolades by Japanese gamers and press.

64
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:19,669
Famitsu 40 out of 40 was super humbling for us.

65
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:21,410
And recently Nate and I got,

66
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,291
and extended to the rest of the studio,

67
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,133
awarded honorary tourism ambassadors to Tsushima,

68
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,414
which is just like the coolest thing

69
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:30,655
that's ever happened in my life.

70
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:31,956
But it did take a lot of work to get here.

71
00:04:31,956 --> 00:04:34,717
So let me share a little bit about our journey

72
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,838
in making this game from across the Pacific.

73
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:40,080
This talk is broken up into four sections.

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,642
I'm gonna talk about how Ghost came about.

75
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:48,692
sort of hinging on, almost didn't come about because of a single fear,

76
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:53,115
sort of our transition into having to take the position of learning. We're directors and leaders

77
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:57,598
and that's how we've made games. We've built upon, you know, we make decisions built off our

78
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:02,181
expertise, but this time we're going to have to sit down and listen to somebody else tell us what

79
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:07,325
they think is right for us in this particular game. And that's a different frame of mind.

80
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:13,273
as well as the complications of once you do become that student, you do hire consultants,

81
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:17,258
you're going to get feedback about history and culture and sometimes that goes in conflict with

82
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,660
the game you're creating.

83
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:20,865
and you gotta sort that out.

84
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:24,428
And I'm gonna share with you some of our insight there.

85
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:27,070
And lastly, it's kind of a form of its own,

86
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,792
it's like entertainment consultant,

87
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:32,555
is what inspirations do you have

88
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:36,058
and what inspirations specifically we had for Ghost.

89
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,080
Let's start off with talking about the beginning.

90
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,143
So it was August, 2014.

91
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,784
We just created Infamous First Light.

92
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:47,253
And it took us a little bit of time to figure out what we're going to do next.

93
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:53,515
We knew we had the opportunity to create a new IP, and we had some ideas.

94
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:58,217
And these ideas, I'd said we had something like 150 people at the studio at Sucker Punch.

95
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:00,958
These ideas that we had were very broad.

96
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,458
They were cool ideas, but they were very broad.

97
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:07,139
And you take every single person in the studio and they form their own

98
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,640
slightly different variation of what that idea could be.

99
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:14,300
And it was just really hard to bring it to a super sharp, simple idea.

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,161
And that's what we needed.

101
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:17,662
We needed an idea for our next game that was...

102
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:21,484
We didn't want everybody to be on the exact same page, because that's what,

103
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:24,205
you know, having variation and differing opinion is what makes great games.

104
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:30,329
But we needed something that was sharper and more simple and really powerful

105
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:34,231
and that our 150 people weren't going off wildly in different directions.

106
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:39,433
And what we decided is that we needed another strong player fantasy to fulfill.

107
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,547
And frankly, we've done this before, right?

108
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:45,154
Second Son, or excuse me, Infus, and Infamous in general,

109
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,299
is a superhero player fantasy,

110
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:49,184
or the Sly series is about being a thief.

111
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:53,208
we have expertise here, and this was something

112
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,310
that we've done a great job with in the past.

113
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,711
So we knew we wanted to do that again.

114
00:06:56,711 --> 00:07:00,694
What's the super clear player fantasy we wanted to fulfill?

115
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:02,836
So we talked about being a medieval knight

116
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,317
and what that might look like,

117
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:06,219
a medieval knight simulator or something like that.

118
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,120
Or, you know, hey, we could do a modern thief game.

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,301
And we have some expertise in the past.

120
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:11,843
Some of those people are still at the studio.

121
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:13,344
Hey, could we do this?

122
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:16,427
And then we had the beauty, the samurai,

123
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:19,069
the game that we ended up making.

124
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:19,309
But.

125
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:22,867
We actually crossed this one out really fast.

126
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,889
Nate and I, we were like,

127
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,291
we're totally culturally inexperienced here.

128
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,674
I'm not sure if we know how we can make this game.

129
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:34,795
We don't have cultural experts.

130
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:37,057
We don't have experience hiring that many

131
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,979
to make a game as big and as epic as we'd like to.

132
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,320
We sort of had this moment of fear.

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,161
So we were cursed down Knight and Thief

134
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,382
for about two more weeks.

135
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,204
I don't remember how long it was exactly.

136
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:49,805
And then we came back and we're like, you know what?

137
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:57,219
We love samurai stories. We're huge fans of samurai cinema, Kurosawa, or you know, I know

138
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:04,383
Nate's a big fan of graphic novels like Lone Wolf and Cub or Usagi Ujimbo. We're so inspired by this

139
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:09,886
that we felt like we should at least give it a shot. Because at this point in a project, if

140
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:13,168
you don't have enough ambition and passion to carry you through...

141
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,592
now you're not going to for the next four or five years. I mean these games would take so long to

142
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:21,015
make. So Samurai it was. We decided we were going to try it. We gave it some heart and we started

143
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:27,379
working on it and we had we had we had we had ourselves going in a direction. But we still

144
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:34,585
had that fear in the back of our minds. How are we going to do this thoughtfully? We had this

145
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:39,988
very real cultural journey that was in front of us that we needed to understand and figure out

146
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:42,550
how are we going to accomplish it?

147
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,111
The interesting thing is that very quickly we realized,

148
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:48,432
well, we do have some pretty big advantages.

149
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:51,853
For example, we had people within our organization

150
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:53,313
that we had worked with for a long time

151
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,474
that were Japanese, that were big fans of Sucker Punch,

152
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:57,415
that we could talk to and give them the pitch

153
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,716
and tell them what we were planning on doing

154
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:01,956
and just get their feedback.

155
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:04,737
And Shuhei Ishida-san was so excited about the game

156
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:05,598
and gave us some feedback

157
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:07,118
about how we might be able to create it

158
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:08,699
that it gave us ambition

159
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,400
that we might be able to pull this off.

160
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,780
And frankly, for us to...

161
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,703
be successful here, we didn't know how much we were going to be doing this, but we did know that

162
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:22,384
there were some things we're going to have to change in the way we make games. First of all,

163
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:27,606
every time you make a game, somebody's going to get hired. It's animator or a graphics engineer,

164
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:34,449
producers. This time, there was this whole new subset of team members that we were going to

165
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,471
have to hire that we had never experienced working with in the past.

166
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:43,992
people that even at that point when we started, you know, we knew we had a, for example, religion,

167
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:47,697
we needed somebody to help us with Japanese religion because we were totally inexperienced

168
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:52,202
here. But as time went on, that team, that list just grew and grew and grew. But we knew that

169
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:56,327
we're going to have to kind of reshape our minds a little bit about what type of team members we're

170
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,730
going to need in order to pull this off. And

171
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:03,816
going to have to do research. Now, every game, especially these big games like this, you know,

172
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:08,298
there's lots of research that goes in, like shader research, you know, for example, but not

173
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:13,920
to the level of like historical, religious, you know, cultural, deep cultural research and

174
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,682
consultants guiding it. It's just something that we've just totally never done before. And these two

175
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,863
were going to catapult us into, um...

176
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,505
being absorbed with information. We're going to constantly be giving information and that

177
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:32,447
really catapulted us into the second section I want to talk about. So we had Ghost. Our fears

178
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:37,589
of creating it were defeated by our excitement and some of our partners and like you know,

179
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:43,190
Shu being so supportive so early gave us enthusiasm to move forward. But now we have,

180
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,931
we are put into a position where we

181
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:51,684
no longer can just sit there and be directors about literally everything. We had to sit down

182
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:57,667
a little bit and sort of frankly buckle up and take in information and realize that we're not

183
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:03,690
gonna be driving literally everything. That's good. And I'm gonna talk a little bit about that. So

184
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:10,413
we sort of had to become students. And becoming a student has got a couple things in common,

185
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:15,476
like you gotta show up, gotta have an urge to listen, gotta have a yearning to learn.

186
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,908
probably going to accept the fact that you don't know everything.

187
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:26,508
certainly about checking assumptions. I saw a samurai movie one time. That's great. It might

188
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:31,230
have some great information in there, but it's great to sort of check those assumptions with

189
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,951
some consultants. They might be like, yeah, but it doesn't work the way you think it might. And

190
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:41,753
that was really good for us. And frankly, the most important one around the topic of being a student

191
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:47,275
is really getting into research and especially field research, if you can. And for us, it was

192
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:48,055
really beneficial.

193
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:53,993
because that's the really exciting one. We actually got to go on a trip to Tsushima in Japan and do

194
00:11:53,993 --> 00:12:02,040
real research and that's just so much deeper than your typical cursory kind of, well,

195
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,746
Google's not cursory anymore. You can learn anything on Google, but this was just so powerful

196
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:12,650
for us that it helped augment the work that we're already doing from a research angle.

197
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:18,809
photos that we were looking at and documents we were reading online, actually getting to

198
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:19,470
go to the place.

199
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,934
And I took all these pictures I'm about to show you.

200
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:27,201
I kind of went there thinking, you know, you know, this is gonna be one thing, but it really

201
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:30,987
provided proved to be sort of beneficial in ways that I, I hadn't.

202
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:37,076
from that trip feeling the way I did. I really went into that trip thinking, oh this is gonna

203
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:41,817
be great. We're gonna go on this epic trip to Japan. You know, we're gonna gain a ton of knowledge

204
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:49,000
of what it is that we were building and how to create it effectively. And this did become true,

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,462
right? You know, Tsushima and greater Japan and all this, you know, on our entire trip this did

206
00:12:54,462 --> 00:13:00,264
become true. We learned about, you know, what did the buildings look like? How tall were they? What

207
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:01,585
materials were they made of?

208
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:05,699
You know those cool katanas and no-dachis and odachis?

209
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,860
Like, how do you create a sword?

210
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,080
What types of foliage should we use

211
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,120
in certain climates of Japan?

212
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,561
Thousands of photos, hundreds of pages of note,

213
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,682
two trips to Japan with 10-plus members

214
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:21,322
of our sort of senior leads and directors.

215
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:25,043
We brought back an enormous library of photos,

216
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:28,224
drone footage, you name it, to reference from.

217
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,464
It was awesome.

218
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:30,964
All right.

219
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:37,529
To me, the real beauty was so, so much more important

220
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:37,969
than that.

221
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:41,773
It was building new relationships with people

222
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:45,096
that were going to guide us, passionately guide us

223
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,597
and desperately guide us.

224
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:50,061
One, they had so much energy for helping us.

225
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,742
And we were so inexperienced here,

226
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:54,325
like just learning the types of questions we need to ask

227
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:57,488
and, you know, and how to document it and how to...

228
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:03,544
uh, categorize our notes. Like it's just, there's just so much to take in. But the human connection

229
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:08,806
with some of these people, like, uh, the guy in the black shirt here, his name is Jonah, Jonah Nagai.

230
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:14,209
And he worked for Sony Japan, helped organize our first trip. I was on this trip with him and he was

231
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:18,670
so invested in answering any question we had, you know, introducing us to food. He took us to this

232
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,813
shrine, which is where one of the warriors that fought at this actual real invasion, he fought

233
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:25,973
and died here on this beach.

234
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,005
there was a shrine here commemorating this fight, took us there, took us to the beach where the

235
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:37,951
invasion actually happened. It's called Komodohama Beach. Honestly, I thought it was just gonna be

236
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:45,018
those photos and sort of just like what we're making and what became true was I was so invested

237
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,039
from

238
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,819
an emotionally perspective, emotional point of view. Like I came back home thinking I really

239
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:54,562
want to do right by all the people that helped us and the new colleagues that I have and the

240
00:14:54,562 --> 00:15:00,767
new friends that I had. I really wanted to do right by the locations that I saw and I think

241
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:04,790
our entire team felt that way. And so you have this like personal investment that's far bigger

242
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,235
than just creating a piece of entertainment and it really helps drive your ambition and your passion

243
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:15,539
and your patience to to tackle some of these very challenging problems ahead. So that personal

244
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,200
investment is very real.

245
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,990
When you take on a project like this,

246
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,372
you're also going to learn a lot about various things.

247
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:24,973
Here's a katana or a tachi.

248
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:27,714
A tachi, I can't remember exactly what this one is,

249
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:30,435
but you learn a lot about how a sword is created.

250
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:32,756
And this right here is called a suba.

251
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,597
And suba is just this hand guard.

252
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:37,318
And that's what I kind of went into this trip

253
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,238
thinking it was.

254
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,959
And then I went to a sword museum,

255
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,740
and I realized, and this sword museum was just insane.

256
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,241
They make swords, they have old decorative swords here.

257
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:48,768
and you realize this Suba is not just a hand card, it is a hand card.

258
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:50,351
It's a lot more than that.

259
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,162
It is icons of just artistry and mastery. Just beautiful pieces of Japanese artwork

260
00:15:57,162 --> 00:16:01,943
that I just kind of thought was a cool looking hand guard. And you realize that sometimes it's

261
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:06,625
connected to family, sometimes it's connected to stories. There's so much art and craft that

262
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:11,226
goes into a single sword. And that, even that little piece of inspiration, that little nugget

263
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:16,968
of knowledge, drives so... You come back home in months later and it drives so much energy to create.

264
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:22,691
our own weapons and our own swords and getting those details, not just to be cool, but if we

265
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:27,374
had a character that was, her name was Masako, who was going after the people that killed her

266
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:33,998
grand, her grandbabies, she's a hunter. And so going after, you know, when we have to create

267
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:37,540
this piece of artwork, it's not just a generic piece of cool art, it's connected to who she is

268
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,664
as a character in an artfully poetic way, deepening her story or deepening our main hero story, which

269
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:46,425
is Jin Sakai, the Sakai storm, you know.

270
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:52,965
deeply connected to him and his pushing out the Mongol invasions, which, you know,

271
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:57,168
they say that a windstorm came and pushed them, pushed the Mongols off the island.

272
00:16:57,168 --> 00:17:02,050
And that's, that's like us being inspired by the artistry and the craftsmanship,

273
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,773
even in this single Suba. And so that research trip did give us a lot of photos.

274
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:11,475
It did give us a lot of great, you know, references guide,

275
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:15,297
but the personal investment to do a great job coming back home and saying.

276
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,904
Man, Jonah was a great guy.

277
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,286
I want to do right by him.

278
00:17:19,286 --> 00:17:21,007
How can, you know, and feeling that you're now

279
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,788
you're part of a team and that inspiration

280
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:26,912
carried us through so many, so many hard times.

281
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,235
And I can't recommend a trip like that enough.

282
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:31,416
We did have to grow our team.

283
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,217
We grew our team quite a bit.

284
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:35,619
This isn't all of them, but these are the types of positions

285
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,881
that we sort of grew in terms of the consultants

286
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:38,942
we bring on.

287
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:40,423
We had a number of people from Sony Japan

288
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:42,705
that actually helped us from the very beginning.

289
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:51,785
Yuhei Katami actually ended up moving over to the US at some point and he actually worked on our project full time for a number of years.

290
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:55,447
He's a great producer, a great consultant, he's just incredible.

291
00:17:55,447 --> 00:18:03,213
And so we've surrounded ourselves with some internal folks and then we actually surrounded ourselves with some language consultants,

292
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:08,316
some Mongolian language consultants. We had one person very early on to just help us understand religion,

293
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:12,800
the difference between Shintoism, Shinto and Buddhism, or a temple.

294
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:20,560
shrine, it was very confusing. And it's even more confusing for 1274, predating the Meiji restoration,

295
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,303
it even gets more complex. And so having someone that was just an expert in this very complicated

296
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:31,966
area was so helpful. Obviously our game's about combat. There's a ton of combat consultants that

297
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:36,908
we had, and all of them are just exquisite and just amazing and just so so helpful.

298
00:18:37,835 --> 00:18:42,845
And we even had some people that weren't necessarily brought on to be consultant guides, like Shigeru

299
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:45,730
Umabayashi was our composer, one of our two composers.

300
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,488
and he's Japanese, and he would see our game

301
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:50,429
and he would give us feedback.

302
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,871
And of course, it was just like so great

303
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:56,372
to get feedback from our Japanese composer

304
00:18:56,372 --> 00:18:58,313
and to hear his voice and to just understand

305
00:18:58,313 --> 00:18:59,854
what he thought we were making

306
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:01,695
and what we could do to make it better.

307
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:03,696
So even though he's making the music

308
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:04,757
and I couldn't wait to hear the music,

309
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:07,338
I was also excited that he was invested enough to say,

310
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:09,660
hey, you know, maybe these plants could be different.

311
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,720
And that was excellent.

312
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,963
So we've equipped ourselves.

313
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:23,496
with new colleagues to guide us and we've sort of gotten into this position of learning,

314
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:30,158
like really sitting back and taking a seat, taking a position of learning from these guides.

315
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:34,419
So now we have these historical guides and we have these consultants, cultural consultants

316
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:40,060
surrounding us, but we still had to make a game and sometimes there's this conflict, you know, the

317
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:46,996
Something the guide says is very different than what you need the game to be, and you have to resolve this conflict.

318
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:53,239
And this is where all I can tell you right up front is that the majority of time it can take to get these problems right.

319
00:19:53,239 --> 00:20:00,261
Because it's about balancing, you know, how can the game be an incredibly fun game,

320
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:04,082
but also a poetic and artful and thoughtful experience.

321
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:08,324
And that takes time, and it takes time getting to know your consultants, it takes time getting to know your game.

322
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:13,364
And that's a huge part of what we do.

323
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:16,366
And so I'm going to talk a little bit

324
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,767
about some of our examples and some of our goals

325
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,268
with what we were doing.

326
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:24,090
So at the very top, it's important to really highlight

327
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,991
what we were building.

328
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,913
Now, we are not, and we never wanted

329
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:32,875
to be a sort of a Tsushima one for one, rock for rock,

330
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,557
stone for stone, building for building simulator.

331
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,182
First of all, the game, it takes place in 1274.

332
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:41,824
It's just so long ago, it's hard to even understand

333
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,245
exactly where things were.

334
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:48,407
But furthermore, that's not our team size, it's not our goal.

335
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,869
It's actually, our goal is to really just get enough

336
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:54,411
of those details right to transport you

337
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:57,412
in an artistic and respectful way.

338
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:58,653
If the details are really important,

339
00:20:58,653 --> 00:20:59,553
we're gonna get them right.

340
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:00,774
We're not gonna mess those up.

341
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:02,755
And we surround ourselves with people to get it right.

342
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:04,977
But outside of that, we want you to feel

343
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:08,936
transported and it make it feel memorable for you.

344
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,778
And actually, this is just for its worth.

345
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:14,442
This is exactly what we did the second time we made the game in Seattle.

346
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:17,544
But, you know, Pioneer Square doesn't look anything like our Pioneer Square.

347
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,646
It has similar brick types and material types.

348
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:23,009
The Space Needle is in the game, but it's not exactly in the right spot.

349
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:27,774
And, you know, we were there are two bridges, but they're sort of nowhere

350
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:29,696
near the same type of bridges that we have here.

351
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:32,965
it's about the impressionistic view of something,

352
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:37,368
a blurry-eyed view showcasing sort of the feeling of a place.

353
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:41,712
If people's perception of Seattle is rainy and wet, it is.

354
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:43,774
Then we should deliver some version of that.

355
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:44,815
And maybe we push it.

356
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:45,615
And we may be expressive.

357
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:47,237
So we're trying to create a Tsushima that

358
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:48,718
can be expressive and artful and entertaining,

359
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:50,739
but culturally thoughtful as well.

360
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,502
Now, if it's not about getting every single detail right,

361
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:54,062
there's a problem.

362
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:54,863
There's a misunderstanding.

363
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:56,424
Right?

364
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:58,186
And if weThreeD implemented that,

365
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,947
then we did all the erasers and everything else.

366
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:05,578
that's great. You might think that saves you some time, but I'll tell you, I don't know if it does,

367
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:10,680
because literally, as soon as you invite your consultants to sort of kind of partake in giving

368
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,803
feedback on every axis of your game, you realize very quickly that every department is going to

369
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:21,525
be affected by this. So you have to plan for the time. So just to run through a couple things

370
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:24,867
that you may not consider, I've heard all of these on our game.

371
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:28,251
There's an instrument in the game that's playing.

372
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:30,653
Was that instrument really around in 1274?

373
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:34,036
Or those outfits, they don't really look like

374
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:35,757
the history reference that I saw.

375
00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:39,821
Or that family crest, it's real and it's a modern crest

376
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:42,003
and it belongs to a modern family.

377
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:45,906
This could be sort of looked at poorly.

378
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,909
The story moment is anachronistic

379
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,630
or the architectural style is off

380
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,852
or the dialect is too modern.

381
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:55,582
It's not about, I could go on and on,

382
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,864
it's not about getting all of these right

383
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:00,066
because we don't have the time.

384
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,527
We could work on this for 10 years

385
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:02,728
and you could get some of these wrong.

386
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:04,690
It's just creating them is tough.

387
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,371
But which ones are important?

388
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:08,093
That's the ones you wanna work with your guides on.

389
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:10,395
Which ones are the ones that we must get right?

390
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:13,217
And which ones are gonna be transportative?

391
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:14,859
And you wanna get those right because.

392
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:27,453
really know what a torii gate was before I took on this project. I kind of knew, but you know,

393
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:31,136
taking on this project you learn very quickly what it is. But you know, in our team we started

394
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:35,340
first putting the gates in the world and you google a torii gate and you're going to get

395
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,384
something like this pretty quickly. You're going to see something modern, it's a little flashy,

396
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:45,508
it's larger, it's not of humble origins, it's of you know pretty big origins.

397
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,322
and you work with your consultants pretty early and you realize this is not really representing

398
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:56,723
an authentic view of old Japan. This feels very new and modern and you get guidance that like

399
00:23:56,723 --> 00:24:00,224
maybe you should head back into a more natural feeling where you feel like they're made out of

400
00:24:00,224 --> 00:24:08,667
natural pieces of wood. They're humbler in size to represent the smaller community that Sushima

401
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,247
had.

402
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:12,441
There's a lot of amazing shrines on Tsushima,

403
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:15,503
but we were representing it a little bit poorly at first

404
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:17,045
in our first kind of look into it.

405
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:19,266
So it's about going one level deeper on those details

406
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,868
to make sure that you get them right.

407
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:24,491
And so thanks to our guys for helping out with those details.

408
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:25,512
And there's a lot more,

409
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,493
especially around religion that I could go into,

410
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:31,116
but I'm gonna hit a couple other topics like naming.

411
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,418
Now, naming a hero for a new IP

412
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:35,120
that nobody's heard this name before.

413
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:41,073
it's so hard. You want it to be short and sweet and has personality and easy to say,

414
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:45,654
you know, regardless of what you're making. You want these memorable names.

415
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:51,596
And, you know, we had this complication here that, you know, was brought up. It's like, oh,

416
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:56,357
well, are we going to name him in the English version? Are we going to name him

417
00:24:56,357 --> 00:25:00,197
like it would be in Japan where you'd have the family name and then the given name? Or are we

418
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:04,518
going to do a European style or, you know, how my name is like Jen Sakai, Jason Connell.

419
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:09,416
And we actually had to talk about this, because all your scripts will have to be written this way.

420
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:12,537
You know, it's a pretty big change if you're going to do it in English.

421
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:15,658
We had to talk about it. You had to create time to have this discussion,

422
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:17,839
which we've never had this problem before.

423
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:23,040
Now, this problem ended up solving itself because we decided to make a Japanese localization track,

424
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,261
ship with every single copy, and you can select it from the very first menu in the game.

425
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:29,302
We realized that this is going to solve itself.

426
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:31,422
We're just going to let people play the way they want to play.

427
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:38,106
But at that time, we did consider the options early on. We had to discuss this. Our consultants

428
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:42,047
brought it up. I think Ryuhei brought it up himself. And there are other issues that we

429
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:45,469
had with names. Like we had a character whose name shipped with Yuna, but her name was Yone

430
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:51,611
for a very long time. And that name actually came from one of our Japanese partners very early. Now

431
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:59,273
her character over time started morphing into a character that had modern ideals and sort of

432
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:01,014
that name Yone.

433
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,181
sort of started clashing with sort of her character type over time and we started getting

434
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:12,982
feedback from our consultants and our kind of partners that her name didn't really fit with

435
00:26:12,982 --> 00:26:19,183
who she's becoming and man we had already done written some stuff we had been working on this

436
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:24,964
name for a long time and to us Yone and Yuna sound so similar we don't know and so we're

437
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:29,064
completely blind to this and so you have to trust in the people that you're getting guidance from

438
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:30,525
and so for this particular example

439
00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:35,907
even though we didn't understand and maybe we were even perplexed, you have to ask them and you have

440
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:40,411
to trust. And when somebody says, oh, the character doesn't feel like it matches the name, it really

441
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:45,035
kind of pulls you out of the experience for them. If the name felt very old, it was an old feeling

442
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:50,539
name and this character was very modern in their ideals, that's bad to us. I don't want that for

443
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:55,843
any of our characters. So even though we had production sort of things to sort out, we ended

444
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:58,285
up changing the character's name. Now, again,

445
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:01,671
I could continue going on and on and on with a ton of examples.

446
00:27:01,671 --> 00:27:06,640
In fact, probably could give a two hour presentation about all of these types of examples, but

447
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,362
that's not the point.

448
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:07,923
The point is.

449
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:11,287
This stuff, it takes time.

450
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:12,587
It takes time to sort them out.

451
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:14,447
It takes time to realize which consultants

452
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,028
are the right people to handle different types of,

453
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:18,729
tackle different types of problems.

454
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:20,489
It takes time to hire consultants.

455
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,950
The whole process takes time.

456
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,571
And even with us being pretty committed to it,

457
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:27,531
it still takes a lot of time.

458
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:30,012
So I think that's one of my most important points

459
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:31,472
that I wanted to convey in this, is

460
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:35,113
that even though our team treated this very, very, very

461
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,114
seriously, it still just took a lot of time.

462
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:46,111
I do think there's some things I can share though that might be helpful. So here were a few ways

463
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:52,315
that we, you know, when we get a piece of feedback that we could potentially see the feedback be

464
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:56,899
broken up into different types of answers. So we'd get a piece of feedback and talking to our

465
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:01,643
consultant they would say, oh you know what this is an okay thing to experiment in so we'd be good

466
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:03,684
to go and we would try some experimentation.

467
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:06,397
We'd get some feedback that's just like a hard no.

468
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:09,699
This is super, you know, you need to avoid this.

469
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:11,960
This is, you know, it's not what you think it is.

470
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,381
And we just full stop, we just listen.

471
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:16,223
Sometimes there's game needs

472
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:19,485
and the game has to function a certain way.

473
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:21,186
There's, it's gotta be fun.

474
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:24,508
We want the progression to work a certain way.

475
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:24,748
And

476
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:27,297
that doesn't mean we don't listen to our consultants at all.

477
00:28:27,297 --> 00:28:30,440
We just kind of keep going back saying, okay, what if we try this?

478
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,201
Or what if we try that?

479
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:35,685
And typically we can find something that works, that feels comfortable,

480
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:37,607
and we can both have our cake and eat it too.

481
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:41,470
And then sometimes, it's my favorite, you can have feedback that inspires design

482
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,352
and inspire big design changes.

483
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:45,354
Let me give you a couple examples.

484
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:49,798
We at one point in the script had seppuku, which is this act of sort of killing oneself.

485
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:56,281
and super clear feedback very early on that that was something we should avoid.

486
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,863
It's out of time period. It felt like we were shoving it in because it's a trope.

487
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:04,425
We thought it was very interesting. We certainly didn't want any of that. So we actually rewrote

488
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:10,007
that out and we've never looked back. It was the right decision and we're really glad that we removed it.

489
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:14,509
We get feedback about architecture in our game.

490
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:18,256
So we did have a lot of architecture that was Kamakura period inspired.

491
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,820
And if you know, that's actually the time period that these buildings were built.

492
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,122
And there was a certain way they looked.

493
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:48,870
But at some point we started experimenting with other types of building structures and we got some feedback that why are we doing this and we would talk to them and what we learned is that you know what, it's actually great if you do a good job with establishing Kamakura as the base, and then you're sort of exploring in architectural styles to try to create unique feeling across the island or little pockets of, you know, you know, memorable locations and it was okay to experiment and that was that was good for us to hear. Same thing with outfits, by the way.

494
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:56,269
Sometimes the game has needs and our game specifically we wanted no mini-map, we wanted no compass, we didn't want...

495
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:00,112
we wanted to be able to look around the island and see what you want to do next, but

496
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:06,237
Tsushima is like hills everywhere and super dense forests. We have a horse...

497
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,673
You've got to ride a horse, you've got to fight, you can't be on steep inclines.

498
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:12,835
So we actually had to flatten some areas out.

499
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:13,876
We still have lots of hills.

500
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:15,017
We had to flatten some areas out.

501
00:30:15,017 --> 00:30:18,460
We had to de-forest a little bit so that we could get that, you know,

502
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,502
those flat areas where you could see where you're going next.

503
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:24,165
And we had to work with our consultants about what the right feeling was.

504
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:26,287
And we eventually got there in a great way.

505
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:29,069
But that was a lot of where the game had needs.

506
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:33,173
And lastly, we used to have hunting in the game because I think it's very common.

507
00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:33,673
And, you know.

508
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:36,242
have bow, see animal, must kill.

509
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:39,163
There's this like feature that's hunting in games

510
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:41,104
that is great for a lot of games

511
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:43,745
and we didn't particularly want to go deep on it.

512
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:47,007
But moreover, we got feedback that hunting deer

513
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:50,208
was just so strange because hunting mindlessly

514
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,609
didn't really fit into the culture of Japan.

515
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:53,670
You know, it was sort of like they had a lot of

516
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,331
huge respect for animals, especially these deer.

517
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,332
So, okay, we had to reevaluate this.

518
00:30:57,332 --> 00:31:00,093
At the same time, we were discussing ways

519
00:31:00,093 --> 00:31:02,274
in which we could, you know, maybe

520
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:10,952
make Jin fall in love with the island? How can we inspire him to really feel like he's being guided

521
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:16,057
by the island more? And this changed the way that we treat animals. Sort of, next thing you know,

522
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:22,064
the wind came up, and then we had birds. We de-incentivized killing deer, and sort of,

523
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:26,509
and kind of gave us a whole new look at some of the way we treat animals in the game.

524
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:44,279
So I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the takeaways for some of the areas where our consultants and our guides came into sort of almost like conflict with some of our game goals and how we sort of maybe overcame some of those and some of the takeaways.

525
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,360
Well, first of all, 1274 was so long ago that there were.

526
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:54,982
a numerous amount of historical discrepancies and variation in what we were kind of researching.

527
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:59,584
It was just kind of all over the place. We had to surround ourselves with enough guides that

528
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:05,166
would give us good feedback and we would have to take the best approximate guess to sort of solve

529
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:10,948
some of our historical-based issues. You know, we surround ourselves with the facts and try to do

530
00:32:10,948 --> 00:32:16,770
the best we could. Each example, as given by the previous section with the four quadrants,

531
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:22,455
challenges. I mean, they're different teams, they're different challenges,

532
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:29,541
they're different levels of passion. And sometimes, sometimes it's even

533
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:34,105
technical hurdles. I guess it's, it's, it's, it's can underline in bold this,

534
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:39,730
but it's just so different for each piece of feedback that you might get.

535
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:45,896
Now, one thing that we did was really helpful is we had Rie Katami, he was

536
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:54,308
sort of our point person, he was at the nexus of almost every single piece of feedback that we

537
00:32:54,308 --> 00:33:00,110
tried to address. In fact, actually, he became so close to some of the team members. I know for me,

538
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:06,532
in particular, I utilized my, my, my, my relationship with Yuriyuhei grew so much

539
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:09,394
throughout the part of this project, because I would talk to him so much. I'd be like,

540
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:11,975
hey, what do you think about this? Hey, what do you think about that? You know,

541
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:15,296
anytime he and I, or one of their leads had an idea about.

542
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:20,053
Doesn't matter if it's an animation thing, you know, how the character holds a sword,

543
00:33:20,053 --> 00:33:22,120
or a story thing, or an architectural bit.

544
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,512
we would call him and say, hey, what do you think about blah?

545
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:29,554
And if he didn't know, then he would kind of go down the list

546
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:32,155
of he would know who to talk to and would either point us

547
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:34,036
in the right direction or he would take

548
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:34,936
on the problem himself.

549
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:37,497
He was so invested in having that single point of contact

550
00:33:37,497 --> 00:33:42,560
allowed us to be very proactive in our endeavors

551
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,401
to sort these problems out and point at them

552
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:48,222
as in the ideation phase, not wait till they're already

553
00:33:48,222 --> 00:33:48,983
through production.

554
00:33:50,122 --> 00:33:54,503
And it was also made it really great to, you know, I think this is a great goal.

555
00:33:54,503 --> 00:33:58,324
Luckily for us, it never turned into an us versus them or, you know, game

556
00:33:58,324 --> 00:34:04,166
versus history in a real, you know, conflict like negative sense.

557
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,467
It was very collaborative.

558
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:09,308
And it was that way because it felt like we had, you know, people like you

559
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:12,269
to helping us that were just part of the game team.

560
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:14,570
Like we were just trying to create a great game together.

561
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,590
And that collaboration.

562
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:17,569
is key because we are a team.

563
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:21,011
And I can't say this enough too, that it really

564
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:24,694
isn't about getting all the details perfectly fit

565
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:27,396
and right, and even our consultants would guide us

566
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:27,596
here.

567
00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:30,798
It's about very specific ones are very important.

568
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:33,139
But it's enough to earn that belief and that trust

569
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,301
and that respect.

570
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:38,363
And then the rest of it's how do you

571
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:41,005
create the great piece of poetic entertainment

572
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:42,546
that we were hoping that we would create?

573
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,493
And that sort of goes on to talk a little bit about the next session.

574
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,736
You know, that's a little bit about how we dealt with some of that feedback

575
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:56,001
and how entertainment and sort of our guidance along the way could sometimes collide.

576
00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:00,041
And hopefully that's helpful to you.

577
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,162
But this next section is really,

578
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:05,584
I wanna talk about what inspired Ghost

579
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:09,346
and how frankly, this is the other pieces of entertainment

580
00:35:09,346 --> 00:35:14,328
ended up being sort of their own consultants in a way.

581
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:16,770
I wanna talk about our, frankly, our inspirations.

582
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,292
We talk a lot about various types of other consultants

583
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,213
that we had that were very specialized

584
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,673
that we brought in to help create the game.

585
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:37,757
But one very important strategy is that we study the works of all of these great creators that came before our game was even an idea, or even sometimes before we were around.

586
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:45,939
How have Japanese artists and filmmakers and Japanese game developers depicted Japan in the past?

587
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:49,400
Or maybe Japan-like places, if that's a made-up place.

588
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,676
So our goal was to create a piece, you know, an entertainment piece, a piece of

589
00:35:54,676 --> 00:36:00,183
a work of art and a game that sits right next to the artistry that we were,

590
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:02,726
frankly, inspired by so much growing up.

591
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:05,950
You know, frankly, we had decades of entertainment consumption.

592
00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:09,398
that have been ingrained into who we are.

593
00:36:09,398 --> 00:36:10,758
And so we really believe that looking

594
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:12,559
at some of these neighbors, some of our most

595
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:14,820
influential pieces of work, could really help guide us.

596
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,521
So I'm going to show you some of the inspirations that we had,

597
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:19,622
ones that we held onto really tightly,

598
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:24,043
even though it might have taken some time for a while for us

599
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:27,345
to really see the benefits come out.

600
00:36:27,345 --> 00:36:31,166
So we did set out with a few very distinct visual

601
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:34,908
inspirations in mind, famous simplified illustrators.

602
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:42,056
from Japan like Hasui Kawase featured really low detail style block print artwork

603
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:47,079
Bold and high contrast yet really impactful. You don't really see the rocks and the sand in these illustrations

604
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,241
But what you do see is the memorable shapes the bold colors

605
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:54,683
It's it's very curated and there's a lot of overlap with this simplified look and feel

606
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:57,525
to this wonderful game called Breath of the Wild

607
00:36:57,525 --> 00:37:00,326
that showcases really great, you know, kind of restrained

608
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:01,987
and disciplined use of color

609
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,308
and this like single beautiful species of grass

610
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,388
that's like a love leaf,

611
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:08,069
like a loving leaf flowing through in the wind.

612
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:09,930
It's beautiful.

613
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,871
And there's this low noise feeling,

614
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:13,492
this high color and saturation

615
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:16,013
and this great curated feeling to both of these.

616
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:17,613
So the question was,

617
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,395
could we take these types of inspirations?

618
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:24,915
and apply them to a more realistic samurai epic?

619
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:25,796
That was the question.

620
00:37:25,796 --> 00:37:28,938
And this proved to be pretty hard.

621
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:33,482
You know, we were frankly inherently Western game artists

622
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:36,484
and our goal was, left our own kind of path,

623
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:40,727
was sort of heading towards the path of general realism.

624
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:42,488
And so a common goal in games

625
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:44,510
is to create these realistic spaces.

626
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,211
And we just got done with Second Son,

627
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:48,033
which was like, had a little bit of that realism

628
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,254
and that grittiness.

629
00:37:49,254 --> 00:37:50,475
You know, Seattle's very different.

630
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:56,157
And we kind of really headed this way pretty hard, but it just felt like something wasn't right.

631
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:59,279
It wasn't really transportative. It wasn't very memorable.

632
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:03,882
And at one point, it certainly didn't feel like some of those references that I just showed you.

633
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:07,544
And at some point on the project, fairly early,

634
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:11,907
Shuhei Yoshida-san gave us feedback that his memory,

635
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:16,110
and this is great, his memory of Japan is that it was more green.

636
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,684
He felt like it was missing that.

637
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:19,765
And I just really liked that.

638
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:23,449
I thought that him saying his memory of Japan is a memory.

639
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:26,072
Because memories are this blurry thing

640
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:30,396
where you don't see every single tiny little detail, right?

641
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:35,842
Really, the only things that resonate with you,

642
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:37,243
something will stand out.

643
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:40,447
So if we were going to create a fern forest.

644
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:45,796
why would we go with the one on the left when we could honestly head more in this direction where

645
00:38:45,796 --> 00:38:50,859
we create a fern forest that is single and species type it's like all-consuming like we

646
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:56,502
want to leave you with the memory of a fern forest it's certainly more saturated more green

647
00:38:57,482 --> 00:39:02,445
and hopefully you step away from that feeling like I visited the Fern Forest and I know where it is now.

648
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:06,528
And this had a lot of overlap with, you know, some of the references that I kind of mentioned

649
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:14,413
earlier and certainly some of the paintings or the illustrations that I mentioned as well from Kawase.

650
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:20,477
So this was resonating with us and so we started taking the game in this direction and

651
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:23,298
boy the visuals exploded everywhere.

652
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:29,937
you went in the game, you could find this magnificent, beautiful, simplified, yet still

653
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:33,838
gritty and kind of realistic if you wanted to look at it. It had realistic features, but it was very

654
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:40,380
simplified in like species. And that was so important to us. This was so important to us,

655
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,101
the noise, like the low noise to try to match this like feeling, was so important to us that we

656
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:51,463
created tools that our artists could use to find areas where there was too much noise in the game.

657
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,224
If it was red, it was too noisy, and the artist could go in and do a pass to remove the amount of noise.

658
00:39:57,224 --> 00:40:05,169
And therefore, you could have this... you could very quickly and easily isolate that this rock texture here...

659
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:09,673
It's a great rock texture, but it was very noisy, and you could go in and address it,

660
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:17,838
and simplify it down, and let it sit down, and sort of be complementary to the art style that we were trying to go for, instead of this...

661
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:21,743
realistic noise to the frame.

662
00:40:22,634 --> 00:40:25,475
And this was wonderful because we're making an open world game,

663
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:27,316
and this was our visual target.

664
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:31,198
And where we landed was sort of in the cinematic,

665
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:33,498
stylized view of the game, where there

666
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:37,880
was minimal sort of species around the world in terms

667
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,262
of foliage, but really, really, really impactful and colorful.

668
00:40:42,262 --> 00:40:43,803
And at the textural level, we try

669
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:46,024
to remove as much noise as possible

670
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:47,924
so you see the details that matter,

671
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:50,525
which is sort of a theme for this entire topic,

672
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:51,746
or this entire talk.

673
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,687
And that manifested into multiple different types of biomes

674
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,430
and an art style that sort of resonated

675
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,812
with our fans in the end.

676
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:02,477
But it's not all about, obviously, style and color.

677
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:05,381
There's tons of other areas we were inspired by

678
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,684
that changed the course of the game.

679
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:13,626
Cinematography could go on and on about the types of cinematography that we were inspired by.

680
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:20,250
I'll just say that we looked at a lot of old and new samurai movies and we would look for patterns

681
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,673
and there were patterns that would pop up in a lot of these films and one of them is which

682
00:41:24,673 --> 00:41:29,056
is like a centered framing with a human or a subject matter and in the very very center but

683
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:34,199
it's very equal framing and so we would look for these patterns and then we would look for areas

684
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,399
whether it was in marketing.

685
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:42,882
or in the actual game cinematography that we could utilize these patterns in our own ways,

686
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:48,248
because we know it would resonate with other fans that had watched these types of films, etc.

687
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:50,607
Here's another one.

688
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:50,847
Duels.

689
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:53,290
If you've seen a samurai movie, there's this,

690
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:57,134
it's not about the duel, it's about the human tension

691
00:41:57,134 --> 00:42:00,357
that's so palpable between these two fierce warriors

692
00:42:00,357 --> 00:42:03,200
that are sort of standing behind this beautiful backdrop.

693
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,363
Everything is just so amazing around them,

694
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:08,726
and yet there's just this silent tension

695
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,989
between these two people.

696
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:14,645
You know, I didn't grow up necessarily watching samurai movies.

697
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:18,108
In fact, I grew up watching what most of us would feel like

698
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:20,310
in the West or in the US might be more

699
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,772
familiar to, which is Westerns.

700
00:42:22,772 --> 00:42:25,494
And they have the same thing because they are inspired by that.

701
00:42:25,494 --> 00:42:30,458
There's the same human tension is so palpable between two gunslingers.

702
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,320
That is, it's two people with a sword.

703
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:38,298
And so we really felt like this was a great thing to capitalize on in terms of like put into our

704
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:43,046
game having that human tension because you've seen it in samurai movies and it's real and it's human

705
00:42:43,046 --> 00:42:46,171
but it was also familiar. So what we did is we created

706
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,996
a number of very specific duels in our game.

707
00:42:48,996 --> 00:42:51,858
And those duels are set against unique backdrops,

708
00:42:51,858 --> 00:42:54,380
really a beautiful display of environment art.

709
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,321
There's this human narrative that usually is going on

710
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,483
between you and the person that you're dueling.

711
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:00,203
It's fairly serious.

712
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,105
They're actually pretty tough too.

713
00:43:02,105 --> 00:43:05,327
And there's a cinematic that happens before

714
00:43:05,327 --> 00:43:06,527
that builds the music.

715
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:10,510
It's really built around having tension before the fight.

716
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,752
We would also create a feature later on called standoffs

717
00:43:13,752 --> 00:43:16,153
that would let you have systemic duels.

718
00:43:17,057 --> 00:43:19,719
more often, more frequent at your own discretion.

719
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:23,182
But getting that attention was really key for us.

720
00:43:23,182 --> 00:43:26,785
We also were inspired by a number of books, whether it's graphic novels

721
00:43:26,785 --> 00:43:29,567
for entertainment, or if it was documentaries and books that would

722
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:30,688
help us understand the history.

723
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:34,591
You know, both of them do so much, but you know, the entertainment based books,

724
00:43:34,591 --> 00:43:38,814
the graphic novels, the artistry in them, we could learn, I think what we learned

725
00:43:38,814 --> 00:43:40,676
was like human connection.

726
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:47,492
variety of types of complex relationships, whether it was, you know, protecting a young kid or,

727
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:51,814
you know, something about betrayal, like somebody that might betray you.

728
00:43:51,814 --> 00:43:59,157
And certainly the books we learned about just how can we best depict the Mongol invasion

729
00:43:59,157 --> 00:44:03,038
and do right by what these history books could help us help us out with.

730
00:44:03,038 --> 00:44:04,919
So we looked at several books as well.

731
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:12,025
Sometimes our research and our kind of entertainment inspiration overlap,

732
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:16,015
and our historical research and our kind of love for samurai cinema overlap.

733
00:44:16,936 --> 00:44:22,839
And in one particular way, it came out with just this like crazy, interesting, super new idea for the game.

734
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:33,183
So we're big fans of, you know, movies, Kurosawa movies, these movies that have wind and movement in these famous samurai classics.

735
00:44:33,183 --> 00:44:39,446
But turns out, I mentioned a little bit before, but the wind also had a major part in the actual history.

736
00:44:40,282 --> 00:44:42,484
of the events of 1274, the invasion.

737
00:44:42,484 --> 00:44:44,866
The belief is that this windstorm,

738
00:44:44,866 --> 00:44:47,308
known as the Divine Wind,

739
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:49,650
sort of pushed the Mongols back to sea

740
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:52,773
and protected Japan, not once, but actually twice.

741
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,016
And that's kind of an incredible story,

742
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:59,479
so incredible that we really decided

743
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:00,920
that we should underline this.

744
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,222
And it ended up becoming a mechanic in our game.

745
00:45:03,222 --> 00:45:06,946
In our game, the wind, if you haven't played it,

746
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:07,366
the wind...

747
00:45:10,347 --> 00:45:13,909
sort of kind of pick the wind's next target and the game's particle effects

748
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:17,952
on the wind would sort of blow in the direction you need to go next. So many

749
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:22,274
reasons why this was a fun decision to come to but it took

750
00:45:22,274 --> 00:45:26,037
that historical research and understanding. It took the years of

751
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:31,040
samurai movie watching that we kind of were so inspired by.

752
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:36,367
And it took us sort of kind of coming up with a variety of ideas to get there.

753
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:41,413
And so those overlapping themes really helped us come up with a really poetic and great feature

754
00:45:41,413 --> 00:45:44,137
that really propelled the game in a lot of ways.

755
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:53,111
So one of our greatest inspirations in the end came full circle.

756
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:58,693
We're finishing up the game and I mentioned that, you know, we were so inspired by Kurosawa.

757
00:45:58,693 --> 00:46:05,936
We actually ended up having a mode in the game called Kurosawa Mode and it was introduced

758
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:11,578
into the game after working with the Kurosawa estate, showing them our game.

759
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:15,882
sort of having a couple back and forths, answering some questions, and really trying to faithfully

760
00:46:15,882 --> 00:46:21,228
show them what we're trying to create. And so much of our game is inspired by the art and the

761
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:27,455
cinematography and the storytelling of a Kurosawa classic. We were just so honored to get to have

762
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:32,160
this relationship and to have this feature and to have it named such. Because in the end,

763
00:46:33,344 --> 00:46:36,366
the fans of our collective,

764
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:38,527
you know, whether it's games or watching those films,

765
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:41,149
our collective biggest fans together

766
00:46:41,149 --> 00:46:43,831
could enjoy this crossover in this way in our game.

767
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:45,612
And that was kind of like,

768
00:46:45,612 --> 00:46:48,774
the sort of towards the end of the project.

769
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:51,756
And it was just this really rewarding moment

770
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:53,537
for everyone here at the team.

771
00:46:56,408 --> 00:47:04,053
So just to kind of recap, we talked about how Ghost got started with a simple player fantasy

772
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:10,217
idea that almost wasn't Samurai because we were scared of this topic. We were scared of how we

773
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:15,580
were going to do this, you know? And I'm so glad we went back and really chose Samurai. It was the

774
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:21,524
right choice for us and I'm so glad that we kind of faced that problem and that challenge head-on.

775
00:47:22,747 --> 00:47:26,524
and didn't let our fears sort of tear us away from our dreams.

776
00:47:28,272 --> 00:47:32,753
We talked a little bit about our kind of journey

777
00:47:32,753 --> 00:47:34,914
into taking a little bit of a backseat,

778
00:47:34,914 --> 00:47:38,495
learning from people, the art of learning, if you will,

779
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,855
and just being really proactive

780
00:47:39,855 --> 00:47:41,976
and developing, frankly, new relationships

781
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:44,777
with a bunch of amazing people

782
00:47:44,777 --> 00:47:46,837
that help make our game great.

783
00:47:46,837 --> 00:47:49,638
And this is where the relationship is forged, right?

784
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:52,138
Like the complex problem solving

785
00:47:52,138 --> 00:47:55,659
between game and authenticity and what happened in history

786
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:56,900
and, you know, making entertainment.

787
00:47:57,529 --> 00:48:00,071
original story versus the true events.

788
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:03,553
This is where the relationships of all of our consultants

789
00:48:03,553 --> 00:48:05,894
thrived and came alive.

790
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:09,436
And hopefully that section was helpful

791
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:14,420
in sharing how we dealt with some of those subjects.

792
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,742
And lastly, way before we ever decided to make this game,

793
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:21,504
we were fans of the genre.

794
00:48:21,504 --> 00:48:25,186
So of course we bring forward our own kind of depiction

795
00:48:25,186 --> 00:48:26,707
of how it.

796
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:28,869
how we would hope it could be represented,

797
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:31,351
how we hope it can be appreciated.

798
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:33,713
And so those inspirations are really important.

799
00:48:33,713 --> 00:48:35,154
And sometimes those inspirations

800
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:36,655
are guided by consultants as well.

801
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:38,657
Other consultants can give us feedback

802
00:48:38,657 --> 00:48:41,099
about its representation in Japan

803
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,221
and how they might, may or may not view it.

804
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:45,242
But those inspirations are kind of

805
00:48:45,242 --> 00:48:46,683
what starts you off to begin with.

806
00:48:46,683 --> 00:48:48,785
So you have to have them throughout the entire game.

807
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:55,153
You know, so to sum up, you know, creating massive pieces of entertainment,

808
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:56,953
they take years to create.

809
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:59,134
Five years to create, six years to create.

810
00:48:59,134 --> 00:49:02,555
Games are, they're so complicated and they're minor miracles

811
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:05,036
that they get finished at all sometimes.

812
00:49:05,036 --> 00:49:07,077
You know, and this is saying you're going through a lot of extra work

813
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,837
and you might ask, why go through all that extra work?

814
00:49:09,837 --> 00:49:11,898
You know, the years spent talking about these reference points,

815
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:17,120
the labor, sometimes reworking, you know, names, you know, for us, it's.

816
00:49:18,128 --> 00:49:24,316
we really wanted to create a game that thoughtfully represents a culture that is not our own.

817
00:49:24,316 --> 00:49:31,525
And then that comes with a sense of responsibility. And if we wanted this to resonate with the wide audience...

818
00:49:32,204 --> 00:49:36,726
in a way that all those classic samurai films did for us,

819
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:39,388
or some of those games and books that I mentioned did for us,

820
00:49:39,388 --> 00:49:42,229
then we really need to pay attention to this.

821
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,650
And we need to take it seriously.

822
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,831
So make no mistake, the responsibility is real,

823
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:47,912
and it's super heavy, and it takes a lot of energy

824
00:49:47,912 --> 00:49:50,293
and patience.

825
00:49:50,293 --> 00:49:55,135
But like most things, it requires strength

826
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:57,316
in relationships with people around you,

827
00:49:57,316 --> 00:49:58,697
especially things like this.

828
00:49:58,697 --> 00:50:01,058
That team that you develop along the way.

829
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:07,609
can be really transformative in the game that you can create.

830
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:11,396
So we're honored.

831
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:17,253
you know, that it played out the way it did. And we did learn from many mishaps and lapses of

832
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:21,776
judgment along the way, but we cannot really express how thankful we are that to all the

833
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:25,979
consultants that did help us on this project, as well as all of our teammates in Japan,

834
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:30,042
the localization team, recorded audio, people that recorded audio from us from Japan, like,

835
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:35,145
it's just the list goes on and on. So I'm just going to put a big loud thank you out to the world.

836
00:50:35,685 --> 00:50:42,928
for anyone that ever helped give guidance and feedback on our project and helped us understand more what we are creating,

837
00:50:42,928 --> 00:50:51,351
so that we could make something that fits the expectations of a great samurai game, a great piece of samurai media.

838
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:58,553
So thank you all for helping us recreate Feudal Japan from across the Pacific.

839
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:01,734
So thank you for listening to my talk.

840
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:08,210
Sucker Punch is hiring if you're looking for a new adventure.

841
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:08,511
Cheers.
