1
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:09,491
Hey guys, thank you for having me back at GDC.

2
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:11,652
Before we get started, guys, this has been amazing.

3
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:15,515
Just putting this together takes so much time and effort.

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,498
And so I just want to applause for Mike, Tim, and Lana

5
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:19,939
to put this together, guys.

6
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:20,259
Thank you.

7
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:26,397
When we started this, it was like eight of us.

8
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:27,299
Now there's 37.

9
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:30,103
You guys should see the email threads that go through.

10
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:31,766
And I can't read all of them.

11
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,269
I would just call Mike and be like, hey,

12
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:34,130
can you just catch me up?

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,297
But the amount of work has been fantastic.

14
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:38,798
So thanks a lot.

15
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:43,624
So, studying of creature animation in films and games.

16
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:46,567
Let me see if that works.

17
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:47,067
There we go.

18
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:48,548
So, quickly about myself.

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,249
My name is Julo Sadool.

20
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:53,712
I'm the CEO and co-founder at Stimulus Studios.

21
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,573
A little bit about my background.

22
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:58,736
I've got 13 years of experience in the industry.

23
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:01,258
Before Stimulus Studios, I was working at Rhythm & Hues,

24
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:02,759
Weather Digital, and DreamWorks Animation.

25
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:08,701
I was an animator and senior animator on The Chronicles of Narnia, Avatar, Prince Caspian,

26
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,361
a few more movies.

27
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:15,843
And a couple games as well, Rises of the Tomb Raider and Deus Ex, Mankind Divided.

28
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:20,905
I was animation lead and supervisor on Rise of the Planet of the Apes on Young Caesar,

29
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:24,386
How to Train Your Dragon 2 on The Beholder Beast and Archean Spray.

30
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:28,607
And I am currently working with Epic on Fortnite and Phoenix Labs on Dauntless.

31
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:31,368
So two more interesting stuff.

32
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:36,137
So game animation, feature animation, and VFX animation.

33
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,617
I'm actually holding a P right now,

34
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:40,998
so let's see how this goes.

35
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:44,500
And I'm usually never prepared, but I had to prepare this time.

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,162
So that conversation regarding game animation, feature

37
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,983
animation, VFX, really, it's something

38
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:56,504
that I've been having a lot of.

39
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:00,463
discussions, arguments, everything with a lot of my colleagues.

40
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:08,976
And it really started when schools started introducing game animation as a class.

41
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:15,517
And that's been, to me, I look at, and it's been confusing

42
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:18,178
and a little frustrating as well because,

43
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:21,859
especially when I hear students go, they label themselves,

44
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:25,001
I'm a game animator, or I'm a film animator,

45
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:27,662
I'm a feature animator, I'm a TV animator.

46
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:30,263
You know, when it comes to animation,

47
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:35,045
The craft itself, there is no difference.

48
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:40,328
The difference between working on a game or a film

49
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,289
might be the same as the difference

50
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,570
between working on two feature films.

51
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,351
Animation itself, the craft itself, an arc is an arc.

52
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,932
A performance is a performance,

53
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:50,953
and anticipation is anticipation.

54
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:55,946
The difference is how you adapt the craft

55
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:58,486
to the specific project that you're working on.

56
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:01,007
The difference between working on a game and a feature film

57
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,268
can be the same as the difference between working

58
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,329
on two different feature films.

59
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,409
For example, oh yeah, I forgot to click.

60
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,550
So anyways, I'm gonna go through this real quick.

61
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:14,455
So for example, working on Rise of the Guardians,

62
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:18,418
then going on to Dragons 2, both feature films,

63
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:22,822
I found the difference in animation between the two,

64
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:27,106
it was absolutely bigger than the difference

65
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,988
between working on the film Avatar, which was a VFX film.

66
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,290
and the game Dauntless.

67
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,094
So my point here is not that we've been wrong

68
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:39,116
to label or categorize animation,

69
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:42,698
but that animation from one project to another,

70
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:46,181
regardless of it being a film or game,

71
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:49,404
requires the animator to rethink their process.

72
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:52,986
find new workflows and adapt their craft

73
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:54,888
to the demands of that project.

74
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:59,031
So it's not the animation itself that's different,

75
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,313
it's everything around it.

76
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:06,457
So when you're learning animation,

77
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:09,639
the thing you have to know is

78
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,521
you have to focus on your craft.

79
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:18,071
You have to make sure that you're working as hard as possible to make yourself the best animator.

80
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:21,833
Not the best game animator, not the best film animator or TV animator.

81
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,135
Just focus on the craft itself.

82
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:28,413
You will learn the process and the workflow

83
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:30,754
while being on the job.

84
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:33,436
You know, when I left Weta and I went to DreamWorks,

85
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:36,918
I did not go to feature animation school.

86
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:39,220
You know, when I left DreamWorks to go to Steamroller

87
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,002
to do games, I didn't go to game animation school.

88
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,083
I'm just an animator, I just had to adapt,

89
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,245
had to learn about how do I adapt my craft

90
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,727
to the specific project.

91
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,268
So,

92
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:55,725
You know, one thing I did realize was,

93
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:58,168
there is a ramp up time to get,

94
00:04:58,168 --> 00:04:59,569
you know, when you're on a new project.

95
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,592
Like for example, on Guardians, when I moved to Dragons,

96
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:03,873
it was a similar ramp up time.

97
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:04,994
I had to learn the new team,

98
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:07,236
I had to learn what the director wants,

99
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,437
the things that I need to do

100
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:09,999
for these dragons to feel alive.

101
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:13,922
And when I move into a game, it's the same process.

102
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:16,383
I have to learn more technical stuff, of course, because

103
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,324
it's a game.

104
00:05:17,324 --> 00:05:20,606
And I need to learn all the specifics of moving my craft

105
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:22,107
into this new field.

106
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:26,731
So the next two things I'm going to talk about.

107
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:31,645
are very much my personal journey and things that I've learned in the industry.

108
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:36,489
It doesn't apply to everybody, but it's something that I've been lucky

109
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:39,791
enough to have worked in the VFX feature

110
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,853
and in the game industry.

111
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:46,477
So, starting a shot and the camera work. In the VFX industry,

112
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:52,821
You have something called a live action plate, which is you

113
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:58,467
get the film that they shot, the shot that they did on set

114
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,049
with the actor in there.

115
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:05,154
It has all the details in there that the director wants, but

116
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:06,195
no visual effects.

117
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,678
then they send this to our team,

118
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:10,220
and this was when I was at Rhythm and Hues

119
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,743
on the museum, and they ask us to actually put,

120
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:14,165
you know, put characters in there.

121
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,250
This is an example of what we call a straight ahead shot.

122
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,454
Not straight ahead animation, straight ahead shot.

123
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,576
It's still playing, sorry.

124
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:29,707
And why it's a straight ahead shot is because there is no

125
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:33,250
interaction between the creatures and the character.

126
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,671
There's barely any interaction with anything else.

127
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:39,294
As you can see, the lion, all the creatures jump from behind

128
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:43,197
there, and right before they jump onto the cage, the shot

129
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:43,438
is cut.

130
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:44,799
So that's a straightforward shot.

131
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:49,522
And it's actually really rare in the VFX industry that you

132
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:52,084
get something like this, something as simple and

133
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:52,785
straightforward.

134
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:59,809
usually there's tons of complications and I'm going to share one with you guys. So the next

135
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:05,572
shot I'm going to show you guys was a nightmare of a shot. And actually I've never shown this to

136
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:10,735
anybody because it's embarrassing. But I'm going to show you here for the first time. And you

137
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:13,937
guys have all seen it. If you've seen the movie, rise of the penalty apes.

138
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,088
Anybody? Awesome.

139
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:20,709
And it's a shot that I was stuck with what I had,

140
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,390
and I'm gonna explain it real quickly

141
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,550
before I show it to you guys,

142
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,891
just because I do not have the role I've actually played,

143
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:29,092
you just have to believe me.

144
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:31,212
So in that shot, it was on the Golden Gate Bridge

145
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:35,274
where Buck, the gorilla, had to pull this guy

146
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:38,175
from the back of this truck and throw him off the bridge.

147
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,121
So the plan was that when it comes to animation,

148
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:44,763
we would actually digi-double the actor

149
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,004
and then have the gorilla in CG.

150
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:46,824
Everything would be CG.

151
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,585
You guys know what digi-double is?

152
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:52,067
We'll just CG the character instead of using the actor

153
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,568
and then have the gorilla pull him off the bridge.

154
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,849
Because it's a shot where there's a lot of interaction,

155
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,450
it's really difficult to do.

156
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:03,641
So that was the plan, but when it got to the animation department, we were told that because of budget,

157
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:09,286
because we don't have enough money, I'm going to have to use the actor that they shot on set.

158
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:13,550
So, I'm going to show you guys the shot. Please don't laugh.

159
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:18,937
I said, please don't laugh.

160
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:22,182
So anyways, we're going to talk about this shot.

161
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:23,103
I swear I can animate.

162
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,044
I swear.

163
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:27,348
So we're going to take a look at it.

164
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:28,690
You guys have seen it.

165
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,053
We're going to show it in slow-mo.

166
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,601
and see why it doesn't work.

167
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:38,044
So this guy, when they were shooting him on set,

168
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:42,507
they tied him up, they attached a cable to his back,

169
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:44,808
and instead of pulling him out of the truck,

170
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:47,310
they lifted him up, because they didn't care.

171
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,471
He was just there to be temp.

172
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:53,153
It was just an idea, just for the length of the shot.

173
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:56,399
because they thought they were gonna didger double that.

174
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,281
But when he came to us and they told us to do this,

175
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:59,862
we're like, all right, so how am I gonna do that?

176
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:02,285
I need to have the gorilla pull him out.

177
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:03,386
But no, he's not gonna pull him out,

178
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:04,468
he's gonna lift him up.

179
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:06,730
So when you look at the shot,

180
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,112
very at the very beginning,

181
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,154
he doesn't get pulled, he gets lifted up.

182
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,856
So there's no anticipation to the gorilla.

183
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:14,138
He basically lifts the guy up.

184
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,399
There is no motivation for him to do that.

185
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,360
There basically is no physics whatsoever.

186
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,942
And when the guy goes halfway through, watch what happens.

187
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:25,403
The guy flips, the guy spins.

188
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:27,724
Because he gets lifted up, you can totally see.

189
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:30,825
Because they tied the stupid guy with only one cable.

190
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:31,985
Usually when you do something like this,

191
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,186
you tie him up with a few cables

192
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:34,706
so you control him in the air, but no.

193
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,848
One cable, so of course the stupid guy's gonna spin.

194
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:42,155
So I had to figure out how I'm gonna make him spin and my gorilla holding on to him.

195
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,898
I tried to have him hold his legs.

196
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:47,745
That didn't work because there was no drag in his legs.

197
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:50,490
So the leg spins, goes through the gorilla.

198
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:52,104
Yep, it does.

199
00:09:52,104 --> 00:09:55,088
And then when he throws him, he can't drag,

200
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,910
usually you would drag somebody,

201
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,232
there'll be a lot of drag physics to the character,

202
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,835
but no, I had to make him push the guy.

203
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,560
Worst thing was, I had to make the gorilla jump

204
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,122
because the guy was so high up.

205
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:09,064
Watch this, the gorilla will leap up in the air

206
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:11,306
because that's what gorillas do, they love jumping.

207
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,804
And so yeah, there's no physics, there's not server.

208
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:19,205
So anyways, this is an embarrassment to my career,

209
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:20,886
but I'm showing it to you guys.

210
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,806
And no one will ever see that again.

211
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:25,227
And when I show this in my demo reel, this is all I show.

212
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:26,248
It's pretty cool.

213
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:31,910
No one knows.

214
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:39,020
So this is basically an example of what can go wrong when

215
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,784
you're working on something that is not well planned on

216
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,425
set, because they had it.

217
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:48,185
Well, it was planned.

218
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:50,587
They had it planned, but it didn't work out, and you have

219
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:52,148
to do with these things.

220
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,069
So in feature animation.

221
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,472
You don't have live action plates, right?

222
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:02,994
You actually get storyboards.

223
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:08,358
For the most part, you do get animatics or layout work.

224
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:11,761
But you get animatics and layout also in VFX,

225
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,762
but usually because you're tied to the camera

226
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:16,244
and to the plate, you don't have the freedom

227
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,185
to do whatever you want.

228
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:21,008
But the good thing about VFX is there is a guide.

229
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:24,996
You use that plate, live action plate, as a guide.

230
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:27,120
In feature animation, you don't have so much as a guide

231
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,544
in terms of plate, but you do get layout work

232
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:30,286
that is sent to you.

233
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,786
So, in feature animation, you get a bit more freedom, of course, because you don't have

234
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:39,910
that live action plate, but that has its pros and cons.

235
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,933
You're not limited to live action plate.

236
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,795
The camera and layout department will do that for you.

237
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:47,981
So these are images, actually, of storyboards.

238
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:52,305
Because the boards were reading so well, we actually tried to

239
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:53,146
match it in the film.

240
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,947
The top one, actually, they're both from

241
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,370
Art of the New Dragon 2.

242
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,694
And where we tried to, with the characters and the

243
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:05,097
composition in animation, we tried to really

244
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,059
match these boards.

245
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,943
So the next shot I'm going to show you guys is.

246
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:17,747
is an example of what freedom allows you to do,

247
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:20,889
especially the freedom you have in feature animation

248
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:23,710
where you're not stuck to a specific camera.

249
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,433
So I got this shot to get to, let's say, on a Monday,

250
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,213
I get that shot.

251
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:31,074
And in this shot, basically, there

252
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:33,135
is Astrid jumping on the back of her natter.

253
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:37,796
And the intent of the shot was to make Astrid look really cool.

254
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:41,097
So I get that shot, and I spent about an hour on it.

255
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:44,618
I put some basic wind flap in there

256
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:47,938
and kind of linearly have Astrid jump up.

257
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,579
There's no animation on this.

258
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:50,619
It's just blocking.

259
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:53,219
And then I show it to the director and the camera

260
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:56,160
department to show this is not really working.

261
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,981
We look at it because usually the intent of a shot

262
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:00,881
is what you want to.

263
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:05,888
To succeed at if the shots about Astrid being cool

264
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:11,433
No one cares about how cool the animation is Astrid needs to look cool. So it needs to work really well

265
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:14,855
So what do you guys see here is you Astrid looking cool?

266
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:18,478
You barely can see him barely can see her she gets cut off at the end

267
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:24,163
You don't even see her head so that wasn't working so the framing was off. So I tell the director, okay

268
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:26,184
I'm gonna do a pass at it where I try to lock

269
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:31,706
her on camera. So of course I need a blessing from the camera

270
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:35,348
department. And they tell me, yes, I can do that. Now I lock

271
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,608
him on camera. So at the end you're like, oh, yeah, look,

272
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,890
that works. You see her. Well, not really because she gets cut

273
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,131
off really quickly at the end, too. You can see you see her and

274
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:47,532
then she's gone. So the shot was actually too short. So now

275
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:51,133
they're like, okay, we need to extend the shot. I can't just go

276
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,153
and extend it myself.

277
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:55,850
because I'm going to mess up with the edit. So what they do

278
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,157
is they tell me, hey, do a quick little pass, extend the shot,

279
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:02,962
and then send it to the camera department, and they'll do what

280
00:14:02,962 --> 00:14:04,905
they're good at. Yeah, right.

281
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:07,096
So, no, they're good at it.

282
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,737
So anyways, I do a tweak to it,

283
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:11,138
I extend the shot myself.

284
00:14:11,138 --> 00:14:12,619
Of course there's no animation to it,

285
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,280
it's just the camera extended.

286
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,242
And I show the camera department,

287
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:20,103
hey, this is what, I think this is the length that I want,

288
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:21,304
so let's make this work.

289
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:24,566
They do their pass at it, they send it back to me,

290
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:26,447
and I tweak my animation to actually work

291
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,028
more with the shot.

292
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:29,048
So now you see this and you're like,

293
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:30,809
oh yeah, you get some more time to see her.

294
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,918
So we actually did that back and forth, you know,

295
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:37,299
many more times, maybe two more times after that,

296
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,380
and we kept bringing her closer to the camera

297
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,181
to actually read her expressions,

298
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,223
and in the end, you know, it looked like this in the film.

299
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:46,765
Because we had way more, we added about 19 more frames

300
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,006
to this so she can get closer to the camera.

301
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:54,217
So this is the type of back and forth between animation

302
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:55,678
and camera in the camera department

303
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:58,921
that is very common in feature animation,

304
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:02,945
but something that is very, very rare in VFX.

305
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:06,708
You're stuck to the live action plate.

306
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,690
So that said.

307
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:19,728
In games, especially for in-game animation, when you launch on a

308
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:24,889
game, you get this.

309
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,809
And that's it.

310
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,810
So well, no, you actually get the character as well.

311
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,110
You would get a character in there.

312
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,371
And this is a blank Maya scene.

313
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:34,911
If you guys don't know what it is, Maya is a tool a lot of

314
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,671
animators use for animation.

315
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,312
You guys all know what Maya is?

316
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:38,712
I'm sure.

317
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,792
Awesome.

318
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:47,105
I'm an idiot and and so you don't get you know storyboards or animatics

319
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:52,549
You know you you get but what you do get though you get a little description of what you're supposed to do

320
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,832
so for example you get to

321
00:15:55,832 --> 00:16:01,677
Make it wing slash. I love this you're like awesome as an animator now you look at this you're like wait

322
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:05,260
I don't have a camera. I don't have a live-action plate. I don't have storyboards

323
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,623
This is this is practice whatever I want, but no you get that

324
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:11,703
Attack will be 150 frames long,

325
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:14,364
anticipation needs to be 60 frames,

326
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,926
the wing needs to open around frame 30,

327
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:19,808
the slash needs to last for 40 frames,

328
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:22,609
the slash needs to do a spin for 360,

329
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:26,192
the last pose of the slash needs to hold for 20 frames,

330
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:29,434
and the creature needs to settle during the last 30 frames.

331
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,015
Pretty crazy.

332
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,756
You get exactly what you need to do

333
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:34,997
for this to actually work.

334
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:37,628
uh... you know

335
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:40,510
you don't have free reign you know because

336
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,113
in games it's not animation that rules actually game design it needs to

337
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:45,554
actually work

338
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:48,696
so uh... actually this this creature

339
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:52,238
is uh... is uh... is a behemoth from the

340
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:55,560
from the game dark list that is being launched you know midway through the year

341
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,322
and uh... and simon hunger who is simon where are you at

342
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:00,464
he's one of the animation supervisors there

343
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:02,305
and uh... the game

344
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:06,530
Basically, we'll have lots of creatures in there, lots of behemoths in there.

345
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,416
And the wonderful team at Phoenix Lab partnered with us at Stimulus Studios to actually bring

346
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,360
these creatures to life.

347
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,782
So check it out when it comes out.

348
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,065
It's going to be awesome.

349
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:20,748
So for this next animation...

350
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:29,705
we were to make this creature called a Shrike land from a flying pose.

351
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:34,971
So, you know, and if you've worked in the VFX or film industry or feature animation,

352
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:40,338
the chances of you doing a landing or taking off or flying character is actually...

353
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:47,083
huge. Every movie now has a flying creature. So I've done flying before and we had to do this

354
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:54,328
one. For example, when I was on Avatar I had to do this shot where the Banshee lens comes out,

355
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:59,492
Nitori's Banshee. And there's one thing about this shot is there's a lot of cheat in this shot

356
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:03,174
because like I said, I had a camera to work with.

357
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:07,437
I had a plate to work with and I had a lot of guide,

358
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,019
I have a huge guide to work with.

359
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,841
So if you look at this shot from the side,

360
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,383
it actually doesn't work because this creature

361
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,785
is way too big to be landing that fast

362
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,886
because he comes out really fast

363
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:21,488
and then he just stops and start to land.

364
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:24,690
I didn't have much time but you don't always notice it

365
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,053
because I had to do some cheats.

366
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:29,854
I mean, the distance between that tree

367
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:31,396
and the branch he lands was way too short.

368
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:36,820
So what I did is I exaggerated the up and down of that character's chest.

369
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,543
A lot of up and down, probably more than I should have,

370
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:44,126
to kind of trick the audience into looking at something else

371
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:46,949
instead of the fact that he just stops immediately.

372
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:52,553
So there are cheats you can do because you have a still camera

373
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:54,515
and you can animate to the camera.

374
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,417
So you can do these cheats.

375
00:18:56,417 --> 00:19:00,480
And that happens all the time, maybe in VFX or feature animation.

376
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,214
So you can get away with things.

377
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:10,979
But when it comes to games, you do not have this luxury.

378
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:15,322
For The Shrike, on Dauntless, we didn't have that chance to

379
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,943
actually cheat.

380
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:22,187
Josiah Massengill, our lead on Dauntless, had to make sure it

381
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:23,388
worked from all angles.

382
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:25,329
And why that was cool is because we were able to use

383
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,191
that same animation in the trailer.

384
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:30,834
And that's something we would not have been able to do if we

385
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,757
didn't make sure it looks good from every angle.

386
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,579
So that's something that's really cool.

387
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:38,282
Sometimes in games, you can get away with reusing the

388
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:42,846
animation, because it looks good from different angles.

389
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:42,986
So.

390
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:52,669
The next thing I want to talk about is how important the rigging department is with animation.

391
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:56,073
Riggers and animators are the best of friends. Actually, not all the time.

392
00:19:56,073 --> 00:20:04,423
But it's really important for animators and riggers to actually nurture this relationship.

393
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:10,981
And Jared Snover at DreamWorks, one of the best riggers I've ever worked with.

394
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:16,765
And I will never forget when I was launched on the Bewilderbeast,

395
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:20,928
I was called to Simon Otto's office, my animation director, and he said,

396
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,911
Hey, Jalil, we need to do a test to show Jeffrey Katzenberg,

397
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:27,693
and we're going to see the Bewilderbeast for the first time.

398
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,455
I was like, oh, that's great, I'm excited about this.

399
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:32,056
I didn't know that the rig was ready.

400
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:33,257
It was, oh yeah, and the rig is not ready.

401
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:36,884
I was like, so okay, so you want me to do a test

402
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:39,365
to show the boss to sell a dragon to him

403
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:42,548
and the rig is not ready and he needs to like it?

404
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:45,490
I was like, I love my job, I don't want to get fired.

405
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,651
He goes, you'll be fine.

406
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:48,692
You'll be fine, okay, sure.

407
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:50,894
So I run to the riggers and I'm like,

408
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:54,397
okay guys, so we need to do this Beholder Beast test.

409
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:55,637
Can we do that?

410
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:58,119
It's awesome to work with a team of riggers

411
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,360
that will say yes to everything.

412
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,802
They will be like, oh yeah, of course we can.

413
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:04,940
Oh yeah, but the body isn't ready, we only have the head.

414
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,182
I was like, only the head is rigged?

415
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,042
He goes, yes.

416
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,664
Oh actually the jaw is broken and the eyes are broken.

417
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:13,947
I was like, how am I gonna do this?

418
00:21:13,947 --> 00:21:16,329
He goes, oh we'll be fine, we'll just fix the head for you

419
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:18,370
and fix the jaw and fix the eyes, you'll be fine.

420
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,813
I was like, all right, so it's great that they can do that

421
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,234
because they worked all night,

422
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:25,196
got the rig ready for me the next day.

423
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:30,793
And so my point is here is that not always are the rigs ready,

424
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:32,634
especially in feature animation.

425
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:35,857
So after a few days, I was able to do a test with it.

426
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:39,119
As you can see, the neck is broken.

427
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,541
The spikes are broken.

428
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,822
Legs don't work.

429
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:46,025
But I used the head, the jaw, whatever I had to kind of sell

430
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:46,505
the animation.

431
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:51,429
and we showed it to Jeffrey and he liked it and I did lose my job.

432
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:57,414
So my point here is that in feature animation there's usually more R&D time.

433
00:21:57,414 --> 00:22:02,358
The early teams get to do performance tests with the rough rigs and usually all the animation

434
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:05,181
you do during this test are never seen on screen.

435
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:12,285
So, but the great thing is that you get to know your character really, really well when you have so much time.

436
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:23,012
In games, it's kind of similar in some ways because the animation, the production time is actually longer than in VFX because you usually approach things in iteration.

437
00:22:23,012 --> 00:22:29,777
You know, you get to, sometimes you do get unfinished rigs to work with and then they update the rig, then you have to redo the animation. Just like that.

438
00:22:30,814 --> 00:22:33,576
In VFX, rigs tend to be further along.

439
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:36,098
When you start your animation, VFX studios

440
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:38,960
are used to faster turnarounds.

441
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,201
The downside is that usually you don't

442
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:44,643
have enough time to do R&D. VFX studios also

443
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:47,645
work on more projects, so they need a much better,

444
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:51,788
straightforward, streamlined rigging system.

445
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,810
Sometimes VFX studios would take on similar projects

446
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,871
back to back.

447
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:58,373
For example, on Narnia and at the museum,

448
00:22:58,373 --> 00:22:59,393
we actually used.

449
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:03,297
almost the same rig that we use on Aslan and the Lions are now the museum.

450
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:04,979
Not many people know that.

451
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:10,083
Hey, now Rhythm and Hues is closed down so they can't sue me anymore for saying that.

452
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,366
It's so mean. I love Rhythm and Hues.

453
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:15,608
So, anyways, that's that.

454
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:23,015
So, in VFX, timing is based on performance.

455
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:25,518
I don't know why I'm saying feature over there. Did I get something wrong?

456
00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:27,683
All right, maybe.

457
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:28,824
I'll keep going.

458
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,067
So in VFX, timing is based on performance

459
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:36,490
but limited to shot length.

460
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,131
Why is this?

461
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:40,093
What that means is, I'm going to keep going, guys.

462
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:43,896
Sorry, I think the slide might be off.

463
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,418
What that means is, oh, you know what?

464
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:46,679
Because I already talked about that.

465
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,721
I'm going to fast forward this.

466
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:50,822
Any questions so far?

467
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:50,862
No?

468
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:50,982
OK.

469
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:55,949
So in VFX, timing is based on performance,

470
00:23:55,949 --> 00:23:57,731
but limited to shot length.

471
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:02,397
What that means is the focus is still on the great performance,

472
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:04,680
but your animation needs to be done

473
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,543
within the length of the live action plate, which

474
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:08,644
we talked about earlier.

475
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,747
In feature, timing is based on performance.

476
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:17,299
like we spoke about earlier, but shots can be extended when you need it.

477
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:23,420
But there is a huge con to that, to having the freedom of time and shot length.

478
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:32,362
Sometimes there's so much focus put on performance that important information is overlooked.

479
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:36,415
That board, which I showed you guys earlier,

480
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:37,896
when you look at these storyboards,

481
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,856
actually, when you look at the framing at the top,

482
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:42,137
the framing's actually better

483
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:44,137
than what I did in my animation.

484
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:47,458
And the reason for that was because, you know,

485
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,259
the director really wanted us to make sure

486
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:53,160
that we can focus on the eye of the bewildered beast

487
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,340
when he comes out of the water.

488
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,260
So I'm gonna show you that shot.

489
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:58,192
and you'll see what I mean.

490
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:01,034
So this was a shot of the Bewildered Beast

491
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:01,715
come out of the water,

492
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:03,216
and the director was like,

493
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:05,478
okay, we need to spend a lot of time.

494
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:06,939
Can you guys see my mouse?

495
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,180
Oh no, you can't, okay.

496
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,541
When the creature comes out,

497
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,224
the screen right eye needs to be clear

498
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:15,947
that he actually looks at Drago,

499
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:19,510
because Drago is showing where he needs to go.

500
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,831
But this shot was difficult to do

501
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:22,292
because it was very busy.

502
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:25,214
There's a lot of stuff going on in this shot.

503
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:26,235
Don't know why it stopped playing.

504
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:31,966
And I had to make sure that I make, you know, I tone down on the rest, for example, tone

505
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,627
down on Drago a little bit, make sure the boat doesn't cover the eyes where it needs

506
00:25:34,627 --> 00:25:34,747
to.

507
00:25:34,747 --> 00:25:35,407
Is it playing?

508
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:35,747
No, it's not.

509
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:38,088
And so we spent a lot of time on this shot to actually make sure that it works.

510
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:40,189
I don't know why it's not playing, guys.

511
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:41,169
I apologize about that.

512
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:44,150
And so we spent a lot of time on this shot to actually make sure that it works.

513
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,551
I don't know why it's not playing, guys.

514
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:46,591
I apologize about that.

515
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:53,277
And you know I spent probably about two weeks just back and forth just to make sure all that stuff is with all the timing

516
00:25:53,277 --> 00:25:57,081
Is there and then you send that shot to the effects department, and that's what came back

517
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:58,883
Yeah, so right there is where I spent most of my time on right there right there

518
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:13,355
where he's supposed to be looking at Drago.

519
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:16,217
So that's an example of how much time we spent

520
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:17,598
on trying to tweak the eye to make it read.

521
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:18,098
And guess what?

522
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:19,780
They took the boat out as well.

523
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,562
And I didn't realize it until the guys,

524
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,063
I didn't realize it when I watched the film

525
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:25,364
until the guys at work was like,

526
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:26,585
hey, they took the boat out.

527
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,066
I was like, they took the boat out.

528
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,728
Sons of bitches.

529
00:26:29,728 --> 00:26:32,910
So, you know, the effects department,

530
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,011
everybody's trying to show off.

531
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,472
This is another example.

532
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:46,254
This is the Bwildebeest going up and what I wanted to do here is really, you know, put some jiggle in that jaw, you know, when the Bwildebeest lands down right there because I wanted to show, wait, this thing is really huge.

533
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:48,816
So the effects department comes back looking like this.

534
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:49,316
Uh oh.

535
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,277
There is some, oh no, he just crashed on me.

536
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:50,737
Let's do that again.

537
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:50,838
Oh no.

538
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:07,965
Oh, yeah, it just crashed.

539
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:08,385
Control-R delete.

540
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:09,566
Does that work?

541
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:13,447
I'm just going to stand over your shoulder and pretend like

542
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:14,307
I'm helping.

543
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:16,068
Yeah, I got this.

544
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,268
Do that one, that one.

545
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,949
Yeah, then click on it.

546
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:20,709
Got it.

547
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:23,170
How much time do I have?

548
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,091
I really go quickly through it.

549
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,891
Let's see.

550
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:29,212
We were right here.

551
00:27:35,593 --> 00:27:37,875
Okay, cool.

552
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,276
So, and it came back like this.

553
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:40,976
This is all the jiggle in the jaw.

554
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:41,516
Fantastic, Jalil, well done.

555
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:42,477
This is another one where I wanted to put

556
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:47,099
a lot more jiggle in the jaw,

557
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,561
because yeah, the director was like,

558
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:53,702
let's sell the impact, let's make sure this lands

559
00:27:53,702 --> 00:27:55,283
and is really powerful.

560
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:58,025
It's like, I got this.

561
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:00,686
Goes to the effective department, comes back.

562
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:04,199
Yeah, we don't need to see it again.

563
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,559
It's nothing to look at.

564
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,001
The next one is my magnum opus.

565
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:10,223
This is the one where I actually spent a long time on.

566
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:13,545
Make sure that, you know, I actually 2D'd the effects

567
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:15,746
so the effects department can follow this.

568
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:17,468
Get all the little jiggle in him, you know,

569
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:19,529
make sure all the dragons shooting at him,

570
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:21,190
it's selling all the impact.

571
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,091
Spent two weeks on this.

572
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:25,613
So happy with the shot, I was coming along.

573
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:27,094
And sent it to the effects department.

574
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:27,875
Comes back like this.

575
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,692
I'm going to write a book about how I've been screwed by the

576
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:36,392
effects department.

577
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:37,673
And you guys should buy it.

578
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:39,755
It's going to make a lot of money.

579
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:41,697
So I think this is it for now.

580
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:46,200
This is the first half of I Got a Sequel at 6 o'clock, I

581
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,082
think, and so be here.

582
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:50,443
We have some more stuff to talk about, and then we'll do

583
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:51,244
a Q&A as well.

584
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:54,587
Thank you very much.

585
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:58,330
All right, so this is where we were.

586
00:28:59,932 --> 00:29:07,976
All right. So timing and performance. So in games, timing is based on gameplay. Extending

587
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:13,879
an animation depends on the game designer. All animations are very specific, have very

588
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:18,821
specific timing. So what I'm going to show you guys right now is actually from the game

589
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:25,945
Dauntless. And what you're seeing is what we should be playing.

590
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:40,807
Oh, just crashed. I think we might need to restart it. Sorry,

591
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:51,531
guys. Any questions? So far? Seriously, any questions? Because

592
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:58,473
we have to restart it. Okay. We're going to do this. It's

593
00:29:58,473 --> 00:29:59,613
going to be great.

594
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,282
I'm going to do a little song and dance. I don't know what I'm doing.

595
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:03,943
I saw your face.

596
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:05,664
Aww, don't name and shame.

597
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:06,044
Laughter.

598
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:14,651
The concept of sweet sex that was just presented.

599
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:14,751
Right.

600
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:18,273
Do you do anything like that in your facial animations?

601
00:30:18,273 --> 00:30:18,473
Yeah.

602
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,033
So the question was the concept of swing set. Do we do something of that?

603
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:28,838
We actually did we actually don't did not do what he did which was awesome because I'm gonna take this idea now

604
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,940
I'm gonna do it at the studio as well

605
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:37,966
animated through it was fantastic, but we do have like the seams and phonemes that we go through we do all the shapes and

606
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:43,130
Actually Mike will talk about that during his talk which we worked with volition on agents of mayhem

607
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,152
We actually did some of these faces

608
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:46,373
but

609
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:47,173
I'm gonna take your idea

610
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:49,617
I have a question.

611
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:56,905
Your studio right now takes a lot of animation work from other studios, right?

612
00:30:56,905 --> 00:31:00,089
So is that the way you think the industry is going?

613
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:04,453
Do you think there's going to be more and more animation studios used as outsourced?

614
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:06,348
Yeah, it's something that we actually fell into.

615
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:08,590
The question was,

616
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,592
Stillmode Studios, where I'm at right now,

617
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:12,453
we actually have a lot,

618
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,234
we're working on a lot of bigger studios

619
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:15,235
to do all of the animation.

620
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:16,036
Not all of the animation,

621
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:17,717
but helping them with the animation work.

622
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:20,920
And it's something that is kind of new,

623
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,422
because outsourcing has always been around,

624
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:26,124
but in games especially, it's always been in-house.

625
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:27,185
But they're discovering now,

626
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,086
because quality of games are actually getting

627
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:29,907
better and better and better.

628
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:34,312
People are starting to realize that maybe we do need help

629
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:37,516
with other teams because it's difficult to hire

630
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:40,740
a bunch of animators and then maintain that,

631
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,704
sustain the amount of work for a long period of time.

632
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:46,227
So it's a lot of money just to bring in 20 animators

633
00:31:46,227 --> 00:31:47,790
just for a few months and lay them off.

634
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,810
So what they do now, a lot of bigger studios

635
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,831
are actually doing this.

636
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:54,292
They find a studio out there, a self-contained unit team

637
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,233
that they can do that.

638
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,414
They can just, you know, they have six, seven animators

639
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:00,595
they can dedicate to another project.

640
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:02,175
I mean, we've done this with Dauntless,

641
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:05,176
with Phoenix Lab, with Epic on Fortnite,

642
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:08,378
with Prey on Arcane, and we've also

643
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:11,099
Agents of Mayhem as well.

644
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,619
And I don't know if that's the future of it,

645
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:14,440
but it's definitely working out for us.

646
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,640
Yeah.

647
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:14,900
Yep.

648
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:23,388
So, previously, there's a trick about, like,

649
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,550
using your hands as a reference for, like,

650
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,432
some weird creature.

651
00:32:27,432 --> 00:32:29,194
Absolutely, yeah, I was laughing when I saw it,

652
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:30,736
because that's something that we do a lot.

653
00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:32,138
At DreamWorks, I would actually,

654
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:33,439
because it's so fast to do that,

655
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,601
you don't have to go in a room and shoot reference.

656
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:37,083
I actually would take my little figurines

657
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,524
and just film it, you know, doing an action.

658
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:38,785
I would take on...

659
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:41,126
Rise of the Guardians for Jack Frost flying,

660
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,307
actually use little Ninja Turtles to just make him fly.

661
00:32:44,307 --> 00:32:46,108
I have to find the shot somewhere.

662
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:48,789
But I just had, you know, I got the timing right

663
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,030
with my hands, I just animated it,

664
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,831
because with your hands you can get the timing that you want.

665
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:55,612
Yeah, good question.

666
00:32:55,612 --> 00:33:00,574
Yeah, I'm actually going to talk about that in a second.

667
00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:01,754
Cool.

668
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:03,375
All right, so, so.

669
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,850
So this video, which I was going to talk about,

670
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,472
is what you're seeing here is a gray box

671
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:10,373
version of an animation.

672
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:13,156
And we're going to use the behemoth from Dauntless

673
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:15,218
called Embermane.

674
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:20,523
And what we do is we find a motion that we actually like.

675
00:33:20,523 --> 00:33:23,706
We get a timing that actually feels right to us

676
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:27,410
by just animating this little box right there.

677
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,272
It's not playing anymore, but we're going to keep going.

678
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:33,255
And when we like this, when we like this timing,

679
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:35,497
then we actually go and block it.

680
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:38,339
And usually what we do is we keep it in step mode,

681
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:40,902
which is what you're seeing right now,

682
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:43,204
where we get to focus on the actual poses.

683
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:45,205
We don't worry about spline for now.

684
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:48,548
And for this character, the team at Fink's Lab,

685
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:52,531
They really wanted us to get a lot of personality

686
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,272
in these creatures, you know, when somebody was just

687
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:55,872
talking about personality earlier.

688
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:58,254
Hence why we did the few little steps, you know,

689
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:00,515
because we knew Embermane would be a stalker,

690
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:03,356
he would try and follow you, so we did that.

691
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:05,818
When this gets approved, then we go on and we spline it.

692
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,757
And then that version, we actually sent it

693
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,698
to the game designers, and then we take this

694
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,419
and put this in the game.

695
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,981
The thing is, I remember that meeting with Simon

696
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:16,702
and his team, and they would come back to us

697
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:19,183
and be like, yeah, Jalil, the amount of time

698
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:22,205
that he's stalking these first few steps

699
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:24,826
would allow the player, give the player a chance

700
00:34:24,826 --> 00:34:27,267
to actually run behind him and attack him.

701
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:28,588
So we had to change that.

702
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:30,429
They said, hey, can you make that faster?

703
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,010
So we went back to the drawing board.

704
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,171
Well, not really back to the drawing board,

705
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,572
but we went back and sped that up.

706
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:37,473
send it back to them, they take a look at it,

707
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:40,054
and it was still too fast.

708
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:41,554
So we went back and forth a couple times,

709
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:43,735
and we realized we can't actually keep

710
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,656
that part of the animation.

711
00:34:45,656 --> 00:34:47,356
Again, like I said, animation,

712
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:48,937
doesn't matter how cool your animation is,

713
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:51,218
it's based on game design and gameplay.

714
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:53,479
So in the end, it just ended up being something like this,

715
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,579
where we took out the whole stalking move,

716
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:56,460
which was really cool.

717
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,383
But what ended up happening was the game designer,

718
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,564
who's super cool to work with,

719
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:03,425
and he looked at it and said,

720
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:05,707
actually I really like this talking movement,

721
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:10,031
we can cut that in half and then use that somewhere else.

722
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:13,333
So it shows that even animation can influence game design.

723
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,494
If they see something cool,

724
00:35:14,494 --> 00:35:16,155
they can think about where can I use this,

725
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,036
and it actually can work.

726
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:19,658
So that was something that worked out really well for us.

727
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:26,132
Next, so making creatures believable

728
00:35:26,132 --> 00:35:29,135
is something that I've been talking about a lot

729
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:31,057
and I think that will answer your question.

730
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:34,040
So one common aspect of the process of animation

731
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,885
is how do you make a creature believable?

732
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:41,366
a creature believable.

733
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:44,488
And that's crucial, and there are no secrets to that.

734
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:46,049
You know, all creature animators

735
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:48,651
will do it in a different way.

736
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:52,834
But not every creature animation is actually successful.

737
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:57,818
So how do you imagine, that was your question I think,

738
00:35:57,818 --> 00:35:59,499
how do you imagine the motion

739
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:00,219
of something that doesn't exist?

740
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:04,582
Well, you relate it to a creature or animal

741
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:05,823
that actually exists.

742
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,294
And that can take time, and in VFX,

743
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,936
usually that takes longer,

744
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:13,079
because usually the director in VFX films

745
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,842
are not in-house, so you have to do something,

746
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,985
try something out, and then send it to them.

747
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:19,466
Sometimes it could take months.

748
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:20,548
On Avatar with James Cameron,

749
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:21,989
he was in L.A. for the most part,

750
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:23,672
so it would take a long time for us

751
00:36:23,672 --> 00:36:24,753
to get approval on something.

752
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:27,895
But in feature, at DreamWorks for example,

753
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:29,997
the director's always there, he's in house,

754
00:36:29,997 --> 00:36:31,538
and you would do something on Dragons 2,

755
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:33,179
we would do a dragon, he's right there,

756
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:34,900
he looks at it, he likes it or he doesn't like it,

757
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,181
you keep working on it.

758
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:39,963
It was much faster to get something that actually works.

759
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:44,006
So part of the planning is to pick the animal

760
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:49,710
or the character that actually can inspire your creature.

761
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,891
Take Toothless for example.

762
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:52,932
You guys know Toothless, our dream dragon?

763
00:36:54,036 --> 00:36:57,158
The reason why Toothless is so loved is because

764
00:36:57,158 --> 00:36:59,240
it's a mixture of a cat and a dog,

765
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,302
pets that we can all relate to.

766
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:05,364
Most of Toothless in the first Dragons film

767
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:08,166
was actually a cat, and while most of Toothless

768
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,548
in the second Dragons film was actually a dog.

769
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:14,110
Because in the first film, Toothless is the mysterious

770
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,851
human killer, but in the second film,

771
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:17,453
he's the best friend of Hiccup,

772
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:19,934
so hence the choice for a dog.

773
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,770
Crusoe as well, from the film which most of you

774
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,951
haven't seen, The Water Horse, no one has seen that movie.

775
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:31,332
But it was really fun because we used the same thing,

776
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:36,274
we actually used puppies for Crusoe and seals.

777
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:38,455
And we mixed that together and it was probably

778
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:42,516
one of my favorite character to work on was that little guy

779
00:37:42,516 --> 00:37:46,637
because he was a little puppy and we made him cute

780
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:48,358
so the audience can connect with it.

781
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,164
again, the lock desk monster doesn't exist but that was

782
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:55,629
something we decided to go with is use pets that people can

783
00:37:55,629 --> 00:38:00,156
relate to. The bewilder beast from Hydrogen Dragon 2,

784
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:03,090
they were a serious challenge,

785
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,572
because definitely on the opposite spectrum of toothless.

786
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:09,253
You know, toothless is mostly puppy, cute, cuddly,

787
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:12,855
but the bewilderbeast were massive, majestic, threatening.

788
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,256
Again, this was another creature

789
00:38:14,256 --> 00:38:16,797
that I had no idea how it would move,

790
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,099
but, you know, or what reference that I would use.

791
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:22,941
So, you know, I knew it had to be big, you know,

792
00:38:22,941 --> 00:38:26,543
it was a monster, but still it had to feel like an animal.

793
00:38:26,543 --> 00:38:28,964
So the good bewilderbeast was the king proud.

794
00:38:29,164 --> 00:38:30,065
you know, powerful.

795
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:32,086
The Babyl the Beast was the tortured soul,

796
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:33,227
the injured animal.

797
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,349
And the director, Dean, really wanted it to feel

798
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:39,632
like it was the king of the dragons against the caged soul.

799
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:43,094
So it was definitely hard to relate to them,

800
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:47,017
but the fact that Valka and the other dragons

801
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:49,779
had so much respect for these two dragons,

802
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:53,662
it was enough to actually, you know, connect with them.

803
00:38:53,662 --> 00:38:55,583
So for the battle sequence,

804
00:38:56,234 --> 00:39:01,417
which took me about five weeks to animate.

805
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:03,738
We wanted the two Builder Beasts to feel like

806
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:05,339
two mountains fighting each other.

807
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,920
And you can see, we used different animals.

808
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,640
We couldn't find one.

809
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,402
We used polar bears and big horns for that first part.

810
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:16,784
We used bulls and buffaloes and moose

811
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:19,206
to actually do the locking the horns.

812
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:23,348
We used the elephant seal for the under the neck attack.

813
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:26,910
I would do reference all the time,

814
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,812
just looking at all these animals for this twist.

815
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:33,615
I used the grizzly bear attacks for that.

816
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:36,077
It was a mixture of all these animals

817
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:39,300
that we've seen before, we can relate to.

818
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,403
That sequence took me about five weeks to do

819
00:39:43,403 --> 00:39:46,245
and by the time this was done, I was completely exhausted

820
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:49,908
because it took the life out of me.

821
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:55,773
In games now, we do very similar type of reference work.

822
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:58,555
This is again from the game Dauntless,

823
00:39:58,555 --> 00:40:01,078
being done by the team at Phoenix Labs.

824
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:05,021
And we treat creatures with the same care

825
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:08,184
and as much attention to detail as we do in films.

826
00:40:09,016 --> 00:40:11,937
This is something that is more common today

827
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:14,038
because of the high quality of video games.

828
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:17,660
Five years ago, it would be rare to see subtle shakes

829
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,681
in a creature's head, body, or tail.

830
00:40:19,681 --> 00:40:23,903
Nowadays, we want characters and creatures

831
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:28,186
in our games to match those in VFX or feature animation.

832
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:31,528
So for Dauntless, we are applying everything we've learned

833
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:32,408
from the film industry.

834
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,049
We're not shying away from a good performance.

835
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,971
We want these behaviors to feel alive.

836
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:39,333
We want the players to feel that they are hunting creatures

837
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,254
with real personalities.

838
00:40:41,254 --> 00:40:44,756
For Shrike, we used owl and bear, obviously.

839
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:46,938
And eagles for the wings.

840
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:49,580
And also cats for some of the locomotion.

841
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,042
For Embermane, we used mostly big cats.

842
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:55,223
For Pangar, we used birds.

843
00:40:55,223 --> 00:40:57,165
And also Jurassic Park.

844
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:01,254
We use Jurassic Park as reference, yes we do.

845
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:03,695
So the length of time of animation,

846
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,415
the amount of time that,

847
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:07,635
let me see.

848
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:11,296
So time management is incredibly important.

849
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:15,857
In feature animation, you are allowed more time

850
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:19,098
to do more research, like I mentioned before.

851
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:21,279
Usually, a feature animated film will average

852
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,519
between 30 and 80 animators.

853
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,620
depending on where you work.

854
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,782
For example, Dreamworks would be 40 animators on a film

855
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:30,703
and Disney could go up to 70 animators.

856
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:35,765
In VFX, usually they would end up with 80 animators,

857
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:38,026
but they have really short deadlines,

858
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:39,687
so it's very, very strict.

859
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:43,389
Sometimes they would go over 100 as well.

860
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:45,910
In games, they have longer production time as well,

861
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,772
but on average you'll get about seven animators,

862
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:51,553
that's if you're lucky on one production.

863
00:41:51,963 --> 00:41:53,764
And then Naughty Dog, they have 40.

864
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:55,526
That broke my theory.

865
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:59,009
But for the, you know, most game companies

866
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,050
would have a small amount of animators.

867
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,053
It's more developers, more designers, more programmers,

868
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:05,674
and less on the animation side.

869
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:08,216
Hence your question, Gwen, you know,

870
00:42:08,216 --> 00:42:10,718
instead of hiring a bunch of animators,

871
00:42:10,718 --> 00:42:13,700
they try to outsource it to different places.

872
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,043
So the last shot I'm gonna show you guys,

873
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:19,545
oh yeah, I forgot I have to go through that.

874
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:23,850
So the last shot I'm gonna show you guys is,

875
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,093
it's a shot that, you know,

876
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:29,838
it's an example of how having too much time

877
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,620
sometimes can be a bad thing

878
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,542
if you don't manage your time really well.

879
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:36,806
So we're gonna watch this shot and...

880
00:42:37,518 --> 00:42:39,880
I got that shot, that was the shot that I got right after

881
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,762
I did the battle between the two Be able to Beast.

882
00:42:42,762 --> 00:42:45,744
And right after this shot, I was going to jump onto

883
00:42:45,744 --> 00:42:48,106
the battle between the Be able to Beast and Toothless.

884
00:42:48,106 --> 00:42:51,489
And so it was two huge shot sequences I was supposed to do

885
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:54,632
and then in the middle, I was waiting for the sequence

886
00:42:54,632 --> 00:42:56,293
to be ready, I get this shot.

887
00:42:56,293 --> 00:42:59,135
And they told me that I have two weeks to do it.

888
00:42:59,135 --> 00:42:59,796
I was like.

889
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:01,706
two weeks to do this shot?

890
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:02,767
They were like, yeah, two weeks.

891
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:05,050
I was like, okay, that's awesome.

892
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,691
And I didn't want to ask too many questions

893
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:08,713
because I'm like, that's, I can do that in a day.

894
00:43:08,713 --> 00:43:11,776
This is awesome, I got two weeks to do this.

895
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:12,817
So I go back to my desk, but I did ask,

896
00:43:12,817 --> 00:43:14,199
I was like, there's nothing else.

897
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,401
I was like, oh yeah, there'll be some background dragons

898
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:17,822
and crowds will take care of that.

899
00:43:17,822 --> 00:43:19,364
I was like, great, so I don't have to do anything.

900
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,425
So I didn't have any more questions,

901
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:22,567
I went back to my desk and I said,

902
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:25,029
wow, I can go home early, I can, you know.

903
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,554
relax on this one, so I would basically, you know,

904
00:43:28,554 --> 00:43:30,876
key the head, move the head around,

905
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:33,378
watch some YouTube videos, walk around,

906
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,220
get some coffee, talk to some friends,

907
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,162
come back to my desk, eh, head doesn't look good,

908
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:40,285
move the head again, key it, some more YouTube videos.

909
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,146
I did this for four days.

910
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:44,669
And I get a call back, I get a call on Friday,

911
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:45,950
and my production manager's like,

912
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,972
so, Jhilo, when are you showing your shot?

913
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:49,473
I was like, ah, Monday.

914
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,622
So, week is gone. They're like, Monday, okay, well, you don't have to show all of the baby dragons.

915
00:43:54,622 --> 00:44:00,085
Just, just, you know, show just a couple if you have them done. I was like, how about it, baby dragon?

916
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:03,347
There were seven baby dragons in the shot.

917
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,426
I just didn't know.

918
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:10,249
And so I was like, okay, yeah,

919
00:44:10,249 --> 00:44:12,291
Mosh, I'll show them on Monday.

920
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:15,753
I was terrified and I sat down at my desk, I was cold,

921
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,815
and my buddy Ted T. walks by and he goes,

922
00:44:17,815 --> 00:44:18,355
dude, what's going on?

923
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,357
I'm like, dude, I've got seven dragons to do

924
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,379
and I've got five, five and a half days.

925
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:24,100
He goes,

926
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:25,764
That's about 1.4 dragons a day?

927
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,604
You're dead, man.

928
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:30,585
So I was like, he's like, okay, listen, dude.

929
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:34,266
What you do is have fun with this shot,

930
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:35,927
and if not, you will go insane.

931
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:38,827
So that's what I learned from this shot was,

932
00:44:38,827 --> 00:44:40,928
you know, having fun with whatever you do

933
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,229
is incredibly important because you think

934
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:45,549
working on movies is fun, yeah, it's fun,

935
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,850
but there are days where you just don't wanna be there,

936
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,690
and you need to force yourself to have fun.

937
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,191
And there are ways to do that,

938
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,392
and on this shot, I learned how to do that.

939
00:44:53,392 --> 00:44:53,472
So.

940
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:57,583
What I did is for the next two, two and a half days,

941
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,304
I just started building cycles,

942
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:00,685
similar to what I would do in games.

943
00:45:00,685 --> 00:45:03,506
So I used like, you know, I wasn't in games at that time,

944
00:45:03,506 --> 00:45:04,607
I hadn't done games at that time,

945
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:06,848
but I used similar ways of doing things.

946
00:45:06,848 --> 00:45:07,948
I would build little cycles.

947
00:45:07,948 --> 00:45:09,949
I'd build a little flap cycle, a little tail cycle,

948
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:12,870
a little idle, and I would populate my dragons,

949
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,031
my baby dragons with that,

950
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:16,812
and then put them on the beautiful beast

951
00:45:16,812 --> 00:45:19,193
and blend in them in between.

952
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:20,674
So in three days, I had six dragons to show.

953
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:25,153
So these were super simple in there, just simple cycles.

954
00:45:25,153 --> 00:45:28,915
I had to animate the end of the shot

955
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:30,016
where they were flying off.

956
00:45:30,016 --> 00:45:32,117
Of course, I was a little more manual.

957
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:34,058
But I showed it on Wednesday,

958
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:37,000
and then I had a couple days to finish the rest.

959
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,801
So what I did though was have fun with these characters.

960
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:42,542
I told myself I've got 1.4 dragons a day

961
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:45,623
and I had to have fun with each of them.

962
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:47,443
For example, the bottom guy on the right,

963
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:50,524
he's trying to pee and he doesn't have a chance

964
00:45:50,524 --> 00:45:51,804
because the Beable to Beast stands up.

965
00:45:51,804 --> 00:45:54,705
The one right above, he's licking the Beable to Beast

966
00:45:54,705 --> 00:45:55,985
because he has cravings for salt.

967
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:58,966
The guy right above him, he's actually teething.

968
00:45:58,966 --> 00:46:01,327
So you'll see he's actually biting the eyebrows.

969
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:03,367
One's flying in front of his face.

970
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:06,148
The two on the left are trying to go for a nap,

971
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:06,728
but they can't.

972
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:09,072
One tries to bite the other guy.

973
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:10,554
And then there's one more little guy,

974
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:11,997
I don't know if you guys can see my mouse,

975
00:46:11,997 --> 00:46:14,320
but he's up above the tusk.

976
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,243
He shows up right there.

977
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:18,187
Hold on, you see him again.

978
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:18,948
Watch, watch for it.

979
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:19,669
He'll show up.

980
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:22,272
Right there, little guy up there.

981
00:46:22,272 --> 00:46:22,953
His name is Tobias.

982
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:24,334
His story is actually massive.

983
00:46:24,334 --> 00:46:27,016
And I wanted him to showcase in the whole battle

984
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:29,678
when he falls off, but I didn't have time to do that.

985
00:46:29,678 --> 00:46:32,360
But the lighters were really cool

986
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,541
because they saw the dragon, they came to say,

987
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,003
hey, you have a dragon, random dragon.

988
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,164
It's not random, dude.

989
00:46:38,164 --> 00:46:38,844
He's got a story.

990
00:46:38,844 --> 00:46:41,966
He's the reason he's back there.

991
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:42,207
What?

992
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:45,969
So they actually put some lighting there.

993
00:46:47,045 --> 00:46:49,667
so that you would see the dragon in the end because...

994
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:49,747
What?

995
00:46:49,747 --> 00:46:55,669
If not, it would be all dark and you wouldn't see him.

996
00:46:55,669 --> 00:46:58,110
So, you know, that's that's where it is having fun.

997
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,872
Make sure that that's the thing I learned is from this shot was

998
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:03,533
make sure you ask questions.

999
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:06,434
If you have too much time to do something, there is a catch somewhere.

1000
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:11,142
don't watch fucking YouTube videos, just fucking animate.

1001
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:14,964
And make sure that you have fun with whatever you do

1002
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:16,185
because you're there for a reason

1003
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:18,647
and all animators know it can get difficult

1004
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:20,468
even though it's a fun job, it's still stressful.

1005
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:23,789
That's it for me, thank you very much.

1006
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:24,030
And.

1007
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,110
And.

1008
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:24,250
And.

1009
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:24,370
And.

1010
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:24,510
And.

1011
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:24,750
And.

1012
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:24,910
And.

1013
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:24,970
And.

1014
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:25,150
And.

1015
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:33,515
And.

1016
00:47:33,515 --> 00:47:33,755
And.

1017
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:33,835
And.

1018
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:34,055
And.

1019
00:47:34,055 --> 00:47:34,175
And.

1020
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:35,927
Yeah, go ahead.

1021
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:42,930
What do you find that a limited number of animation will directly affect the design?

1022
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,811
The creature design? Oh, man...

1023
00:47:44,811 --> 00:47:45,791
Repeat the question.

1024
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:46,752
Oh, sorry, the question was...

1025
00:47:46,752 --> 00:47:48,493
Sorry, can you say the question?

1026
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:48,953
How often will...

1027
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:55,476
What do you want to do with an animation that affects the design of the creature?

1028
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:55,536
Wow.

1029
00:47:57,425 --> 00:48:00,749
How often is it that animation affects the creature design

1030
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:03,452
that we have to go back and redesign the creature?

1031
00:48:03,452 --> 00:48:04,754
Hell, that's rare.

1032
00:48:04,754 --> 00:48:06,937
It's never happened to me often.

1033
00:48:06,937 --> 00:48:09,600
Maybe it happens, maybe a character's tail,

1034
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,303
if the tail feels too big, they might,

1035
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:15,067
but it takes so long to build a character and then.

1036
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:18,390
and then rig it to get to animation,

1037
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,191
then go, okay, that design is not working.

1038
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:23,174
That's a huge flaw somewhere there.

1039
00:48:23,174 --> 00:48:25,396
And usually it's whatever they'll give us,

1040
00:48:25,396 --> 00:48:28,038
the animator's job is to find the right reference

1041
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,480
for that creature to work.

1042
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,001
If it doesn't exist, you make it up.

1043
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:33,928
But usually the other way around, I don't know,

1044
00:48:33,928 --> 00:48:36,149
anybody, any of you guys have that happen to you?

1045
00:48:36,149 --> 00:48:36,970
I don't think it happens.

1046
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,732
If not, there's a big problem in the pipeline somewhere.

1047
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:42,414
Bad design goes all the way to animation.

1048
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:45,476
But in terms of personality, yes, that does happen.

1049
00:48:45,476 --> 00:48:47,577
For example, discovering a character,

1050
00:48:47,577 --> 00:48:48,858
maybe the original idea.

1051
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:53,820
of a creature just gets altered when you get to animation.

1052
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,700
You start discovering,

1053
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,220
ah, that's what this creature will do.

1054
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,121
Maybe the designers had an idea,

1055
00:48:58,121 --> 00:49:00,001
for example, the Bewilderbeast,

1056
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:03,422
the modeler designed him to be standing in a certain way,

1057
00:49:03,422 --> 00:49:06,163
but when I animated him, I didn't make him stand that way

1058
00:49:06,163 --> 00:49:09,243
because I didn't feel it was right for him to stand that way.

1059
00:49:09,243 --> 00:49:10,864
So yeah, that does get changed,

1060
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,044
but not really the actual design.

1061
00:49:13,044 --> 00:49:14,365
Yeah, good question.

1062
00:49:15,238 --> 00:49:16,880
Last question?

1063
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,242
Can you talk, I also come from a visual effects

1064
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:21,123
and feature animation background.

1065
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:24,726
Can you talk a little bit about building cycles

1066
00:49:24,726 --> 00:49:29,109
that will transition from one to the other

1067
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:30,710
or one to any of another?

1068
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,873
That's something in visual effects or feature film

1069
00:49:33,873 --> 00:49:36,715
that you can hand animate, but you have to,

1070
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:39,777
can you talk a little bit about that?

1071
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,519
Yeah, yeah, do I have to repeat the question?

1072
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:42,660
No, it's good.

1073
00:49:44,362 --> 00:49:47,504
Okay, good, so the question, so how,

1074
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:49,145
okay, so your question was,

1075
00:49:49,145 --> 00:49:51,146
how do we do cycles in VFX as well?

1076
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:52,247
And yes, we do.

1077
00:49:52,247 --> 00:49:54,648
And we actually do that early on,

1078
00:49:54,648 --> 00:49:56,430
depending on how much time you got on a film.

1079
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:59,932
On a movie like Avatar, which took three years to make,

1080
00:49:59,932 --> 00:50:02,534
like, seven months out of that is just,

1081
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:04,155
you know, character development,

1082
00:50:04,155 --> 00:50:05,676
where you would animate cycles,

1083
00:50:05,676 --> 00:50:07,417
you would figure out how a character would,

1084
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:10,299
you know, fly, you would figure out how the Thanator

1085
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,940
would run, because he had six legs.

1086
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,921
And it was all about building these cycles

1087
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:17,962
that eventually we can reuse when we're blocking our shot.

1088
00:50:17,962 --> 00:50:19,523
Usually you use it when you're blocking your shot,

1089
00:50:19,523 --> 00:50:21,264
you can reuse some of that cycle.

1090
00:50:21,264 --> 00:50:23,325
For Crusoe, for example, and Water Horse,

1091
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:24,885
I did do a walk cycle,

1092
00:50:24,885 --> 00:50:27,046
because a lot of my shots had walking in there.

1093
00:50:27,046 --> 00:50:28,487
Instead of reanimating every time,

1094
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,228
I would do a cycle that I would reuse.

1095
00:50:31,788 --> 00:50:34,689
On Narnia, we did, we had a year and a half to do it,

1096
00:50:34,689 --> 00:50:37,390
so we had a little bit more time.

1097
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,651
But on movies like Rise of the Apes,

1098
00:50:38,651 --> 00:50:40,391
we had eight months to do that.

1099
00:50:40,391 --> 00:50:42,052
And Rise of the Planets of the Apes, sorry.

1100
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:43,992
We had eight months to do that,

1101
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:45,913
so we didn't have too much time.

1102
00:50:45,913 --> 00:50:47,654
We did some personality tests,

1103
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:50,775
but we didn't have time to actually do a lot of cycles.

1104
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:51,615
In games, we do that every day,

1105
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:54,736
so yes, you do that when you have time

1106
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:57,537
in VFX and feature animation, but not so much.

1107
00:50:58,018 --> 00:51:00,400
all the time just because of, it all depends on time,

1108
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,361
how much time you've got.

1109
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:03,284
Hopefully I answered your question.

1110
00:51:03,284 --> 00:51:04,125
Thanks a lot guys.
