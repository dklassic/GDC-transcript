00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:10,273
Hello, this is Marcin Przybyłowicz, music director at CD Projekt Red.

2
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:13,194
And I'm Piti Adamczyk, senior composer at CD Projekt Red.

3
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:17,335
And this is Immersing with Music, Approaches to Musical Storytelling in Cyberpunk 2077.

4
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:24,537
We have to do this one virtually, but hopefully next year we're going to hang out with you guys.

5
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:25,937
Now let's jump into our presentation.

6
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:33,499
So, first of all, spoiler alert. And now, without further ado, let's jump right into it.

7
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:38,896
So as we speak to a group of audio professionals and game developers,

8
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:42,698
you are all probably familiar with the term immersion.

9
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:45,699
For those who are not, immersion, according to the Cambridge Dictionary,

10
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:48,960
is the fact of being completely lost in something.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,701
Now, you know, why would we even want to have that?

12
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,020
In our book, immersion is engagement, and engagement is fun.

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,501
It makes combat more exciting if the player cares

14
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:00,841
about the character.

15
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:04,222
It makes story more intriguing if the choices

16
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:06,683
and consequences that the player makes

17
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:07,983
resemble some sort of reality.

18
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:11,104
And it makes exploration more intriguing

19
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,205
if the player's curiosity is fed back

20
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:15,385
by the design of the world.

21
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:18,446
And this concept is not a new concept.

22
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:23,108
It has been known since Aristotle, through Shakespeare and Tolkien,

23
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:26,370
that in order to truly appreciate a work of art,

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,832
you have to either suspense disbelief

25
00:01:29,832 --> 00:01:36,495
or create secondary belief in the presented reality.

26
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:40,917
Now, how we try to immerse players in Night City.

27
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:45,632
In Cyberpunk, we were dealing with four different types of music.

28
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:49,213
We had original score, we had source cues and diegetic music,

29
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:54,254
we had radio tracks, and media music.

30
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:58,315
Now we would like to talk about each of those groups,

31
00:01:58,315 --> 00:01:59,915
how they all fit together,

32
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:02,516
and what challenges and possibilities they presented.

33
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:05,737
I give the floor to Marcin.

34
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:08,637
So, first of all, how Cyberpunk sounds.

35
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:11,078
The most important question we had to ask ourselves.

36
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:23,192
There are already several examples of what people have been considering as cyberpunk sound for years in movies, video games and music in general.

37
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:32,899
We knew we wanted to find our own recipe, to have our own take on how cyberpunk music can sound.

38
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:37,182
Also, the IP itself pushed us to explore new territories.

39
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:41,831
Our game is an adaptation of pen and paper cyberpunk 2020 after all,

40
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:46,078
and it draws heavily from the world Mike Pondsmith has created.

41
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:50,346
Night City is a fast, overstimulated and dangerous place.

42
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,545
Also, the story.

43
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:55,226
It's not a one-dimensional journey

44
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:58,528
focusing only on metaphysical elements

45
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:00,309
or any other for that matter.

46
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:02,710
It touches on several tropes of the genre,

47
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,652
so it's obvious music needs to answer that call

48
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,373
and fit the world, narrative arc,

49
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:09,814
character development, and so on.

50
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,595
Okay, so what to do?

51
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:14,977
Our way out was pretty simple.

52
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,778
Let's ditch the 80s and go with 90s instead.

53
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:23,229
For us, that 80s sound people are so familiar with

54
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,370
didn't have what it takes to illustrate brutality

55
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,250
and intransigence of Night City.

56
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,151
90s, on the other hand, that's a completely different story

57
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:34,132
from our own perspective.

58
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:36,552
We grew up listening to Nine Inch Nails,

59
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:39,533
Race Against the Machine, The Prodigy, Beastie Boys,

60
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,333
and so on.

61
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,814
Bands representing different musical styles,

62
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:45,274
but having that attitude in common.

63
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,922
Okay, custom scoring and implementation of quest music.

64
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:52,164
That was a huge part of our approach

65
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:53,805
to scoring Cyberpunk 2077.

66
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:56,627
You know, since Witcher 3, we're aware

67
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:00,310
that system-driven music or generative music

68
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,672
is not really our forte.

69
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:05,154
Witcher 3 was notorious for having the music on

70
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:07,837
all the time, and this time we wanted

71
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:09,038
to try a different approach

72
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:11,320
and maybe introduce silence into the mix.

73
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,634
Also, there's a lot of attention given to story and cinematic storytelling at CDPR.

74
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:25,700
So we wanted our score to feel bespoke, to score the many different possibilities, many

75
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,782
different play-throughs of each quest.

76
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:36,788
And we wanted to feel that our score supports V throughout her journey.

77
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:40,311
Also, minimal amount of typical cutscenes.

78
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:47,234
was a design feature that at first we didn't feel like we have to change our approach that much.

79
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:51,258
But once you give the control of the camera to the player,

80
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,922
and for example you can't see the protagonist's face,

81
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,064
a lot of things change.

82
00:04:56,064 --> 00:05:01,590
Especially mood-wise and pacing-wise, music had to support scenes even more.

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,941
So the conclusion for us was simple.

84
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,002
We have to spot and score every main quest

85
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:13,484
and every side quest with custom assets.

86
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:16,345
And that was a huge undertaking

87
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:20,166
for a game the size of Cyberpunk,

88
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,647
but having two in-house composers capable

89
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:26,089
of producing assets and implementing them,

90
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,270
and having Paul Leonard Morgan as our outsource composer,

91
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,151
it felt doable.

92
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:34,459
And in exchange, we got a lot of control

93
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,660
over the playback of the cues.

94
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,244
And our unwritten motto became, if a player

95
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:42,905
hears a piece of music in the game,

96
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:46,168
it was hand placed there for a reason.

97
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:48,649
And whether it's score or cutscene,

98
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:53,553
or whether it's score or source cues, or diegetic music,

99
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,714
or radio tracks, whatever, we wanted

100
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:58,977
to make sure that the cue that's audible for the player

101
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:00,618
is the one that we intended it to be.

102
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:07,715
We started the gargantuan task by spotting the whole game.

103
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:10,196
And here you can see a bird's eye view

104
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:11,797
on our spotting document.

105
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:15,718
We would get videos from QAs,

106
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:18,159
and based on those videos,

107
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,900
we would prepare the first set of assets.

108
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,641
Then we would implement them, playtest them,

109
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:28,543
and if we maybe missed something or the design changed,

110
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,584
we would then reiterate on those assets.

111
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:34,184
And the list you saw, it could be more detailed,

112
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:38,427
but each of the line actually represents

113
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:39,908
like a whole family of cues

114
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:42,689
rather than just one piece of music.

115
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:46,391
And to further illustrate how we divided those scenes,

116
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:48,913
I would like to play you two examples.

117
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:54,636
This one is the scene where the relationship

118
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:57,298
between Johnny Silverhand and Vegas established.

119
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:01,867
This is sort of their first of many quarrels,

120
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:06,772
and I would like to play you this one

121
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:08,874
to show you our approach to narrative scenes.

122
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:09,395
Need a smoke.

123
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,156
Where'd you stash yours?

124
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:19,345
So this scene starts with a fairly soft, moody, dark drone,

125
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:21,047
and it's played on a loop.

126
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,047
Where did you even come from?

127
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,448
How are we even talking?

128
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:32,328
How the fuck should I know?

129
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,009
Now we introduce a one-shot cue.

130
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:36,229
The fuck kind of droid toy are you supposed to be?

131
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,070
That's playing Johnny Silverhand's theme

132
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,331
in a very transgressive, weird way.

133
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,331
Who you work for?

134
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,251
Start talking.

135
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:44,812
Fuck.

136
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:53,674
And because of the design of the scene,

137
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:56,780
This cue has a very long tail.

138
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:05,168
And when we cut to black,

139
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,670
we actually play one more cue on top

140
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,373
of the already playing one on a different stance.

141
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:17,739
The reason behind it is we wanted to time

142
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:21,443
the end of this cue with the cut to black.

143
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,058
I'll take control.

144
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:30,720
I'll find a way.

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,100
You hear me?

146
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:40,124
Now we play another cue, which is again a fairly soft drone.

147
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:44,086
It's to kind of keep the tension up.

148
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:48,588
But also try to sell the idea that the scene is over, but it's actually not.

149
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:50,549
Here we start another loop.

150
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:53,190
See you never, asshole.

151
00:08:54,793 --> 00:09:09,318
And that loop will play till the end of the scene.

152
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:36,320
Another scene I would like to play you is from one of the Nomad quests,

153
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,945
and here V is becoming one of the Aldecaldos.

154
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:44,347
And a similar approach was taken.

155
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:48,430
We divided the scenes into many different segments,

156
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,813
and whenever a player is in control of the action,

157
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:54,475
we basically loop the piece of music.

158
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:58,238
And when there is a more scripted segment...

159
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:03,765
the approach is more free.

160
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:13,928
So the first cue starts when V gets on the truck.

161
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:28,013
And the music that is playing is a version of Pan Am's theme.

162
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:31,487
which means this family will go to hell and back.

163
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:33,989
Now this kid is actually a one-shot kid.

164
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:34,949
Do your worst.

165
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:37,230
And if you take your time answering Sol,

166
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,231
you're an Aldecaldo, Kevin.

167
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,672
It will actually fade to silence.

168
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,212
Great to have you with us, V.

169
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:43,293
Which may seem weird,

170
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:46,035
but it actually adds a pretty cool tension to the scene.

171
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:47,396
Welcome to the family.

172
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,977
But now we reintroduce Panem's theme here.

173
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:50,957
That's what they say.

174
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:55,300
Easier to gain a cobra's trust than an Aldecaldo's.

175
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,610
So I know how much this means.

176
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,571
Do you, to me, think...

177
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:08,912
And now we play a segment that's also looped.

178
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:12,673
And actually this segment comes off one of the tracks

179
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,613
that a Nomad guitar player was playing in some other quest.

180
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:18,254
...as Bobby tells it, and I won't even mention Pan Am.

181
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:18,754
Go to hell.

182
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:21,994
Saul's right, though.

183
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:25,835
I mean, let's face it, V, my life was in a million pieces.

184
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:26,555
You broke it into him, though.

185
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:34,661
But sometimes it's only then that you can piece it together again.

186
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:39,467
Now the sound effects here are actually done by our sound department.

187
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:45,213
And they are sort of underscoring the fact that this disease is developing.

188
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,255
It's, you know, it's almost...

189
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,841
Like, V is dying.

190
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,922
When she gets down from the truck,

191
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:53,262
we introduce a subtle drone

192
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:57,224
to also support the fact that, you know,

193
00:11:57,224 --> 00:12:01,385
her disease is developing.

194
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:11,256
And here once again we reintroduce Panem's theme, this time in a very subtle way, to

195
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:18,201
help support the dialogue and help this scene and the description of the scene sell the

196
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:23,085
idea that Panem and V are now very close friends.

197
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:31,148
Themes were the glue we used to illustrate narrative arc.

198
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:34,852
Our goal was to take the advantage of the first-person perspective

199
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:39,335
and find the way it immerses players into the storyline.

200
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:46,382
Even in the early stages of development, the game, even with no music whatsoever, felt already very cinematic.

201
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:50,666
After a few months of experiments, we've ended up with a number of themes.

202
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:58,033
Short, flexible motifs that can be easily adapted to narrative arc and serve their purpose in a number of ways.

203
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:05,079
Also, their short duration nicely corresponded with the genre choices we've made regarding overall musical direction.

204
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,455
We've ended up with two main themes and a few secondary themes.

205
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:14,998
V and Johnny's themes, our main motifs.

206
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:19,642
And several secondary themes, illustrating Arasaka, obviously,

207
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:24,225
but also transgression theme, which is a big part of the storyline, death,

208
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:28,529
and a number of smaller themes or riffs or patterns

209
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,471
tied to specific locations, gangs, and so on.

210
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:39,281
I'd like to present now an example of how we've been using our themes throughout the whole game.

211
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:45,929
We're gonna listen to V's theme and a few of its variations from various parts of the storyline.

212
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:08,697
That's a main menu cue.

213
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:11,339
First thing players hear when they launch the game.

214
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,341
So the music doesn't waste much time

215
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:18,264
and within two and a half minutes of duration,

216
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:21,647
the music presents the general vibe, emotional palette

217
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:24,088
and some punch in B part we are listening to right now.

218
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:30,073
This cue plays when Johnny manifests his presence

219
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:30,793
for the first time.

220
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:39,860
V, it's important you get all this.

221
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,642
You'll fix me up, right? Vic?

222
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:47,124
If I could, I would, V. Believe me.

223
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:51,827
But this is... it's way beyond what I know how to do.

224
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:56,591
You're the best of the best, Vic. Why can't you help me?

225
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:28,085
This one plays during Tapeworm quest, which is stretched over the length of several other quests.

226
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,275
Not having control.

227
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:36,836
You can't stand it.

228
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:40,397
Seeing some things are out of your hands.

229
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,578
Don't be ridiculous, V.

230
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:43,959
Cyberspace, near end of the game,

231
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,620
where the player has to decide

232
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,341
who's gonna take control over V's body, V or Johnny.

233
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:51,442
On V's behalf, thanks.

234
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:55,744
As for V, I'm sorry.

235
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,379
And finally, one of the endings.

236
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,747
Back to you, PT.

237
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:54,809
Open world music using a wider brush.

238
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,690
So we scored all quests, all side quests,

239
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,431
and we were ready to congratulate each other

240
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:03,472
and high five because we delivered all quests way

241
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:05,072
before the deadline.

242
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:06,833
And then we got feedback from one

243
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,234
of our designers who spent most of their time

244
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:15,496
in the open world asking us why there's

245
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:18,537
no music in the game.

246
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,954
Well, it turned out we were so focused on scoring quests and V-Story,

247
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:30,777
that we kind of underestimated the amount of gameplay we need to cover with our score.

248
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:37,861
We initially thought that street noise, that, you know, media music and radio tracks

249
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:43,925
will create enough of audio distraction that exploration music would be superfluous.

250
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:50,875
Also one more comment that we got was that combat felt underwhelming.

251
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:56,379
Compared to scripted quest events, not having music and combat encounters in the open world

252
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:57,199
kind of feel lame.

253
00:17:57,199 --> 00:18:05,825
And we tried a few different things like placing radio emitters with source music next to possible

254
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:10,568
combat encounters, but it all just didn't feel right.

255
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:10,648
So...

256
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:18,616
Our solution to that was produce even more assets.

257
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:20,457
And we had to be smart about it.

258
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:25,340
We didn't have the time to basically write everything

259
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,840
from scratch.

260
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,442
And that would be impossible.

261
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,802
That wouldn't be practical.

262
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:35,585
But we also didn't want open world content

263
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:37,166
to feel less polished than.

264
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:40,911
quest events or side quests.

265
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:45,054
So we once again went back to our spotting document

266
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:48,677
and we diligently went through all minor quests

267
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,839
and all street stories and we identified their needs.

268
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,082
For more narrative moments or dialogues,

269
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,104
we music edited already existing cues,

270
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,046
especially the ones that didn't have

271
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,288
one of the already established themes.

272
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:09,084
And here, once again, you can check the bird's-eye view on our spotting document.

273
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:17,707
This is all the mine requests, and this is all the street stories.

274
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:25,409
So, for each of the in-game factions, we had to produce a specific combat music group.

275
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:26,530
We called them combos.

276
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,752
And every single faction got one combo.

277
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:37,493
Some of them were already produced for quests or side quests,

278
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:44,017
but ones like Valentino's or Sixth Street had to be written from scratch.

279
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:49,040
Each set consisted of stealth, alerted, and combat state.

280
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,163
It was mostly driven by AI, but it was also frequently triggered from quests.

281
00:19:55,163 --> 00:20:00,166
For example, when a combat started, when an alarm goes off,

282
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,448
it would be weird to start with stealth, so we would start with alerted then.

283
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:08,583
And we tried adding more states to combat,

284
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,369
but again, it kind of got in the way of the groove

285
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:12,431
and just didn't seem right.

286
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:21,980
And as you can see, we kind of prefer horizontal interactivity over vertical one.

287
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,942
There's various reasons for that, but I think the main one is the type of music we're producing

288
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:32,844
doesn't really work well with vertical interactivity, because what you would

289
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:38,406
really want to have is a track that's compressed, that's well produced and put together,

290
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:41,548
because then you really get the kind of energy we're looking for.

291
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:56,362
Now I'd like to play you an example of the combo for Valentinos.

292
00:20:56,362 --> 00:21:03,447
So we start with combat.

293
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:05,509
We go to stealth for a brief moment.

294
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:44,757
This is what alerted sounded like.

295
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:44,349
Back to combat.

296
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:49,179
So we had combat encounters covered,

297
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,983
but there was still a question of what we're going to do

298
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,886
with exploration ambiences.

299
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:59,267
So again, we had to be smart about it and cover a lot of gameplay.

300
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:05,348
So the technique we used, we decided to take stems from already existing cues,

301
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,749
record them back to cassette tapes at half speed,

302
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:12,009
and then play them back through a 4-track cassette recorder

303
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:19,651
with delay and reverb, tweaking some EQs and playing even more with the varispeed control.

304
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:23,532
and recorded them as stereo tracks into the DAW,

305
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:26,872
and did very little post-processing after that.

306
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:32,234
And that technique felt right for the world.

307
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,894
It also felt right for the fact that we

308
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:37,475
were trying to evoke the 90s as much as possible,

309
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:42,296
so that tape hiss added an extra level of 90s into the project.

310
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,036
And also, thanks to that technique,

311
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:48,877
we were able to produce a lot of assets, over one hour of assets.

312
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:49,497
Yeah.

313
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:58,169
in one day. So it was a great technique and also those ambiences weren't that

314
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:01,611
interactive. They were basically just kind of playing in the background. So it

315
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:06,175
all seemed to work and I'd like to play you an example of what it sounded like.

316
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:29,873
And the way all those types of music fitted together is we had a fairly simple yet powerful bussing system created and...

317
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:36,332
The quest music was the most important music, so it would basically block any other music that was trying to play.

318
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:48,200
Then, the next level of importance was combat music, which would mute car radio or radio that was pumped through speakers on the level.

319
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,104
And in those two, car radio was more important for us, so it would mute all the radio emitters.

320
00:24:55,028 --> 00:25:00,935
And the ambiences were the very bottom of this chart right here.

321
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:08,303
And it was basically played only outdoors and only if there was no other music playing around the player.

322
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,622
So all those things combined as exploration ambiences,

323
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:17,484
the reuse and music editing of existing cues

324
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:21,106
and combat music design was a compromise

325
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:24,949
between our handcrafted approach and a more systemic one.

326
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,730
So source music or diegetic music

327
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,672
played an important role in Cyberpunk.

328
00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:32,755
It was not only treated as some kind of audio fluff,

329
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:35,496
but we tried to use it narratively.

330
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:40,605
And what it gave us is that it broader our stylistic net

331
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,546
or emotional net.

332
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:45,788
And also one more thing that it created

333
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:48,870
an interesting musical fourth wall breaker,

334
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,471
which I'll talk about in a minute.

335
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:54,634
This scene is a pretty important scene.

336
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:59,858
This happens right after Jackie dies in the prologue,

337
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,380
and you're trying to honor him during an ofrenda.

338
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,880
And...

339
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:12,506
We could have scored this scene maybe with V's theme or the cue that we used when Jackie actually died,

340
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:19,350
but we decided to go with Source Cue and basically score this scene with that score screen.

341
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,891
It's just me playing the guitar.

342
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:26,954
And you could see that it makes the scene special.

343
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:32,597
It's not, you know, yet another scene when you have some synthy drone playing around.

344
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:41,138
It actually creates an interesting lore building, because we don't really say what this track is.

345
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:43,639
Maybe this track is Jackie's favorite tune.

346
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:52,383
So there's actually also a bit of exploring to be done on the player's side here.

347
00:26:52,964 --> 00:26:56,946
Okay, on occasion, source music was actually played in 2D

348
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:58,367
from the same sort of virtual emitter

349
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,228
that the score is played through.

350
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:02,969
And once again, it added variety,

351
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:07,291
it prevented us from using the same cues too many times.

352
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:10,913
And most importantly, in this particular moment,

353
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:13,814
it's actually cued by one of our made up bands,

354
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:16,035
Tainted Overlord, so it kind of fits well

355
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:19,817
with the Nomad vibe and with the overall lore of the world.

356
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:25,161
And this cue happens right after you rescue Sol in one of the side quests.

357
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:32,367
So we found that breaking the musical fourth wall added variety and extra level of immersion,

358
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:37,832
but it worked intriguingly well when those both worlds, the diegetic and non-diegetic,

359
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:40,394
were actually played together at the same time.

360
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:48,661
This is an example of how we did that in one of the early quests in the prologue.

361
00:27:49,729 --> 00:28:00,491
If you choose to take the Corpo path, you end up in Liz's bar, and once you get into Liz's bar,

362
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:03,252
there's a Source team playing, which is actually created by GazelleTwin for us.

363
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:13,594
And once the Arasaka guys come to V, we introduce the drone that's played as part of the score,

364
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:18,555
while we keep the GazelleTwin track playing in the background.

365
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:27,620
Now there's a subtle but audible filter on the Source Cube.

366
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,942
And we're all in score now.

367
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:37,467
And as the scene ends, we actually go back to a different Source Cube.

368
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,526
And here's an example also from the prologue,

369
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:52,448
when you're infiltrating a scavenger's base.

370
00:28:52,448 --> 00:28:54,829
And here we have the scavenger combo,

371
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:58,111
and on top of that we have,

372
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,812
with the same tempo, same cue signature,

373
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:04,313
playing a variation of the scavenger's theme

374
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,054
in a very hardcore rave sort of vibe.

375
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:26,285
But the biggest fourfold breaker was this guy right here,

376
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:27,286
Johnny Silverhand.

377
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:33,891
We wanted to introduce Johnny's theme,

378
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:36,473
and first of all, we wanted Johnny to have a theme

379
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:38,074
because he was such a prominent character.

380
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:41,016
And we also wanted to introduce that theme

381
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:42,598
as one of the Samurai songs.

382
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:46,140
But we didn't want this to be introduced in Chippin' In

383
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,121
or Never Fade Away.

384
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:50,203
No, we wanted it to be like a cool B-side, you know?

385
00:29:53,317 --> 00:29:57,861
So we had to create a theme or a motif that was simple,

386
00:29:57,861 --> 00:29:59,402
that could work in many different contexts,

387
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:04,807
and mostly because it had to work both as a samurai song

388
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:07,649
and also as part of our score.

389
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:11,232
And the added difficulty was that at the time of writing,

390
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:13,874
you know, the story was actually still in development.

391
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:16,236
Although we knew who Johnny Silverhand is,

392
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:16,977
and we knew...

393
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,781
you know, how this story will go.

394
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:22,245
The specifics that would be required

395
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:24,907
to create a bespoke asset, sort of the assets

396
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,929
I showed you during the custom scoring bit,

397
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:29,712
that was another difficulty.

398
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:37,487
So here you can see the very simple rendition of the theme.

399
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:40,728
This is basically how this motif looks like.

400
00:30:40,728 --> 00:30:42,148
I mean, it looks nothing on the page,

401
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:44,930
but it was actually surprisingly flexible.

402
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,631
It could score a whole bunch of different scenes.

403
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:07,663
So this is the first time the theme is introduced.

404
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:11,147
Johnny is basically once again going to kick Arasaka's ass.

405
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:17,914
We also used it in an emotional context

406
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:19,736
when Johnny is talking to Alt.

407
00:32:03,627 --> 00:32:05,709
and it was also part of our combat queues.

408
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:42,823
Now, we had to drop it from A, because A was the key that most of our score was written in.

409
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:47,406
We had to drop it to D to really make use of that drop D tuning that Refused is playing in.

410
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:52,390
And so the whole riff and the whole motif is now in D.

411
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:57,134
And it became a part of one of the Samurai songs, the ballad.

412
00:32:57,134 --> 00:33:03,419
And I'm going to play you a fragment that's actually the very beginning of the track.

413
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:36,829
And also there's a development section when the riff in the way I just played you is actually

414
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:41,031
countered with again the same riff but played in a slightly different rhythm.

415
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,275
But I was once a teaser man

416
00:33:58,275 --> 00:34:00,378
Promises I was made

417
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:02,361
Were made to keep me asleep

418
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:05,125
Come on now, I'm kept on a wage

419
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,090
I've come the worst of my rage

420
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,191
One day the...

421
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:52,262
So it wasn't the only theme that we actually used in our score.

422
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:57,163
Other Johnny Silverhand songs like Chippin' In or Never Fade Away were also

423
00:34:57,163 --> 00:35:03,024
modulated and reimagined as cues in our score.

424
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:04,325
For instance, this is Chippin' In.

425
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:37,691
And this is a rave version of Chippin' In. ♪♪

426
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:47,013
And also Never Fade Away got a similar treatment. ♪♪

427
00:35:56,268 --> 00:36:06,875
It was used in this way as the ending cue in a lot of the Corpo quests or the epilogue quests for Johnny.

428
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,171
Radio playlists are a big part of Source Music too.

429
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:41,473
They play primarily in cars and other vehicles as well as in a number of clubs, but also

430
00:36:41,473 --> 00:36:47,335
everywhere else where we felt adding some extra musical layer would improve the scene

431
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:48,435
or the location.

432
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:53,337
The main idea behind them was to come up with a variety of genres

433
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:56,499
citizens of Night City would listen to.

434
00:36:56,499 --> 00:37:01,401
It's a tiny but still important role music has to contribute

435
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:03,102
into the world building process.

436
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:09,104
Teenagers, after all, would listen to different music than maelstromers,

437
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,905
hence the presence of pop.

438
00:37:10,905 --> 00:37:13,906
Jazz in 2077 is considered as new classical music

439
00:37:13,906 --> 00:37:17,008
and it's listened to the cultural elite.

440
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:21,611
Snobs, Corpos and other people.

441
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:26,675
So, how do you populate 11 playlists with enough songs?

442
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:31,799
We've commissioned over 150 original or unreleased tracks,

443
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:35,802
plus we've licensed several jazz pieces recorded in 1970s

444
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:38,925
by Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Chet Baker and other jazz icons.

445
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:43,869
Why not going with licensed song in general though, for the whole thing?

446
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:51,541
First of all, our game director, Adam Badowski, didn't want to create any unnecessary connections

447
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:55,704
between the real world, our world, and the reality of Cyberpunk 2077.

448
00:37:55,704 --> 00:38:02,129
To a degree, he once said to me, it wouldn't make sense to listen to The Prodigy in 2077.

449
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:04,571
They would be so old, after all.

450
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:08,914
Second reason is the license eventually expires,

451
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,916
which forces the developers to issue an update to the game,

452
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,458
which removes expired tracks.

453
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,360
We really wanted to make sure playing our game,

454
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,762
even a few years after the release,

455
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:21,383
will deliver the same experience

456
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,245
and the music will remain unchanged.

457
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:28,457
We've invited dozens of artists to contribute to the soundtrack.

458
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:32,904
And to make sure we do not break the immersion of having

459
00:38:32,904 --> 00:38:36,470
2020s artists existing in dystopian futuristic world.

460
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,854
Everyone get their own alter ego.

461
00:38:40,576 --> 00:38:45,461
Lots of bands appear in quests, not only Samurai, but also Kerry Eurodyne,

462
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:50,745
AskRax, pictured here with V and Kerry, Lizzy Weezy and others.

463
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:57,371
We took great care to make sure every quest a particular band or artist may be a part of

464
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:01,435
is suited with the fitting tracks by this artist, not only from the

465
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:04,498
world-building perspective, but also from a musical point of view.

466
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:10,102
Retrospective parts of Johnny Silverhand's past as a rogue legend slash terrorist,

467
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:15,166
Kerry's storyline about his beef with us cracks are just a few examples of that approach.

468
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:23,681
Of course, since it's an RPG game, V can differently interact with all these musicians,

469
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:25,802
which results in different outcomes.

470
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:29,825
So, for example, Kerry finds out there's this band that stole his song.

471
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,426
He wants V to take care of the problem.

472
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:37,029
It's up to the player, though, to decide how this should be played out.

473
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:41,732
In the result, it may happen V manages to end the beef between Kerry and us tracks,

474
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:44,294
and have them work together on a new track together.

475
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:45,875
The track we obviously would produce.

476
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:52,468
Okay, so what we've learned throughout the process of scoring Cyberpunk.

477
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:55,851
So first of all, repetition, repetition, repetition.

478
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:00,975
In order for teams to work and for players to be able to identify

479
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:05,719
which motif belongs to which character, you have to repeat them a lot.

480
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,481
But you can't do it haphazardly.

481
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:10,724
You can't put these themes in every single combat queue.

482
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:13,826
You have to pick your spots and then go with it.

483
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:19,549
Also, spotting was key, and identifying the needs of the game.

484
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:25,454
In order to, you know, try to create the illusion of having a very linear story, we basically

485
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:28,457
had to custom score and implement everything.

486
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:33,080
So identifying what you need and what the player is going to hear from scene to scene

487
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,301
was absolutely essential.

488
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:38,729
Also, performance and interpretation.

489
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:42,951
In order for the music to come off the page

490
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:46,353
and actually create an emotional response,

491
00:40:46,353 --> 00:40:48,674
you have to either take your time

492
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:51,296
or give the right instructions to the players.

493
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:53,957
And it doesn't matter whether you're using instruments

494
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:58,760
or synthesizers, performance and interpretation

495
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,621
of the material is absolutely key.

496
00:41:00,621 --> 00:41:04,243
Also, context creates emotions.

497
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:06,886
you know, don't try to put a hat on a hat.

498
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:10,871
Sometimes you just have to let the already established

499
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,954
relationships between the characters

500
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:14,837
kind of speak for themselves.

501
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:18,181
And not every scene needs a terribly emotional music.

502
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:20,365
Sometimes you just want these things

503
00:41:20,365 --> 00:41:22,227
to be gently pushed along.

504
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,403
On a more production-related side,

505
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,784
in-house music theme is a pretty cool thing to have.

506
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:31,945
We can make a lot of music, a lot of assets quickly,

507
00:41:31,945 --> 00:41:35,606
implement them, and kind of take ownership of our work.

508
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:38,647
And it doesn't matter if it's score or custom source music.

509
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:40,808
It's a good thing to have.

510
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:45,970
Also, we still stack at systems and generative music,

511
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,450
but you try to make up for it by producing

512
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,391
a lot of bespoke assets.

513
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:52,432
And we think we're getting better at it.

514
00:41:53,603 --> 00:42:01,491
One more thing to add is that features like the dynamic 2D, 3D switch or other things

515
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:03,773
that we talked about shouldn't be gimmicks.

516
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:10,881
I mean they should be used just in the right spot to be as effective as possible.

517
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:16,280
And on a final note, be bold and don't be afraid of using music.

518
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,942
Don't mix your music too low.

519
00:42:19,942 --> 00:42:21,904
It can be a great asset.

520
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:25,847
It can enhance immersion and essentially, and hopefully,

521
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:27,188
make the game better.

522
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:30,050
So this is our presentation.

523
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,611
Thank you for being with us.

524
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:33,833
We hope you've enjoyed it.

525
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,294
And hopefully, see you next year.

526
00:42:35,294 --> 00:42:37,396
And if you want to message us, you can reach us out

527
