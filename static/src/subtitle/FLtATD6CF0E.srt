1
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:09,873
Excellent. Well, thank you all for coming. I think I was supposed to remind you to sort of

2
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:14,858
turn off your mobile phones and possibly at the end like fill out your speaker evaluation

3
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:19,863
forms. I might wait and see how things go before I tell you to do that. All right.

4
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:21,165
Excellent. Good. Okay.

5
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:23,446
So it's great to see all of you here.

6
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:27,088
So my talk is actually meant to be complimentary

7
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:29,489
to CJ's talk, The Lives of Others,

8
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,811
which is tomorrow at 1.20 p.m. in room 3016 West Hall.

9
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:35,332
So go see that as well.

10
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:36,152
I mean, you're already here,

11
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,333
so I don't need to tell you to come to mine.

12
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,994
If this is a topic that interests you,

13
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:40,915
it's gonna be a really great talk.

14
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:44,816
So CJ will be telling you all about how to use NPCs to increase player empathy,

15
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:50,558
whereas I'm going to spend the next 20 or so minutes trying to convince you to limit, hurt,

16
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,879
stymie, and stifle your protagonist to give your NPCs room to breathe.

17
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,120
So actually, my talk title is a complete lie.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,461
We're going to do the opposite of forgetting protagonists.

19
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,622
We're actually going to, I'm actually going to try and convince you to make them pay

20
00:01:05,622 --> 00:01:08,203
because they've had it their way for too long.

21
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:10,324
And many times at the expense of other characters.

22
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:14,627
So it might seem a little bit strange that I'm up here talking about writing NPCs with

23
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:19,390
agency when the game that I wrote that you're probably most familiar with is Inkwell Studios'

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,334
80 Days, which is a massively branching, anti-colonial, steampunk, chooser-in-adventure story based

25
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:27,636
on Jules Verne's adventure novel around the world in 80 Days.

26
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:33,857
which is kind of fundamentally around two whitish Europeans going around the world on a silly bet,

27
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:39,078
encountering people, cultures and politics in fleeting glimpses. So the setup of our story,

28
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:45,960
of Vern's story really, and the mechanics really almost lend itself to shallow characterization

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,761
and the playing out of protagonist power fantasies. It would have been very easy for

30
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:55,182
us to make a game which just retold the last samurai over and over.

31
00:01:56,023 --> 00:02:01,474
Just a chewed over story of a white dude coming into a native culture and just saving the day, but

32
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:04,279
This is exactly the story that we don't want to tell

33
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,757
So we developed strategies to give our NPCs life, agency,

34
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:12,419
integrity, and to balance that with the demands

35
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:14,740
of telling this particular kind of story.

36
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,421
And today I'm gonna try and share with you

37
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:19,083
some of our design thinking and our strategies with you

38
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,844
in the hope that you find it useful.

39
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:23,525
Basically, if we could make a game full of engaging

40
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,206
and diverse NPCs with agency,

41
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:27,468
given the original novel could have been easily adapted

42
00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:29,689
to be a tourism simulator,

43
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,170
you can probably do the same

44
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,771
with whatever limitations you're working with,

45
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,831
or at least that's the idea.

46
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:39,918
So we have, I think personally, spent too much time fridging girlfriends and little brothers

47
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:44,624
because we're afraid of hurting protagonists. We only kind of dare hurt them by proxy.

48
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,908
We think players will be turned off by experiencing a protagonist's loss,

49
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:52,694
or confusion, or stupidity, or failure. Who wants to play a loser?

50
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:56,722
But that's something that seems true, but actually I don't think it is.

51
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:59,724
In fact, I think it's winning all the time that seems fake.

52
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:03,368
True immersiveness necessitates loss, failure, pain, and frustration.

53
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:08,732
Um, because do you remember that bit in The Matrix when Agent Smith tells Neo about

54
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:12,375
the very first Matrix that's, you know, incredibly perfect, this world

55
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,057
without suffering where everyone was happy?

56
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:21,703
It's one of my favorite bits in the film because obviously a simulation of perfection is bound to fail. Everyone rejected it.

57
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,145
They lost entire crops, I think is the line.

58
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:29,669
So the thing is the simulation of perfection is bound to fail and we're obviously going to keep trying to wake up from it.

59
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:34,352
But it also fails because I think immersion is social. We want to play with other people.

60
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:38,936
We want to engage with people who feel real and and real people demand things of us.

61
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:42,819
Being the specialist snowflake is a lonely fantasy.

62
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:46,502
There is a reason that the Truman Show,

63
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,724
I'm dating myself with these references, aren't I?

64
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:48,924
Damn.

65
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,586
There is a reason that the Truman Show

66
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:54,088
is about a guy realizing that his surroundings

67
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:56,070
and relationships aren't real,

68
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,432
and trying to escape rather than to jack further in.

69
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,014
Everything in the Truman Show is all about Truman,

70
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,816
but eventually that starts to feel shallow and unsatisfying.

71
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:11,101
He doesn't want the simple, transactional, easy relationship with his actor wife, Laura Linney.

72
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:15,724
He wants the thrill and unexpectedness and the risk of Natasha McElhone.

73
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:16,825
And of course he does.

74
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:22,309
So why do games keep trying to give players Laura Linneys with perfect hair and saccharine smiles,

75
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:27,072
when what we clearly want is Natasha McElhone and her crappy apartment and her deflating blowout?

76
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:30,875
Truman deserves someone real and messy, and so do we.

77
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:38,299
But the thing is, games protagonists aren't Truman who wants to wake up from their self-absorbed dream.

78
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:40,940
They're Gregory House from season one of House.

79
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,743
They're the obnoxious jerk who gets away with their behavior because they can somehow solve all the problems.

80
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,144
Basically the fictional equivalent of that one rude guest at the dinner party that never shuts up.

81
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,346
The thing is, everything orbits around House.

82
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:58,227
Everyone else is swallowed up in the supernova of his ego

83
00:04:58,227 --> 00:05:00,308
and the totality of his brilliance.

84
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:01,549
And it's a great TV show,

85
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:03,409
but what if all TV shows were like that?

86
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:04,090
Oh, crap.

87
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:10,773
Sorry, Asshole Genius is clearly a popular fantasy.

88
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:19,246
But jokes aside, when it comes to television, it's so easy to understand how limiting it would be

89
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:24,048
to the kinds of stories that we could tell, to the kinds of characters and ideas and themes that we could explore

90
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:27,790
if every TV protagonist, literally everyone, was like House.

91
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,212
And if House was our only model for what a TV protagonist was.

92
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,734
So the thing is, if we see how limiting it is with TV,

93
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,376
then surely it's as limiting with games.

94
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:40,277
And we have to stop letting games protagonists

95
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:41,617
get away with this.

96
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:43,719
This kind of structural centrality,

97
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,319
these assumptions about what it means

98
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,181
to be a games protagonist and have agency

99
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,062
can lead us to unwittingly reinforce

100
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,203
unhelpful cultural and social norms

101
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:54,925
to keep making the same game protagonist

102
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,646
over and over again.

103
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,548
Because we're mistaking variations on a theme for variety.

104
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,582
We need to start thinking about agency, player agency,

105
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:09,226
as an effect and a technique within a wider context.

106
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:11,848
Agency isn't necessarily a goal in of itself,

107
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,550
it shouldn't be treated like that.

108
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,672
So let's talk a little bit specifically

109
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,794
about 80 Days Protagonist, Passpartout,

110
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,136
and how we approached his place in the game world.

111
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:25,741
So in 80 Days, Passepartout's perceived whiteness and masculinity and Frenchness never go unremarked.

112
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:30,005
We don't treat them as if they're normal or automatically powerful,

113
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:33,688
and in fact we mark bits of the map as off-limits because of them.

114
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:40,575
We have NPCs deny you, as Passepartout, authority and question Passepartout's motives because of it.

115
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,977
Whiteness and masculinity make you an outsider in 80 Days,

116
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:46,180
even more often than it allows you within the circle.

117
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:52,167
We remind players of Passepartout's social and cultural limitations in his context.

118
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:56,170
NPCs will often discuss their plans and goals and ideas with Passepartout,

119
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,754
but we very rarely allow Passepartout to make a choice for them.

120
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:07,039
He gets involved in revolutions, riots, plots, and NPCs' adventures, but he doesn't drive them.

121
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,343
Yes, he can meet a beautiful revolutionary and shout alongside him in protest against a despot,

122
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:20,048
but he can't lead the revolution because he wasn't the one oppressed in the first place.

123
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:23,170
And because the revolution was already happening without him.

124
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,813
The thing is, he can't do the liberating because he wasn't the one oppressed,

125
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:32,356
because often the issues our NPCs struggle with are political and systemic,

126
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:36,178
far beyond the ability of one person, even a games protagonist, to solve.

127
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,481
So what that boils down to is that Passport 2, in a traditional choose-your-own-adventure sense,

128
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:44,182
actually goes around the world doing very little at all.

129
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:48,964
We kind of, we limit his actions and his power, but not the player's agency.

130
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:54,567
So, okay, let's define player agency very loosely as the ability to interact meaningfully,

131
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:59,069
meaningfully with the game world. But let's qualify that a little bit more.

132
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:01,770
If it's about making, say, significant changes to the game world.

133
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,998
The words that we need to be looking at here are meaningful and significant, I think.

134
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,536
Look at your friendships in the real world.

135
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:14,579
You can probably remember a time when a friend of yours was going through something.

136
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,100
A breakup, trouble at work or at home.

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,481
And they told you about it.

138
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:21,243
You listened to them. You might have even offered them an opinion.

139
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:24,025
They might have done what you suggested, but they might not have.

140
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:27,687
That doesn't really matter. You're still part of that story.

141
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:32,110
Your relationship isn't based on the other person following your directives exactly,

142
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,351
or on you making a decision for them,

143
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,332
unless you have some incredibly unhealthy friendships.

144
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:42,615
So the thing is, the meaning, the significance of it comes from the conversations you've had,

145
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:46,077
the connection you've shared, the relationship itself, the fact that you care about their problem.

146
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:49,938
You might have made a significant change in their life simply by listening.

147
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:55,441
So this is something that I want to talk about more, that player agency doesn't have to translate into action in a traditional sense.

148
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:59,523
even if a player can't directly affect something,

149
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:01,925
if they can have an opinion or an emotional response

150
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:05,308
or a reaction, for a game to allow them the space

151
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:07,429
to have an opinion can be as powerful

152
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,011
as allowing them to do something.

153
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:12,533
And giving protagonists this type of agency

154
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:15,355
actually can allow NPCs then to have more development

155
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,278
and depth, to pursue their goals without being constantly

156
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:21,380
overridden and overwritten by the protagonist's

157
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,662
overdeveloped sense of importance.

158
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:25,643
I'm Day One of GDC and I'm losing my voice.

159
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:31,598
All right. So let's look at an example of this from Bioware's Dragon Age 2. So how many of you

160
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:36,762
here have played this game? All right. Excellent. Great. This is going to be good. So the thing is

161
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:41,747
Dragon Age 2 gets a bit unfairly maligned I think. Dragon Age 2 is my, I think it's actually

162
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:46,391
probably my favorite Bioware game. Possibly one of my favorite games of all time. And all of that

163
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:52,036
is down to the NPCs. I can still load up any one of my 30 or so saves and feel right at home. Not

164
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,278
because I remember exactly where I am in the main plot.

165
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,360
But because I know exactly where I am based on the characters around me and my relationships with them.

166
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,422
Those relationships pull me into the world and they feel real, the characters in Dragon Age 2,

167
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:07,963
feel real in a way that most NPCs in games don't.

168
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:10,764
And that's because they often act independently.

169
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:13,706
And sometimes they lie, which almost never happens in a game.

170
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:21,116
So, spoilers, but in Act 2 of Dragon Age 2, you, the player, find out that Isabella has

171
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:24,738
been lying to you for almost all the way through the game.

172
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:28,300
So no matter what the state of your relationship with her, how friendly you are, or whether

173
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,922
you're in a romance with her or not, she betrays and abandons you because she has pressures

174
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:35,163
acting upon her that you didn't really know about.

175
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:40,326
So it's entirely possible for Isabella to leave the party permanently,

176
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:46,028
leaving your companion quest hanging indefinitely, denying you the player and you the protagonist

177
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:50,590
any resolution to her action beyond rage or belated justification.

178
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,393
And even if she does return to you, you have to deal with the consequences of her betrayal,

179
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:58,534
her independent action. You can't control what she does.

180
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:03,497
And the only thing that you can control here is how you react to it and how you feel about it.

181
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,717
And that's really powerful.

182
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:12,485
I think we need more NPCs like Isabella if games are ever going to be more than entitlement simulators.

183
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:19,049
So Matt Buck talked about this at his GDC MicroTalk last year, and this is just such a great term for,

184
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:23,511
I don't know, what most games can, you know, often feel like.

185
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:28,093
He talks about how the stories, the characters, and the mechanics of games, video games especially,

186
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:31,254
are often designed to give us exactly what we want uncritically.

187
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:37,639
And this is a problem because whoever heard of that great novel where the protagonist got exactly what they wanted all of the time?

188
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,300
Yeah, that sounds like a real page-turner.

189
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:47,106
So looking at games in this way, as entitlement simulators, also highlights what's wrong about most romances in games.

190
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,128
Why they feel transactional and goal-oriented.

191
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:54,811
How can we believe in NPC's romantic desire if they don't have any other kinds of desires?

192
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:57,513
If they feel like skill checks rather than people?

193
00:11:58,194 --> 00:12:06,019
We need to give NPCs agency and integrity if romances in games are ever going to feel like more than just playing with ourselves, as it were.

194
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:13,665
So let's keep talking about Dragon Age. Pretty much every single one of the romantic options in Dragon Age 2 stymies the protagonist in some way, which I love.

195
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:20,850
I'm going to talk about the most dramatic example of this, and it only just happens to be my own champion's romantic partner, Anders.

196
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:28,447
Anders is a mage possessed by the spirit of justice who occasionally gets all glowy eyed and kills people.

197
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:35,392
He is not Fenris, a runaway slave with tattoos which occasionally get glowy and they kill people.

198
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:36,572
So, just to make it clear.

199
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:41,916
Alright, so Anders. Whether he's in a relationship with you or not,

200
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,798
Anders actually chooses his political ideals over his personal loyalties

201
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,600
and commits an act of terrorism that starts a war.

202
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:51,948
which actually goes on to play out in Dragon Age Inquisition.

203
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,729
So it's a really, really great moment in the game.

204
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:58,331
You sort of start suspecting that he's sneaking around

205
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,192
and lying, and instead of finding out

206
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,274
that he's having an affair and cheesing on you,

207
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:05,916
he turns out to have been plotting a terrorist atrocity.

208
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,497
What I love about this is that there is no way to stop him

209
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,018
or to convince him out of it,

210
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:12,180
or even find out what he's planning,

211
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,341
no matter how many times you shag,

212
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,522
or even if you move him into your fancy mansion

213
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:16,862
in Hightown.

214
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:23,328
And if you're romancing him, the other characters give you, the protagonist, a hard time about

215
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:26,008
the fact that your boyfriend's a secret terrorist.

216
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:27,669
Just kind of fair enough, right?

217
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:31,550
His actions reflect on you because you chose to romance him.

218
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,531
Usually the game protagonist's actions ripple out into the world, and the entire game is

219
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:40,171
about seeing the consequences of your choices, the protagonist's choices, play out.

220
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:45,513
But in this instance, you're the one stuck, having to cope with and deal with the consequences

221
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:46,253
of an NPC's actions.

222
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,032
What this does is, as well, is begin to move us away

223
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:52,733
from that kind of goal-oriented conception of romance,

224
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,054
where you win a romance by getting a character

225
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:56,254
to sleep with you.

226
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:58,695
But in Dragon Age 2, shacking up isn't the end

227
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,036
of your story, it's the beginning.

228
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:02,557
It sounds really out there, I know,

229
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:05,658
but the game actually gives you content and dialogue

230
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:07,099
and quests with a character,

231
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:08,439
even after you've slept with them.

232
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:11,641
Almost as if one shag doesn't tell you everything

233
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,381
you need to know about a person in perpetuity.

234
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:19,298
I guess if these romances have a win state, it's staying together.

235
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:23,461
And as acts contrary to the interests and goals of the protagonist, and the experience

236
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:28,025
of the game is made richer for it, I personally think that Dragon Age 2 is a milestone for

237
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:30,488
the treatment of relationships and NPCs in games.

238
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:41,335
So giving NPCs control and limiting control and power can create interesting effects and experiences in games, even beyond romantic fulfillment.

239
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:47,999
So I wrote a couple of guest islands for Fail the Better Games' wonderful game, Summer Sea. Any of you played it here?

240
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,300
Yeah, well, okay most of you that's great

241
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:58,862
So if for those of you haven't it's a texty literary game of darkness and exploration set in a vast subterranean underworld

242
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:02,443
I'm deliberately trying to not look at Alexis Kennedy as I say this

243
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,684
I wrote I wrote the I I wrote a place called the Isle of Cats

244
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:10,245
Which is a kind of smugglers haven a really morally dubious place a dangerous place

245
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:14,266
You have to pick a patron on the island and then perform a series of quests to progress

246
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:20,968
And at one point, one of the patrons, Zaira, demands that you sacrifice a member of your crew to her

247
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:24,668
to allow their memories to be harvested in this incredibly gruesome and horrible way.

248
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:31,110
It's worse than murder somehow? And there is no way to access the rest of the content on this island

249
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,451
without giving Zaira what she wants. There is a real cost to the protagonist, but to the player

250
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:42,692
as well. You can retain your in-game morals, but you'll have to give up on the story and the rewards

251
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,172
that would result in completing the quest.

252
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:48,373
the protagonist really doesn't get to have everything.

253
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,014
And certainly not for free.

254
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,234
And that's the entire point.

255
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:53,715
That's how we establish the creepiness

256
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:54,636
and drive home the danger.

257
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:57,637
But the thing is, the player isn't entitled

258
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:59,597
to the end of this story.

259
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:02,478
And even though there's no way to subvert or trick Zaira,

260
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:05,419
the player is not left without a choice.

261
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:07,600
There is a choice and it's not to play.

262
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:13,017
So Papers, Please is a really interesting counter example that helps make clear, I think,

263
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:18,300
the distinction between agency and control, between agency and power.

264
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,483
So in Papers, Please, you have all the agency in the world to decide how to spend your time,

265
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:28,926
what documents to pass, how to spend your money, but your power is hugely and pointedly limited.

266
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:34,389
Part of that limitation is by making the NPCs in the game demand things of you,

267
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,850
demand and need more things than you can provide,

268
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,132
forcing you to make choices and compromise and fail.

269
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,994
Giving you the agency actually highlights how powerless you are in this world.

270
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:49,357
In playing, you actually form a kind of kinship with the NPCs that you nominally dictate to.

271
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:53,339
You are all, in fact, powerless in the face of Arstotzka's tyrannical bureaucracy.

272
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:59,782
So all of these examples, I think, show us ways NPCs can help make games that go beyond

273
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,005
the power fantasy, basically.

274
00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:08,351
So in fact, the way in which we treat our NPCs in 80 Days ties entirely into the theme,

275
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,954
but it's also a huge part of how our players interact with and understand the world.

276
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:16,378
In a very real way, NPCs are a key part of our world building.

277
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,820
we explore wider social and cultural,

278
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,721
political, social, and cultural themes

279
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,662
through personal concerns and entanglements.

280
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:27,464
The world feels complex because the way our NPCs think about,

281
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,345
react to, and engage with the world is complex

282
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:32,006
and often contradictory.

283
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:34,407
So this feels like a much more elegant and natural way

284
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,908
to unfold things like backstory and politics and plot.

285
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:40,030
So in 80 Days, almost every single NPC

286
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,152
has a slightly different opinion of the Artifices Guild.

287
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:46,884
So they have their own entirely biased and personal

288
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:47,624
and particular perspective,

289
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:50,266
and that's what the player experiences.

290
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,906
World building through NPCs in this way

291
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:55,608
actually makes the world kind of counterintuitively,

292
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,889
I think, feel more coherent and alive

293
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:01,010
by even more so than offering the player a journal entry

294
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,391
or a singular definitive perspective.

295
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,032
It kind of gives the player the space

296
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:06,693
to make up their own mind,

297
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,554
rather than having their mind made up for them.

298
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,294
There is no definitive truth.

299
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:14,817
about the Artifices in a world-building document somewhere.

300
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:17,437
We developed our ideas about the Artifices Guild

301
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:20,958
through writing the NPCs' opinions

302
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,719
and our engagements with them.

303
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,520
That's what makes the fantasy feel nuanced and grounded.

304
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:28,345
I'm going to drink some water.

305
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,747
So the reason that this works though, also in 80 Days,

306
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:33,390
is because there are so many NPCs in 80 Days,

307
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,212
and so many perspectives.

308
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,214
So no NPC has to bear the weight

309
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:41,338
of entirely representing a culture or gender or a race,

310
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:43,380
which is kind of the quickest way to end up

311
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,422
with stereotypes and mouthpieces,

312
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:47,184
or merely vessels for plot and story,

313
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:49,446
which is entirely what we don't want.

314
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:55,879
So the way around, one of the easiest ways to avoid this

315
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:57,459
is by doing the research.

316
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,980
And I know this doesn't really sound particularly sexy,

317
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,141
but it really is, trust me.

318
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:06,862
So beyond just having more characters and not just tokens,

319
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,383
you need to do this research.

320
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:10,063
Whether it's about, whether your game

321
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:11,864
is about a historical period or a situation

322
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:13,144
or a particular identity.

323
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:23,809
Look for real-world examples of dilemmas, or people, or places, or cultures to help inform and add nuance to your portrayal of your NPCs.

324
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:27,591
Don't give your NPC the most obvious opinion you think they would have.

325
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:32,174
In some cases you might need to do research to discover this stereotype that you need to avoid.

326
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:33,574
Do this. It will be worth it.

327
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:36,716
This is the very first hurdle, so don't fall at this one.

328
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:41,238
It's lazy, and it's boring, and it's so easy to avoid, I promise you.

329
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:42,599
So part of doing the research...

330
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:49,530
is also as writers and creators asking ourselves whether this is our story to tell.

331
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,112
In 80 Days, some NPC stories are simply not for Passepartout. They're not for the player.

332
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:58,993
They're not for strangers, tourists, or outsiders. And that's okay. That can actually be a good thing.

333
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:03,717
This is a question we should ask ourselves when we're writing games and designing NPCs.

334
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:07,040
How much of this is for the player? How much of this is for the protagonist?

335
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,704
If we want to breathe life into our NPCs, I think there kind of has to be something left over for them.

336
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:17,408
Something that is just for them and not just in service of player, protagonist, or plot.

337
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:20,491
And that might mean telling the story in a slightly different way than you imagined.

338
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:26,633
So there are multiple times in 80 days where Passport 2

339
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,340
encounters a person or a situation

340
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,365
and can't do anything to influence them.

341
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,327
because of a particular set of circumstances.

342
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,968
So it's been really interesting for us to watch players

343
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:39,009
respond to that in forums and blogs.

344
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,550
I think it tells us quite a lot about player expectation

345
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,031
and how hard we have to work to subvert that

346
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,671
to make worthwhile NPCs.

347
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:48,913
So in Brisbane in 80 Days, you discover,

348
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:52,294
you encounter a girl from the indigenous Murray tribe

349
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:53,774
and she's working as a maid in the hotel

350
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:55,055
that you're staying at.

351
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:56,355
You can engage her in conversation

352
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,296
and she tells you about the depredations

353
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:01,217
her people have suffered as a result of colonialization.

354
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:07,425
And she's written a letter of complaint outlining this, which she wants to get printed in the local newspaper

355
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:08,707
to gain attention for her cause.

356
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:11,591
And you, as Passpartout, as a protagonist,

357
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:15,937
realise that it's unlikely that the white settler-owned newspaper is going to print any such note,

358
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:18,160
especially not on the request of an Aboriginal girl.

359
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:25,543
So you can offer to take the letter to the newspaper yourself, to use your whiteness and maleness and your protagonism basically to help her.

360
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:31,125
But she refuses, she doesn't trust you because of all these things, because you're an outsider, because you're white and you're male.

361
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,626
You're closer to the oppressor than you are to her.

362
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,187
And all the good intentions in the world can't change that.

363
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:44,250
And what is wonderful and perfectly understandable is that there is a heated debate in various forums about how to get the Murray girl to trust you with her letter.

364
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:48,430
This is not surprising.

365
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,772
Games train you, the protagonist, to fix problems.

366
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:54,354
Or rather, they teach you that all problems can be fixed

367
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,916
and by protagonists, if you try hard enough.

368
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,758
But here, in this case, it's not your problem

369
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:00,159
and you can't fix it.

370
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,261
Solving it using your protagonist's white privilege,

371
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,823
actually, would make the solution part of the problem.

372
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,844
Passport 2 can't ride to her rescue.

373
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:10,686
He can't really solve racism by posting a single letter.

374
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:15,190
and your protagonist can't get past years of ingrained distrust of whiteness

375
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,353
and his ignorance of local culture and politics in the course of one conversation.

376
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:22,735
She's never going to open up to pass by to you, no matter what item

377
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:24,677
you, the player, try and use from your travels.

378
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:29,881
So, but awesomely enough, when I checked back this thread on the wiki,

379
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,382
someone had actually made this post.

380
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:34,599
Which is great. Maybe it's a life lesson.

381
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,422
Sometimes no matter what you do to try and help, bad things will happen.

382
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:42,985
Exactly anonymous Wikia contributor. This is not a bug.

383
00:22:42,985 --> 00:22:47,228
This is not a bug. This is a feature. This is the entire point of the game.

384
00:22:47,228 --> 00:22:50,550
But it is such an unfamiliar notion, I think, to people who play games.

385
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,212
And it's such an unfamiliar structure that inhabiting the skin of the protagonist

386
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:56,133
can be limiting as well as liberating.

387
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:59,715
that you will meet someone that does not immediately want to open up to you,

388
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:02,737
the protagonist, and want your involvement.

389
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:06,959
It feels unfair to the player to be shown a problem and not allowed to fix it.

390
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,999
But it's important.

391
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:09,820
We couldn't have done it any other way

392
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,921
without completely undermining the kind of story that we wanted to tell.

393
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:16,723
We had to deny the player that fairness fantasy, their white savior fantasy.

394
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:21,521
we deliberately steal power from Passepartout and give it to the NPCs.

395
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:24,744
And that's why the game works as it does.

396
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:27,667
Because the way in which we understand and assign agency

397
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,951
is not a neutral design decision, as though there's any such thing.

398
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:35,013
And how could we write stories of indigenous power and ingenuity

399
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,656
with our words if Passepartout was mechanically solving

400
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:39,898
all of our NPCs' problems for them?

401
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,700
It might feel unfair to the player,

402
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,082
but maybe unfair isn't the worst thing a game can be.

403
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:51,081
This is one of the myths of equality and multiculturalism and feminism that I particularly despise,

404
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:54,603
that socially good and progressive outcomes are going to come without a cost.

405
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:56,324
But you can't deny this truth in game design.

406
00:23:56,324 --> 00:24:00,687
If you want someone who is silent to speak, someone else might have to shut up for a while.

407
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:04,189
With 80 Days, we went in wanting to be respectful to other cultures and people and characters,

408
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:09,372
and that meant that we had to balance the agency in the game as we would difficulty and challenge.

409
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:13,674
This was not only a question of design or storytelling or mechanics, but a question of ethics.

410
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:17,478
So giving NPCs agency can genuinely be an ethical imperative.

411
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:23,643
So specifically one of our stated purposes was going in was to make a game which undermined

412
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:28,427
the power fantasy, the fantasy of white history and the fantasy of imperialism.

413
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:32,391
And the imperial fantasy requires that the struggles of colonized people, of people of

414
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:37,415
color, of women and working class people and minorities are either ignored or enshrined

415
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:41,038
in victims of porn in pornographic narratives of victimhood.

416
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:47,101
and suffering. And victimhood is all-encompassing. Victims exist to be saved or pitied, but never

417
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:52,943
respected. Victims are acted upon rather than acting. In fact, victims are the quintessential

418
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:58,845
NPCs. And if we don't deliberately and specifically work to undermine that, all of our NPCs are going

419
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:03,287
to be victims, even if we don't intend them to be. Just as we need to deliberately and

420
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:06,828
specifically work to make sure that protagonist is not synonymous with hero...

421
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,651
we need to do this for NPCs as well.

422
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:11,612
And the more that we make these distinctions,

423
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,313
the more we interrogate these assumptions,

424
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:15,955
the more we'll be able to shift focus to NPCs,

425
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:18,776
to allow them power and space and depth and importance.

426
00:25:18,776 --> 00:25:22,699
And I think this is vital to the progress of games' narrative as a craft

427
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:24,480
and to video games as a medium.

428
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,401
We need to come to an almost entirely new understanding

429
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,562
of the meaning of protagonism and agency.

430
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:34,004
And to find a definition of agency that can assimilate a loss of control,

431
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:37,445
of protagonism that works outside of primacy,

432
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:40,066
of games that can function outside of entitlement.

433
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:42,827
And that's my talk. So, thank you very much.

434
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:48,889
AUDIENCE APPLAUSE
