1
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:05,768
Thank you all so much for coming out.

2
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:08,249
We're going to spend a little bit of time together today

3
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:10,910
talking about how we play with magic

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,351
and make interactive worlds at Walt Disney Imagineering.

5
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,291
My name is Sarah Thatcher.

6
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,332
This is Brent Strong.

7
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:16,772
Hello.

8
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:17,032
And.

9
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:25,117
When I'm at Imagineering, I have worked in R&D.

10
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:27,958
So I've done a lot of work in R&D thinking about,

11
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:32,300
what are the new experiences that we really want to do,

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,921
but we don't have the technology for?

13
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:37,523
How can we build that technology to create that experience?

14
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:43,005
And equally, how do we, there's some brand new cool things

15
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:43,465
out there.

16
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:44,746
What do we do with these?

17
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:46,867
How do we turn this technology into an experience?

18
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,688
Because ultimately, at Imagineering,

19
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:50,488
we're an entertainment company.

20
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:55,081
So, and lately, I've been taking all of that work

21
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,864
and translating it into a new project

22
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:59,366
as part of the Star Wars portfolio,

23
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:03,830
the Star Wars Immersive Multi-Day Resort Experience

24
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,654
that is, thank you, that's announced for Florida.

25
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:11,277
So, that's a little bit about what I do

26
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:13,459
as a creative director at Walt Disney Imagineering.

27
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:15,573
And hi there, I'm Brent Strong.

28
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:17,913
I'm also a creative director at Walt Disney Imagineering.

29
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:20,954
I've been at WDI for about 13 years now

30
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:22,415
and spent most of that time working

31
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,476
on new interactive experiences that bring our guests closer

32
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:26,776
to the magic.

33
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:29,657
My current project, I'm working on a new project

34
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,717
down at Disney California Adventure.

35
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,658
It's an immersive interactive attraction

36
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,959
that lets guests feel what it's like

37
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,899
to have super heroic powers.

38
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,860
And we're very excited to bring people

39
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,020
into that world as well.

40
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,919
So quick show of hands, how many of you guys

41
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,270
have been to one of our parks around the world?

42
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:49,847
All right, good.

43
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:50,887
Most of you will know the things that we're

44
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:53,608
talking about then today.

45
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:57,048
As that video outlined, we do have 12 theme parks

46
00:01:57,048 --> 00:01:58,009
around the world.

47
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,369
We have four cruise ships, soon to be seven.

48
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,790
We also have the Alani Resort and a whole host of adventures

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,370
by Disney around the world.

50
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,650
Most people think of theme parks when

51
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,551
they think of Imagineering.

52
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,131
But what most people don't realize

53
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,752
is that at Imagineering, we're responsible for every aspect

54
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:14,733
of the guest experience from restaurants, to shopping,

55
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:18,593
to rides, shows, entertainment, spectaculars, you name it.

56
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:22,336
But before we talk about all of that, I want to go back in time a little bit.

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,859
I want to talk a little bit about how this all began back in 1952 before we had any theme

58
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:28,519
parks.

59
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,542
In fact, before the concept of a theme park really existed, sort of where that came from.

60
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:39,245
And Walt himself was a filmmaker, had wonderful programs on television.

61
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:43,327
When he set out to figure out what is this idea of a theme park, what is this idea of

62
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:47,430
a location-based experience, what he did is he gathered movie makers around.

63
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,033
him, some of his most trusted animators, some of his most trusted storytellers, and asked

64
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,474
a very important question.

65
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,636
It was, whose tie is the skinniest?

66
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:57,957
You'd think so from the picture.

67
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:00,879
It's a really good skinny tie competition.

68
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,262
But actually it was, how can we put our guests in the movies?

69
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:09,545
How can we take the stories that they've seen on screen and bring that to life in three

70
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:10,126
dimensions?

71
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:14,047
And back then, they were inventing this from scratch.

72
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:18,988
Since then, we have 65 plus years of experience doing this.

73
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:21,069
And we've learned a couple things along the way.

74
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,689
And today, we're going to talk about a few

75
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:25,170
of these best practices, a few of these tips

76
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,210
that we've discovered along the way.

77
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,071
And spoiler alert, a lot of these things

78
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,172
that we deal with in theme parks are things

79
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:35,292
that you guys have tackled in game design and game

80
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,893
production as well.

81
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:38,893
It turns out that these missions are very similar.

82
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:46,413
And today we're going to highlight some of those similarities as well as some of the things that are fundamentally different when you take things off the screen and bring them into three dimensions.

83
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:54,271
So by way of example, sort of talking about how different these mediums can be,

84
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:57,934
we're going to go all the way back to the beginning as Walt and those original Imagineers

85
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,616
were coming up with the original Disneyland.

86
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,018
They turned for inspiration to one of the original movies,

87
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:05,921
one of the original animated films, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,

88
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,923
and they turned that into an attraction.

89
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:10,525
Now in this attraction, they wanted to really immerse you in the film.

90
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:11,946
They wanted to bring you into the movie.

91
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,949
And so they created an experience where you visited

92
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:16,870
some of the most iconic locations from the film.

93
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,452
You went to the Dwarves' Diamond Mine,

94
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:22,035
you went to the spooky dungeons, you went to the forest.

95
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:24,097
You saw some of the most iconic characters.

96
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,818
You met the dwarves, the woodland critters,

97
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:27,259
the evil queen.

98
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,062
And yet when people went on this, they were perplexed.

99
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:34,526
You saw a lot of things from that film

100
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:36,367
and went through all those iconic scenes,

101
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,129
but you never saw Snow White.

102
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:43,001
There was no Snow White in Snow White and Her Adventures.

103
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:46,606
It said right on the marquee, it said her name above the door,

104
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:48,207
and then you go on, you see all these things,

105
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,990
but you don't see her.

106
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,070
So.

107
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:51,672
Where is she?

108
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:52,472
Why wasn't she there?

109
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:56,915
Well, our filmmakers said, when they were gathered

110
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:59,137
around that table thinking about how do we

111
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:01,639
put guests in the movie, they said, OK.

112
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,282
This is an amazing opportunity to give our guests

113
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:08,723
that first-person experience.

114
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:12,986
So instead of, as you're going through,

115
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:15,929
instead of seeing Snow White, you're going to be Snow White.

116
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,110
The witch is going to offer you the apple.

117
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:25,264
And it turned out that that was a little confusing.

118
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:27,805
Cool idea, confusing execution.

119
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:31,547
So part of the confusion was a first-person experience

120
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,968
is just a small part of being in the movie.

121
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,548
It turns out that

122
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,459
Snow White's experience as you're watching her

123
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,141
is a lot different than your experience

124
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:46,623
of being in this early dark ride.

125
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,266
So you are, for one thing, you are literally on rails.

126
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,068
Snow White is, you're watching her make choices.

127
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,310
She's deciding whether or not to go investigate

128
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,671
this little sleepy cottage.

129
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:58,712
Why is it so small?

130
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:00,213
Who could live there?

131
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:02,315
She's deciding whether or not to take the apple.

132
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:04,476
You are on rails.

133
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,474
Going through scene by scene, you're

134
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:08,854
not making any of those choices.

135
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:11,595
So your fundamental experience is

136
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:16,096
different than that of Snow White.

137
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:19,757
So when you're watching something on TV,

138
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:23,538
say like a car commercial, that car commercial

139
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:26,778
is getting you to imagine what it's like to be

140
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:28,759
behind the wheel of the car.

141
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,799
That's their whole goal is to.

142
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:35,116
within that frame of that proscenium of that TV

143
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:39,560
to get you to imagine yourself immersed in that car.

144
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,866
And as a simple message for a car commercial, great.

145
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,307
But when you start to add.

146
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:54,229
When you start to add emotions, when you start to add that narrative complexity, we don't

147
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:59,114
get to transition directly to the experience of being that first-person perspective.

148
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:05,581
Because what's really happening is we're ingesting all of that, what's going on on the screen,

149
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:09,404
and we are projecting ourselves into that world.

150
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:10,325
We're imagining.

151
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,213
we're imagining what is not just what is Snow White doing,

152
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,094
but what is she thinking?

153
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:19,234
What is she feeling?

154
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:21,095
What would it feel like if I were there?

155
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:23,457
We're empathizing with that world,

156
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:25,818
and we're creating it inside of our heads.

157
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,980
So to put us in the world, it doesn't

158
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,540
mean making us Snow White.

159
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,043
It means being, it's not just the interpretation of you

160
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,644
in the movie, it's.

161
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:42,619
your experience, it's your empathy of how we get you in the movie, we make that experience

162
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:46,566
authentic from what you view it from the inside out.

163
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:50,596
So when we start talking about building an authentic experience

164
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,077
from the inside out, one of the first things, right

165
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:55,938
at the center of that diagram, is giving our guests a role.

166
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:57,839
Making sure that we are very clear about the role

167
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,179
that we're giving you.

168
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,660
In that original attraction, we never

169
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,481
told you that you were going to be Snow White.

170
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,921
And so of course, you expected to see her.

171
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,142
You did not know who you were.

172
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:08,143
And by the way, being a camera is not necessarily a role.

173
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,103
That doesn't really feel like you're a part of that world.

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,082
Moreover, it's important that we give you a role that fits.

175
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:17,225
It can be really difficult to empathize with a character

176
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:18,746
whose story you already know.

177
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:20,788
Snow White has already made her decisions.

178
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:22,049
Her story has already unfolded.

179
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:23,270
We know how it plays out.

180
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,330
Mine is just beginning.

181
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,732
So you don't necessarily want to be in the role of a main

182
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:28,514
character, and you don't necessarily want to hand

183
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,956
somebody a back story that they don't know, relationships

184
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:34,378
with characters that they can't identify with, goals

185
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:35,419
that don't resonate with them.

186
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,981
You need to meet guests where they are and give

187
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:39,322
them a role that fits.

188
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:42,279
So let's look at an example from opening day Disneyland

189
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,519
that worked out a little bit better,

190
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,160
which is the Jungle Cruise.

191
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,261
Now, in the Jungle Cruise, you have a clear role.

192
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,002
In fact, it's right there on the marquee.

193
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:50,523
You are a river tourist.

194
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:54,105
You are here to experience the wonders of the jungle.

195
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:56,606
You go on a wonderful adventure hosted by a skipper.

196
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,267
That skipper is interacting with you as a tourist.

197
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:02,009
You are playing that role quite authentically.

198
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,730
Another example here, classic attraction,

199
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,231
is the Haunted Mansion.

200
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:08,152
Now, here you are a guest of the ghosts.

201
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:08,892
How do we know that?

202
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:18,356
Welcome, foolish mortals, to the Haunted Mansion.

203
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:21,320
I am your host, your ghost host.

204
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,482
Well, we know because the ghosts tell us.

205
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:27,727
The ghost host himself welcomes us as foolish mortals

206
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:28,608
into the haunted mansion.

207
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:30,851
We are invited guests.

208
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:33,214
And we kept building on that.

209
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:35,837
We could become passengers on a spaceship in Star Tours,

210
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:38,441
where we could blast off to a world far, far away.

211
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:40,443
And again, how do we know that we're passengers on a spaceship?

212
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:43,585
the entire queue is set up as an airport, right?

213
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:45,146
It's set up as a travel departure port

214
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:48,107
where we're going through baggage screening and security.

215
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:49,708
We're seeing our ship prepped for launch.

216
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,230
There's even a captain who addresses us and brings us

217
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,110
into that world.

218
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,692
So in all three of these examples,

219
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:57,853
we are going to incredibly aspirational places.

220
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:00,294
We're meeting aspirational characters.

221
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:02,535
But it feels like we could go one step farther.

222
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:02,996
Yeah.

223
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:03,076
So.

224
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,215
We're going to these aspirational places,

225
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:10,219
but what if the role that we could play

226
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:14,926
was as aspirational as the place that we're going?

227
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:18,932
So in taking this on, we looked at our

228
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,634
Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout attraction in Disney California Adventure.

229
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:29,640
This is, you are, you start out as a visitor to the collector's collection. I know you're saying,

230
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,704
we just talked about active, we just said how can you make that role more active,

231
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:38,171
and we're saying you're a visitor. So very quickly as you're going through.

232
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:39,906
that attraction.

233
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,268
Right there in the queue, you're told

234
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:45,730
you're no longer a visitor to the collector's collection.

235
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,971
You are an accomplice.

236
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,873
The Guardians of the Galaxy have been

237
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:51,975
collected by the collector, and they're being held,

238
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:54,397
and we need to break them out.

239
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:57,659
And in fact, we need you to break them out.

240
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:02,083
So Rocket Raccoon, as the brains of the operation,

241
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:06,426
has figured out that he

242
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:10,266
He knows how to do this, except he's a raccoon.

243
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:13,469
It's a recurring problem for him.

244
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:17,313
So he recruits you to use your human hands

245
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:20,336
to be able to scan your hands

246
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,178
and defeat the security measures.

247
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:26,563
So you are a necessary part of getting this to happen.

248
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:31,135
So you raise your hand, security measure is defeated,

249
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:33,057
and we actually get to break them out.

250
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:38,161
So in all of this, giving you a role that is,

251
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,442
in order to play a meaningful role,

252
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:42,524
I need to know who I am, understand my role,

253
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:43,264
make it clear.

254
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:47,868
It's great if it can be an aspirational one,

255
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:49,549
something that I get to,

256
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,531
and maybe even something that I get to do.

257
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:55,614
So we have all of that.

258
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,194
Where am I going?

259
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,843
Well, so as we create our worlds, as we bring the worlds of the film to life, now that you

260
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:06,064
have a role, we want you to inhabit a living world.

261
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:11,787
When you see Snow White in that frame, for example, she is able to not walk through a

262
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:12,508
static world.

263
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:14,489
Static worlds are creepy worlds.

264
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:17,170
Even the haunted mansion, which is full of dead people, moves.

265
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,673
In horror movies, when things are static, that's how you know that things are about

266
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:22,873
to get really, really scary.

267
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:27,756
And so when we bring these worlds to life, we want to create living worlds, breathing

268
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:28,636
worlds, worlds that move.

269
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:32,859
And obviously, Walt and those original Imagineers with a background in animation,

270
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,640
were passionate about that.

271
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,883
And so Walt at the time was very intrigued

272
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:38,725
by these little mechanical birds.

273
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,986
He had found a couple of these

274
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:41,888
and actually started a small collection.

275
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:44,792
And these birds, these little mechanical birds,

276
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,053
held the illusion of life,

277
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:48,676
that same concept that they had in their film animation.

278
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:52,039
They were seeing play out in 3D space.

279
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,181
And this became a trend in imagining.

280
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,343
This became a cornerstone for us,

281
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,385
this idea of audio animatronics.

282
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,548
And using that illusion of life in three dimensions

283
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,151
to bring our stories to life in new ways.

284
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,933
And this is just a couple brief clips

285
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,474
of some of the highlights.

286
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,496
That one right there, Lincoln standing up,

287
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,898
that was sort of a seminal moment in audio animatronics.

288
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:14,340
Up until that moment, the animatronics

289
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,201
were very stiff, very stationary.

290
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:18,043
Everyone thought that Abe was just

291
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:21,245
going to be sitting there in that chair, all nice

292
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:21,966
and peaceful.

293
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,427
And then he goes and he stands up.

294
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:27,050
He becomes more lifelike than anyone had expected him to be.

295
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,691
And we continue to push the envelope here, right?

296
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:32,273
This is really key to bringing our worlds to life.

297
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:34,854
This is the shaman figure from Pandora,

298
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:37,336
the world of Avatar at Disney's Animal Kingdom.

299
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:40,258
Now this animatronic is incredibly sophisticated.

300
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:42,179
It contains over 140 functions in the head alone.

301
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,442
to bring this character to life.

302
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:50,446
And, you know, really the goal here is to take that same level of fidelity

303
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:53,649
that you see in the movies, right, where special effects animators

304
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,913
are able to bring these characters to life with every tool at their disposal.

305
00:13:57,913 --> 00:14:01,176
We want to give that same tool to our animators in three dimensions.

306
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:05,476
But most of the things we've been talking about here,

307
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:06,817
we are an audience to, right?

308
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,958
These animatronics are putting on a show,

309
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,120
whether that's the Tiki Room, whether that's Mr. Lincoln,

310
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,861
even the shaman as you go floating by.

311
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:16,504
These are things where we become silent observers for that.

312
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:18,346
That's not Snow White's experience at all.

313
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,894
She's in a world where as she moves through it,

314
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:24,616
that world reacts to her presence.

315
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:27,840
That's how we know that she's in that world.

316
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,104
And so to do that, we started asking the question,

317
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,787
can we make that illusion of life responsive?

318
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:36,010
Can we make that world respond to what you do?

319
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:38,873
So going back to the collector's collection,

320
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:41,395
as you're going to Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout,

321
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:45,338
you go through, you get to see a little bit of the collection.

322
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:47,940
And in that collection, there are

323
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,903
some creatures from around the galaxy,

324
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:53,465
including these little Vilew.

325
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,846
And these guys.

326
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:58,982
actually react to our guests.

327
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,602
So they're packed with a bunch of sensors.

328
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:06,383
And as guests are going by, they're looking for big gestures.

329
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:07,844
They're looking for your gestures.

330
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:09,564
They're looking for their sounds.

331
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:14,025
And just like a creature is taking in information

332
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:19,046
from the world and then reacting to it, they do that.

333
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:21,787
And they have a personality.

334
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,867
So the idea that, well,

335
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,181
Somebody who's making big motions,

336
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,642
that's a little scary.

337
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,643
But another Vailou who's a little more brave

338
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:33,803
is gonna lean in and just be really curious.

339
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:37,105
So each of them have their own personality

340
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:38,465
and react to you.

341
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,986
And what's really amazing about that happening

342
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:44,107
is that that role that we gave you earlier

343
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:48,349
as first as a visitor and then as an accomplice,

344
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,009
it makes you real in the world.

345
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:52,950
That if the world changes because of things that you do,

346
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,772
that world becomes more real and you become more real within that world.

347
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:07,633
So when you think about it, if you remove all of the movement from a world,

348
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,294
that's actually how horror movies start.

349
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,214
That's how you know something's wrong.

350
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:16,255
It feels dead. It feels creepy.

351
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:18,695
Even the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion move.

352
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:22,997
the feeling of a static world, it feels dead.

353
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,918
So how do we make it move?

354
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:28,220
How do we make, and making that responsiveness

355
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,862
actually validates the existence of that person

356
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:33,443
in the role that they're playing.

357
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,344
So as we bring the environment to life,

358
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:38,065
we're making that role that you're playing

359
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,586
even more deep and meaningful inside of that world.

360
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,810
So we're playing a meaningful role.

361
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,071
The world is responding to us.

362
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,433
Now we're actually not feeling like an extra.

363
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:52,115
We're beginning to feel like a protagonist in this story.

364
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:53,777
And what do protagonists do?

365
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:57,500
Well, they take action that moves the story forward.

366
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,841
And so one of the really important things

367
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:00,943
here is to look for a way that our guests can actually

368
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:03,985
propel the narrative, that their action can

369
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:06,488
be the impetus for the story continuing.

370
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:09,611
Now, this is something, again, we're here at GDC.

371
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,154
You guys know all about the importance of players or guests

372
00:17:13,154 --> 00:17:14,495
taking action, right?

373
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,678
Action is the foundation of play.

374
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:19,080
It's the foundation of challenge.

375
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,783
It's the foundation of so many of these things.

376
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:24,866
But it turns out that when you go and try and take play,

377
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:26,427
which people already do in their living

378
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:29,190
rooms with their families, and bring it into the real world,

379
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,231
you encounter some challenges.

380
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:33,976
And so for example, when I'm at home with my wife,

381
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:36,198
my six-year-old, we're playing a board game,

382
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:38,779
I will do ridiculous things that I would not

383
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:40,220
do in the supermarket.

384
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,702
When I am playing online with my friends,

385
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:44,523
I will put my avatar into an outfit

386
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:47,245
that I would not feel comfortable wearing here at GDC.

387
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:49,426
There are things that you do that

388
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:52,228
are ridiculous among friends and in the privacy of your home

389
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:55,330
that you would not do in a public space.

390
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,631
And so really, the question here is,

391
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:59,673
how do we encourage guests to play in public the same way

392
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:00,654
that they would play at home?

393
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:05,783
Or to put it differently, how do we get a normal teenager to wear a silly hat?

394
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:08,504
How do we go about crossing that divide?

395
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:14,327
And it turns out that the answer is something that's familiar to most of you guys in the game design industry,

396
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,288
which is you make a magic circle.

397
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:21,412
Now, this term was popularized in game design, and essentially, you know, it's that concept

398
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:26,295
of leaving the real world behind, right, setting aside the rules of everyday life and reality,

399
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:32,660
and substituting them with the reality of a game, right, with a new context of the game.

400
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,122
Now, the Imagineers back in 1952, you know, 1955 when the park opened.

401
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:39,925
wouldn't have been familiar with the term magic circle,

402
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:43,787
and yet they built a literal magic circle around the park.

403
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:45,788
At Disneyland, we actually have a train

404
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:48,230
that encircles the entire park that's elevated

405
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,792
so you cannot see the real world from inside of the park.

406
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:52,993
We call it the berm.

407
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:55,815
And actually, at the entrance to this park,

408
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,977
as you cross underneath that train track,

409
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:00,978
there's a plaque that explicitly states,

410
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:03,100
here you leave the real world behind

411
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,621
and enter a world of fantasy.

412
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,842
And so that's actually the trick.

413
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:10,223
It turns out that we're not asking you to play

414
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:11,343
in the real world.

415
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:14,584
We're giving you an alibi to play in a fantasy world.

416
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:16,325
We're creating a fantasy world

417
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:18,486
that happens to exist in real space.

418
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:21,227
And when you do that, it gives you permission to play.

419
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,587
It gives you permission to act.

420
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:25,909
It gives you permission to experiment and to role play

421
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,390
in a way that you may not do out in public spaces,

422
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,710
and yet you will do here at Disneyland.

423
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,131
And we see this all the time.

424
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,492
And we've taken advantage of this

425
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,773
by creating a lot of experiences that

426
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:39,715
allow you to take a deeper part in the story

427
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:41,816
and really move the story forward.

428
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:45,779
So one example of this is Agent P's World Showcase Adventure

429
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:47,720
that is out in Epcot in Florida.

430
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,841
Now, this was actually designed.

431
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:50,982
He might be here in the audience.

432
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,583
Is Jonathan Ackley out there right now?

433
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,301
If he's raising his hand, I can't tell.

434
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,745
But one of our Imagineers here at the conference

435
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:00,327
actually designed these games, had

436
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,471
been creating adventure games for home platforms

437
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,794
for a long time, and actually came to Imagineering

438
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:06,357
and created a series of adventure games

439
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:08,600
that play out in physical space.

440
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:11,303
And these allow you to explore the environment,

441
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:13,366
just like you would in a traditional adventure game.

442
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:15,107
But instead of pointing and clicking,

443
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:18,111
you're actually physically moving through the space.

444
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:19,212
Now, in order to understand this video,

445
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:20,513
you have to go back to a time

446
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,537
when we didn't all carry smartphones in our pocket.

447
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:25,559
We actually used to hand out flip phones

448
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,322
for this experience so that people could have it.

449
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:29,824
But as you're moving through the park.

450
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:32,285
You are receiving missions.

451
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:34,646
You are receiving treasure hunts, scavenger hunts,

452
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:38,308
that allow you to find and trigger magic in the environment.

453
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:40,129
You interact with physical props.

454
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:41,449
You deploy satellite dishes.

455
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,811
You receive encoded messages.

456
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:45,311
You interact with cast members.

457
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,072
You interact with all sorts of things.

458
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:48,033
And it turns out...

459
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:52,776
that while the mechanics are very similar to playing an adventure game at home,

460
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:56,199
there's something very different that happens when it plays out in the real world.

461
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:59,261
We're all very used to having agency in a world of pixels.

462
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:03,184
It's very different to have agency in a world of bricks and mortar.

463
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:07,508
To actually change the physical environment around you at the push of a digital button

464
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:08,949
is still very magical, right?

465
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:12,411
That phone almost becomes a remote control for the entire park.

466
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:14,653
And you're able to find magic right under your nose,

467
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:16,415
or in the case of this troll, right under his nose.

468
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:21,136
right, and really make things, you know, sort of magically appear.

469
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:23,136
Now we've taken this one step farther,

470
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:26,437
and last year we launched the Play Disney Parks app.

471
00:21:26,437 --> 00:21:29,178
And this is, again, taking that idea of agency even farther,

472
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:33,198
where you are now able to use the entire park as a game board,

473
00:21:33,198 --> 00:21:35,599
and your phone is able to follow your lead.

474
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,620
Your personal device is able to understand where you are

475
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,900
and allow you to interact with the environment in unique ways,

476
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,801
depending on the story world that you're within.

477
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:48,183
And so if you take your phone to Peter Pan's flight,

478
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,783
the wonderful Peter Pan adventure,

479
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:52,484
you're able to collect pixie dust.

480
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:54,005
You're able to find hidden objects.

481
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:56,366
And you're able to even make Tinkerbell appear.

482
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:57,526
If you bring that over to Space Mountain,

483
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,207
you start landing spaceships and preparing for your flight

484
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:01,388
through outer space.

485
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,389
And pretty soon here, if you bring it

486
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,849
to Star Wars Galaxy's Edge.

487
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,851
Just as you step into that narrative,

488
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:09,752
your device steps into that narrative, too.

489
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:12,414
And it can become a Star Wars data pad that is, again,

490
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,775
your gateway to taking action.

491
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:17,517
You can join the Resistance and go on a mission,

492
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:20,619
or you might decide to align yourself with the First Order

493
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:21,800
and support their cause.

494
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,021
So in all of these, the story unfolds

495
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:26,943
because you take action.

496
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:32,386
Because you do something, because you act,

497
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,128
the world changes.

498
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:38,436
And that's the very definition of a protagonist.

499
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:41,119
The world, your experience of the world,

500
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,082
that story does not continue unless you do something.

501
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:47,646
Things don't happen to you, things happen because of you.

502
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:52,057
And so we took that idea and said, all right,

503
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:54,378
that's pretty exciting as a park.

504
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:58,440
What happens is park overlay in these little pockets

505
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,941
of discovery throughout the park.

506
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:06,264
How can we extend that to maybe a classic attraction?

507
00:23:06,264 --> 00:23:09,966
So as a pilot to try out what does this look like,

508
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:12,827
we launched the Haunted Mansion Ghost Post.

509
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:14,808
This was a small pilot to figure out

510
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:16,089
what does it look like for?

511
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:19,273
people who really want to be protagonists.

512
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,574
We haven't let you be a protagonist in that world.

513
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:24,756
You've been a visitor, a guest of the ghosts.

514
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:27,177
How can you, if you want to develop a relationship

515
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:29,199
with those ghosts, how can you have that

516
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,720
and actually help move their story forward?

517
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,281
So this is a pilot that we did.

518
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:38,304
It was, and it was really based around this promise

519
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:41,666
that our ghosts have been making for about half a century.

520
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,001
that a ghost will follow you home.

521
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:51,805
At the end of the attraction, there's this either promise

522
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,166
or threat, depending on your read,

523
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,687
how much you like ghosts, that a ghost will follow you home.

524
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,188
And so we said, well, what if the ghost's ability

525
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,450
to travel outside of the mansion was in jeopardy?

526
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,631
They don't know why, what's causing this,

527
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:07,532
but this is an existential crisis if you're a ghost

528
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:09,353
and you can't haunt people.

529
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:11,774
So if you care about ghosts.

530
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,839
That's going to be something you want to help solve.

531
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:20,163
So we created this serial narrative that arrived in the form of a series of boxes.

532
00:24:20,163 --> 00:24:24,946
And building on that subscription box model, our serial narrative,

533
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:27,148
each box was a chapter in that story.

534
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:33,478
and delivered a set of haunted objects that became,

535
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:36,099
as you open them, these aren't just stuff in a box.

536
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,000
These are props that as you play,

537
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,122
they allow you to unlock parts of the story,

538
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:47,243
advance the story, and actually help the ghosts restore

539
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:48,204
their ability to haunt.

540
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:52,745
And we're taking all of those moments,

541
00:24:52,745 --> 00:24:57,827
so these imaginary tips and tricks of illusion.

542
00:24:58,154 --> 00:25:00,075
There are things that reflect.

543
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:02,937
It's done with mirrors.

544
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:06,099
So we're using a lot of different imaginary things

545
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:08,760
to create these reveals, just like you're

546
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,142
seeing in the park with Agent P, and create those reveals

547
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:14,744
at home and allow you to discover those hidden

548
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:15,985
qualities of those objects.

549
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:21,608
You're literally revealing the ghost writing between the lines.

550
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,914
You're literally revealing the ghost writing between the lines.

551
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:36,618
You're creating that story and advancing how do we solve this problem.

552
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,981
And to do that, we do actually use your personal device.

553
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:47,124
We use a custom app and combine that with some of these objects to make a phantom radio.

554
00:25:47,124 --> 00:25:48,365
So this spirit radio.

555
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,881
can tune into the spectral qualities of all these objects.

556
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,882
And they actually create radio stations,

557
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:57,803
which become a radio play that you assemble

558
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:59,504
your own cardboard radio.

559
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:05,127
And without pairing it, there's an extra bat stanchion knob

560
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:07,548
that you can use to tune in that radio.

561
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:12,271
and actually be able to hear the voices of the ghosts talking to you.

562
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,532
So you're creating this relationship,

563
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,914
even though they can't travel to you physically or spectrally.

564
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,875
Not sure how that works as a ghost.

565
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,317
Even though they can't travel to you and haunt you at home,

566
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:25,339
they are talking to you and talking to you through the problem.

567
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:31,409
So when you go back to the park, because your phone has been part of your journey all along,

568
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:36,053
it's been interacting with all of these objects, it has your story state.

569
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,115
It knows where you are, what progress you've made.

570
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:44,260
And when you come back to the park, the audio on the attraction actually changed.

571
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,163
So you're no longer just a guest of the ghosts.

572
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:48,563
You are

573
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:52,427
you are actually, you're special to them.

574
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:55,050
You are somebody helping them solve a deep existential crisis.

575
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,334
So of course they know who you are and recognize you when you come through.

576
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:00,636
They're not showing you the ballroom for the first time.

577
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:05,242
You're returning to that ballroom as a friend, and eventually that ballroom

578
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:08,926
becomes a celebration for your restoring their ability to travel.

579
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,722
So in doing all of that, building that magic circle

580
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,723
to allow people to play together,

581
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:19,746
to give them that alibi to feel like they understand

582
00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:23,648
and can do all those silly things

583
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:26,950
within that circle of play,

584
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,152
the ability to have that discovery

585
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:32,313
and move the action along,

586
00:27:32,313 --> 00:27:34,855
be the protagonist in their story

587
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:35,875
and move the action forward.

588
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:42,444
Now, moving all that action forward, that's great.

589
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:45,348
That's pretty straightforward, unless you

590
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:47,751
have some challenges along the way.

591
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,614
You can't just walk into Mordor.

592
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:52,655
You've got to have some challenges.

593
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:55,338
This is the basis of the hero's journey.

594
00:27:55,338 --> 00:28:00,703
And who better at making challenges than game makers?

595
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:06,388
That loop of try, fail, succeed, you guys know what this is.

596
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,971
This is what games are made of.

597
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,220
And those games, it turns out, are an amazing way

598
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,682
to create a hero's journey, to create that challenge that

599
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:20,986
makes me feel accomplished, that gets me as a protagonist

600
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:25,129
from point A to point B. I have to try and fail

601
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:25,990
before I get there.

602
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,353
We didn't invent games, but we use a lot of mechanics

603
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:34,555
from them in our parks.

604
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:37,156
So we have your driving in Autopia.

605
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:43,740
As Brent took us through, you're exploring in adventure games.

606
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,021
And we have a lot of aiming games,

607
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:52,825
where you are using some sort of device

608
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:55,166
to influence things from afar.

609
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:55,246
So.

610
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:59,861
So that idea is actually really helpful.

611
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:02,484
We do it on, and it's super useful.

612
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:04,987
So we end up using it across a variety of attractions.

613
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:07,209
We got Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters,

614
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:10,753
where you're, we have Ant-Man and the Wasp,

615
00:29:10,753 --> 00:29:13,817
where you're shrinking down to the size of a nanoparticle

616
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:16,360
and taking part in this heroic battle.

617
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:22,183
We have Toy Story Mania, where you're going through

618
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:26,726
and playing these carnival games that your friends

619
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:28,226
from the Toy Story movies have set up.

620
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,367
And in all of these, that mechanic

621
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:33,189
of being able to influence things from far away

622
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,569
actually is super helpful

623
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:35,950
when you're building an environment.

624
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,932
The ability to touch things, to interface with things up close

625
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,592
is really exciting.

626
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:46,053
There are a bunch of illusions that we

627
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:49,054
can use if we control how close you can get to it,

628
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,455
and we can make that physical world come to life

629
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:55,176
in a really exciting, extraordinary way

630
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:56,476
that you can only do in person.

631
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:59,978
But the ability to influence that at the distance

632
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:02,338
really expands the possibility space.

633
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:07,551
In all of that, when you're making console games,

634
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:11,253
as let's say you're making a AAA title,

635
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:14,035
most of the things, there are a bunch of things

636
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:14,836
that you have to consider.

637
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:16,577
You're thinking about all your mechanics,

638
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:18,118
what is gonna go into the box,

639
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,479
how those mechanics link together,

640
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,220
how they build together for a story.

641
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,561
We're all thinking about the same thing.

642
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,496
What you're not thinking about is, well, most of you,

643
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:28,756
probably when you're making a game,

644
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:31,677
you're assuming that if you're making a AAA game that's

645
00:30:31,677 --> 00:30:34,117
going to take a few hours to play,

646
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:38,118
there's a place where somebody's going to need to sit down.

647
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:40,479
You don't really think or say that in,

648
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:43,359
that's not in the instructions, and certainly not in the box.

649
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:48,434
You just assume that they already have a place,

650
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:54,037
a way to display that game, a way to see what you've made,

651
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:54,938
and a way to interact.

652
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:58,540
That controller, you assume, is already there.

653
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,802
And for the most part, unless you're a launch title,

654
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:04,563
you're assuming that they've actually

655
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:05,944
used that controller before, have

656
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:08,165
some level of familiarity with it.

657
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:10,546
Now, when we're making experiences in

658
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:18,628
in our parks, when we're making these built experiences, all of those things you build.

659
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:23,610
You build how do I want you to be where you're interacting?

660
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,390
I'm going to build that.

661
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,211
If it's a place to sit, great.

662
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:28,651
If it's not, also got to build that.

663
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:35,334
It may not be a screen, but some way to see the results of my actions.

664
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:41,375
and that way to actually act upon those things.

665
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,796
You're actually responsible for building

666
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:46,558
all of those things.

667
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,379
So you're responsible for it,

668
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:51,320
but it also offers up some pretty cool potential.

669
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,721
Yes, so by way of example, we'll go back to Toy Story Mania.

670
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:56,141
And so in Toy Story Mania, again, you

671
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:57,182
can't take anything for granted.

672
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,102
We had to invent the place to sit, right?

673
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:01,883
That ride vehicle is a custom invention for Toy Story Mania.

674
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:05,044
It's a wind-up toy that you, because you've been shrunk down,

675
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:06,005
you're able to be in.

676
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:07,985
It's able to move through the environment.

677
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:09,186
It's able to spin around.

678
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:11,827
It's able to provide a bunch of physical thrill

679
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,128
before in between rounds of play.

680
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:18,769
We also invented the medium by which you're going to see these things.

681
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:23,051
And in the case of Midway Mini, it's actually a hybrid of physical space and virtual space,

682
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:28,493
where you're using a physical controller to interact with a virtual environment.

683
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:32,054
But even that controller is something that we got to invent.

684
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:33,375
We had to figure that out.

685
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:37,196
And while there's disadvantages to having to invent a brand-new interface,

686
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:41,477
most of you probably have dozens, if not hundreds, of hours logged

687
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:44,138
building muscle memory around your preferred system at home.

688
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:45,619
This one's going to be totally novel.

689
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:49,140
It also means that we get to design an interface that is

690
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,681
custom-tailored to the experience.

691
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:54,141
So where do we start with something like that?

692
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,982
Well, with MidwayMania, we actually start with a plethora

693
00:32:55,982 --> 00:32:58,903
of plywood prototypes trying to figure out the different

694
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:01,203
ways that guests might interact with that virtual

695
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:03,204
world using this physical controller.

696
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,305
And as you can see here, we tried a whole bunch of

697
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:06,625
different designs, right?

698
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,705
We tried things that had.

699
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:10,107
Cranks on top, almost like a gatling gun.

700
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:13,349
We had big smash pads on top where you physically hit it,

701
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:14,309
almost like a high striker.

702
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,230
We had levers that you could pull.

703
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,512
And with each one of these, we play tested.

704
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:19,853
We brought people in.

705
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:21,033
We tried it out.

706
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,975
And of course, what you discover is

707
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:24,195
that the interface and the game are

708
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:25,396
tightly married to one another.

709
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:27,557
When you have that sort of gatling action,

710
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:30,359
you go rapid fire, you need a vastly higher number

711
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,880
of targets on the screen.

712
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,321
Some of these interfaces take away from the feeling

713
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:35,942
that you're a toy having fun at a carnival

714
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:37,503
and start to feel like it's a weapon.

715
00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:38,104
Right?

716
00:33:38,104 --> 00:33:40,088
Start to feel like it's a more violent thing.

717
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:42,493
Some of these are easier for kids to use,

718
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:44,276
easier for adults to use.

719
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:46,220
And each of these need to be taken into consideration.

720
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:49,688
Now ultimately, we decided on the mock-up

721
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:50,768
that you see down there at the bottom.

722
00:33:50,768 --> 00:33:52,369
It's a pop action shooter.

723
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:53,849
And just to call out a couple features here,

724
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:55,869
the way that you actually fire this pop action shooter

725
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,850
is by pulling a little string on the back.

726
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,891
Right, it feels fun, it feels playful.

727
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:01,871
We spent a lot of time actually determining

728
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:04,632
what exactly it feels like to pull on that rope.

729
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:06,532
And what's great is that the interface presents itself

730
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:09,713
to you in the most intuitive way possible.

731
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,814
Right in front of you, there's a handle to aim it,

732
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:12,954
there's a string that you pull.

733
00:34:12,954 --> 00:34:14,154
The only instructions that you need to play

734
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:15,375
are pull the string to shoot.

735
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,115
One thing about that, though, you

736
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:18,836
have to be able to reach the string.

737
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:22,378
It turns out that if you are writing Midway Mania, an adult

738
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:25,159
and a child together, what is a comfortable distance

739
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,740
for an adult is out of reach for a child.

740
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,941
And what's a comfortable distance for a child

741
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,682
is way too close for an adult.

742
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:32,123
And so we actually had to do some engineering

743
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:34,284
to figure out the best way to get that interface

744
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:36,225
into the best ergonomic position.

745
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:37,745
And so in this case, we actually created

746
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:40,547
a mechanical linkage between the placement of the pop action

747
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:42,788
shooter and the lap bar that you pull down in order

748
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,068
to secure yourself into the seat.

749
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,851
So the smaller you are, the closer that pop action shooter becomes.

750
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,693
And the farther and the bigger you are,

751
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:53,056
the farther away it is, making it always very comfortable.

752
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,357
But that sort of gets into an interesting point, right?

753
00:34:55,357 --> 00:34:57,840
Since we're designing the entire environment,

754
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,741
this interface is just a little part of it.

755
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:02,944
What if the environment was the interface?

756
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:04,705
And this is, again, an idea that goes all the way back

757
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:06,086
to the beginning of the park with, you know,

758
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:07,788
experiences like Tom Sawyer's Island.

759
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:11,029
which nowadays has been made over into pirates' lair on Tom Sawyer's island.

760
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:16,472
What this is, this is a physical space full of challenges for our guests to overcome.

761
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:21,415
This is an island that's filled with crisscrossing, with a crisscrossing network of pathways,

762
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:23,756
each pathway with its own unique challenge.

763
00:35:23,756 --> 00:35:27,798
Some are creepy caverns, some are, you know, swinging suspension bridges.

764
00:35:27,798 --> 00:35:31,780
We have nice buoyant bridges that go across the lagoon.

765
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,021
And each one of these provides you an opportunity to sort of put yourself to the test.

766
00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:37,282
But of course, what's challenging for one person

767
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:38,663
is trivial for another.

768
00:35:38,663 --> 00:35:39,723
It'd be great if there was some way

769
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,404
that you could modulate that challenge.

770
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:44,165
And we actually did that in Camp Discovery,

771
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:47,107
which is a new experience out in Shanghai, Disneyland.

772
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:49,047
This is a set of adventure courses

773
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,948
built into the side of this mountain,

774
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,189
where guests, as you can see here, actually clip off.

775
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:54,890
You're in a one-person ride vehicle.

776
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,851
It's a harness that you wear that allows you

777
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,692
to perform death-defying stunts

778
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:01,193
while still being totally safe.

779
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:03,115
And what's really cool about this

780
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:06,719
is that at every step along the way, every vertigo-inducing

781
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,522
step along the way, you actually have a choice to make.

782
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:12,326
You can decide exactly how much challenge you want.

783
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:14,428
So for example, if the vertigo is setting in

784
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:15,610
and you're a little bit nervous, you

785
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,891
can take that path to the left.

786
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:19,034
If you want to put yourself a little bit more to the test,

787
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:21,557
you can take those swinging barrels in the center.

788
00:36:21,957 --> 00:36:25,720
And if you're really feeling brave, if you really want to go ahead and test your mettle,

789
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,283
you can take those swinging logs on the right.

790
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:32,966
And as you go through these challenge trails, you're constantly given new opportunities

791
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:33,847
to challenge yourself.

792
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:36,794
So again, we know we're preaching to the choir

793
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,015
here in terms of talking about the importance of challenge.

794
00:36:39,015 --> 00:36:41,637
But there is something, again, just like we were talking

795
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:42,937
about with adventure games, there's

796
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:46,879
something very special when you take that try, fail, succeed

797
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:49,641
loop and bring it away from the pixels and into physical space.

798
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,162
And especially when the interface disappears,

799
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:55,264
suddenly that triumph isn't an abstract triumph.

800
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:56,404
It's a personal triumph.

801
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:59,586
It's a social triumph that you are succeeding in real space

802
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:00,786
with people that you know and love.

803
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,268
And that makes the moment all that much more special.

804
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:07,205
And so again, to recap here, challenges

805
00:37:07,205 --> 00:37:08,306
are the hero's journey.

806
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:10,326
They're critical to making you feel like you're

807
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:12,027
growing and evolving.

808
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:14,427
There's immense benefit when you can

809
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:16,308
build the game and the interface together.

810
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:19,649
It allows you to dovetail those two things in a way that is

811
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:21,829
more than the sum of either of their parts.

812
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:23,190
And when you do it really well, the world

813
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,850
becomes the interface itself.

814
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,031
And people are feeling a personal sense of challenge

815
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:29,871
unencumbered by any sort of interface.

816
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:35,249
So you're able to overcome some challenges.

817
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:37,729
You are on your hero's journey.

818
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:39,530
I think we're gonna need some friends.

819
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:39,930
Absolutely.

820
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,570
So let's make some friends.

821
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,991
Characters have been at the center

822
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:50,473
of Disney Parks experiences since the first day.

823
00:37:50,473 --> 00:37:53,854
And building relationships, it turns out,

824
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,195
when you see a character on screen,

825
00:37:57,127 --> 00:37:58,868
you're making that relationship in your mind.

826
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:01,548
When you meet them in the real world,

827
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:03,749
that character can see you

828
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:07,850
and you can feel seen by that character,

829
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,151
which is super powerful.

830
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:13,672
Being able to meet your heroes is part of our foundation

831
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:16,933
and getting that experience of I can actually.

832
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:25,118
I can actually hug Mickey, have that tactile moment of friendship.

833
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:32,304
So that's super powerful and foundational, something the early Imagineers figured out

834
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:33,325
way early.

835
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:39,811
It turns out we actually have a really wide variety of characters, and not all of them

836
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:42,674
are as comfortable walking down Main Street as Mickey is.

837
00:38:43,474 --> 00:38:48,739
So let's take, for instance, Crush from Finding Nemo

838
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:49,700
and Finding Dory.

839
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,564
He's not super comfortable walking down Main Street.

840
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,407
In fact, he's way happier to swim in the ocean.

841
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:59,149
So we made a little window to the ocean

842
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:02,513
and actually invite our guests in to have

843
00:39:02,513 --> 00:39:05,015
a conversation with Crush as part of the show

844
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:06,396
Turtle Talk with Crush.

845
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:11,440
And in this show, you are actually just having a conversation.

846
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,246
Crush is a super curious guy, and it turns out kids are also pretty curious creatures

847
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:20,728
themselves, so they get along really well.

848
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:27,133
He can ask them questions, they can ask him questions, and the show evolves based on what

849
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:27,934
everybody is curious about.

850
00:39:29,282 --> 00:39:33,003
So Crush shares a little bit of his life on the reef,

851
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,864
and that allows you to create this relationship

852
00:39:35,864 --> 00:39:39,445
with the character with a little bit of added technology

853
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:40,965
to bring that to life.

854
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:44,707
Now, to extend the work of other characters

855
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:49,068
that are really tough to bring to life,

856
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:51,009
when we want to bring them off the screen,

857
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:52,229
how do we do that?

858
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:56,032
We have extended our work in audio animatronics,

859
00:39:56,032 --> 00:39:58,294
that you saw earlier, into automatronics.

860
00:39:58,294 --> 00:40:00,076
And what do I mean by that?

861
00:40:00,076 --> 00:40:04,340
Well, we have some characters who also are a little,

862
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:09,384
who also want to roll around and move their less,

863
00:40:09,725 --> 00:40:15,348
able to, they're less Nikki sized, so how are we going to get them to move around?

864
00:40:15,348 --> 00:40:19,130
Well, we want them to be able to do that autonomously. We don't want to have them

865
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,033
bolted down to a show, bolted down in a show building. And so developing a little bit of

866
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:29,156
extra technology to allow them both to navigate safely, but enough to understand their environment

867
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:35,480
so that all of those relationships, that ability to respond to somebody when they're rolling,

868
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,781
when he's rolling around.

869
00:40:37,862 --> 00:40:42,409
out in Tomorrowland, he can go by and actually...

870
00:40:44,004 --> 00:40:49,066
Because he's aware of the world around him, just like all of us, he can actually clock

871
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:54,648
that person over there, and as he's rolling past, make eye contact, and maybe even get

872
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:55,668
curious enough to go over.

873
00:40:55,668 --> 00:41:01,970
Of course, because of that eye contact, that's an invitation now for our guests to interact

874
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,411
with him, too.

875
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:09,973
So all of that is really special in ways that we are giving our characters the ability to

876
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:12,714
have a relationship and see our guests.

877
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,572
So now I want to pull a lot of the things

878
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:18,494
we've been talking about together into one example.

879
00:41:18,494 --> 00:41:19,975
We have an attraction out in Florida

880
00:41:19,975 --> 00:41:21,655
called Enchanted Tales with Belle.

881
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:24,377
This is at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World.

882
00:41:24,377 --> 00:41:27,398
That really employs a lot of the tactics

883
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:29,199
that we've been talking about so far

884
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,920
to create that deep relationship with the character.

885
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,381
We're going to cast you in a role.

886
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:34,762
We're going to let you overcome some challenges.

887
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:35,762
Of course, we're going to be using

888
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:37,583
some technology along the way.

889
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,184
And in this experience, you're actually

890
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:41,865
coming to help Belle celebrate her anniversary

891
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:42,325
with the Beast.

892
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:47,695
And as such, we're actually going to be helping to retell the story of the day that she met

893
00:41:47,695 --> 00:41:52,564
the Beast, and again, like I said, put a lot of these tactics into play.

894
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:55,730
So for example, the first room that you move into is not only in...

895
00:41:56,462 --> 00:42:01,147
inhabited. It's not only a moving living world, but it's a world where you actually get explicitly

896
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:05,450
cast a role. You get to determine what part in that story you want to play. You can be

897
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,735
everything from a suit of armor to enchanted dishware to the beast themselves. You can

898
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:14,779
see the kid wearing the red cape, usually the most adorable kid in the crowd, but honestly

899
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:18,502
it works with everybody. You know, gets to be the beast in this retelling of the story.

900
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:22,546
We move into another room where we have our director, Lumiere,

901
00:42:22,546 --> 00:42:25,668
who again is another enchanted object come to life

902
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,611
that's able to choreograph some of this action

903
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:30,432
and help us put on this production.

904
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:33,815
And then of course, the star of the show herself, Belle.

905
00:42:33,815 --> 00:42:36,858
And Belle leads all of these kids in this interaction

906
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:40,020
where we all become a part of the retelling of this story.

907
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:42,963
And we were talking a moment ago about challenges,

908
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:44,024
overcoming challenges.

909
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:45,706
And we talked about games.

910
00:42:45,706 --> 00:42:49,309
But performance is a form of challenge too, right?

911
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:52,252
And this is sort of a uniquely social form of challenge, right?

912
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:53,753
That for a lot of these people, this

913
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:55,395
is probably their first time really getting up

914
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:58,358
and performing in front of other people, right?

915
00:42:58,358 --> 00:42:59,359
But doing that.

916
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,040
is an act of bravery, right?

917
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,940
It's an act of connection.

918
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,882
You're helping create a special moment for Belle.

919
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,083
And so when Belle is able to hug you

920
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:10,925
at the end of that experience, you've earned that hug, right?

921
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:14,506
You have not just met her, you have actually helped her.

922
00:43:14,506 --> 00:43:16,107
You have warmed her heart.

923
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:19,068
And she can recognize you not just as a friend,

924
00:43:19,068 --> 00:43:21,570
but as someone who has collaborated with her

925
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,791
and is a deep, meaningful friend.

926
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:26,868
And so again, we've known this from day one.

927
00:43:26,868 --> 00:43:29,270
There's power in connection.

928
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,992
And connection really comes from not only seeing that character,

929
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:34,794
but being seen and being recognized by that character.

930
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:36,556
And when you combine it with all the things

931
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:38,818
that we've talked about before, there's

932
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:40,819
incredible power when you feel like you've

933
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:43,361
earned that connection and really, really

934
00:43:43,361 --> 00:43:45,183
made that friend in a new way.

935
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,625
We get into, we've made all these friends,

936
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,726
we've combined all of these things,

937
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:58,527
and really one of the amazing opportunities

938
00:43:58,527 --> 00:44:02,028
in building the world, building the world from scratch,

939
00:44:02,028 --> 00:44:06,890
means that we can go after those aspirational moments,

940
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:13,731
those moments that I see on screen and I go, I want that.

941
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:15,433
That thing, I want that.

942
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:18,518
Then we were going back to the car commercial

943
00:44:18,518 --> 00:44:20,701
of you're having the moment of,

944
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:24,266
that just looks like it would feel amazing.

945
00:44:24,266 --> 00:44:28,252
And it's that feel amazing that we're going after.

946
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:29,053
So how do we?

947
00:44:30,054 --> 00:44:31,455
bring that magic to life.

948
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:35,456
We're engaging all of the senses to make that magic real,

949
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:37,097
to make it feel amazing.

950
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:41,399
And that feeling of flight, those aspirational feelings.

951
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:45,220
So it's about sensation.

952
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:45,861
It's about haptics.

953
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:47,081
It's about touch.

954
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:51,423
It's about how do I, the thing that I saw on screen

955
00:44:51,423 --> 00:44:53,864
that looked cool, how does it feel?

956
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:58,735
Now, this section, I'm going to warn you,

957
00:44:58,735 --> 00:45:01,096
when you're talking about all the senses,

958
00:45:01,096 --> 00:45:05,438
keynote actually is a really, a slide talk,

959
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:10,120
is a really hard thing to do to communicate all the senses.

960
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,481
So you're going to have to use a little bit more imagination

961
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:17,082
for this section of the talk as we go through,

962
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:20,104
because we haven't invented the scratch and sniff slide deck

963
00:45:20,104 --> 00:45:20,184
yet.

964
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:20,544
Not yet.

965
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:29,113
working on it. So in Peter Pan this is an opening day attraction and we're starting to get into

966
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:34,098
this. We're using a little bit of forced perspective to give you that sensation of

967
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:39,924
flying over London and in fact that perspective that we have.

968
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:44,446
of flying over it, and you're seeing it underneath you.

969
00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:47,488
That's part of the aspirational experience of flying.

970
00:45:47,488 --> 00:45:49,768
The non-aspirational experience of flying

971
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:52,049
of I'm in a metal tube, I'm looking out the window

972
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,291
and seeing the clouds pass by, I am a passenger.

973
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:58,232
If I am flying, I am looking down,

974
00:45:58,232 --> 00:46:01,233
I have the world spreading out underneath me.

975
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:04,634
And so we continued that into Soarin' Around the World.

976
00:46:05,455 --> 00:46:11,698
in which you are gliding through all of these epic locations

977
00:46:11,698 --> 00:46:12,919
around the world.

978
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:15,540
And we're literally lifting your feet off the ground.

979
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,321
Your feet are dangling.

980
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:20,343
And we've added movement to this.

981
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:25,486
So we're lifting you up and pushing you into and moving

982
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:27,847
with those images.

983
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:30,088
As that scene unfolds around you,

984
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:31,949
you're crossing on top of Everest.

985
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:37,784
and flying, you feel the wind in your hair,

986
00:46:37,784 --> 00:46:41,946
the sway of the wind as it catches you as you bank around,

987
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:47,248
and you smell the ocean, the orange groves,

988
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:50,349
my personal favorite, as you're flying through,

989
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,529
we activate all of your senses.

990
00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:54,830
And taking that activation one step further,

991
00:46:56,171 --> 00:47:00,793
In Avatar Flight of Passage in Pandora,

992
00:47:00,793 --> 00:47:04,315
which we opened as part of Disney's Animal Kingdom

993
00:47:04,315 --> 00:47:08,877
in Florida, you are able to mount and ride

994
00:47:08,877 --> 00:47:11,459
on one of those banshees.

995
00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:14,800
So these are those dragons from the Avatar films,

996
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,101
kind of dragon-y creatures.

997
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:17,082
They can fly.

998
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:19,143
They're super cantankerous.

999
00:47:19,143 --> 00:47:19,923
You've got to earn it.

1000
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:23,661
And you're creating a relationship with this thing.

1001
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:27,924
So we take all of what's working well in Soarin,

1002
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:32,808
we're taking that motion, we're moving you with this image,

1003
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,070
we're wrapping that image around you

1004
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,592
as you're flying through,

1005
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:39,394
bringing it into three dimensions,

1006
00:47:39,394 --> 00:47:43,377
and we're also activating your senses.

1007
00:47:43,377 --> 00:47:45,499
So you're feeling that sea breeze,

1008
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:45,919
but you're also...

1009
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,136
feeling that Banshee breathe underneath you,

1010
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:51,042
because it's not just you flying,

1011
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:54,633
you're flying with your new friend, the Banshee.

1012
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:54,693
Now.

1013
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:58,097
We have some other aspirational things

1014
00:47:58,097 --> 00:48:02,498
that we're about to open, Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, which

1015
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:08,999
I have been waiting to step into that world

1016
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:12,760
that I've seen on screen since I was a small child.

1017
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,481
And so what could be more aspirational?

1018
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:21,002
We can get to drink some blue milk, step into that world,

1019
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:24,122
smell the smells, see all the sights,

1020
00:48:25,623 --> 00:48:27,104
It's going to be very exciting.

1021
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,826
And what more aspirational thing in there

1022
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:35,010
when we talk about flying, but flying the Millennium Falcon?

1023
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,352
So you are going to get to step into the cockpit.

1024
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:56,471
Just a little teaser.

1025
00:48:56,471 --> 00:49:00,058
So in all of this, when you step into that cockpit,

1026
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:02,783
you have been given a very clear role.

1027
00:49:02,783 --> 00:49:05,688
You are the new Millennium Falcon pilot.

1028
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:11,773
And with that role, you are engaging the whole environment.

1029
00:49:11,773 --> 00:49:15,077
That environment is actually responding to what you do.

1030
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,939
Those lights blink.

1031
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:19,902
That hyperspace lever goes.

1032
00:49:19,902 --> 00:49:22,885
You're overcoming a bunch of challenges

1033
00:49:22,885 --> 00:49:24,427
and moving the action forward.

1034
00:49:25,225 --> 00:49:28,087
as you're going through, so you are,

1035
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:30,169
the reason why you go to light speed

1036
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:32,570
is because you pull that lever.

1037
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,192
You're in charge of hitting those buttons,

1038
00:49:35,192 --> 00:49:37,193
targeting those tie fighters,

1039
00:49:37,193 --> 00:49:40,255
and making sure that you get through,

1040
00:49:40,255 --> 00:49:42,437
that you move that action forward.

1041
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:46,019
And you're building relationships along the way.

1042
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:51,319
depending on what shape you get that Millennium Falcon back,

1043
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:53,380
that's going to matter as well.

1044
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,421
And so your friends might respond a little differently,

1045
00:49:57,421 --> 00:50:01,022
depending on how you handled yourself as a pilot.

1046
00:50:01,022 --> 00:50:04,304
And all of this bringing together

1047
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:07,365
the wish and the dream of being able to fly

1048
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:08,065
the Millennium Falcon.

1049
00:50:08,065 --> 00:50:08,125
So.

1050
00:50:11,158 --> 00:50:12,579
We've sort of done exactly what we were saying.

1051
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:14,881
We're building this experience from the inside out, right?

1052
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:17,403
Starting with that role, putting you in the world,

1053
00:50:17,403 --> 00:50:19,905
and really figuring out how we put you in the movie, right?

1054
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:22,667
And these are all wonderful tips and techniques

1055
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:25,009
that we've figured out along the way to put you in the movie.

1056
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:27,210
But it turns out that there's one additional wrinkle.

1057
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,412
It's not just about putting you in the movie.

1058
00:50:29,412 --> 00:50:32,314
It's about putting all of you in the movie together.

1059
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,156
These are family experiences.

1060
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:38,097
These are experiences that you want to share

1061
00:50:38,097 --> 00:50:40,317
with your loved ones, with your friends.

1062
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:42,638
It turns out that people don't just come to the park

1063
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:45,839
for the attractions, they come to the parks to be together.

1064
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,340
They come to the parks to connect with people

1065
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,200
that they love.

1066
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,481
When you're exploring a fantasy world,

1067
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,082
a place that you've never seen before,

1068
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,362
it levels the playing field between adults and children

1069
00:50:54,362 --> 00:50:56,583
and you're able to experience awe together.

1070
00:50:57,184 --> 00:51:00,286
When you wear a silly hat, it's not just a fashion choice.

1071
00:51:00,286 --> 00:51:01,847
It is that alibi to play.

1072
00:51:01,847 --> 00:51:04,388
It is that opportunity for an adult

1073
00:51:04,388 --> 00:51:05,889
to engage with their children in a way

1074
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:08,911
that they may not even do in their own living rooms.

1075
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:11,413
When you overcome challenges together,

1076
00:51:11,413 --> 00:51:13,495
when you share a meal together.

1077
00:51:13,895 --> 00:51:17,977
when you play together, what we're doing is we're creating indelible memories, right?

1078
00:51:17,977 --> 00:51:22,280
We're creating experiences that people are going to carry with them for the rest of their life.

1079
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,783
And that's tremendously impactful. It's powerful that these places and that these experiences

1080
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:32,906
can actually bring people together. And that power is one of the reasons that I come to work every day

1081
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:36,888
is that ability through these experiences, that power to bring people together.

1082
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:37,289
And with great power.

1083
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:42,870
comes great responsibility.

1084
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,271
Because we have the responsibility

1085
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,872
to build that world.

1086
00:51:46,872 --> 00:51:48,152
And that's really why we're here today.

1087
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:54,595
Because what we have discovered over the last 65 years

1088
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:58,157
of figuring out how do we put you in the movie

1089
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:02,359
is that it takes more than just some filmmakers.

1090
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:06,101
To put guests in the movie, you need more than movie makers.

1091
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:10,236
You need a whole range of skills.

1092
00:52:10,236 --> 00:52:14,001
And those skills are bringing that world into dimensions,

1093
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:16,363
bringing that world to life.

1094
00:52:16,363 --> 00:52:20,769
You need roboticists and those same powers of animation

1095
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:24,293
that bring animated worlds on screen.

1096
00:52:24,293 --> 00:52:25,554
Those characters live.

1097
00:52:26,155 --> 00:52:27,496
with that power of animation.

1098
00:52:27,496 --> 00:52:29,797
You need storytellers who understand

1099
00:52:29,797 --> 00:52:34,521
how to build a space for the guest inside of that world,

1100
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:36,522
that they have that storytellers who

1101
00:52:36,522 --> 00:52:42,206
build that story around our new protagonist, the guest.

1102
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:45,189
How to create those special effects and illusions.

1103
00:52:45,189 --> 00:52:48,611
And you maybe need some people who

1104
00:52:48,611 --> 00:52:52,694
are willing to move mountains or even build them if necessary.

1105
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:53,475
You need.

1106
00:52:54,663 --> 00:52:57,126
and being able to bring those to life,

1107
00:52:57,126 --> 00:53:02,252
to activate those surfaces and use them

1108
00:53:02,252 --> 00:53:04,936
to tell an infinite variety of responsive stories.

1109
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:06,878
And of course, the people to take it together

1110
00:53:06,878 --> 00:53:08,080
into the field.

1111
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,600
And.

1112
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:13,683
As you've probably noticed, a lot of these things

1113
00:53:13,683 --> 00:53:16,064
have to do with games.

1114
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:19,645
And the qualities that make games so evocative

1115
00:53:19,645 --> 00:53:24,527
and keep us playing are also the qualities

1116
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:28,228
that make our guest experience possible, that

1117
00:53:28,228 --> 00:53:31,289
make you the protagonist in the world, that

1118
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:35,351
keep the world responding to you, give you challenges,

1119
00:53:35,351 --> 00:53:38,252
and ultimately turn into that wish fulfillment.

1120
00:53:38,852 --> 00:53:40,133
So thank you all for joining us.

1121
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:40,554
Thank you.

1122
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:52,783
Thank you.

1123
00:53:52,783 --> 00:54:00,949
So we have a little bit of time in this room for questions.

1124
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:05,393
We're going to go ahead and take a couple of questions now,

1125
00:54:05,393 --> 00:54:07,774
and we'll hang out afterwards.

1126
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:11,605
We went almost to the time limit.

1127
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:14,587
So we'll just take a couple questions, but we'll hang out.

1128
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:17,890
And if you need to find us, we can be found over on the Overlook as well.

1129
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,021
Cool, thanks for the talk, really appreciate it.

1130
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:24,623
Can we bring up the house lights a little bit?

1131
00:54:24,623 --> 00:54:27,144
There's a lot of really fantastic examples

1132
00:54:27,144 --> 00:54:29,805
of people having individual agency

1133
00:54:29,805 --> 00:54:31,366
as they're interacting with the park,

1134
00:54:31,366 --> 00:54:33,647
and you're in a unique position to have

1135
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:37,269
multiple physical people in the same space.

1136
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:39,810
So I'm curious, I'm glad that you mentioned

1137
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,571
bringing them together and showed the example

1138
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:42,871
of the beauty and the beast.

1139
00:54:43,432 --> 00:54:49,058
How does having multiple people in a space shape the way that you think about cooperative gameplay?

1140
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:56,486
And what are the challenges and considerations that you have to balance between having emergent behavior and emergent gameplay

1141
00:54:56,486 --> 00:55:00,591
with making sure that experiences are contained?

1142
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:03,033
Yeah, that's a great question.

1143
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,235
I mean, talking about how we use cooperative gameplay.

1144
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,397
I mean, that is really at the core of everything

1145
00:55:07,397 --> 00:55:09,600
that we're doing is that idea of co-op, right?

1146
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,142
We recognize that almost nobody comes to the park alone.

1147
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,383
You're there with your friends.

1148
00:55:13,383 --> 00:55:14,304
You're there with your loved ones.

1149
00:55:14,304 --> 00:55:16,986
And yes, you are surrounded by lots of other people.

1150
00:55:16,986 --> 00:55:19,989
And so we always look for experiences that,

1151
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:22,151
while there might still be some elements of competition,

1152
00:55:22,151 --> 00:55:24,413
that there's also some elements of teamwork.

1153
00:55:24,814 --> 00:55:28,457
And going back to Toy Story Mania as an example,

1154
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:30,960
the best way to get the high score on that,

1155
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,022
I'm going to give a little tip to everyone in the audience,

1156
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:34,684
is not to compete with your friend,

1157
00:55:34,684 --> 00:55:36,325
but to actually work with your friend.

1158
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:39,649
There are tons of Easter eggs and hidden targets

1159
00:55:39,649 --> 00:55:42,011
inside of that experience that can only be unlocked.

1160
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:47,194
if two of you are working together, hitting tyrants simultaneously,

1161
00:55:47,194 --> 00:55:50,675
using your powers combined in order to reveal extra magic.

1162
00:55:50,675 --> 00:55:52,136
And that's how we sort of get that idea,

1163
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:54,117
even in that very competitive head-to-head experience,

1164
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,478
a little bit of that coopetition.

1165
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,619
And as you mentioned, we're always looking for a way

1166
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:01,040
to embrace the fact that there's a crowd of people

1167
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,982
and to give you an opportunity to take the stage

1168
00:56:03,982 --> 00:56:05,202
and to be at the center of the action.

1169
00:56:09,152 --> 00:56:10,753
My question is...

1170
00:56:10,753 --> 00:56:11,293
Oh, sorry.

1171
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:11,593
You want to go?

1172
00:56:11,593 --> 00:56:11,974
Oh, should I go?

1173
00:56:11,974 --> 00:56:12,834
Oh, okay.

1174
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:13,215
Sure.

1175
00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:14,516
We'll alternate.

1176
00:56:14,516 --> 00:56:15,396
Okay.

1177
00:56:15,396 --> 00:56:20,680
I attended a bunch of awesome talks this week about designing for color blindness, adaptive

1178
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:26,104
controllers, subtitles, and I'm curious what the Disney Imagineering approach is when it

1179
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:31,628
comes to designing for all of the senses to make sure that anyone who goes to the theme

1180
00:56:31,628 --> 00:56:35,851
parks or has any Disney experience is able to have a good time as well.

1181
00:56:36,283 --> 00:56:43,467
Absolutely. Accessibility and these experiences are for everyone. We have an incredibly broad

1182
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:50,971
audience. So in all of the, you saw the development of that control, the midway mania.

1183
00:56:51,771 --> 00:56:58,275
We look towards certainly colorblind, but also the ability to, you don't want to assume

1184
00:56:58,275 --> 00:56:59,275
the ability to grip.

1185
00:56:59,275 --> 00:57:05,499
We want to reach a widest possible audience, so you can use that controller with, you don't

1186
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:09,181
have to use opposable thumbs to use that controller.

1187
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:11,062
So we have a set of guidelines.

1188
00:57:11,062 --> 00:57:14,244
We work with a ton of folks who are really...

1189
00:57:15,404 --> 00:57:19,986
very talented at looking at accessibility across a variety of categories.

1190
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:24,408
And it means inventing what that accessible thing is for each experience.

1191
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:29,870
How do you create that experience that when you are engaging the senses

1192
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,851
that can communicate to that wide audience?

1193
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:34,711
And it's really a case by case basis, but

1194
00:57:34,711 --> 00:57:36,752
it's something we think about all the time.

1195
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:38,914
And actually, one of the interesting things about that

1196
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:42,857
is that the process of designing to engage all the senses,

1197
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:46,279
in and of itself, makes the experience more accessible.

1198
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:49,902
I mean, you may not be able to see the visuals on the screen,

1199
00:57:49,902 --> 00:57:52,043
but that doesn't prevent you from feeling the motion,

1200
00:57:52,043 --> 00:57:54,465
from feeling the breeze, from smelling the smells.

1201
00:57:54,465 --> 00:57:56,086
That can still be an adventure.

1202
00:57:56,787 --> 00:57:57,928
even if you don't see the visuals.

1203
00:57:57,928 --> 00:57:59,629
And likewise, you may not be able to hear it,

1204
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:01,471
but there's a lot to see, there's a lot to feel.

1205
00:58:01,471 --> 00:58:04,514
And so a lot of times, yes, we are taking into account

1206
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,295
every time we design an interface how

1207
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:08,757
to make that interface available to everybody.

1208
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:10,139
But part of that is just designing

1209
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:11,920
multisensory experiences to begin with.

1210
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,100
Thank you.

1211
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:12,681
Thank you.

1212
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,921
My question is around personalization at scale.

1213
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:20,943
I did one of the beta tests of an immersive experience at

1214
00:58:20,943 --> 00:58:23,443
Walt Disney Resort a couple years ago with my sister.

1215
00:58:23,443 --> 00:58:24,784
And it was one of my favorites.

1216
00:58:24,784 --> 00:58:27,965
But obviously, that takes away time from other people.

1217
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:30,906
So how do you balance having these extremely personalized

1218
00:58:30,906 --> 00:58:35,147
experiences or even smaller seating arrangements so that

1219
00:58:35,147 --> 00:58:37,288
people can feel more intimate and more like they're actually

1220
00:58:37,288 --> 00:58:40,329
riding the Millennium Falcon versus getting a lot of people

1221
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:41,629
through experience in a day?

1222
00:58:42,682 --> 00:58:47,684
That is something we, in terms of that game design loop

1223
00:58:47,684 --> 00:58:51,146
of I want to try, fail, succeed, having that,

1224
00:58:51,146 --> 00:58:53,507
having the responsiveness and balancing that

1225
00:58:53,507 --> 00:58:58,049
with the scale of how many people we are entertaining.

1226
00:58:58,049 --> 00:58:58,709
We have

1227
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,251
A lot of ways, we have a lot of ways to go after that.

1228
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,352
One of the ones that we mentioned in the talk,

1229
00:59:04,352 --> 00:59:06,312
we talked about Ghostpost.

1230
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:11,974
That actually allows you to continue that story at home

1231
00:59:11,974 --> 00:59:16,836
and keeping that story to having different levels

1232
00:59:16,836 --> 00:59:17,417
of interaction.

1233
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:19,717
So for Parks Play app, you're getting,

1234
00:59:19,717 --> 00:59:21,898
everything is very responsive

1235
00:59:21,898 --> 00:59:24,819
and using the environment strategically

1236
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:26,860
to pay off for those larger payoffs.

1237
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,344
so that we can do that at scale and handle

1238
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:35,946
the amount of people who want to play and interact.

1239
00:59:35,946 --> 00:59:38,828
Ghost Post has a wonderful version of that, too,

1240
00:59:38,828 --> 00:59:40,889
which is context, right?

1241
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:42,450
The fact that when you play Ghost Post,

1242
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,151
you're still writing the same haunted mansion

1243
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:44,772
as everyone else.

1244
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:47,333
But because you have this deeper connection,

1245
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,015
because you have this insight into the world,

1246
00:59:50,015 --> 00:59:52,357
you see different details in that environment

1247
00:59:52,357 --> 00:59:53,157
than other people do.

1248
00:59:53,597 --> 00:59:55,660
What you talk about is definitely a challenge that we confront.

1249
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,283
We have a whole bag of tricks to do it.

1250
00:59:58,283 --> 01:00:01,567
But one of those is definitely thinking about how do we extend the time, how do we deliver

1251
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:06,212
personalized messages, the personal devices and things like the Parks Play app.

1252
01:00:06,212 --> 01:00:10,197
All of these are techniques to sort of give each of us our own unique experience within

1253
01:00:10,197 --> 01:00:11,198
this shared environment.

1254
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:17,693
Hi, when approaching the process and problems that you talked about today,

1255
01:00:17,693 --> 01:00:22,119
how do you maintain the perspective and lens through which a kid sees the world

1256
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,221
a lot of us, all of us lose as we go older?

1257
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:28,647
Like, how do you know the experiences are going to be received as intended by a kid?

1258
01:00:29,665 --> 01:00:33,887
So this is in the perspective setting of literally

1259
01:00:33,887 --> 01:00:37,268
understanding what do kids see out of this experience.

1260
01:00:37,268 --> 01:00:42,110
I have been in Imagineering about a third of the time

1261
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:42,710
that Brent has.

1262
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:47,653
And so had the experience of, never had the experience

1263
01:00:47,653 --> 01:00:48,593
of the parks as a child.

1264
01:00:48,593 --> 01:00:51,554
A colleague said, all right.

1265
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:53,944
We're going to judge this.

1266
01:00:53,944 --> 01:00:55,805
We're going to put you on a rolly chair,

1267
01:00:55,805 --> 01:00:57,466
and you're going to roll through this

1268
01:00:57,466 --> 01:01:02,928
and look at what does somebody who is waist high, what

1269
01:01:02,928 --> 01:01:04,729
do they understand in this world?

1270
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:07,530
And so seeing, well.

1271
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:11,033
Sometimes you see a lot of crowds of legs.

1272
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:14,236
So bringing those details down to extending them

1273
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:17,019
all the way down to the floor, understanding

1274
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:19,801
what that experience is like.

1275
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:24,265
I like to borrow as many families and friends

1276
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:26,728
that I can and go to the park with them

1277
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:30,972
to be able to understand what is their experience of going

1278
01:01:30,972 --> 01:01:31,552
to the parks.

1279
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:37,214
So that empathy as a designer is really important

1280
01:01:37,214 --> 01:01:43,316
and it is all too easy to lose track of

1281
01:01:43,316 --> 01:01:46,337
this is the experience for me.

1282
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:49,078
You have to play in the, we play test constantly

1283
01:01:49,078 --> 01:01:52,499
to better understand our test, our assumptions

1284
01:01:52,499 --> 01:01:55,260
about what do you understand, what do you know,

1285
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,761
how do you interact, and try to look at it

1286
01:01:58,761 --> 01:02:01,842
through the eyes of our guests in all their variety.

1287
01:02:03,022 --> 01:02:03,302
Thank you.

1288
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:03,943
Hi there.

1289
01:02:03,943 --> 01:02:06,425
Oh, I think they cut us off.

1290
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:06,585
Hello.

1291
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:14,034
Oh, in the case of a lot of my favorite games, I had to lose a lot before I could win.

1292
01:02:14,034 --> 01:02:20,340
Do you think it's possible to have a satisfying theme park attraction that actually ends in

1293
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,281
loss or failure?

1294
01:02:22,356 --> 01:02:27,603
Yeah, well, you know, yes.

1295
01:02:27,603 --> 01:02:29,665
But I think that that is defined differently, right?

1296
01:02:29,665 --> 01:02:31,387
I mean, I think that we always want you to have a good time.

1297
01:02:31,387 --> 01:02:33,390
I mean, the reason that you kept playing that game

1298
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,412
is not just because it was challenging,

1299
01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:37,995
but because the challenge was a fun challenge, right?

1300
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:40,837
And I think that within the context of our parks,

1301
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:42,778
we need to account for guests who

1302
01:02:42,778 --> 01:02:45,940
are going to be able to ride that ride hundreds of times,

1303
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,321
as well as people for whom that experience might be a once

1304
01:02:48,321 --> 01:02:49,741
in a lifetime experience.

1305
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:50,982
And so we're always looking at, how

1306
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:53,703
do we make sure that it's fun the first time you play it?

1307
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:56,505
And how do we make sure that it's still fun the hundredth

1308
01:02:56,505 --> 01:02:57,585
time you've gone through it?

1309
01:02:57,965 --> 01:03:01,188
And so a lot of the times we look at sort of variable success

1310
01:03:01,188 --> 01:03:04,970
more than digital decisions of failure and success.

1311
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,672
An example, going back to Toy Story Mania,

1312
01:03:07,672 --> 01:03:10,574
is we have a high striker board that sort of gives you

1313
01:03:10,574 --> 01:03:13,396
your score at the end and lets you know how well you did.

1314
01:03:13,396 --> 01:03:15,297
No matter what, you get to shoot confetti out

1315
01:03:15,297 --> 01:03:16,318
of that cannon at the end.

1316
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:18,959
It is a celebration of however well you did.

1317
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:20,420
But you also get sort of a metric

1318
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,141
of how well you did in the grand scheme of things.

1319
01:03:22,582 --> 01:03:25,524
And I'll give a slightly humbling example there.

1320
01:03:25,524 --> 01:03:27,525
I was part of the design team on Mania,

1321
01:03:27,525 --> 01:03:31,607
and I rode that ride hundreds of times before it opened.

1322
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:32,568
It was a tough job.

1323
01:03:32,568 --> 01:03:34,869
And me and the other designers had a little bit

1324
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:36,470
of a running competition going on.

1325
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,912
I think my personal high score that I ever got

1326
01:03:38,912 --> 01:03:42,694
was about 380,000 points, which we thought was,

1327
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:44,616
I thought was pretty dang good.

1328
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:47,958
We opened up, and within a couple months of opening,

1329
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,799
we had annual pass holders who had already crossed

1330
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:50,119
the 500,000 mark.

1331
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:55,767
And so no matter how deep you make it, people will go deeper.

1332
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:58,452
But it still needs to be fun that first time through.

1333
01:03:58,452 --> 01:03:59,934
And that's always what we're trying to balance.

1334
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:00,154
Thank you.
