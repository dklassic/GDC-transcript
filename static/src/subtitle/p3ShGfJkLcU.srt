1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,642
This talk is called Helping Players Hate

2
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:13,843
or Love Your Nemesis.

3
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:16,285
My name is Chris Hoagie.

4
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:19,808
That's right, pronounced Hoagie like the sandwich.

5
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:23,491
I'm the lead systems designer at Monolith.

6
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:25,413
I think we'll start off with a video

7
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,155
that shows us a little of Shadow of War.

8
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:34,055
All right, at Monolith, our recent products have been Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War.

9
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,597
And we are based in Kirkland, Washington.

10
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:40,058
It's a great place to work.

11
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,719
Here's a little pic of our office building.

12
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:44,220
A little bit about myself.

13
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,163
Before these two products, I worked on several others, some Lord of the Rings based.

14
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,445
Before that, I was in children's games.

15
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:54,305
I did several.

16
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,326
Here are a few of them.

17
00:01:56,306 --> 00:02:00,832
And before children's games, I was designing in other industries.

18
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:05,798
I did a little designing for test systems for the F-16,

19
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:11,124
designing oceanic fiber optic cables, and I lived in Africa for several years.

20
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,869
So, in the Nemesis system, what we like to do...

21
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:21,504
is we like to surprise and delight the player

22
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,605
and evoke these emotions of love and hate.

23
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,607
So this talk is gonna be about that.

24
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,529
We're gonna get into the nemesis system.

25
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,491
We're going to talk about how we do this,

26
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:33,814
why we wanna do it, talk about some philosophies

27
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:36,756
of our design and some tricks and a lot of examples.

28
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:39,919
And here's the summary in case you gotta go.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,222
The players hate it when you inhibit their progress and insult them.

30
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:47,703
And they love it if you help them and entertain them.

31
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:53,026
And it really helps to have a long relationship, as long as possible.

32
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:59,170
And it helps to be a memorable orc, to be a nemesis, not only in who they are but what they do.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,460
So what is the Nemesis system?

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,221
Well, a short answer could be it is procedural bosses.

35
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:08,241
I like this longer answer better.

36
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,062
It's an interconnected game mechanics

37
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:14,583
that allow players to develop Nemesis-style relationships

38
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:16,443
with systemically generated enemies

39
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:18,704
using systemically generated events.

40
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:21,444
And when I say Nemesis-style relationships,

41
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:24,885
what I mean is that classic relationship

42
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:28,646
that is long-term, that you see between two main characters

43
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:30,527
over time where there's respect.

44
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,850
and fear of each other.

45
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,793
So there's a lot of examples of these.

46
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:36,797
Here's a few that you probably know.

47
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:39,000
This is Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty,

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,224
and this is Beowulf and Grendel.

49
00:03:42,397 --> 00:03:45,858
So the Nemesis system isn't what it's all about.

50
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:47,139
It's only a part of the game.

51
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:50,321
There's a huge set of game mechanics and systems

52
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:55,363
that exist that only, Nemesis system can only be enjoyed

53
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,765
and even perceived if these other things are in place

54
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:58,465
and are awesome.

55
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:00,706
And it isn't a separate thing either.

56
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,067
It is deeply integrated.

57
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:03,728
It's got its roots in everything.

58
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:06,369
The whole team helps to bring that whole thing to life.

59
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,715
And the nemesis system can be thought of,

60
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:12,316
interesting stories, and interesting stories

61
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:16,597
can only exist on top of a sense of normalcy.

62
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:18,917
Once you establish normalcy,

63
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:20,478
you can have the interesting things happen

64
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:23,618
because only when things stand out as interesting,

65
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,219
then people say, oh yeah,

66
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,819
it's different than everything else I've seen.

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,480
So the best example of gameplay.

68
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,121
for the Nemesis system is the revenge loop.

69
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:38,503
And in the revenge loop, it follows these steps.

70
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:42,105
The orc kills you, then you respawn,

71
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:46,086
and this is important, time moves forward in our game,

72
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,028
which means you don't go back to where you were alive,

73
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:53,749
you wake up later, then you decide to hunt down the orc,

74
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,210
and then you kill the orc.

75
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,748
This is different than what players want.

76
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,368
Of course, they want to kill every orc

77
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:03,448
and they want to never die.

78
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,569
And when this is deviated from their expectations

79
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,549
is when it starts to get really interesting.

80
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,490
So I have a video of this revenge loop.

81
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,550
I'm gonna show you now.

82
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,910
And I spliced it and I sped up some parts

83
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,211
so that we can get to the really interesting parts

84
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:18,051
and I highlighted them.

85
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,091
So let's take a look.

86
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:21,911
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

87
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:25,792
Submit now, and perhaps I will show you a bit of mercy.

88
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,194
Nothing personal. I'm just following orders from my overlord. He says kill the Tark. I kill the Tark

89
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:54,537
Actually was a little personal because I really do hate Tarks

90
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,123
So here time was forward

91
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:12,534
Now I'm trying to find the orc again.

92
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,462
All right, let's talk about when time moves forward.

93
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,163
In a lot of single-player games,

94
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:59,864
you actually have the option to,

95
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:02,245
or you're forced to even, go back in time.

96
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:06,566
And what that means is it's part of your thought process.

97
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,848
So pardon my crude designer drawings,

98
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:12,169
but here's me playing the game,

99
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:14,710
and I'm thinking to myself, oh, this is a hard part.

100
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,550
Should I save?

101
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,131
Maybe I'll reload.

102
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:20,394
Maybe I'll reload version A or version B.

103
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:24,618
Now I'm actually in my own gameplay process.

104
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,782
I'm like watching myself in my little time travel experiment.

105
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:31,446
I think I'll reload B if I fail here, otherwise A might be good.

106
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,793
In our game, we are forced to move forward in time.

107
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,314
You don't have the option to go back,

108
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,055
and it's freeing in a way.

109
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:43,677
It helps you focus on what's happening immediately.

110
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,058
You don't have to play that little experiment

111
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,639
because all you're focused on is what's gonna happen next,

112
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,181
what just happened, and you end up being

113
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:55,163
very emotionally involved with the immediate events

114
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:55,783
that are happening.

115
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:58,765
And the bonus is you have a longer relationship

116
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:00,626
with the orcs, because now they have a memory

117
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,247
that they can hold.

118
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:06,696
So in the revenge loop, here are the emotions that go through the typical player.

119
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,011
like, oh, I'm so frustrated, I just died.

120
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:13,353
And then most people, they abandon whatever they're doing

121
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:15,955
and they're like, that orc, he's dead, I'm going after him.

122
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:17,837
Then they hunt him down, they find him,

123
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:19,118
and then they kill him, and they're like,

124
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:21,119
oh, this is so amazing, that felt good.

125
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,501
And I liken it to a roller coaster,

126
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,064
so like, oh, I hated that part, oh, here we go, yeah!

127
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:28,745
That was a great hill that we went down.

128
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,887
So here's the key is that we like the negative emotions.

129
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:32,948
We really like it.

130
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,970
because it leads to that glorious result.

131
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,391
In fact, if it's strong negative,

132
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,291
it leads to a stronger positive.

133
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,252
So we want that roller coaster hill

134
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,613
to be higher if possible.

135
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:48,734
It's also similar to doing hard work.

136
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,355
So here's a fruit tart.

137
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:53,216
If I make a fruit tart, it's a lot of work to put into it,

138
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:56,037
but man, after you finish, it tastes way better.

139
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:56,097
So.

140
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:02,233
We have support for this, here's a couple.

141
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:04,094
Georgia R. Martin says,

142
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,976
fiction is about emotional resonance,

143
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:11,499
about making us feel things on a primal and visceral level.

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,782
And so I interpret that as emotions are the whole point.

145
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,665
If you're not gonna do the emotions, why even do it?

146
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:23,328
So here's an article we got when we released Shadow of War.

147
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:30,896
So this article, so like, I'm being bullied by Mozu.

148
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,097
That's his voice.

149
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:33,738
Oh, awesome.

150
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:34,218
Yeah.

151
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,520
Yeah.

152
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:37,961
Yeah.

153
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:38,101
Yeah.

154
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:38,341
Yeah.

155
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:40,943
This article is very satisfying to get

156
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:45,485
because it shows that he's on his way up that rollercoaster

157
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:47,527
and a few days later he wrote the subsequent one.

158
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:48,127
Yeah.

159
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:48,848
Yeah.

160
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:51,729
And he shows like, yeah, this is, it was proof to us.

161
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:52,970
This is working like this.

162
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,751
This is really where it's all about.

163
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:58,038
So this leads me to philosophy number one.

164
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,420
So I have a bunch of philosophies,

165
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,221
and by the way, they're kind of all swirling

166
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:04,482
and all over the place, so they're not really

167
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:06,763
part of a list, it's not exhaustive.

168
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:08,444
I have, I think, seven.

169
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,766
So here's philosophy number one.

170
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:12,807
We want to maximize the hate, why?

171
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:15,849
Because the resolution is way more sweeter.

172
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:17,956
And there's two parts of this.

173
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,218
One of it is that the orcs are mean,

174
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:23,941
and the other is we want to get you to hate the orc,

175
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:25,562
not hate the game.

176
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:28,304
And so let's talk about orcs being mean.

177
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:33,250
There's a lot of tricks we do, but we basically try to do it everywhere we can.

178
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:41,817
One example is the kill animations. You saw that example. When that orc kills you, we show those brutal, supposed to look painful.

179
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:46,881
You know, talion is suffering. And then when he stands over you and talks to you, he insults you.

180
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:51,325
He says things that are really aggravating, if possible, or memorable.

181
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:55,968
And then when he's promoted, he's like, yeah, I'm stronger now because of your failure.

182
00:10:56,637 --> 00:11:01,038
And then we also spent a lot of time focusing on the orc's face.

183
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:04,019
And the next time he meets you, of course, he insults you again.

184
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,199
Why, you died.

185
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,079
I can kill you again.

186
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:06,720
You're so easy.

187
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,301
So let's talk about the death taunts.

188
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,101
Death taunts is the moment right when you're dying.

189
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:16,782
And he looks over your dying body, and then he

190
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,803
says something insulting.

191
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:20,504
I have a little clip showing a few examples

192
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:24,085
of being insulting and memorable.

193
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:37,344
If you're the best that men can offer, this war will be disappointingly short.

194
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:41,886
You wanted to beat me, didn't you?

195
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:49,911
Must be frustrating losing the way you did. Just makes this all the more fun for me!

196
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:12,393
Don't promote me for this!

197
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:14,335
Maybe a few times!

198
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:17,718
I could be War Chief, I could be Overlord...

199
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:18,719
I could be...

200
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,360
Ah!

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,941
Whatever's above that!

202
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,968
We come to this, your sad little end.

203
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:33,453
I do like to think we were almost friends.

204
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:41,941
Okay, we want to get the player to focus their hate on the orc, not the game.

205
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:46,643
And the key to this is the players have to feel like there was a solution available to them

206
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,745
within their grasp, something they could have done to avoid it.

207
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:52,646
Oh, if only I... Here's some examples.

208
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:54,687
If only I won that last chance minigame.

209
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:58,449
If only I got intel, I would have known he has that special move that killed me.

210
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:01,790
Oh, I forgot to run away. We can always run away in our game.

211
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,875
So here's a story about this.

212
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,198
During development of Shadow of Mordor,

213
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,362
we were putting in the trait No Chance.

214
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,624
And before we had the banner that

215
00:13:12,644 --> 00:13:15,568
showed across the bottom of the screen, it was partially working.

216
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:19,396
and it was implemented, we were experiencing it in the game,

217
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,277
Bob Roberts said, oh, this feature is terrible,

218
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,939
it makes me feel terrible, why are we even doing this?

219
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,739
And then the banner finally got in the game,

220
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,620
and he said, oh, yeah, okay, now it's fine,

221
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,481
yeah, it's fine, because it means I could have known,

222
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:33,262
if I had done research on that orc,

223
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,003
which a lot of times you need to do,

224
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:37,084
I would have seen it as no chance,

225
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:40,405
it would have changed the way I approached my behavior,

226
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,306
I could have avoided it.

227
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:43,046
So let's go back to that,

228
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:50,060
That loop that I was talking about. So you first meet the captain and he insults you and then

229
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,825
He then you get killed and this is the moment of aggravation

230
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:58,849
of course the orcs promoted and I want to point out that you don't have to be killed by

231
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:01,292
a captain, you could be killed by a grunt.

232
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:04,153
And that's kind of the beauty of our game.

233
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:05,373
It's not just the captains.

234
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,493
Any grunt who happens to get a lucky shot on you

235
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:09,454
can kill you.

236
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:11,154
And then he'll be promoted to captain

237
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:14,795
and then he'll be just like all those other captains.

238
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,095
And then of course you hunt him down

239
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,435
and you have the option as a player

240
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:19,036
to give him a death threat.

241
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:19,736
And I'll explain that.

242
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:21,656
It means you give him a warning.

243
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:22,696
I'm coming for you.

244
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:23,236
A message.

245
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:23,597
And then he...

246
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:26,080
he prepares and he gets stronger.

247
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,921
Why would you ever do that?

248
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:30,525
It's because when you do get him, your loot is way better.

249
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,228
So then you meet the captain again, he insults you again,

250
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:37,113
and then you finally, if you're lucky, defeat him.

251
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,701
A lot of times they give last words if they can,

252
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:45,564
and then you finally, yeah, I killed him, I got my loot,

253
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:47,085
ooh, this is the good feeling, right?

254
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:49,827
So last words, let's talk about that a second.

255
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,249
Last words is when you get him on his knees,

256
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,011
it doesn't always happen, but it happens with orcs who,

257
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,593
you know, if the circumstances are right,

258
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:58,934
and this is a orc that you know really well,

259
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:00,736
he'll say something to you,

260
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:05,779
and they're meant to be memorable and emotion-provoking.

261
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,462
I have a little video showing a few examples of last words.

262
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:15,095
You think you're better than us?

263
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,276
You enjoy the kill, don't you?

264
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:24,398
Catch some drops of my blood, Ranger.

265
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:30,599
Carry it with you, so we can be close.

266
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,160
There was so much more to eat!

267
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:40,370
Maybe you won't see me again, but there's someone who will come for you.

268
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,593
He is my brother by blood, and he will come for yours.

269
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:48,794
What are you waiting for?

270
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,595
I don't have any last words.

271
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:54,357
Except for what I just said.

272
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:09,337
So the loot, when you do a revenge loop

273
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:12,798
and you kill that guy, your loot is even stronger

274
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,619
than before, giving you a better payout

275
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,960
and it's personalized.

276
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,323
This is an illustration of a ring that has a quote

277
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:22,884
from the orc who you just killed and his name.

278
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:24,405
So you can always look back at your loot and say,

279
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:26,906
oh yeah, I got this one from Mozu.

280
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,628
And if you happen to put a death threat on him,

281
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:33,150
then your loot is even stronger.

282
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:34,895
So, philosophy number two,

283
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:37,760
we want to maximize the length of the orc story.

284
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,484
And by this, I mean like the roller coaster, right?

285
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:42,147
We want the ride to be really long

286
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,231
because it gets better.

287
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,715
You feel all these, you know, bad, but yet good.

288
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:53,473
So the easiest way to maximize the length of the story is the orcs should not die and the easiest way to

289
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:56,056
Prevent the orcs from dying is you make them really hard to kill

290
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:59,140
This is a potential problem because you get this loop

291
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,164
Somebody meets the orc a second time and then they die again

292
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:07,330
And then they get double angry and then they meet him again, and then they die again and now they're triple

293
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,092
God, and if they're able to break out,

294
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,093
then they're triple happy,

295
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:13,194
and they're really feeling good about this moment.

296
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,335
And the mechanism they have to break out of this

297
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:19,117
is they have a lot of tools at their disposal

298
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,659
for how to approach and kill this orc.

299
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,500
And it could be like, wait till later until I'm stronger.

300
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,121
It could be bring my allies with me,

301
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:27,402
use beasts, use stealth.

302
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:31,425
But if they can get out of that loop, it's really glorious.

303
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,266
It's important that every orc that you meet is beatable.

304
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,783
And here's a trick that we use to make sure every orc is beatable.

305
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,366
Is that each one has a built-in weakness.

306
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:43,648
They can't shed it as they grow.

307
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,211
So in this little diagram, this orc has...

308
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,433
I put the red as the strengths and this...

309
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:50,936
Lose weaknesses, got a little yellow one there,

310
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,478
which is secretly marked as he'll never shed this.

311
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,861
An example of a strength might be I'm immune to fire,

312
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,623
and a weakness might be I can be killed by fire.

313
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:02,665
So as he grows, he will randomly grow.

314
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:04,487
We don't quite know what's gonna happen to him

315
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,108
or the experiences he's gonna have,

316
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,470
but we're sure that there's always a way

317
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,851
that you can kill him.

318
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:11,372
And so an example of that might be

319
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:14,154
he's instantly killed by stealth attacks,

320
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,156
which you could have killed him when he was level 10,

321
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,958
but as he grew, you didn't realize that,

322
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:18,238
but then.

323
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,660
there's still a way, there's still a way that you can get that guy.

324
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,104
So we like the longer stories. I'm going to add a few things to this diagram

325
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:31,269
talking about longer stories. So there's the humiliation.

326
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:34,691
One of my favorite features, the orc doesn't actually kill you.

327
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:37,894
As an exception, he looks over you and he says,

328
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:41,937
you're not even, you're not even worth killing. He insults you and then he walks

329
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,779
off and then of course you can find him again

330
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,440
and re-engage.

331
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:50,676
Some players forget that they can run away, or the orc will try to run away.

332
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,400
This is a change from Shadow of Mordor.

333
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,665
In Shadow of War, we realized we want these stories to be longer, so we thought really

334
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,528
hard about how to help the orc escape.

335
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,621
Aside from just running and other tactics while he's running,

336
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:07,042
we have death defying. This is a trait that some orcs have.

337
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:10,944
At the moment you get him down, he's on his knees, you think he's going to give his last words,

338
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:15,245
and he looks up and he says, I'm not done yet, and he gets a breath of second wind,

339
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:17,086
and he's back up and you have to fight him again.

340
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:20,387
Of course, you may not defeat him at that point, he has another chance.

341
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:22,928
Or there's a tricky escape.

342
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:24,909
He looks up at you and he goes,

343
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:26,451
I got one more trick up my sleeve,

344
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,412
and then he hits you, and then he runs off screen

345
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:28,952
and he escapes.

346
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:30,233
Now it's kind of a cheap shot,

347
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:31,454
so we can't use that too much,

348
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:33,376
but if it's an exception once in a while,

349
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:34,997
it's kind of a cool story,

350
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:37,219
and the orc lives to have a longer story.

351
00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:39,656
You can always shame the orc.

352
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:45,558
This is when you momentarily make him suffer and he'll go down a level.

353
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:46,998
I'll talk more about shame a little later.

354
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:49,839
Or of course you can recruit him. He'll be on your team.

355
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:54,201
And that's awesome because now you like him and you want him to survive.

356
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:57,281
And now his story will be prolonged. I'll talk more about that guy too.

357
00:19:58,202 --> 00:19:59,463
And then cheating death.

358
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:03,628
So cheating death is really powerful because you've already gone through the,

359
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:06,271
I got my loot, I'm so happy, I killed him.

360
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:08,313
And then he basically announced to you,

361
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:12,037
you thought you killed me, but I really wasn't dead, I'm back.

362
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:15,601
And of course, that's really emotional, like what?

363
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:17,784
I spent so much effort trying to kill you and now you're back.

364
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:21,127
And then it can be awesome and it can be terrible.

365
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,849
Like during development of Shadow Mortar,

366
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:26,291
we had to make sure that this loop didn't go out of control

367
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:28,413
because if a guy comes back too much,

368
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:30,074
then it gets aggravating.

369
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:31,376
But a little bit, it's awesome.

370
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:33,497
So this is where we control it.

371
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,460
Right there we say, well, maybe he doesn't always cheat death.

372
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:39,153
So who cheats death?

373
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:47,057
So we we need cheating death to be an exception. It can't happen to every orc. It has to be an amazing thing.

374
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:51,900
What just happened? Oh, I didn't know that could happen in our game. Oh, yeah, that does happen sometimes that kind of thing.

375
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:57,670
So what we do is we keep track of the interaction you have with every orc,

376
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,891
and they have a little score.

377
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,251
We call it the player interaction score, or PIS for short.

378
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:04,332
Yeah, we thought that was a really clever name.

379
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,172
So, then the...

380
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:09,873
If their PIS is really high, then at the moment of their death,

381
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:13,494
they have a higher chance to cheat death.

382
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:16,115
And then that chance is reduced over time.

383
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,731
We can't let them cheat death infinitely.

384
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:22,193
Unless, of course, you cut off their head.

385
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,054
Everybody knows if you cut off their head,

386
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,455
then they're not coming back, they're dead for sure.

387
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:29,037
But you can't control that.

388
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:30,398
The way the game mechanics work is,

389
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,059
when you get an orc down,

390
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,781
you're not sure whether you're gonna use that animation

391
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:35,701
that cuts off his head,

392
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,062
or you're gonna attack the stab throughs.

393
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:43,283
chest or a number of other animations. So we do something else here which is if there is an orc

394
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:49,905
who is a candidate for cheating death like we can tell you you really hate this guy then we we

395
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:54,347
actually protect him. We say no no you're not going to actually cut off his head because we

396
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:57,808
want a chance that chance that he can come back and have a longer story.

397
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:03,720
And then after he cheats death a couple times then we're like okay now

398
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,523
Now you can go ahead and cut his head off because we know that that feeling of cutting that orcs head off

399
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:14,786
You're like why don't you stay dead and then his head goes off. You're like. Oh, yeah, that's really it really feels great

400
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,470
This chart shows the survivability of orcs.

401
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,331
So for a typical player, I mean there's all kinds of players, but typically

402
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:27,273
you'll meet 85 captains who you will kill in your first encounter with them

403
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:30,413
and then you'll meet 14 who you'll have two encounters

404
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:34,194
and then about four who you'll have three

405
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:39,076
encounters and this area is the area where you have a nemesis-die relationship.

406
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:42,478
You start to care really, like, who is this guy?

407
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:43,780
Why does he keep defying me?

408
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,361
Or why does he keep escaping?

409
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:46,562
Or why is he haunting me?

410
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:48,344
He keeps chasing me down and killing me.

411
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:51,066
Now, you might say, oh, 85 is a lot.

412
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:51,947
That seems like a waste.

413
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,469
Like all those orcs, they're just dead instantly.

414
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,052
Well, I mean, you have to have an exception, right?

415
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:00,655
If that 85 was like as low as all those others,

416
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:02,176
then it wouldn't be an exception

417
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,078
for these long-term relationships.

418
00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:07,154
And actually we root for these orcs.

419
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:10,097
When we're in play tests and we're watching players play our game,

420
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:11,659
we see an orc die.

421
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,820
We're like, oh, I hope he cheats death.

422
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,541
Wouldn't that be great?

423
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,722
Wouldn't that prolong his story?

424
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:16,323
It would be so fantastic.

425
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:21,629
Philosophy number three, we don't know who your nemesis is going to be.

426
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:22,310
Why?

427
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,831
Because it's all random.

428
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,853
It's all about what you do in the game.

429
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:30,906
So it's really better if your nemesis is actually

430
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:32,927
as a result of your actions or interactions,

431
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:36,030
so because then you're emotionally involved.

432
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,392
It's because of what you did or didn't do.

433
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:41,834
So what we do is we basically just seed the world

434
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:44,656
with lots of orcs of varying types,

435
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:48,139
and if you make a mistake, well, that's an opportunity

436
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,761
for that new relationship to start.

437
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:55,244
And by the way, these two guys, Bruise and Zog,

438
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:55,505
are...

439
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,625
are not the same as the rest of the orcs.

440
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:01,006
They are forced upon you as a player.

441
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:02,267
You have to be these guys.

442
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:05,009
But after they finish telling their story,

443
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:07,770
then they're basically released into the system.

444
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,011
You can do whatever you want with them.

445
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:13,874
Oh yeah, and you gotta remember your nemesis

446
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:15,795
or the orcs that you meet.

447
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,676
This is really, really important.

448
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:19,136
And so I'm gonna sort of shift that

449
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:21,058
and talk about remembering orcs for a while.

450
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:24,607
If you can't remember an orc,

451
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,948
how are you gonna have any opinions about him?

452
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,489
How do you have any relationship with him?

453
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:32,469
So how do you make anything memorable?

454
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,450
So you're gonna meet someone.

455
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,190
How do you make yourself memorable

456
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,371
so that they will remember you?

457
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,412
Well, I've talked about two things already.

458
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,612
Do something that will impact their emotions.

459
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:49,433
Have a long time meeting them or many interactions.

460
00:24:51,177 --> 00:24:52,699
And now I'll talk about my friend Darryl.

461
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,903
Okay, this guy, I went to school with him years ago.

462
00:24:57,684 --> 00:25:01,007
And what's interesting about him is I haven't talked to him

463
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,028
since I went to school.

464
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,171
And he doesn't know that I'm talking about him now.

465
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:10,036
And he wasn't even that good of a friend.

466
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:11,157
He's one of my friends, you know,

467
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,658
but he wasn't my best of friends.

468
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:19,295
Yet, at the same time, I remember him better than some of my close friends.

469
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,076
Why is that?

470
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:23,277
What about him makes him memorable?

471
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:26,479
So I'll tell you a little bit about his personality.

472
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,602
He was a little bit opinionated and he was kind of assertive, but he loved life and so

473
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:34,524
he had a really strong personality.

474
00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:40,287
And so this is my theory, which is it's not about being likable to be memorable, it's

475
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:43,009
more about having a unique identity.

476
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:47,320
So we're trying to make orcs have a unique identity

477
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,042
so that they can be memorable.

478
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:51,003
And if you want somebody to remember you,

479
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,624
have a unique identity, it helps.

480
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,067
Okay, so another point is breaking the norm.

481
00:25:57,147 --> 00:26:01,049
Doing something really strange will help you be memorable.

482
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:04,771
So I'm going to tell a story now about Brian Pamatuan.

483
00:26:05,592 --> 00:26:07,353
He's a friend of mine at Monolith.

484
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,356
And he told me an interesting story

485
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:14,639
that he did long ago for a girl he liked

486
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,923
to try to make himself really memorable by doing something

487
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:19,864
really unusual.

488
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:22,626
Actually, it's kind of an embarrassing story.

489
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:25,128
Maybe he promised not to tell it.

490
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:28,631
But I don't think he'd mind, because it really

491
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:29,672
is applicable here.

492
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:29,812
So.

493
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:33,105
What he decided to do is he decided to dress up.

494
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:36,388
Oh my god.

495
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:41,753
Are you serious?

496
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:43,975
You...

497
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:45,296
You said you weren't going to be here.

498
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:51,001
I wasn't going to be here.

499
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:53,383
Alright.

500
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:56,165
I guess I don't have a story about brain.

501
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:05,098
Actually, I actually don't really have a story about Brian.

502
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:14,307
We decided to orchestrate a little orc confrontation here to illustrate breaking out of the norm.

503
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:18,671
So because of this moment of conflict, we wanted you...

504
00:27:21,977 --> 00:27:24,539
I wanted you all to say, oh my god, what's happening?

505
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,601
Maybe to make this speech a little bit more memorable.

506
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,802
Yeah, thank you.

507
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,045
Okay, how do we design memorable orcs?

508
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:37,006
Well, we usually start with our identity.

509
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:39,568
Here's a guy, Golem Firebrander.

510
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:41,109
I mean, it's procedurally chosen,

511
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:42,930
but this guy, if his name is that,

512
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,711
we already know a lot of things about him.

513
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,052
Let's talk about his visuals first.

514
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,734
First, I mean, he's probably going to be fire related.

515
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:54,315
He's got a fire weapon, you see, probably a branding iron.

516
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:58,097
We can make other things interesting and memorable about him.

517
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,838
Like he's got this goggles.

518
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:01,198
Maybe you'll say, oh, that's kind of weird.

519
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:03,739
If it's not something you see often in the game, it'll stick out.

520
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,400
His dialogue can stick out as unusual.

521
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:08,681
His taunts during his combat.

522
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,862
We have this thing called mannerisms, which is.

523
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,552
It's kind of like a subtle thing that they say over and over.

524
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:17,974
Not all orcs have this, but once in a while an orc will just repeat themselves over,

525
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:20,896
it's time, every time he hits you, it's time.

526
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:24,339
Now you might get really annoyed at that in the same way that Princess Bride, like,

527
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:25,900
stop saying that.

528
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,282
And so that was the point is that it becomes irritating and memorable.

529
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:30,823
In combat.

530
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:33,273
They might have specific attacks that you remember,

531
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:34,794
oh, that's the guy with that one attack.

532
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:36,776
Other behaviors they might have,

533
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,118
he has certain kinds of ambushes,

534
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:41,081
maybe he shows up certain times repeatedly,

535
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:43,583
it becomes part of his identity or where he lives.

536
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,166
Anyway, we try to do as many things as possible

537
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:48,048
to make him memorable.

538
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:50,651
I'm going to show you some examples.

539
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:51,732
This is the maggot.

540
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:55,049
So he has a problem.

541
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,872
He's suffering from maggots.

542
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:01,434
He's got maggots eating away at him.

543
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,935
And he complains about it every time you see him.

544
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:07,217
He uses that opportunity to talk about the maggots eating away.

545
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:09,539
He can feel them in his scalp eating away.

546
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:16,023
And so when you look at this guy, is he terrible or wonderful?

547
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:18,765
Well, if you think this is terrible, awesome,

548
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,506
because you have an emotional reaction.

549
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:24,469
If you think he's wonderful, awesome, because you have an emotional reaction.

550
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:31,494
So it turns out he becomes memorable because of this unique identity he has.

551
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:35,857
And the more time you think about him and why he's this way and how he feels,

552
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:39,840
of course, the more memorable he'll be, which means the more likely you'll have

553
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,303
an emotional response when he kills you or escapes or whatever.

554
00:29:44,524 --> 00:29:48,167
Here's some more tricks we use. We use name-dropping in death taunts.

555
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:49,588
They'll lean over and they'll say to you,

556
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,326
It was Grisha who killed you, remember that.

557
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:55,268
And then maybe Grisha will be something that you remember

558
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:57,390
so that when you go hunt him down, it'll be,

559
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,091
oh yeah, it was that guy, it was Grisha.

560
00:29:59,852 --> 00:30:03,415
We also do this, the orcs remind you of your history.

561
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:04,616
Last time you ran away.

562
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,977
And of course, the player doesn't always remember,

563
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,619
but it really helps if the orcs reminds them,

564
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:10,380
oh yeah, I guess I did run away.

565
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,623
And then it'll reinforce that and it'll become the truth.

566
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,697
So philosophy number four, we wanna actually

567
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,438
maximize the correlations between their identity

568
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:24,260
and the things that we do to help you remember them.

569
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,801
So you never know how they're gonna be noticed.

570
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,923
We asked play testers after they played the game,

571
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:32,404
who was your nemesis and what do you remember about them?

572
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:34,345
And we were surprised, it wasn't always visual.

573
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:36,246
Sometimes it was audio, sometimes it was combat.

574
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:39,188
Sometimes it was the way the orc found them

575
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,549
or behaved with them.

576
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,370
And so we used to clearly wanna do everything we can

577
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,711
so that they become memorable.

578
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,566
So this guy is the diseased.

579
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:51,152
He also has a problem, you know, he's got.

580
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:58,168
diseased face and arm and he's got some boils on his chest, he's got poison things around

581
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:58,608
his belt.

582
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:01,069
So we try to do everything we can.

583
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:03,490
They only get one chance usually, you saw that chart.

584
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:08,693
They're probably going to die the first meeting but if they don't, this is awesome, this is

585
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,774
a good guy to have as your nemesis.

586
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:15,757
And we try to use outrageous things whenever we can and tropes help.

587
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,045
And by the way, this part of the orc visually is way more impactful than the...

588
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:24,248
See, he's got a belt around his belly, he's got jars with eyeballs in them.

589
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:27,631
That's all cool and all, but it's not as impactful to the player

590
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:30,072
as everything around the head and shoulders area.

591
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:31,293
That's something we learned.

592
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:35,136
Here's another orc, the dwarf hater.

593
00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:38,478
So here's his concept before he was made.

594
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:40,574
The other one's an in-game shot.

595
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:42,595
So this starts off as an idea.

596
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:45,176
Oh, what if we have an orc who just hates dwarves?

597
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,777
And that's all he thinks about, that's all he talks about.

598
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:48,497
What would he look like?

599
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:50,678
Well, maybe he has dwarf paraphernalia.

600
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:53,039
Maybe he collects dwarf beards and dwarf skulls

601
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,900
and wraps them around as jewelry.

602
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,341
Maybe he finds dwarf equipment, dwarf helmet,

603
00:31:58,361 --> 00:31:59,421
and it doesn't quite fit,

604
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:01,062
but he shoves it on his head anyway.

605
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:01,982
Maybe he...

606
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:05,852
We didn't do the weapon, but this was our idea.

607
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:08,453
It was a crow cage with a dead dwarf in it.

608
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,654
And when he strikes it, the dwarf is bobbling around

609
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:11,994
inside.

610
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:13,574
That was technically challenging.

611
00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:19,036
So we did implement this trade.

612
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:20,296
He has a hate of dwarves.

613
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:22,537
So he's the only guy in the game who has a hate of dwarves,

614
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:24,417
because it makes sense for him.

615
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:28,278
And then another thing is that the game doesn't have any

616
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,158
dwarves, so it's not.

617
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:36,305
triggered, unless you derange his mind, in which case he thinks you're a dwarf, and then

618
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,765
of course he'll become enraged at you.

619
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:41,126
So one more.

620
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:42,146
So this is a blast.

621
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:45,847
You can just look at him and tell a lot of things about him right away.

622
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:50,168
He belongs to the Machine Tribe, and if you get to know the tribes, you'll already know

623
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:51,728
a lot about him.

624
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:53,769
You can tell by looking at him that he's in the Machine Tribe.

625
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:54,829
He's got grenades around him.

626
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,535
You kind of tell where he's found. He's got a fire weapon.

627
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,980
He's got this thing on his back. It turns out it's a flame cannon.

628
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,342
So he'll burn you with that if he can.

629
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,291
So you might say, hey, Hoagie, this

630
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:10,913
is a lot of specific crafted content for a procedural game.

631
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:14,095
You start talking off, this is procedural enemies.

632
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:16,616
Well, yeah, yes and no.

633
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:23,119
The game has a lot of systemic mechanisms

634
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,540
for putting things together, events, and orcs,

635
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:26,381
and situations.

636
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:28,782
And when it gets down to the granular level,

637
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:31,944
we do have a lot of finely crafted things in it.

638
00:33:31,984 --> 00:33:33,825
It's a ton of content, but the two of them.

639
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,904
are blended to try to make it unclear

640
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:40,285
about how the system really works.

641
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:45,131
Philosophy number five, the scope and nature of the design

642
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:46,792
should be unclear to players.

643
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:53,820
This is intentional. We don't want players to feel like this is a mechanical thing. We don't want players to figure it out

644
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,121
We want them to be instead

645
00:33:55,681 --> 00:34:02,727
Surprised and delighted there should be a feeling of discovery and wonder what else is out there? What haven't I found yet?

646
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:08,371
Oh look. I found something really great. I'd like to find more. This is the type of

647
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:16,016
Feelings we were trying to evoke from the design, and I think I'm going to tell my friends about this this game

648
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:19,314
Let's talk about telling friends.

649
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:25,120
So this became a metric for several of us

650
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,461
on the design team.

651
00:34:27,202 --> 00:34:29,344
Is this feature that we're considering implementing

652
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:30,485
gonna be great?

653
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:33,367
Is it so great that players will blog about it?

654
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:36,090
And what makes players blog about a feature?

655
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,652
It's gotta be amazing, right?

656
00:34:38,692 --> 00:34:39,953
It's gotta be so amazing.

657
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:41,695
They practically fall out of their chair.

658
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:42,355
So.

659
00:34:43,176 --> 00:34:45,498
It turns out they blog for like three different reasons,

660
00:34:45,558 --> 00:34:47,599
and we focus on number one most of the time.

661
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,982
It's they meet something really interesting, unique.

662
00:34:51,602 --> 00:34:57,686
Or number two, they have a lot of emotions all tied up in this situation,

663
00:34:57,706 --> 00:34:58,607
and they want to talk about it.

664
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,329
Or number three, they want to talk about how great they were

665
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:03,350
and how they conquered their problems.

666
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,573
And then when players hear these, especially the first one,

667
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:10,854
they think to themselves, well, what else is out there?

668
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:12,095
I didn't see that.

669
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:14,997
Maybe I should explore the game more.

670
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:18,499
And that's great because now players are questioning

671
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:20,300
their understanding of the scope of the game

672
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,782
and they're waiting to be surprised and delighted even more.

673
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:27,244
And to facilitate all this, telling our friends,

674
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:30,926
we use natural language in the announcements

675
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,128
and the Orc dialogue.

676
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:36,277
For example, this is a banner that comes up on screen.

677
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:40,000
Ushak the unkillable, for example, is a random enemy.

678
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:41,502
Became deranged.

679
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:44,004
Look at that, it's already in sentence format,

680
00:35:44,424 --> 00:35:46,986
using words that are easy to use in your blog.

681
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:49,588
If it happens to be something that happens to you,

682
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,930
then it's worthy of talking about.

683
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:53,452
Natural language.

684
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,634
So philosophy number six, exceptions.

685
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,656
We love exceptions.

686
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:00,918
We love exceptions to exceptions.

687
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,980
This is something that we think about a lot.

688
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:04,035
And

689
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,984
it includes the development process

690
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,745
which supports making exceptions,

691
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:12,367
which is tricky because how do you do that?

692
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:16,290
Well, if you can manage to support development process

693
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,772
which allows people to discover new ideas

694
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:21,354
halfway through, oh, we should add this thing,

695
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:22,675
I didn't think about it before.

696
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:26,257
Yeah, if you add it, sometimes those are the best things.

697
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,640
They lead to more memorable and interesting situations.

698
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,663
So here's what I think it normally takes

699
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:35,284
is forward-thinking game programmers.

700
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,820
What are the features that designers are going to ask for later?

701
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,641
How is this feature going to expand in the future?

702
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:47,507
Data-driven content so the designers can do a lot of tweaking of things late in the cycle

703
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:52,310
and a flexible production schedule so that we can add things a little bit late.

704
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:54,012
Oh, can we get that recording session?

705
00:36:54,032 --> 00:36:54,892
We have these new lines.

706
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:55,613
Can we fit it in?

707
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:56,194
Oh, maybe.

708
00:36:56,234 --> 00:36:56,694
Yeah, okay.

709
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,618
We have to be okay also with not all the content being found.

710
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:06,063
We do a lot of work on these specific stories and we have to be okay as developers.

711
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,785
The player is not going to see everything.

712
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:11,068
Maybe somebody will see it, but maybe not each person will see it.

713
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:16,995
Because what that will lead to is maybe people will hear about it from others, maybe they'll

714
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,356
question their understanding of the...

715
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:21,967
Scope of the design, really it's all about having exceptions.

716
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:25,409
The feeling of exceptions leads to you remembering

717
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,270
the experiences, remembering those orcs,

718
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:29,712
so that you can have relationship with those orcs,

719
00:37:30,072 --> 00:37:32,593
so that you can develop those emotions

720
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:34,214
that we are trying to evoke.

721
00:37:35,135 --> 00:37:37,716
Okay, I got us some examples of exceptions.

722
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:42,642
This is the blight and the claw.

723
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:44,705
Here's two examples of transformed roles.

724
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:46,669
And when we say transformed roles,

725
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:48,311
they change who they are.

726
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:50,935
So instead of just cheating death and coming back

727
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:52,698
and saying, I'm not dead yet,

728
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:53,660
it'll say,

729
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:59,324
I'm not dead, but in the way that you killed me, you have transformed me.

730
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,966
The first guy, the blight, was poisoned by you.

731
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:05,449
And he comes back, and maybe he was someone else,

732
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,291
like the sneak or something more generic before,

733
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:12,674
and now he says, this poison, it has changed him, it's gone inside me.

734
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:16,216
He talks about how he feels about it, how he's stronger because of it.

735
00:38:16,656 --> 00:38:19,278
And now he has poison-based attacks, and he's really aggressive.

736
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:25,700
So the other guy, the claw, you probably killed him by stabbing him and cutting off his arm.

737
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:29,702
And then he comes back and he says, I am now the claw, I am reborn.

738
00:38:29,762 --> 00:38:32,763
And he shows you his claw all the time he can and talks about it.

739
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:34,743
And he tries to kill you with it.

740
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:37,904
And these guys are fairly unique.

741
00:38:38,144 --> 00:38:40,105
We can only allow the player to see these once.

742
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:45,126
As soon as you see these twice, they're now a system, right?

743
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:46,127
They're now mechanical.

744
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:47,747
They're so unique.

745
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:50,450
Here's two more.

746
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,433
The Avenger.

747
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:57,636
If an Orc ambushes you because he came

748
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,638
because you're attacking his blood brother

749
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:01,760
and then he manages to kill you,

750
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,701
he will change his title.

751
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:04,842
He is now the Avenger

752
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:06,404
because he avenged his blood brother.

753
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,286
And the other guy, the Uncatchable.

754
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:12,148
If an Orc manages to escape from you

755
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:13,550
like three times, I think,

756
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:15,011
then...

757
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:19,918
He will change his name to be the uncatchable or the elusive, in this case.

758
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:26,523
So for cheating death, I already told you this is an exception.

759
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:32,088
And then I've just described to you transformed roles where now they're even

760
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:33,669
stronger because they cheated death.

761
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:35,050
We have a double exception.

762
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:38,133
You cut off my head, but I'm not dead.

763
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:39,334
These two guys, the.

764
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:45,698
The guy on the right is the stitch who has his self stitched back together.

765
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:48,779
You can see the stitches around his neck where his friends pulled his body together.

766
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:52,041
This is the story he tells when he comes back to you, like,

767
00:39:52,341 --> 00:39:55,363
I'm still alive and it's because they've stitched me back together.

768
00:39:55,383 --> 00:40:00,406
And the other guy is the machine. He's put together with metal parts

769
00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:02,667
and he says, it's because you cut me in half.

770
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:04,928
You have created the machine. It's because of you.

771
00:40:06,132 --> 00:40:08,813
you're the reason I'm alive, they're your nemesis.

772
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:10,853
Hopefully, I mean, you might kill them right away,

773
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:12,734
but sometimes it works out great.

774
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:16,215
So how do you make an exception?

775
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:19,215
Well, obviously you have to establish what is normal,

776
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:21,476
and then you have to subvert what is normal.

777
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:23,796
And really that's all about adjusting

778
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:25,057
the frequency of something.

779
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:27,957
So with regard to humiliation,

780
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:31,478
let's think about the chance of something happening,

781
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:33,379
zero to 100%.

782
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:35,439
And obviously if it happens a little bit,

783
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,813
It's an exception, and if it happens all the time or often,

784
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,774
it's considered common.

785
00:40:40,635 --> 00:40:44,059
And so humiliators live at about 6% in our game,

786
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,501
right in that space where you feel like,

787
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:47,663
oh, that was kind of odd,

788
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:48,884
but then if you see the second time,

789
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,105
you're like, oh yeah, that thing again.

790
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:52,428
It's on the orc itself.

791
00:40:52,468 --> 00:40:53,989
It's not like him deciding to do it.

792
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:55,711
So an orc will be a humiliator,

793
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:57,693
and he'll humiliate you over and over

794
00:40:57,733 --> 00:40:58,934
every time he kills you.

795
00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:00,904
Because that's a great story.

796
00:41:01,984 --> 00:41:03,985
So an exception, the first time you see it,

797
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:04,685
like, what was that?

798
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:06,626
And then after a while, you're like, OK, I get it.

799
00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:08,887
And then it's in relation to what is normal.

800
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:12,708
So somewhat related, but not really

801
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:14,369
is what I say to my kids around dessert.

802
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:18,270
You're not allowed to have seconds until you have firsts.

803
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:21,232
Yeah.

804
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:23,993
OK, other features that feel like exceptions.

805
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,073
This is the sword breaker.

806
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:28,394
So what happens sometimes is if you get killed by an olag,

807
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:28,834
you'll look.

808
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:32,117
And he'll look over you, over your dead body,

809
00:41:32,477 --> 00:41:34,398
and instead of just taunting you and being done,

810
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:37,099
he'll reach down and he'll take from you

811
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:38,820
your sword that you were just now using.

812
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,860
He'll hold it up and say,

813
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,120
this sword is nothing to me,

814
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,301
and he'll snap it and shatter it and all pieces go.

815
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:45,302
And why would we do that?

816
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,963
It's because we're trying to evoke these emotions.

817
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:49,364
And in fact, this is so strong,

818
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:50,804
we were worried it would be too strong

819
00:41:50,824 --> 00:41:52,225
that players would quit at that moment.

820
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:56,007
So we gave a moment, we gave a message right after this saying,

821
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:58,148
don't worry, don't worry, you can get your sword back.

822
00:41:58,548 --> 00:42:00,330
Go hunt this guy down, kill him,

823
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,491
and then your loot will be your sword again, but stronger.

824
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:06,613
And so people do that, and it's very satisfying.

825
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:08,434
It's so satisfying that some players,

826
00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:10,416
they speculate to themselves like,

827
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:12,597
how can I get this to happen again?

828
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:16,519
But it's, yeah, it doesn't happen very much.

829
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,820
Here's another one where,

830
00:42:19,075 --> 00:42:22,278
An enemy will ambush you, but instead of just showing up and ambushing you and saying,

831
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,621
hey, I'm here, he'll show up with one of your buddies in his arms.

832
00:42:27,301 --> 00:42:31,084
And then he'll say his line like, this follower that you have is worthless,

833
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:32,204
and he'll slice his neck.

834
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:36,367
And then the follower is down on his knees, bleeding out, moments until death.

835
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:40,630
And now you're faced with a situation like, oh, I want to save my buddy,

836
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,031
but this guy keeps hitting me.

837
00:42:42,091 --> 00:42:42,672
I can't do it.

838
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:46,915
We were trying to establish an exception with heightened emotions for the moment.

839
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:48,912
Here's another exception.

840
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,493
When an orc normally meets you,

841
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:52,853
they just usually announce themselves.

842
00:42:53,293 --> 00:42:54,354
Here's an exception to that.

843
00:42:54,374 --> 00:42:55,694
Ranger!

844
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:58,075
You see that orc?

845
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:03,056
He's so lazy, he can't even be bothered to taunt you.

846
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:05,556
Instead, I have to do it.

847
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:07,177
So, here goes.

848
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:10,538
You're ugly, and you're gonna die.

849
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:12,418
Stay put!

850
00:43:12,518 --> 00:43:15,559
All right, let's talk about shaming.

851
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:16,199
So.

852
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:22,412
When you shame it when you shame an orc what you're doing is you're putting your hands on his head and you're using your

853
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:30,433
Your elf magic to get into his mind and torture him and it was originally designed as an outlet for people who hate

854
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:34,954
Their orcs so much their enemies so much. They're like killing is not even good enough for you

855
00:43:34,974 --> 00:43:39,355
I want to torture you actually it ended up being a mechanic where you you

856
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:45,338
You need to lower their level so you shame him so that you can lower their level so that

857
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:48,119
you can, they can be low enough that you can recruit them onto your team.

858
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:55,502
And by the way, if you feel bad about torturing these guys, that's kind of cool because now

859
00:43:55,522 --> 00:43:58,303
you have these emotions like, oh, should I be doing this?

860
00:43:58,323 --> 00:44:00,603
You know, Italians kind of mean, am I kind of mean too?

861
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:06,413
Normally when you shame them, they're usually just angry about it.

862
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:09,195
They'll talk about it, about, oh, you shamed me never again.

863
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:11,277
They'll have a little scar on their face.

864
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,843
Once in a while, they'll be deranged, which means you have affected their mind in a permanent way.

865
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:20,425
They will never speak normally again.

866
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:25,569
Instead, they adopt this weird phrase often related to who they were before.

867
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:28,011
and they'll just repeat that over and over again.

868
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:29,932
Some players have regrets about this.

869
00:44:30,072 --> 00:44:31,573
Oh, did I just destroy his mind?

870
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,555
And then you can also get the double exception,

871
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:36,516
which is now you've deranged him,

872
00:44:36,536 --> 00:44:37,977
but you've created a maniac.

873
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:40,879
This guy will become the strongest orc you've ever met

874
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,461
and will chase you down,

875
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:44,362
and hopefully he'll be your nemesis.

876
00:44:44,442 --> 00:44:45,242
Of course, we don't know.

877
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,182
Okay, some examples of exceptions that we got

878
00:44:50,282 --> 00:44:52,843
because we were flexible, late development, okay?

879
00:44:53,163 --> 00:44:56,645
So in Shadow of Mordor, we got the screamer.

880
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,847
If you played the game, most everybody met a screamer orc,

881
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:02,468
which is basically just screams, he doesn't say anything,

882
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:03,389
and it's an exception.

883
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,709
And when people meet that, they're like,

884
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:07,151
oh, that's kind of weird, it's a little unnerving.

885
00:45:07,611 --> 00:45:08,271
So what did we do?

886
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:09,972
We quickly ran around, got the lines,

887
00:45:10,212 --> 00:45:13,134
we got the body animations, we subverted all the logic,

888
00:45:13,634 --> 00:45:15,095
and got it in and it worked great.

889
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:21,006
So in Shadow of War, here's an orc we got in kind of late.

890
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:22,147
One word.

891
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:25,749
I like his title because as soon as you find out who he is,

892
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,551
you can't wait to hear what he's going to say.

893
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:31,574
You know he's got to say one word, and only one word.

894
00:45:32,254 --> 00:45:34,196
And it turns out he says a different word each time

895
00:45:34,236 --> 00:45:35,797
you meet him, depending on the situation.

896
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:37,832
So he's kind of interesting.

897
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:39,953
Then there's these guys, Baz and Gaz.

898
00:45:40,213 --> 00:45:43,734
So you only meet Baz and Gaz if you play through the game

899
00:45:43,894 --> 00:45:45,555
and you've gotten through the story of Bruce.

900
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:47,416
Now Bruce you have to meet,

901
00:45:48,076 --> 00:45:51,418
and he's a scripted narrative kind of orc who we really like.

902
00:45:52,138 --> 00:45:53,519
He had a real good personality,

903
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,641
and he had an Australian accent,

904
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,602
and after you're done with him,

905
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,203
you're like, can we prolong the story?

906
00:45:59,243 --> 00:46:00,804
Yeah, so we added these guys,

907
00:46:00,904 --> 00:46:03,145
and they come, and they also have Australian accents,

908
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:04,406
and they have the same personality,

909
00:46:04,446 --> 00:46:06,047
and they show up really angry

910
00:46:06,087 --> 00:46:07,888
about how you were mean to Bruce.

911
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:09,569
We have this.

912
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,172
this orc trait called decoys.

913
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:14,394
So tricky orcs will sometimes have a gang

914
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:16,536
and their gang will all be dressed up just like them

915
00:46:16,576 --> 00:46:18,878
and even have the same iconography above them.

916
00:46:18,898 --> 00:46:20,339
You can't tell who is who

917
00:46:20,379 --> 00:46:23,121
and hopefully you'll be a little confused as you're fighting.

918
00:46:23,141 --> 00:46:25,022
Is this the real guy or is this just a decoy?

919
00:46:25,703 --> 00:46:27,404
And then this is one of our favorite,

920
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:29,066
is promoting to overlord.

921
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:30,207
If an orc kills you,

922
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:33,109
instead of just him being promoted a little bit,

923
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:34,810
he's promoted to overlord.

924
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:41,955
And now you can't actually find him until you get into that fortress, to a fort of salt,

925
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:43,796
and meet him in the throne room.

926
00:46:44,776 --> 00:46:45,576
That's really great too.

927
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:50,438
Here's an orc, I'm going to show you a video, the Inscrutable.

928
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:54,419
He's designed so that you can't quite understand what he's saying.

929
00:46:56,795 --> 00:46:58,576
Not as big as they say, eh you? Not nearly!

930
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:00,416
Spit to the man, all I got's a good build!

931
00:47:00,436 --> 00:47:01,757
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

932
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:03,718
You speak my language, do you?

933
00:47:04,138 --> 00:47:04,838
Speak blood, do you?

934
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:05,719
Speak guts?

935
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:09,580
Cause I don't reckon you'll be waiting for me to rip your throat out so fast it'll whistle!

936
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,863
All right, exceptions are only appreciated

937
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:19,905
if the players understand what's going on.

938
00:47:19,945 --> 00:47:21,206
And it comes down to messaging.

939
00:47:22,026 --> 00:47:25,108
Sometimes it isn't enough just to have dialogue

940
00:47:25,149 --> 00:47:26,209
explaining what's going on.

941
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:27,590
You gotta do more.

942
00:47:28,251 --> 00:47:30,752
We use the army screen, we use UI banners,

943
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:31,613
we try to do more.

944
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:37,296
We need to emphasize this even more, because sometimes there's confusion.

945
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:41,938
In the Army screen, we have some stories told, or in Quest Complete screens,

946
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,259
hey, this just happened, by the way.

947
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,119
Sometimes it's text, sometimes it's symbology.

948
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,420
Audio does a great part, too.

949
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,381
Sometimes the audio or the music will hush in such a way,

950
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:55,243
subconsciously telling you, hey, something really interesting is about to happen.

951
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:56,324
Pay attention.

952
00:47:57,464 --> 00:47:58,425
Here's a story about a...

953
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:03,424
messaging and how it kind of worked, kind of didn't work.

954
00:48:04,245 --> 00:48:08,046
So we saw a couple blogs of people who experienced this.

955
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:11,367
A follower will cheat death, and normally they'll just be

956
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:13,847
angry at you, and they'll look like this.

957
00:48:13,927 --> 00:48:16,208
But sometimes a follower will still be loyal, and they'll

958
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:20,289
say, hey, you thought I was dead, but I'm back, boss.

959
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,654
And some players don't quite understand that.

960
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:25,095
And they'll start hitting the orc

961
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:27,238
before they get a chance to swing at them.

962
00:48:27,258 --> 00:48:28,319
And of course, it's a follower.

963
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:29,761
And the follower just goes, ow, ow, ow.

964
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,244
And then the second exception kicks in,

965
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:34,566
which is if you hit your follower too many times,

966
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:35,888
then he'll betray you.

967
00:48:35,908 --> 00:48:36,929
And then you get this message.

968
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:39,071
And that's when the blogger says, wait.

969
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:40,578
What just happened?

970
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:42,799
You mean he was on my side this whole time

971
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:44,920
and I just forced him to betray me

972
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,782
and now I have to get him back again as a follower?

973
00:48:48,502 --> 00:48:49,883
So that's an interesting story

974
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:51,683
how messaging is really important.

975
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:55,835
So I talk so much about hate, let's talk about love.

976
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:58,458
So it's best to have both, love and hate.

977
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:01,042
So I would categorize, there's two types of love

978
00:49:01,082 --> 00:49:01,943
we wanna focus on.

979
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,645
One is nemesis withdrawal,

980
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:06,589
and the other is attachment to followers.

981
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,693
So for nemesis withdrawal, what we mean is,

982
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,857
Oh, that was my favorite enemy.

983
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:14,439
Oh, is he really dead now?

984
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,341
Oh, I had so much fun with him.

985
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:17,882
I hope he comes back.

986
00:49:18,543 --> 00:49:20,044
And we hear this a lot from players.

987
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:21,746
And so that's nice.

988
00:49:22,547 --> 00:49:24,269
We don't always control exactly what's happening.

989
00:49:24,649 --> 00:49:25,891
It has random elements to it,

990
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:30,175
but we like to foster that type of emotion.

991
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:33,738
Also, attachment to followers.

992
00:49:34,398 --> 00:49:36,299
It's natural when you have a follower

993
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:38,981
and you spend time nurturing him,

994
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,442
you have a feeling like, oh, I'm responsible for this guy.

995
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:43,583
Oh, I hope he does well.

996
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:45,924
You spend time thinking about what he's doing.

997
00:49:46,344 --> 00:49:49,746
You spend time thinking about how he can be more powerful

998
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,067
so that he can be a better follower.

999
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:54,668
Even the act of recruiting him.

1000
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:59,031
It's you saying to the game, I want to like this orc.

1001
00:49:59,151 --> 00:50:01,972
I have decided I'm going to care about him.

1002
00:50:03,273 --> 00:50:05,354
The other is orcs being helpful.

1003
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:07,495
And the orcs can be helpful in a number of ways.

1004
00:50:07,535 --> 00:50:09,155
Of course, they can help you kill enemies,

1005
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:10,176
which is the biggest deal,

1006
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:12,576
and they can bring you gifts.

1007
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:14,457
This is a new feature.

1008
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:15,998
We got into a patch recently

1009
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:19,359
when sometimes a follower will just show up

1010
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:20,539
out of nowhere and say,

1011
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,820
hey boss, here's a treasure orc,

1012
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,061
and he'll kill him for you.

1013
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,701
And then the best is the savior moments.

1014
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:29,882
Savior moments is when you think you're gonna die,

1015
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,302
and the orc saves you.

1016
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:32,363
This doesn't happen very much,

1017
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:34,624
but when it does, it's spectacular.

1018
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:35,104
Here's a video.

1019
00:50:35,124 --> 00:50:40,726
You don't believe me, do you?

1020
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:41,327
No!

1021
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:41,447
No!

1022
00:50:43,828 --> 00:50:43,928
No!

1023
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:45,568
No!

1024
00:50:45,588 --> 00:50:45,848
No!

1025
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:46,189
No!

1026
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:48,750
No!

1027
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:48,930
No!

1028
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:49,050
No!

1029
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:49,130
No!

1030
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:49,330
No!

1031
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:49,430
No!

1032
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:49,870
No!

1033
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,090
No!

1034
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:50,250
No!

1035
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:50,410
No!

1036
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:50,470
No!

1037
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:51,631
No!

1038
00:50:51,671 --> 00:50:51,711
No!

1039
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:58,734
Okay, and yet, is there always the inevitable betrayal?

1040
00:50:59,034 --> 00:51:00,734
Will the followers always betray me?

1041
00:51:01,234 --> 00:51:02,435
Well, it is their nature.

1042
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:04,975
It's kind of what their society is built on.

1043
00:51:05,015 --> 00:51:07,296
They often do, not always.

1044
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:11,357
It's also interesting to note that Talion and Celebrimbor

1045
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:14,878
don't really like the orcs as much as you, the player, do.

1046
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:18,319
Really, they see the orcs as tools,

1047
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:20,280
or just they wanna kill them.

1048
00:51:23,472 --> 00:51:25,113
But betrayals are kind of neat in a way

1049
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:29,535
that they can bring orcs back into the game as an enemy.

1050
00:51:29,675 --> 00:51:32,077
And now you've got another hill of the rollercoaster.

1051
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:34,178
More emotions to experience.

1052
00:51:34,218 --> 00:51:36,299
If you really like the orc, you wanna re-recruit him,

1053
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:37,299
go ahead.

1054
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,061
If you can, sometimes you can,

1055
00:51:39,901 --> 00:51:43,183
and then you can go through that process again.

1056
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:44,163
Try to keep him.

1057
00:51:44,384 --> 00:51:47,926
If he dies, you can always use your...

1058
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:53,888
use your necromancy skill late game and raise him from the dead and then you have a zombie follower

1059
00:51:54,468 --> 00:51:58,349
and then he won't betray you then of course that's a trade-off because he just he just groans then

1060
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:08,013
okay so uh here's an exception about love we talked a lot about love here is an exception to

1061
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:15,855
the love they told me about you but they didn't mention your beauty

1062
00:52:16,903 --> 00:52:18,924
No, sir, they did not.

1063
00:52:20,365 --> 00:52:22,727
Oh, you're mine now, love.

1064
00:52:23,428 --> 00:52:25,909
Forever and ever.

1065
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:29,692
Oh, and ever.

1066
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:32,654
OK.

1067
00:52:33,795 --> 00:52:35,917
Is it terrifying or glorious?

1068
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:39,279
Well, either way, it's great.

1069
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,340
For me, it's both.

1070
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:43,322
So.

1071
00:52:44,633 --> 00:52:47,556
In summary, so we don't know what the player's gonna do.

1072
00:52:47,676 --> 00:52:50,018
So there's so many random elements to the game.

1073
00:52:50,518 --> 00:52:53,301
We just seed the world with possibilities

1074
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:54,922
and we see what's gonna happen.

1075
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:58,966
In general, we can pick the good candidates

1076
00:52:59,006 --> 00:53:00,548
for specific events.

1077
00:53:00,908 --> 00:53:02,930
We can set up the timing of the events,

1078
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,773
but we don't know if you're going to like the orc,

1079
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:08,555
if it's gonna be an orc you remember,

1080
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:10,117
or if you're gonna kill him right away.

1081
00:53:10,577 --> 00:53:14,781
We're just trying to encourage these exceptional stories of hate and love.

1082
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:19,306
So I went to Reddit and I found a story to illustrate.

1083
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:23,109
This is Deoxys who wrote this story.

1084
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:28,294
He was killed by a grunt and the grunt was promoted to the gambler and he was angry so

1085
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:29,556
he decided to hunt down that.

1086
00:53:29,976 --> 00:53:35,841
Gambler and then he recruited him. He said you're gonna be in my team and together they killed enemies together, and it was really great

1087
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:40,745
He felt good about that, and then he was betrayed by the gambler and killed oh now

1088
00:53:40,786 --> 00:53:45,630
He was so angry so he hunted him down, and he says I'm gonna punish this guy worse than death

1089
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:48,933
I'm gonna shame him and he he lowered his level and he found him again

1090
00:53:48,973 --> 00:53:53,276
He shamed him a second time so he lowers level even more and at that moment

1091
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:57,320
the gambler became deranged and instead of speaking he started to just say,

1092
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,102
you never gave me a chance, you never gave me a chance.

1093
00:54:00,122 --> 00:54:02,764
And he felt really bad and so he recruited him again.

1094
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:10,250
And then they were together and then one time he was even saved by the gambler

1095
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:12,572
and he said, this is the greatest orc ever.

1096
00:54:15,524 --> 00:54:17,586
A good example of success, right?

1097
00:54:17,686 --> 00:54:20,649
A Nemesis story, even better than the stories

1098
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:25,514
are people talking about how they felt emotionally

1099
00:54:25,575 --> 00:54:27,597
about the game, how the game impacted them emotionally.

1100
00:54:27,977 --> 00:54:29,939
Here's a couple quotes, I'll read the first one.

1101
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:32,942
I went from seething rage to overzealous excitement

1102
00:54:33,543 --> 00:54:33,964
in 20 minutes.

1103
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:40,078
So yeah, this is really, really satisfying to see this.

1104
00:54:40,118 --> 00:54:42,380
It means we succeeded in inspiring players

1105
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,544
to feel these emotions, hate and love,

1106
00:54:46,564 --> 00:54:49,766
the satisfaction of defeating their nemesis eventually.

1107
00:54:50,827 --> 00:54:51,908
So that's the end of my talk.

1108
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:55,811
I hope you found it inspiring and memorable.

1109
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:55,891
And.

1110
00:54:56,352 --> 00:54:56,452
And.

1111
00:55:01,496 --> 00:55:01,576
And.

1112
00:55:01,676 --> 00:55:01,816
And.

1113
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:02,136
And.

1114
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:04,298
And.

1115
00:55:04,338 --> 00:55:04,418
And.

1116
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:04,578
And.

1117
00:55:04,618 --> 00:55:04,698
And.

1118
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:04,899
And.

1119
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,019
And.

1120
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:05,159
And.

1121
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,102
Okay, we got five minutes if anybody wants to ask questions.

1122
00:55:11,543 --> 00:55:14,064
Consider joining us at Monolith on what we're working on next.

1123
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:16,225
Awesome talk.

1124
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:17,006
Yeah, thanks.

1125
00:55:20,828 --> 00:55:21,008
Yeah.

1126
00:55:21,268 --> 00:55:21,508
Hello.

1127
00:55:23,027 --> 00:55:31,653
So this mechanic of you need to get defeated first to get this revenge loop and get better loot and so on.

1128
00:55:32,634 --> 00:55:38,338
Got this mechanic exploited at some point or was it a danger that...

1129
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:46,689
Okay, I get better loot if I let the orc defeat me, because then I can do the revenge without it happening.

1130
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:54,340
Yeah, that's a good question. So, could people exploit her by dying intentionally to get better loot and so they become more powerful?

1131
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:59,763
Well, if you do, you will have an orc who then also gets a nice story.

1132
00:55:59,883 --> 00:56:02,704
And sometimes you don't always kill him successfully,

1133
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:05,485
so you're already engaging in a way that we want you.

1134
00:56:05,906 --> 00:56:09,127
And the impact of the loot is minor enough

1135
00:56:09,187 --> 00:56:11,288
that the variety of the orcs is great enough.

1136
00:56:11,408 --> 00:56:13,269
We don't know if it's going to actually...

1137
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:17,751
We doubt that it will actually impact your success to such a substantial degree.

1138
00:56:21,012 --> 00:56:24,942
Do you have the data on the most number of times someone was killed by the same orc?

1139
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,752
Well, we do know that some people intentionally die

1140
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:30,553
to the same orc over and over on purpose.

1141
00:56:30,773 --> 00:56:33,714
I mean, we have stories and data to show that,

1142
00:56:34,114 --> 00:56:36,596
like, I'm going to shame an orc down to level one,

1143
00:56:36,616 --> 00:56:37,996
and then I'm gonna die over and over and over and over

1144
00:56:38,096 --> 00:56:39,617
until he is max level,

1145
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:41,538
and then I'm going to shame him back down.

1146
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:44,920
And so we have data that says, like, several hundred times,

1147
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,061
but I don't think that's accidental.

1148
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:48,141
I think that's all intentional.

1149
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:50,702
It's hard to know what players are doing intentionally.

1150
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:54,697
Awesome talk, thank you.

1151
00:56:55,137 --> 00:56:56,778
What would your recommendations be for someone

1152
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:59,280
who wanted to make a similar system

1153
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,600
but with a different play mechanic,

1154
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,082
like you were trading with the orcs or dating the orcs?

1155
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:07,824
Yeah, gosh, I don't know.

1156
00:57:11,853 --> 00:57:13,513
It's such a monumental amount of work,

1157
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:15,194
and it's so complicated.

1158
00:57:15,514 --> 00:57:16,895
So I hope you have a large team,

1159
00:57:17,135 --> 00:57:22,517
and I guess my advice would be focus really narrowly

1160
00:57:22,557 --> 00:57:24,398
if you can, because it's gonna end up

1161
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:26,418
exploding in scope before you know it.

1162
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:27,939
Thanks.

1163
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:30,340
And try to make things memorable,

1164
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,460
I think that's a key, yeah.

1165
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:34,441
All right, thanks everybody.
