00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:13,003
Hello, welcome to this ask me anything session. I'm Alex Waro from Gamasutra and I am joined today by

2
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:19,125
Take This executive director Eve Creviche. Eve, thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,686
Thank you, Alex. I appreciate it.

4
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:27,276
We were joking just before this started that you were going to introduce me as take two

5
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:30,137
director and you managed it.

6
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:31,337
I didn't even joke.

7
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:32,298
It was so close.

8
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:32,798
I was like, hmm.

9
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:37,699
Now the important thing about this session is that these fine folks in chat are going

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,620
to get to ask you questions about your work and your role in the industry and sort of

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,480
where you see it going.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,781
So folks in chat, please drop questions in.

13
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:51,162
Use the question feature to upload stuff and we are going to serve up your finest questions.

14
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:52,636
I'm really excited.

15
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:56,059
And with that, I'm also going to mute Slack,

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,382
because of course, these are the things

17
00:00:58,422 --> 00:00:59,663
we need to do these days.

18
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:01,825
Yeah, I probably need to mute a couple of different things.

19
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,049
As you go about clicking all these buttons

20
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,790
and muting all the real things, why don't you,

21
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:10,112
as you feel comfortable, sort of fill us in

22
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:11,694
on what you've been doing at TakeThis recently

23
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,115
and sort of how you got into the industry.

24
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:28,712
Yeah, absolutely. So I've been at take this for two years now. And in that time, I really focused the work that we do on health to be to to be on root causes. So what are the things that

25
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:36,624
um that cause mental distress and what are the the factors that can that we can change that can help

26
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:42,846
people experience better mental health in the game industry um as they play games and in

27
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:49,547
communities that surround games and in streaming environments and so we think a lot uh about what

28
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:55,689
are the things we can do to create systemic change and what are the ways that we can

29
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,949
normalize a conversation about mental health.

30
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,543
and mental well-being and self-care so that people understand that it's, one, okay and

31
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:09,109
normal to not be okay, and two, it's really fantastic to get help and seek support from

32
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,631
communities, from mental health professionals, etc.

33
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:17,596
So we want to work to normalize the conversation from the individual level, and we also want

34
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:22,020
to work to change the conditions that make mental wellness more possible in games.

35
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,252
Right on, yeah, it's a it does the organization.

36
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,293
We've already got some very good questions here in chat.

37
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,655
I'm just going to throw them at you if you don't mind.

38
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:29,735
Awesome. Yeah, please do.

39
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,717
Nice. We have one here from Danny.

40
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:35,581
They want to know, are demographic splits a serious consideration

41
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,643
when tackling mental health and games or are most concepts and concerns

42
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:39,885
universal among all players?

43
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:44,064
Oh, that's a great question, Danny.

44
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:53,631
Yeah. So there are there are both really substantial cultural differences in the way people understand and talk about mental health and mental well-being.

45
00:02:54,451 --> 00:03:03,277
And then there are also differences in outcomes and the experience that different demographics have with mental health care in particular.

46
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,958
So you have.

47
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:10,139
culturally and geographically really dramatic differences in the way people

48
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,800
understand what it means to have mental well-being

49
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,101
and how that is treated or talked about culturally.

50
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:20,582
And take this really functions best in a European,

51
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:24,003
Western European and North American context because that's

52
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:29,724
what our version of mental health is. That's what we're familiar with

53
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:30,305
culturally.

54
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:38,511
The other thing, yeah, and then in terms of the demographic differences in the experience

55
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:46,973
of mental health care, you know, there's a lot of really good history, documentation about the

56
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:54,736
specific ways in which Black people have been pathologized.

57
00:03:55,343 --> 00:04:02,891
through mental health care in really awful and prejudicial ways. And so there's historical

58
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:09,058
distrust and history of mistreatment of Black people in mental health care, for example.

59
00:04:09,578 --> 00:04:14,984
So yes, the answer is yes. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense.

60
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:21,906
Frustratingly, in a conversation like this, we could then go for another 20 minutes, I think, just talking about strategies to deal with that.

61
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:25,287
But there's already a bunch of other fantastic questions in here.

62
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:32,529
Do you want to sort of jump over for a sec as we sort of expand the topic and look at, let's see, Tamla here had a good question.

63
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,971
How do you address mental health and alarm based chat in your workplace?

64
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:44,694
I guess sort of so how people are beginning to discuss feeling strain, feeling mental unwellness, that kind of thing.

65
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:45,114
How do you.

66
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,828
How do you address that kind of conversation in an office environment?

67
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,969
Hmm. Yeah.

68
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,310
Especially since quarantine and since the pandemic has started,

69
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,652
that's been a really big deal and something we've we've created.

70
00:04:57,712 --> 00:04:59,953
Some workshops that we've offered to a couple of places

71
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,834
and we've created a lot of resources.

72
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:04,536
We have actually a whole series of articles on our website,

73
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:09,818
TakeThis.org, on coping with workplace stress and stress in general.

74
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:14,340
Yeah. I mean, the short answer is yes.

75
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,902
The longer answer is that the game industry

76
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:26,207
is prone to burnout. It's a really major problem, and that's caused by the high levels of uncertainty

77
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:32,690
that people experience in the game industry and the cultural norms in the industry that relate to

78
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:40,354
kind of passion, this myth of passion, where you come and you put all of yourself into your work.

79
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:44,375
And you have very little separation and very few boundaries.

80
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:50,439
And that leads to burnout and stress and anxiety, which

81
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,943
and so so it's really it is the responsibility of supervisors

82
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:59,846
and company leaders to have their pulse, their eyes on the pulse

83
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,728
and to understand where and be able to recognize signs of burnout and stress

84
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,410
and to to mitigate those.

85
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:12,307
And there's responses that are kind of personal and individual.

86
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:15,730
And then there's responses and mitigation efforts

87
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,772
that can happen at a company or structural level.

88
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,977
In terms of what's happening specifically in the pandemic,

89
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:29,541
there's a really major increase among managers in and out

90
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:33,664
of work while exhausting.

91
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:39,465
in terms of providing support to the team.

92
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:47,608
I agree. I hadn't really considered the new burdens being placed upon folks for communication

93
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,069
and sort of maintain team morale.

94
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,552
On an individual level, for folks who are logging in from home now

95
00:06:56,832 --> 00:07:00,174
for months and months at a time, logging into this conference,

96
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,296
maybe this one we can dig in there about this Nathaniel.

97
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:11,094
The first thing is that after a data convention like this, I already feel overwhelmed and

98
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:11,854
a bit depressed.

99
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:16,096
Is there any way to help with dealing with this?

100
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:23,079
I know we don't want to dig into specific strategies, but as people who are logging

101
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,160
in from home and either feeling very isolated or overwhelmed or perhaps both.

102
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:32,729
What sort of suggestions would you have for how to deal with that?

103
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:38,430
Yeah, I mean this is a very non-technical term, but FOMO, right?

104
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:44,992
There's a couple things going on when you engage in a really intense experience,

105
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:51,193
like an online conference. One is you feel like you have to see it all,

106
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:53,674
and you have to catch it all, and that's too much.

107
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:59,816
Right? So if you are feeling overwhelmed at the end of today, that means probably that you've

108
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:04,318
done more than you needed to do. You don't have to catch it all. All of this is recorded. All of

109
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:12,241
this is going to be online, download, you know, or most of it. And that's okay. It's okay to miss

110
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:19,304
things. It's okay to take breaks and step away. And that's, in fact, quite healthy. We as humans

111
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:23,426
don't have the capacity to just keep going and going and going and going.

112
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:31,832
In the case of this particular experience and in the case of work in general, we do better when we take breaks.

113
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:35,974
That's why crunch is so harmful, because it actually, we are less effective when we work too much.

114
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:39,616
Our brain stops functioning at its normal level and our body as well.

115
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:44,699
So taking more breaks and allowing yourself to miss things.

116
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:50,695
And also video interaction and online interaction taxes us emotionally.

117
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:58,761
You know, I'm talking about this emotional labor because we don't get the same type of interface with people.

118
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:00,703
And so we have to fill in the blanks a lot.

119
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,084
And so our brains have to work harder.

120
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:02,745
And that is.

121
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:15,666
taxing. And so just knowing that we are having to correct for a suboptimal experience in this time.

122
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:22,148
Yeah, for sure. And also, you're not alone. That's a normal experience right now. This is a very

123
00:09:22,248 --> 00:09:29,011
strange experience. And those of us who've been to GDC before, we know that this is not GDC that

124
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:33,652
we're used to, right? This is a very different experience, and it's a little bit disappointing.

125
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:34,593
And that's okay.

126
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,136
Absolutely, yeah.

127
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,721
There's a bunch of great questions, of course, but I don't want to let one slip by.

128
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:42,765
It was asked a little while ago by Matt, and I think it's important.

129
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:43,927
A lot of people have voted it up.

130
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:47,111
Matt wants to know, do you happen to have any experience with veterans,

131
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,514
and gaming as it pertains to the mental health of veterans?

132
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:57,150
Mm. Well, I would actually refer people to a great organization that we partner with

133
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,493
called Stack Up. And they're a fantastic organization that works specifically with

134
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:11,256
veterans. The issue of mental health for veterans is really a major one, and it's a real challenging

135
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:16,219
one. And take this, we don't specialize in working with veterans. That's a very specific

136
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,940
set of needs and population and culture that's very particular. You know, we

137
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,763
Take This prides itself on being game literate, or veteran literate.

138
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:30,549
And so I would say, you know, there are some great organizations out there that

139
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:35,272
do know how to respond to veterans in a very particular way, and StackUp in particular comes

140
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:40,377
to mind. Yeah, I think that's a great recommendation. And relevant to Take This' work,

141
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:44,660
there was a question here from Danger who wants to know, how can a psychologist or

142
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,322
a licensed counselor get involved to support Take This' mission?

143
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:52,668
Oh, awesome question. We love to have more people get involved.

144
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:57,092
Right now, actually, we're recruiting for our first ever AFK Online.

145
00:10:57,112 --> 00:11:01,897
So our AFK room is a quiet, supportive space at conventions that we provide.

146
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:05,000
And it's staffed by clinical and non-clinical volunteers.

147
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,063
And we're spinning up for PAX Online.

148
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:09,154
First ever online AFK room.

149
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:10,535
We need volunteers.

150
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,856
If you go to our website to our contact us page,

151
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,317
you can get in touch with us.

152
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:19,540
And I or one of my colleagues to you in short order.

153
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,941
All right, let's jump back to the thought

154
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:25,763
of mental health and game companies specifically.

155
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,505
Josh asks, some companies have been introducing

156
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,965
mindfulness training as a form

157
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:31,346
of encouraging mental health awareness.

158
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:33,287
Do you feel this is an effective strategy

159
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:34,648
towards opening the larger discussion

160
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:36,249
of normalizing mental wellness?

161
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,108
Hmm, that's a great question.

162
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:42,451
So, mindfulness is a really powerful tool.

163
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:49,857
And it's a tool that's used in a couple of really great therapeutic approaches.

164
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,519
But it's just one of many tools.

165
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,484
It's one that's kind of easily accessible, especially because there's all these mindfulness apps out there.

166
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:01,786
Headspace comes to mind is the biggest one, right?

167
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:02,947
A lot of people know about it.

168
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:07,612
And it feels like an easy add, I think, for a lot of companies.

169
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:12,394
I don't think, I think it's a great idea, but it's like, it's not a panacea, right?

170
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:15,315
It's a starting point. And it's one of many tools.

171
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,576
And for some people, it may not be the right tool,

172
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,597
or it may not be the right delivery mechanism.

173
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:23,058
So other people need other things.

174
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:25,999
But mindfulness, you know, mindfulness is super powerful.

175
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,520
I have found it personally extremely useful.

176
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:34,815
It's been transformative to me.

177
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:41,819
But but it's this is, you know, mental well-being is a very personal

178
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,320
individual thing, and everybody's on their own path.

179
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:50,263
And so one size fits all approach is never going to work for for everybody.

180
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,023
Yeah, I completely agree.

181
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:54,025
There was actually another question sort of relevant.

182
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:57,387
I think there was Nathaniel asked a little while ago,

183
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,748
how can companies and game companies specifically go about presenting?

184
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:06,555
issues regarding mental health in a way that helps people understand how they might feel.

185
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:14,360
And I assume that's sort of a general empathy and understanding of the, yeah. What do you think?

186
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:21,424
Yeah, so that's a great, that's a really great question and a really powerful one too.

187
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,260
There's a couple of bits to my answer.

188
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:31,041
One is that games themselves tell stories

189
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:34,782
and create metaphors for the way we understand the world,

190
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:38,083
and they both reflect society and can shape society,

191
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:38,703
can shape culture.

192
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:41,824
And so we have at our disposal in games

193
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:44,184
an extraordinarily powerful tool

194
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:48,385
to shape the conversation around mental health

195
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:50,426
and mental wellbeing in general.

196
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:52,906
There's some amazing games that have come out

197
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:53,866
in the last few years.

198
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:03,626
that either represent self-care in a wonderful way or show a really accurate example of mental

199
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:13,013
illness or help to kind of walk people down the road of what it looks like and feels like to be

200
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:19,457
in a certain state. Some of the ones that we've highlighted recently are Celeste and

201
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:24,401
Stardew Valley and Gris and Sea of Solitude and of course Hellblades, Senua's Sacrifice.

202
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:31,429
And so the good representation of mental health in games is really important.

203
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:38,334
The other piece that I think is really important is to talk about how we use communities

204
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:42,337
and the culture and norms inside game communities,

205
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:44,218
like in-game interaction and like...

206
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:53,347
community around games to shape the way we talk about ourselves and to help

207
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:57,491
people understand how they relate to each other and what's good so we can

208
00:14:57,712 --> 00:15:04,919
change the norms to reflect positive support for mental health and well-being.

209
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:13,066
and positive interactions. Victoria Tran actually earlier today gave a great talk on

210
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:20,412
creating positive community environments. Her work at Kitfox Games is just fantastic,

211
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:29,179
and there are many others who think about this work as well. There's many ways that we can

212
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,443
use our power as shapers and creators of community.

213
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:43,970
shared online spaces to set norms around positive online environments. We have, Take This has

214
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:49,895
streaming ambassadors who do that in their streaming environments. They're moderators and

215
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:55,399
they themselves are really well trained and experienced in creating positive environments

216
00:15:55,599 --> 00:16:04,146
and in shaping spaces that promote empathy and demonstrate empathy inside their communities.

217
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:06,685
That's super cool. Yeah, it's really cool.

218
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,586
We kind of already addressed this question, but I wonder if we can dig into it a little more.

219
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:14,107
Daniel asked a little while ago, when building online communities,

220
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,588
what is the best way to approach harassment and mental health?

221
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,169
They've already talked about the actual players themselves.

222
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:22,350
But I wonder for, you know, since you do so much work with game companies

223
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,951
and game makers, for people who are working on online games,

224
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:28,352
who are embedded in online communities and maybe.

225
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:35,737
How do they deal with and how do they regulate the levels of harassment and

226
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:39,160
kind of just mental drain that they are often subjected to in a role like that

227
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,762
where you're public facing inside a game company?

228
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,144
Have you seen any experience with that?

229
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:43,444
Have you?

230
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:44,024
Yeah.

231
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:44,585
Yeah.

232
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:49,209
We, um, yeah, we've actually worked with a number of companies to help, um,

233
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:51,371
help their community teams.

234
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:52,732
Uh,

235
00:16:54,269 --> 00:17:00,593
Either navigate, learn to set boundaries and learn, develop some skills around that so

236
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,155
that they can better protect themselves.

237
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:11,401
And also to understand better how to support people who are experiencing harassment.

238
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:12,082
Yeah.

239
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:12,562
Right.

240
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:20,868
But, but ultimately, the experience of dealing with toxicity and harassment, which is endemic

241
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:22,670
to the industry and a major problem.

242
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:24,019
Um

243
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,364
is the responsibility not of individual moderators and employees, but of companies

244
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:38,349
to develop structures that address it directly. And that means really strong technical solutions,

245
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:47,357
but also creating and being really steadfast in creating zero-tolerance harassment policies and

246
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:52,461
positive communities. There's a lot of good research out there that you can teach people

247
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,982
empathy by

248
00:17:55,427 --> 00:18:02,672
Introducing them to community environments that promote empathy and that you can change people's

249
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:09,497
behavior by bringing them into a community in a positive and constructive way. And that only

250
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:16,282
happens when the community is intentionally designed. And that only happens when a company

251
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:19,204
is intentionally designed.

252
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:27,544
And so the issue of toxicity and harassment does not start at the community design level.

253
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:31,087
It starts at the company dynamic and leadership level.

254
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:37,873
Because if you have a company that accepts as its premise that harassment isn't okay

255
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:42,417
and is unacceptable, and that we want a positive space for our,

256
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:48,622
and a welcoming space for everyone who wants to play our game, then you can design for that.

257
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,933
And only when you design for that can you get to the place where it's possible in a community.

258
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:59,675
That's a long process, but that's where it starts.

259
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:08,540
Yeah, it does seem like, you know, especially with recent events at Ubisoft and elsewhere, like if you don't have buy-in and significant

260
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:18,285
interest in enacting change at senior levels, that it doesn't, it seems like very challenging to enact serious, you know, company-wide change.

261
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:23,576
It's, I would, I would actually, it's not very challenging.

262
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:24,277
It's impossible.

263
00:19:24,737 --> 00:19:25,998
Oh, fair enough.

264
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:26,779
Yeah, absolutely.

265
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,180
Yeah.

266
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,703
There is a question about this that I want to get back to real quick.

267
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:32,884
Here we go.

268
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:37,908
Austin recently asked, do you know of any proven practices you can recommend that a

269
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:41,771
development firm can implement to foster a culture that's supportive of those living

270
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:43,332
with or suffering from mental illness?

271
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,762
Mm. Oh gosh, that's the whole time, but proven practices.

272
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:48,163
What do you think?

273
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:52,065
Proven practices. Gosh, I mean, that's a

274
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:57,169
it's not it's not proven practices.

275
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,654
It's it's a culture that emphasizes humanity.

276
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,537
That recognizes people's needs as people.

277
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:15,689
That is highly transparent and that provides respect to people.

278
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:23,594
That provides the space and good boundaries to allow people to undertake good self-care.

279
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:33,179
So good boundaries means good work hour limits, good boundaries around how much of your life

280
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,961
is involved in your work.

281
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:40,775
good boundaries around when you can walk away completely.

282
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:47,440
So it's about an orientation towards balance and wellness.

283
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:53,245
And a support for that at the company level,

284
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:57,728
like an active advocating for people to leave,

285
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:01,171
to take breaks, to understand what's going on,

286
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,313
to feel empowered to participate

287
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:04,594
and have their opinion heard.

288
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,090
Yeah, yeah, there's a whole series of things like that.

289
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,592
Yeah, that sounds, those all make a lot of sense to me.

290
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:14,713
And it's, it sounds like it really depends

291
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:16,114
on the environment, the team size,

292
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,535
and sort of what kind of, you know,

293
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:19,856
whether it's an indie or a big company,

294
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:20,517
I mean, that kind of thing.

295
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:24,239
Yes, yeah, it shifts dramatically at a large company,

296
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:28,001
especially a large company with, you know,

297
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,142
public companies, I think, are in a very different position

298
00:21:30,462 --> 00:21:32,463
than private studios, privately held studios.

299
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:33,324
Absolutely.

300
00:21:33,664 --> 00:21:33,764
Yeah.

301
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:38,776
There was another question here about a specific person's struggles.

302
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:39,137
Here we go.

303
00:21:39,157 --> 00:21:43,820
Someone asks, Leah asks, what suggestions do you have for someone with a diagnosed mental

304
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,183
health issue who wants to reduce stigma around it through visibility, but also doesn't want

305
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,604
to cause discord with teammates who might not understand?

306
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:57,589
How do people who have unique needs and who struggle with mental health express and make

307
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:01,691
those struggles public and visible without detracting from the team, I guess?

308
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:12,239
Yeah, that's a tough one because there's enough stigma about mental health and mental illness

309
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,924
that people get really afraid when you start talking about it. The recommendation,

310
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:25,088
so this is something actually we're actively working on and we've got our second annual.

311
00:22:25,905 --> 00:22:27,747
a game summit on mental health.

312
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,068
It's called TIGS.

313
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,809
And I work in partnership with Mark Chandler on this.

314
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,192
And we are we are in October.

315
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:39,554
We're going to be sharing stories of people in the game industry

316
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:42,276
with mental health, mental illness and

317
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:47,059
and talking specifically about that so that we can reduce the stigma.

318
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:50,301
And it's really about sharing as many of those stories as possible.

319
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:53,103
But but one of the ways to do that is to

320
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:57,205
Bring as much data to the conversation as possible.

321
00:22:57,505 --> 00:23:04,808
So when you talk about your diagnosis, also describe what it looks like and talk about

322
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:08,029
what accommodation looks like and what you don't need.

323
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:15,813
You know, I don't need sympathy or I don't need you to feel sorry for me.

324
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:20,395
I need, you know, specific accommodations or just...

325
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:27,000
I need you to know and I need you to be able to look at me and see me as the full person

326
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,460
that I am.

327
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:28,941
Yeah.

328
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:29,241
Yeah.

329
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:34,364
You know, it reminds me of, you know, we spoke briefly before this about the myth of passion

330
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:38,947
and how it can be sort of turned against game developers to sort of burn them out and that

331
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:39,808
kind of thing.

332
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:46,752
I wonder, do you have any thoughts on how workers in this industry can sort of avoid

333
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,113
being...

334
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:59,047
You know, like, you know, pulled by the by the by passion and by the call of their collaborators to work beyond their limits or to push their mental health into sort of unhealthy states.

335
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:11,092
So this is this. I'm not going to sugarcoat this one, because it's a tough one to answer. Because if you're in a company where the expectation is that you work and you work too much,

336
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:18,420
and you put all of yourself into your work, and your supervisors and seniors do the same thing,

337
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:23,602
it's going to feel like if you don't, you're going to lose your job.

338
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:28,563
And if you're stuck in that job because you need it and can't leave and can't move out of it,

339
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:34,725
that's a tough place to be in, right? Because

340
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:41,572
What managers do and what leaders do sets the tone for the whole company.

341
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:56,024
So if you are a manager and a leader, even if you tell your employees that they don't need to work, you know, 50, 60, 80 hours a week, and you do, you are putting pressure on them to do that.

342
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:56,944
Right.

343
00:24:56,964 --> 00:25:04,150
So and when I say when I speak to managers and leaders right now, I say you even if you think you're not pressuring your employees.

344
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:11,513
If you do that, if you do that bad thing, they will think they have to, and that is bad.

345
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:16,257
So you need to be good about setting limits and being an example,

346
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:19,540
because that only comes from the top. Full stop.

347
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,343
And I have to, as the executive director of Take This,

348
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:29,147
I have to check myself, too, in that I have to stop.

349
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,909
I have to articulate that I am leaving my desk,

350
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:33,750
that I am walking away, that I am disconnecting,

351
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,892
so that I know that my employees,

352
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:38,413
and so that my employees know that they can, right?

353
00:25:40,475 --> 00:25:41,015
But in,

354
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:53,761
The other thing is to really cultivate in yourself a lot of other passions and other

355
00:25:53,822 --> 00:26:03,384
ways to enjoy yourself, right? Even if it is still related to games, as long as it is

356
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:10,726
explicitly not your work, but it's something slightly different, that's great.

357
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:21,095
Giving yourself explicit ways to leave and shut off will give you the energy and space

358
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:25,078
to reenergize and take care of yourself.

359
00:26:25,598 --> 00:26:26,819
That's really important.

360
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:31,661
I think I answered the question.

361
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:34,263
Yeah, I think those are the things that are pertinent.

362
00:26:34,283 --> 00:26:35,404
Absolutely.

363
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:36,044
Yeah.

364
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:38,305
That's something we've been talking around this whole conversation is.

365
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:40,745
It's those kind of challenges.

366
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,487
Something before, we have about five minutes left.

367
00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:43,648
So if anyone wants to get your questions,

368
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:44,629
please get them in quick.

369
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,393
There was a good one here about 10 minutes ago from Thomas,

370
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:50,535
but it's still a good one now, and I want to get to it.

371
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:53,678
Thomas asks, how do we as an industry create real change

372
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,681
in scheduling deadlines, launch dates, et cetera,

373
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:58,302
while keeping things like mental health, burnout,

374
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:01,085
and so on in mind, without fear of being replaced

375
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:02,787
by the newer, younger generation

376
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:03,928
who haven't hit these walls yet?

377
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:10,269
Is that a thing you regularly deal with in your own work, is sort of the aging problems

378
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:14,999
industry has where older workers seem to have a hard time getting employed when younger

379
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:15,500
folks don't?

380
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:23,138
Yeah, it is. Although there's some evidence that the population, the game industry population,

381
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:29,263
is actually aging a little bit, which indicates there's maybe a shift around that now.

382
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,646
There is a lot of burnout, which definitely chases people out of the industry

383
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:37,648
pretty quickly, on average around 10 years in.

384
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:40,217
which we are concerned about.

385
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:47,941
But I would say the answer to this is that there are good models out there for more transparent

386
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:53,183
and more participatory scheduling and planning processes that help to kind of mitigate these

387
00:27:53,243 --> 00:27:53,603
issues.

388
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:59,766
We're working on some tools and resources in partnership with the IGDA that hopefully

389
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:01,087
we'll be able to talk about soon.

390
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:08,163
around this stuff. It's about training. The industry is an interesting place. It's not

391
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:11,804
actually that old of an industry, and so it's kind of still catching up to itself in terms

392
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:16,625
of professionalization and skill building around management, planning, forecasting, etc.

393
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:23,547
And so it's time for the industry really to mature around that stuff. And I hope to be part of the

394
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:26,288
positive push towards that in the industry.

395
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:29,939
Yeah, I hope so. I mean, I hope you're a part of it for a long time to come.

396
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,780
Eve, thank you so much for joining us today.

397
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:33,622

401
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,971
and we work together.

402
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:50,628

Nice.

407
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:02,205
And there was an event coming up, right?

408
00:29:02,225 --> 00:29:03,046
Did I remember that right?

409
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,587
Are you guys working on that for this year?

410
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:05,508
Is that as far as you can tell?

411
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:06,369
Yeah, we have an event coming up

412
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:07,610
the 7th and 8th of October,

413
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,592
the International Game Summit on Mental Health.

414
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:12,455
Yep, that's one we partner on.

415
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:14,937
And we've got a lot of other stuff in the works

416
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,659
over the next few months.

417
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,001
I'm just really looking forward to it.

418
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:19,782
So keep an eye on us.

419
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:21,523
Yeah, no, absolutely we will.

420
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:22,344
Thank you guys so much

421
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:24,686
and enjoy the rest of your GDC summer.
