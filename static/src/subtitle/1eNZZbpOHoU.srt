1
00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:06,624
How to get a job writing for games.

2
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:09,268
My name is Zach Aris, I'm the creative director

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,331
at Deck Nine Games.

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,939
I'm Tracy John, studio lead of narrative design at King.

5
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:17,020
So, thanks for coming.

6
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:18,903
Yeah, thanks for coming.

7
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:22,759
Why are we giving a talk about how to become a narrative designer?

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,701
It's because game writing is awesome.

9
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:30,984
It's one of the most, I think, privileged things you can do for a living,

10
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,185
is getting to craft interactive story.

11
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:35,947
It's really fun.

12
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:39,810
But the industry is really difficult to get into.

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,272
There's an opacity about how to get a job as a game writer

14
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:46,054
that we really want to kind of challenge and talk about.

15
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,551
And both Tracy and I have very different journeys

16
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,753
through our careers, and we thought it would be really fun

17
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:56,135
to kind of talk about what our stories are

18
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:57,936
from both angles.

19
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:01,498
So, we'll start, I'll introduce myself.

20
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:03,379
I'm Zach.

21
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,681
The first game I published as a narrative designer

22
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:07,061
was Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning.

23
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,263
I worked on several RPGs before that

24
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,103
that were never released.

25
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:14,886
Then I went to college later in life, because I'm kind of a weirdo.

26
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:18,807
I studied classics, so ancient history, ancient myth, Latin, Greek.

27
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:22,029
Then I worked in TV for a bit.

28
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,910
Worked on the show Criminal Minds Beyond Borders, did some indie stuff.

29
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:29,259
And my last game was Life is Strange Before the Storm,

30
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,121
where I was the narrative director at Deck Nine,

31
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:35,764
and I was responsible for hiring and training

32
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:37,746
and leading the writers room that produced

33
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,188
a 1,500 page script for that game.

34
00:01:40,648 --> 00:01:42,630
And I'm currently the creative director at Deck Nine,

35
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,372
driving our story-driven studio.

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,889
And a little bit about me.

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,230
So I had a bit of a weird career as well.

38
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,251
Weirdo in a different way though.

39
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,792
I started off actually as a games journalist

40
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,152
where I interviewed a lot of developers

41
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:00,972
and learned about the process of making games.

42
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:03,633
So I liked that so much I applied for a job

43
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:06,694
and got a job as a narrative designer at Gameloft

44
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:08,774
where I worked on licensed games and original IP.

45
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:14,818
After doing that for a couple years, I took a break from games and I went to do some corporate work.

46
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:20,361
But I included UX design for mobile apps and VR and doing some work for advertising.

47
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:24,883
But after that, I miss games so much, so I came back to King, where I am now.

48
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:29,486
So that's just to give you a little background about us,

49
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,487
but we can launch right into our tips

50
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,728
for the application process.

51
00:02:34,428 --> 00:02:36,249
So first thing we get a lot of questions about

52
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:39,511
is the portfolio, where you want to present

53
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:40,711
your summaries of your best work,

54
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:41,812
and you want to be specific,

55
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:42,952
and you want to contextualize it.

56
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:46,734
So of course, CV, duh, you should definitely include that.

57
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:49,976
But also your published game work, if you have any.

58
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,017
If you don't have any published game work,

59
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,899
published game work, or published non-game work

60
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,260
is also great to put here.

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,002
But with that, also do whatever you put,

62
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:00,162
your best writing work.

63
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,324
So whether you've been published or not,

64
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:05,946
pick the stuff that you feel represents your best work.

65
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:08,856
And then from there, you want to, of course,

66
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:11,219
put work that's related to the jobs that you're applying for.

67
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,362
For example, if you're applying for a mobile game company

68
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,344
with a lot of match-three games, make

69
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:19,288
sure you have stuff that exemplifies that and not

70
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,769
just 100-page movie scripts.

71
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,471
So just think about that kind of thing.

72
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:28,914
And then of course, don't put too much. You don't have to put your entire body of work in your portfolio.

73
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:32,095
A lot of times employers won't necessarily be able to look through everything,

74
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:35,116
so pick your top work and put it on there.

75
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:39,698
And I would also say here, don't necessarily put writing tests that you've done for other jobs.

76
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:46,906
I just think, that's my personal opinion, I think Zach feels similar, but I would not do that.

77
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:50,990
It's more just to show that, you know, I don't want to see that you've necessarily applied to all these other places.

78
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:56,096
I don't want to see the great work you've done for other game companies, even though it's a lot of hard work.

79
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:57,598
Keep that for yourself.

80
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:06,822
Sorry, I'll show me. So some other tips though, as well for portfolio. I would

81
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:11,686
say if you can get help from a graphic designer or use a lot easy to read

82
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:15,089
website templates, there's a lot of stuff out there now. There's kind of no excuse

83
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,612
for a really ugly, illegible portfolio, even if you use a WordPress blog, a

84
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:23,055
Tumblr, there's a lot of templates out there that can really make your

85
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,016
portfolio legible.

86
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,269
If you can, describe what you did for the game.

87
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,110
I get a lot of portfolios that show me

88
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,511
like an awesome trailer and splash image

89
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:35,112
and there's nothing wrong with including that.

90
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:38,073
But maybe tell me a little bit about what you did.

91
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:39,453
Did you write the opening cinematic?

92
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:40,434
Did you write VOBarks?

93
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:41,594
Did you write the UI text?

94
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:44,235
Give me, you don't have to put the actual scripts

95
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:46,296
for those things, but at least explain

96
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:48,457
and give a little bit of context about what you did

97
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:50,937
for this amazing launch trailer game.

98
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,845
Yeah, so if you've never actually published a game,

99
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,708
or if you're working on something exciting,

100
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:02,510
but it's under NDA and you can't talk about it,

101
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,012
which is super frustrating when you have to apply

102
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:07,755
for a new gig, there's still ways that you can demonstrate

103
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,117
your skills and what you've learned.

104
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:11,059
I'm curious if I can ask the audience,

105
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,801
how many people here want to become a narrative designer?

106
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:17,541
How many people here have published a game

107
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:19,223
as a narrative designer?

108
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,086
OK, OK, awesome.

109
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,049
Congrats to everyone who has.

110
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,473
And for those of you who haven't yet, don't despair.

111
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,096
So what I look for when I'm interviewing writing applicants,

112
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:30,920
narrative design applicants, who can't talk about something

113
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,541
they published.

114
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:36,365
I ask them to talk about the themes and the elements of their work,

115
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,687
if they're not allowed to talk about it under NDA,

116
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,229
talk about the themes and the sort of foundational principles

117
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,050
of what makes it exciting to them.

118
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,553
Because I'm not interested in just hearing some title or IP.

119
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:50,135
I want to understand your mind at work.

120
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:54,478
I want to see you and hear you talk critically and passionately

121
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,261
about the elements of your story work that you find compelling,

122
00:05:58,721 --> 00:05:59,742
that you think is exciting.

123
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:04,705
So maybe you're working on a new Walking Dead game and you're not allowed to talk about that at all

124
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,827
But you can talk about what it's like to write about

125
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:14,772
human existential dilemmas and how everyone's a fucking monster when zombies are in around or don't say zombies because

126
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,693
Because maybe that would break your NDA

127
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:22,817
But if you can talk about the work in some way that shows me your passion and your heart and your your critical thinking at

128
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:26,840
Work, I'm gonna get what I need from that conversation and I'm gonna get a better insight into who you are as a writer

129
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:29,823
Okay, so the cover letter.

130
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,464
It's basically an introduction.

131
00:06:31,564 --> 00:06:34,387
You're telling your story to the company

132
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:35,127
that you're applying for.

133
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,708
Think about it like a story with an arc,

134
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,950
and the culmination of that arc should be

135
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,313
that you are destined to land comfortably

136
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:45,035
and naturally into the arms of whatever company

137
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:45,896
that you're applying to.

138
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:49,318
So tailor that story really to make a plausible case

139
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:52,561
for why you belong wherever you're trying to belong.

140
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:56,844
Include in that information about your writing experience,

141
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:57,585
published or not.

142
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:03,845
Talk about why, specifically, you want to work at the particular company that you're

143
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:07,828
applying to and demonstrate in the answer to that why an understanding of who they are

144
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:12,031
culturally, what their values are, what their body of work is like, and how you as a writer

145
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:17,034
will be able, through your writing sample, to immediately create value for them by writing

146
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:21,177
to their style, but to their voice, because that's what they're looking for.

147
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:27,198
And then maybe this is obvious, but include the name of the company in your cover letter.

148
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:32,479
Include an understanding of who they are and make it really, make a deliberate effort for

149
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:36,880
your cover letter not to sound like a form letter where you're just swapping out Blizzard

150
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,262
instead of Bungie and sending off the same cover letter over and over.

151
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:47,532
Awesome. And so now that you've gotten your cover letter down, submitting the

152
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:52,296
application. This is a little bit of housekeeping stuff but employers notice

153
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:56,819
these things. So I'm gonna harp on some really minute details here but you want

154
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,782
to keep it clear and concise but label the file names clearly with your name,

155
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:06,507
CV and cover letter. We get hundreds and hundreds of applications and if you just

156
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,549
simply put your name on there, you want us to be able to find you quickly when I

157
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,210
look in my folder of like oh I really like.

158
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,853
you know, this person's stuff. I want to be able to easily find it, so it's simple

159
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:20,734
stuff but please do that. And then when you do that, please label it clearly with

160
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:24,636
the name of the correct company that you're applying for. To Zach's point

161
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:28,817
earlier about Blizzard or Bungie, like I don't, this has happened to me where

162
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:32,539
I've gotten applications and they put the name of not the game company that

163
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,680
they're applying for but clearly another one.

164
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,923
just check those things because that even though you may have a fantastic

165
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:42,746
cover letter or CV and body of work, it's those little things that

166
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:47,050
like that attention to detail that's really like can be off-putting if I see

167
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,653
that you're you know put bungee and you're applying to King or something so.

168
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,955
that kind of stuff and then if the job description doesn't ask for writing

169
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:59,938
samples, send your portfolio link or a relevant sample anyway. I think some

170
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:04,020
companies might be either for legal reasons don't specifically ask for

171
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,461
samples or maybe it's a new person putting up a job

172
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,703
description and they don't include that but I think that if you just submit one

173
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:15,565
that will save the employer a lot of time because that's happened to me once

174
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,706
where someone for

175
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:21,890
someone, my HR person who forgot to post at please submit writing samples didn't

176
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,953
for like two weeks and then I got all these resumes but then no one submitted

177
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:29,436
writing samples with their resumes and then the ones I like just the CV, I had

178
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:32,458
to go back and ask them for their samples when I just feel like that

179
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:36,141
should just be a part of your application package. So just again, minor

180
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:40,384
housekeeping things that I think matter a lot for when you're applying for a job.

181
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:46,620
Yeah, so if you're applying for a junior role and you don't have any experience,

182
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,303
you're almost definitely going to have to take some kind of writing test.

183
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:53,750
You're going to get a prompt, a challenge, a window of time to complete something,

184
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,415
and then you get to demonstrate your writing ability under deadline.

185
00:09:58,877 --> 00:10:00,359
How to do that well. Don't be late.

186
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:05,481
Game development is all about executing to a very specific and rigorous schedule.

187
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:09,984
If you're late out of the gate with a writing test, it's really going to hurt your chances.

188
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:14,227
If for some reason the deadline that you're given in the middle of the recruitment process

189
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:17,729
isn't something you can hit because of whatever's going on in your life, that's okay.

190
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,932
proactively ahead of time, communicate with the recruiting officer, whoever

191
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:24,654
you're talking to and say, hey I'm not gonna be able to hit that thing Monday

192
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:28,376
because I'm graduating from college on Saturday, can I get a couple extra days,

193
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:32,619
I'll be able to do it Wednesday by 5 p.m. Ahead of time, awesome. That's proactive,

194
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,161
that's a commitment that you're making and then execute and hit

195
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:40,524
that commitment. When it comes to the prompt itself, don't just jump in

196
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:41,684
and rush through.

197
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:46,506
Really think about what the prompt is asking you to do creatively.

198
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,247
Think about what the company you're applying to needs and what they want.

199
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,329
Usually a lot of thought has gone into the crafting of the writing test.

200
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:59,691
So really demonstrate an engagement, an equal engagement with sort of that level of care

201
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:02,272
and write something you're really going to be proud of.

202
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:06,013
On a higher level, consider who you're writing for.

203
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,505
and really try to demonstrate in your prompt

204
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,350
that you understand their voice and their style

205
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,672
and that you can execute to that level

206
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:15,375
and that if we were to hire you tomorrow,

207
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:18,160
you would be able to start creating value

208
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,624
writing within our voice immediately.

209
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,713
And then this is really crucial,

210
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:25,774
enjoy what you're working on.

211
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:29,874
I work with writers all day long at all levels,

212
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:31,915
and it's something that I have to remind people of

213
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:32,635
all the time.

214
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,135
But if you as a writer are not taking joy

215
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:37,516
in what you're crafting, I'm not gonna love reading it.

216
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:39,956
So even at the test level,

217
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:41,417
I think especially at the test level,

218
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,397
have fun with what you're crafting.

219
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,297
You're building something that's supposed to be

220
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:47,158
entertaining and compelling for your audience.

221
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:50,818
Focus on that and you'll generate something really great.

222
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,605
Okay, so you get through the writing process, the test,

223
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:56,705
and now you have an interview.

224
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,726
I want to encourage all of you to think about interviewing

225
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:02,048
not as demonstrating your worthiness to some institution

226
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,468
or body of experts.

227
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,309
It's not all on you.

228
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,610
You're really, it's a two-way street.

229
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,492
And ideally, applicants that I really resonate with

230
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:12,873
and want to work with come to the table

231
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,394
sort of striving to find whether or not

232
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,195
my company is a good fit for them

233
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:18,796
as much as they're trying to demonstrate

234
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:19,976
what they're capable of doing for us.

235
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:23,796
So do that.

236
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:28,059
I would say take time ahead and prepare questions

237
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,822
about the role, about the studio culture,

238
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,944
about the job and the other teams you'll be working with.

239
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:37,127
And take some time to think about difficult questions

240
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:40,090
that you'll get asked and prepare answers

241
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,491
in anticipation of that.

242
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,252
And look at your resume and say,

243
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:47,096
okay, so if I was gonna throw a really difficult question

244
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,798
at this person, what would it be based on their experience,

245
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:50,859
based on their body of work?

246
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,008
And then you won't be caught flat-footed,

247
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,929
except you definitely will be caught flat-footed.

248
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:58,190
But don't dismay.

249
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,130
I think in the middle of an interview,

250
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,831
if you get a difficult question, if you get a question that you

251
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,372
feel like, man, I really should know the answer to that,

252
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:08,493
and I don't, be honest, be humble.

253
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,853
One of the best answers I ever hear in an interview

254
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,794
is, oh my god, that's a really hard question.

255
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:13,954
I don't know the answer to that.

256
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:15,635
My best guess is this.

257
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:19,136
As devs, we are constantly confronted with things,

258
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,956
and we don't have any idea how to solve them.

259
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,843
We want to work with people who have humility

260
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,104
and have honesty, intellectual honesty and creative honesty

261
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:28,324
in how they talk about the work

262
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:29,664
and how they approach problems

263
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:33,985
that they're not necessarily sure about how to answer.

264
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:35,266
It's a process of discovery.

265
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:38,446
So demonstrate that honesty, demonstrate that humility,

266
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:40,367
and you're gonna be demonstrating a person

267
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,227
that I want on my dev team.

268
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:44,567
And then the same thing with the writing test,

269
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,228
enjoy the experience of interviewing.

270
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,239
Have fun with it.

271
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,123
Be excited to meet devs and talk to them about their work

272
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:51,984
and what they're working on.

273
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,186
Be excited to advocate for yourself and your experience

274
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:54,807
and your story.

275
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,152
Have fun, and you'll be performing a version of yourself

276
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,455
that ideally people want to work with.

277
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:09,192
And just also some additional tips based on the interview. I mean to what Zach was

278
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:13,336
saying before in terms of preparing, you know as employers I'm definitely gonna

279
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:18,721
ask you if you've played the games that we work on. You'd be surprised at how

280
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:22,825
many people actually don't do this before an interview. So it's not like you

281
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:25,528
have to finish them, it's not like you have to memorize them or complete

282
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:26,169
everything about them.

283
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,291
I would expect that you at least check them out

284
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,652
and have some general thoughts

285
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:31,114
or even just the context around it.

286
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,815
So, you know, Wikipedia's there.

287
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:34,156
Just, you know, look it up.

288
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:36,239
And don't, but definitely don't lie about it.

289
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,201
If for some reason you didn't play it or whatever reason,

290
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:41,303
don't say that you finished it when you haven't.

291
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:43,025
Don't, we will be able to tell.

292
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:45,628
So we'd rather you have an honest dialogue about it

293
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,430
than lie about it, so don't lie about it.

294
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:53,816
And of course be prepared to talk about the narrative design of either the games that the company are working for.

295
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:59,362
This goes to thoughtful preparation, but as well as just your thoughts on narrative design in general or games, you know, that we may ask

296
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:05,469
what's your favorite narrative design in other games? And so be able to talk about those in a passionate and informed way.

297
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,171
Be prepared to talk about your writing test.

298
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:12,572
We're gonna ask you your thought process.

299
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,573
We know that we gave you an impossibly short amount

300
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,454
of time to do it, so don't feel that you have to be

301
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:18,054
on the defensive about it.

302
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:20,175
We just wanna ask, why did you do this?

303
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:21,175
What did you think about this?

304
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:25,177
So it's not so much as a sort of critical feedback time

305
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,398
as much as we just wanna see why you did what you did

306
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:29,498
in such a short amount of time.

307
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:38,666
And yeah, more of a housekeeping thing, but a lot of times, this goes back to Zack's point about thoughtful questions,

308
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:42,287
but at the end of the interview, I'll usually ask like, do you have any questions for me?

309
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:49,109
And you know, I love questions about craft, how I manage you, you know, specific things about games we've worked on,

310
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:54,771
process, but a lot of times too, I'll get questions about like, oh, how many vacation days and things like that.

311
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,692
And those are all important, for sure,

312
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,774
but I would expect that you would ask those

313
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:00,255
from the HR person and not me,

314
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:01,356
and that makes me just think that,

315
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:04,199
oh, did you not have any other questions about the craft?

316
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,600
So just be mindful of that

317
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,602
when you're about to ask those kinds of questions.

318
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:12,665
But if you do the writing test, the interview goes well,

319
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:15,928
and then you got the job, hooray!

320
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:18,707
But now what?

321
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,548
Thanks, Zach.

322
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,070
So now that you've gotten the job, though,

323
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,372
we also wanted to talk about, if you get the job,

324
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:26,873
what happens afterwards.

325
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:29,235
And Zach is going to talk a lot about craft.

326
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:33,578
OK, so narrative design.

327
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:36,400
If you do everything right that we're talking about

328
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,041
with regard to labeling your CV, how

329
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,423
to navigate the writing process, the interview process,

330
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,585
but you are not growing as a writer.

331
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:48,928
One, I don't know that you'll actually get the job, sadly, but it's true.

332
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:56,434
But two, your work will grow stagnant and you're going to have a difficult time navigating

333
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,657
your career past this first opportunity when you finally get your foot in the door.

334
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,823
Okay, so the high-level question I ask all writers of all levels that I hire.

335
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,010
I asked them to define what their goals are as an artist.

336
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,871
And I would challenge all of you to think about that.

337
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,892
Almost agnostic of where you're working now

338
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:17,232
and where you're applying to next.

339
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:20,874
You should always be asking, who am I as an artist?

340
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,814
Who am I as a writer?

341
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,255
What are the stories that I want to tell?

342
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,856
What are the stories that are invigorating me

343
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:26,776
or challenging me?

344
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:29,918
And the purpose of asking those questions,

345
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:31,338
you should have answers to those questions,

346
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:33,439
cultivate answers to those questions.

347
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,860
That should change over time as well.

348
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:38,455
If you as a writer are not changing,

349
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,958
if you're not actively asking yourself

350
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,400
what you want to be in your artistic praxis,

351
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,241
and the answer isn't shifting to some degree,

352
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:48,883
then you are potentially falling into a place

353
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:49,724
where you will not grow.

354
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:53,948
OK, so who do you want to be as a narrative designer,

355
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:54,628
as a writer?

356
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,290
What kind of work do you want to work on?

357
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,393
As you're navigating the answer to that question,

358
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:01,294
curate.

359
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,881
a deep understanding of narrative media.

360
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:07,164
Maybe you only want to work in open world RPGs,

361
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:08,926
that's cool, play mobile narrative anyway.

362
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,670
Watch TV, watch film, be able to talk about story

363
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,392
in any and every way.

364
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,594
It matters at the interview level,

365
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:16,875
it matters in the day-to-day work,

366
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,020
and truly great writers learn to steal from anything.

367
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:30,464
And then in your own artistic praxis, not just as you're applying for a given job or one project after another,

368
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:35,409
just as you're building a body of your own work, be critical. Challenge yourself.

369
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,672
Recognize the fact that you are building a body of work,

370
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:44,117
and be deliberate about what it is you're choosing to write, where you're choosing to spend your creative energy,

371
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,500
in service of this larger question about what kind of an artist you want to be.

372
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:54,996
A really helpful aid in that journey is finding a writer who's more experienced than you are,

373
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:58,919
who will read your work, spend time with you, talk to you about what they're seeing, give

374
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,560
you notes, and challenge your thinking.

375
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,403
And they're not going to be right all the time, but you don't have to take every note,

376
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:08,106
but be committed to that kind of discourse about your work, and you will improve.

377
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:13,150
Abandon any kind of discourse about your work at that level, and you will not.

378
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:17,094
And be courageous.

379
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:18,935
And part of what I mean by that is...

380
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:26,025
I think bad writers fall into a habit of not challenging themselves to craft new things.

381
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:30,049
They either work on one thing that they've written that they like and they never put

382
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:34,574
it down and they keep polishing it, or they fall into a very specific niche with their

383
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:34,814
work.

384
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:36,275
They write for comfort.

385
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:40,897
They write because they fantasize about this particular job they want to have somewhere,

386
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:47,540
and that's really good, but in terms of growing as an artist, it takes courage to push yourself,

387
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,762
to write things you're not used to, to write in new media, and to write stories that are

388
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:55,683
maybe non-traditional for you. You will learn from that process.

389
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:04,376
Some more notes on crafts, but in addition to defining your goals and cultivating your interests

390
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:06,698
Take the initiative to improve yourself

391
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:12,101
And I think this goes for new narrative designers aspiring designers as well as experienced narrative designers

392
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:16,703
There's always always looking for ways to improve so some tips

393
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:20,465
whether it's your first narrative design job or your tenth

394
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:24,811
Always strive to learn about the other disciplines and departments and work together.

395
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:30,039
See what their thoughts on narrative are and how do you fit into their process and culture

396
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,921
as a narrative designer.

397
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:33,324
This will help you at any job that you go to.

398
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:36,874
Watch GDC talks. Thanks for coming to this one.

399
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:43,335
But there's also a ton of great stuff that happened this weekend and in previous years on the vault.

400
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:47,496
So, you know, everything is easily available now thanks to the internet.

401
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:54,598
So there's definitely no excuse and there's no shortage of narrative design media in terms of videos and books nowadays.

402
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:57,958
So there's definitely stuff everywhere. So no excuse to not check out that stuff.

403
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,701
Network, yes, that's why we're all here, isn't it?

404
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:04,683
But network, it's super, super hard.

405
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,364
As writers, I know we're all introverts,

406
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:08,265
and I mean, even me being up here right now,

407
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:10,366
I'm like, ugh, I gotta talk to people, but no.

408
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,468
But it's super important.

409
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:15,050
We wouldn't be here where we are without networking.

410
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,831
I mean, every job that I've ever gotten

411
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:19,352
was through someone I know or through a friend of a friend.

412
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:21,074
I think Zach's had some same thing.

413
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:23,435
So networking is super important.

414
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:25,216
So it's great that you guys are here at GDC.

415
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:27,678
But even if you can't come to GDC every year,

416
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:30,019
or you have friends who can never make it to GDC,

417
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:33,900
there's definitely local meetups that you can go to.

418
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,201
There's IDGA.

419
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,662
There's tons of stuff out there.

420
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:38,243
Or start your own group, and just

421
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:40,584
get people in your local community interested.

422
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:43,005
And you guys can all talk about narrative design

423
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:43,785
and share advice.

424
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,626
There's also a Facebook group that I'm a part of.

425
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,247
I could talk to you about it after.

426
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:50,128
That is all aspiring game writers and narrative designers.

427
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:52,909
So there's a lot of great places to network,

428
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,710
not just in person, but online.

429
00:21:56,991 --> 00:22:00,373
Be critical of yourself, sure, you can always improve,

430
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:01,874
but also don't forget to be kind.

431
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,956
Narrative design and game writing is hard.

432
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:09,098
So, but with that being said, also be hopeful.

433
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,919
So, you know, throughout the years

434
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:13,981
I've gotten tons of rejections on stuff,

435
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:16,703
on jobs, on things I've written, on written pieces,

436
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,765
but you know what, never give up, never lose hope,

437
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:22,666
keep trying, you know, the first game's job

438
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:24,828
is the hardest one to get, but once you get that,

439
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:29,690
then your career will only keep growing, so don't give up.

440
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:37,955
Okay, so I give advice to people a lot of the time when I only have 30 seconds or

441
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:43,718
a minute, I basically distill all of my advice down to one thing.

442
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,787
which is being a good writer is about discipline.

443
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:51,451
I think we often get into this business because we're really excited by the things we consume,

444
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:55,414
the things that inspire us, we're passionate about it, and we think what if, it would be

445
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:55,955
so fun.

446
00:22:56,595 --> 00:23:04,402
The actual practice of becoming a great writer is not, I think, succeeded in short bursts

447
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:05,943
of inspired creativity.

448
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:08,385
You find success when you develop habits.

449
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:11,501
Habits of production, habits of challenging yourself,

450
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:14,184
habits of writing and of networking

451
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:18,589
and really pursuing, almost aggressively pursuing

452
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,269
your growth.

453
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:22,693
And that just takes discipline.

454
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:25,336
If you can find that as a writer,

455
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:28,379
you will succeed, definitely.

456
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:35,927
We got the five-minute sign. So I'm gonna blow through the key takeaways to make sure that we have time for your questions

457
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:37,808
But overall don't forget

458
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:43,009
Be clear choose the best work that represents the job that you're applying for

459
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:50,591
Be concise choose samples of your absolute best work. Don't include everything and most importantly be yourself

460
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:52,752
Don't be afraid to show who you are

461
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:55,113
and your interest and your passion for storytelling,

462
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:56,234
no matter what it is.

463
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:58,775
Just authenticity really shines

464
00:23:59,115 --> 00:24:00,656
when it comes to both your work

465
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:01,796
and in-person interviews.

466
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:08,619
Okay, so we said do lots of stuff the right way,

467
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,260
don't do other things the wrong way.

468
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,820
That's all good.

469
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:13,301
I love that bullet.

470
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:15,922
Just to calibrate your thinking,

471
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,903
this is what I tell aspiring narrative designers

472
00:24:17,943 --> 00:24:18,483
all the time.

473
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:22,785
If you adopt a healthy practice of applying to places

474
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,946
and you accept the fact that you're gonna get rejected

475
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:29,188
100, 200, 300 times, I have been way more

476
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:30,628
than any yes I've ever gotten.

477
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:33,769
If you can accept that fact, you can almost court.

478
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,212
knows you cannot be afraid of rejection because it is inevitable.

479
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,794
It's not a question of if I get lucky, it's a question of when I find the right place

480
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:46,697
at the right time for my craft and the right studio.

481
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:51,919
And I, when I was desperately trying to get my foot in the door years ago, I derived a

482
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,960
lot of comfort from that.

483
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,341
And I know a lot of other writers who have too.

484
00:24:56,882 --> 00:25:01,525
And then when you do succeed, remember to help the next person along the way.

485
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:03,646
Okay.

486
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,221
Thank you very much, everybody.

487
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:14,268
So we have a few minutes, but really we

488
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:16,750
have as much time as anybody wants, because there's no talk

489
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,610
after this one.

490
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:19,812
If any of you would like to ask questions,

491
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:21,053
I think there are microphones.

492
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:23,434
OK, we have a microphone.

493
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,296
Raise your hand or whatever, and we'll

494
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,637
stay and answer whatever you got.

495
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:30,179
Can we have everyone make a line, possibly?

496
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,480
Yeah, maybe a line makes sense.

497
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,201
Let's do that.

498
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:38,334
Hi, thank you guys for the talk.

499
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,856
Very happy to be here and listen to all your wisdom.

500
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,939
Question, so I have a lot of experience

501
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,160
writing poetry and prose,

502
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,902
not a lot of experience script writing.

503
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:47,644
And I've heard that when you apply for jobs,

504
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:50,728
you just submit screenplays or teleplays.

505
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:52,049
Can I get your feedback on that?

506
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,051
Yeah, okay.

507
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,254
Yeah, I'll answer, did you just take a picture?

508
00:25:57,094 --> 00:25:57,974
Okay, I'll answer that.

509
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,015
It depends on what you're applying for.

510
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:01,475
So if you're applying for a company

511
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:02,756
that does cinematic work,

512
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:06,997
you should have a strong cinematic script, absolutely.

513
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:10,898
If you're applying for something that's maybe more prosy

514
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,339
and there are game studios out there

515
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,319
generating products like that,

516
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,100
I think prose is perfectly fine.

517
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,621
One of the last writers I've hired at Deck Nine,

518
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,982
the vast majority of her experience

519
00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:23,563
is fan fiction and prose.

520
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:26,545
and we make highly cinematic content.

521
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:28,066
Her work was really great.

522
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:31,369
And so we were, and we talked in the interview for sure

523
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,252
about like how comfortable are you writing,

524
00:26:34,272 --> 00:26:35,854
cinematically writing screenplays.

525
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:38,036
And she's much more comfortable with prose,

526
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,199
but I can use that tool in our process for sure.

527
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:43,681
And this I think goes to a higher level

528
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,062
piece of advice I'll share.

529
00:26:45,963 --> 00:26:49,024
Build a portfolio that has an excellent cinematic piece,

530
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:51,965
a screenplay that you're really proud of,

531
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:54,586
a prose piece that you're really proud of,

532
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:56,346
and maybe start there.

533
00:26:57,187 --> 00:27:00,428
Next level would be a Twine interactive something

534
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:01,568
that you're really proud of,

535
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:04,349
and you can submit the right piece for the right gig.

536
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:06,370
And then also, if they ask,

537
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,791
show the versatility that you've acquired along the way.

538
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:09,811
Thank you so much.

539
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:14,603
Hey there, first of all.

540
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:16,545
Again, thanks so much for doing this.

541
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:18,067
My name is Nick.

542
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:20,089
I'm a narrative designer and writer from New York.

543
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,314
And one thing I was interested in is, you mentioned the idea of finding a mentor, like

544
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:29,038
someone who you can develop a long-term connection with and who can really help push you forward.

545
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:33,703
My question for you is, do you have any advice for how to go about finding such a person?

546
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:39,865
Yeah, so I think that it's really hard.

547
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:44,070
Share your work in digital spaces, for sure.

548
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:48,895
Go to events like this and introduce yourself to people.

549
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,799
And then I think local meetups are probably your best bet.

550
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:55,356
You might find them themes toward narrative,

551
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:57,137
I'm sure you will, but even if they're just larger

552
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:59,517
IGDA groups, you can just walk around,

553
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,918
and I'm the worst at this, I hate networking,

554
00:28:02,538 --> 00:28:04,019
but it's so important.

555
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,679
Go to those events, awkwardly introduce yourself,

556
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,440
talk about what you're passionate about,

557
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,760
and when you find someone who you think like,

558
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,101
oh, that guy's local, and he's awesome,

559
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:15,641
and he likes this thing that I also like,

560
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:18,082
and he's published that, ask him to read a piece.

561
00:28:19,403 --> 00:28:20,444
I usually start with that.

562
00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:22,085
Be like, hey, I really like what you're doing.

563
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,787
Would you mind reading one of my scripts

564
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,608
and telling me what you think?

565
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:27,130
And maybe you get one round of iteration,

566
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,211
that's more than you had before.

567
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:30,874
Maybe it starts a conversation or relationship,

568
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:32,536
a mentorship relationship

569
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:33,977
that you can get a lot more value of.

570
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:37,588
I would add to that, like online communities for sure,

571
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:38,809
and just like see who bites,

572
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:41,529
because I feel like I could do a whole micro talk

573
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:43,330
on mentorship because, you know,

574
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,970
be respectful of their time, like, you know,

575
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,691
pick your strongest thing and stuff like that,

576
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:51,832
but I think like there's also like IDGA,

577
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:53,613
Women in Games definitely has a mentorship

578
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:54,653
where you can even sign up.

579
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:58,054
I don't know if there's one for broader narrative design,

580
00:28:58,074 --> 00:29:00,134
but maybe it's something we could start or look into,

581
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,515
but yeah, I think.

582
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:05,783
You know, online is definitely your best bet to start if you can't find people in person here.

583
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:07,066
Yeah, good question.

584
00:29:11,106 --> 00:29:13,547
Hi, so first of all, a quick question.

585
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,087
You mentioned a Facebook group.

586
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:15,807
What is the name of that?

587
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:17,167
Just so I can look it up.

588
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:20,788
I think it's Game Writers, but, sorry.

589
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:23,529
I'm part of a lot of Facebook.

590
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,349
It's very, yeah, it's super generic,

591
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,310
so let me find that, and then I'll share it.

592
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,651
Whoever afterwards, off the mic, I'll share that with you.

593
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:34,932
So, with regards to writing samples,

594
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:37,972
what are you looking for in terms of length?

595
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:49,948
like shouting. Short is better than long. 10 pages of anything is a lot for me to

596
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:56,349
read right now. The best thing you wrote is 35 pages or 95 pages. That is not what

597
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:01,390
you should submit. Challenge yourself to write something new. A 10-page screenplay

598
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,911
that shows some witty dialogue, a clever arc, a fun moment, a filmic understanding

599
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:07,451
of narrative.

600
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:09,593
That's great, that's all I need to see.

601
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,557
Something that makes me laugh, out loud once,

602
00:30:13,197 --> 00:30:15,400
and I'm like, oh cool, okay, I'm interested in this.

603
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,322
I wanna move the conversation forward.

604
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:23,169
But I've probably read about 750 to 1,000 submissions

605
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:24,971
from writers over the years now.

606
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:26,853
I've had people apply with 300 pages of work.

607
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:31,014
I don't even know where to start and so I don't read anything.

608
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:33,295
Because I don't have time because everything is on fire.

609
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:37,038
But like a ten page something and I'm looking, yeah, I'm going to read it.

610
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:41,421
So I really, that's where discipline comes in, but really focus on something, something

611
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,341
really tight, something short.

612
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,672
Just to add to that, I mean, it's more mobile,

613
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:49,073
so definitely if it's not 100 page scripts,

614
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:50,834
but even if you have, I don't know,

615
00:30:51,054 --> 00:30:53,275
a movie script that's 50 pages or something,

616
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:55,796
I would say distill it down to your best scene,

617
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:58,198
but then also give us context for it,

618
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:02,400
so that way we can still get an idea of those few pages.

619
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,521
So that way you also aren't only writing,

620
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:07,342
I mean, if you have 10 page screenplays or less, perfect.

621
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:08,843
But if you have something that's longer,

622
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:10,044
but you still wanna show it,

623
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:12,545
I would say choose the best small portion of it,

624
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:12,985
but give us.

625
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:19,407
prose paragraph of context before we go into reading that. Thank you.

626
00:31:23,168 --> 00:31:29,949
Hi, I'm curious what is the value of secondary skills when you're applying to

627
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:33,930
a narrative position and what is the best way to present them to a potential

628
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:39,532
employer? So by secondary skills do you mean like coding?

629
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:41,063
Yeah, coding art.

630
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:41,724
Yeah.

631
00:31:43,044 --> 00:31:44,525
That's very valuable, I think.

632
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:46,586
The most important is your writing.

633
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:50,988
But the nature of the work that we make at Tech N9NE,

634
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,190
I don't hire any writer who can't code a little.

635
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,573
or pick it up very quickly,

636
00:31:57,634 --> 00:32:00,355
but that's asking a much higher investment from us.

637
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:03,577
So if you have any experience in any scripting language,

638
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:05,338
that's great for me.

639
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:08,579
That never hurts in game development at any level.

640
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,321
Take one introductory CS class online

641
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:15,123
and you'll have everything you need as a narrative designer.

642
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,644
So include whatever language you did that in

643
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:18,865
and that's wonderful.

644
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:21,066
Did you have any other secondary skills?

645
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,727
None specifically.

646
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,712
No, but to that, I mean, for mobile,

647
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,733
I don't necessarily need coders, although if you

648
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:30,493
could do that, awesome.

649
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:35,656
But if you're an artist and you do storyboards,

650
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:38,317
or if you can draw somewhat and you do rough storyboards

651
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:40,419
to go with a piece that you wrote or a script that you

652
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,159
wrote, that's awesome.

653
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:43,341
if you have project management skills,

654
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:45,563
when you talk to me in the interview,

655
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,085
tell me your narrative process,

656
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,007
but how you've dealt with other disciplines.

657
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:52,169
So producer project management skills,

658
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,430
that kind of works as well.

659
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,073
So it depends obviously on what the secondary skill is,

660
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:57,454
but there are definitely ways to frame it

661
00:32:57,854 --> 00:33:00,457
in this helps me as a narrative designer context.

662
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:01,538
Does that make sense?

663
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:13,453
Hey, I'm the... I serve as the dungeon master for my friends and Dungeons & Dragons and whatnot as a creative outlet

664
00:33:14,113 --> 00:33:17,274
and, you know, making adventures and stories for my friends to overcome.

665
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:23,397
And recently I've considered maybe like writing those down to like little adventures and PDF files.

666
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:28,839
I was wondering if that's something that may be worth sending to potential employers as a work sample of

667
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:32,300
something that's not only writing but kind of design in its own way.

668
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:38,176
Yeah, that's a great question. I think it depends on the nature of what it actually looks like.

669
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:46,582
So if you're applying for a narrative design position, I would, unless they're asking for something like that,

670
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:50,144
what's a campaign you've designed? What's a story-driven campaign that you've designed?

671
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:53,546
It's actually a really cool question to ask applicants, but unless they're asking for that,

672
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,528
they're usually asking for something else very specifically.

673
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,569
Definitely have that other thing.

674
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,833
whatever it might be. I would say that that sounds to me like something that

675
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:07,137
could be a really interesting thing for me to find in your portfolio. You have a

676
00:34:07,157 --> 00:34:11,640
website where it's listed, I discover that and I look at it and I'm

677
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,143
like, wow, this is really nerdy and really cool and it's showing a

678
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,426
design skill set that could accompany narrative really well. I think

679
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:21,648
that's great, but I wouldn't lead with something like that because you really

680
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:26,292
want to demonstrate whatever specific writing skill, the role you're applying

681
00:34:26,332 --> 00:34:26,752
for needs.

682
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:30,934
I guess one more question would be,

683
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:34,575
so would something like a short story be more,

684
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:35,996
what I'd lead with?

685
00:34:36,556 --> 00:34:36,776
Yes.

686
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:37,616
All right, thanks.

687
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,537
It could be a D&D short story, that's great.

688
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:40,517
Just make it good.

689
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:46,058
All right, guys, the AV tech is gonna have to,

690
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:47,099
you know, shut the mics down,

691
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,039
but you can still get your questions in,

692
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,160
just, you know, it's gonna be a little bit more intimate.

693
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,980
Everyone's gonna start, you know, sharing warmth.

694
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,000
Everyone huddle together.

695
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,161
But, yeah.

696
00:34:57,235 --> 00:34:58,897
If you guys want to stay in here.

697
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:00,799
Can we stay in here?

698
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,961
Yeah, absolutely.

699
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:04,263
OK.

700
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:07,447
OK, we'll stay for like 20, 30 minutes if people want to talk.

701
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:08,448
Come on down.
