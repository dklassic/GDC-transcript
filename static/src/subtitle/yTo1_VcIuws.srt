00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:13,995
Welcome to GDC Showcase. I'm Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra. I'm joined

2
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:20,960
today by a very special guest for today's AMA session, Gavin Moore, creative director on the

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,543
new Demon's Souls for PlayStation 5. I see people have already started putting in questions,

4
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:31,707
and if you haven't, go ahead now, start submitting your questions via the question tab in the chat

5
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:35,149
box there in the bottom right. We'll try to get through as many as we can.

6
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,374
And with that, Gavin, thanks for joining us, and please introduce yourself.

7
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:45,018
Hi, Chris. Thank you so much for having me here today.

8
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:48,662
It's great to be with you all the way from Tokyo in Japan.

9
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:54,427
It's a little early here in the morning, 7.15, so excuse me if I'm just going to drink all my coffee here.

10
00:00:54,848 --> 00:01:00,331
When remaking and remastering a game, how do you decide which bugs from the original to keep or

11
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:06,975
fixed or fixed based on modernizing it, player expectations or other reasons? Is that...?

12
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:12,999
Yeah, thanks Jay for that really difficult question, you know, that early in the morning

13
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,243
to start off with. That's a really, really, really, really difficult process. There are a lot of bugs

14
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:23,506
that actually become meta in a game, right? And

15
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,175
It took a long time.

16
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:29,397
Demon's Souls took three years to make,

17
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:31,858
and I can tell everybody out there,

18
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,400
nearly every day we had those discussions.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,322
We went through that list and we ticked them for,

20
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:38,563
yes, it's going to be fixed,

21
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:40,224
or no, it's not going to be fixed

22
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:44,027
because the community want to keep that sort of bug.

23
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:47,609
So we look at a lot of background online

24
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,490
to see what people are talking about

25
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,432
and what they're into and what they're not into.

26
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:55,997
It's a very, very difficult decision.

27
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:58,138
I mean, there's no real yes and no answer.

28
00:01:58,158 --> 00:01:59,059
It's not black and white.

29
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,400
It's something we investigate.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,502
Yeah, that is a great question.

31
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:06,124
Like for being seven in the morning, that's really good.

32
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:11,047
We're going to go to Steven real quick.

33
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:15,170
How did your role as the creative director

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,693
change in a good or bad way over the course of the Demon's Souls

35
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:20,474
remake project?

36
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:27,610
So when I was asked to come on board with the project right at the beginning by the executive producer, Asakura-san,

37
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:33,072
I spent many sleepless nights, I can assure you.

38
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,333
This is a PlayStation gem.

39
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:35,573
It's a PlayStation classic.

40
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,014
It's beloved by so many people across the world.

41
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:42,656
And to take on that responsibility is not taken on lightly.

42
00:02:43,316 --> 00:02:47,278
So I would spend sleepless nights worrying, first of all, what Miyazaki-san would say.

43
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:52,040
And then I would spend the next month not sleeping, worrying about what the fans would say.

44
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:59,105
And then eventually you just have to, you know, hitch up your trousers and get to work basically,

45
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:04,667
and believe in what you're doing and believe in the passion. So over the course of the game,

46
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:10,289
I think my trepidation was overtaken by my passion for what the game is,

47
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:13,610
because it's such a spectacular game. And so...

48
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,730
I wouldn't say that I wasn't passionate at the beginning,

49
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,892
but the more I delved into it, the more

50
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,854
I became passionate as a creative director

51
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,936
to make sure this was the best experience

52
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,158
for a whole new generation of gamers.

53
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:26,539
Thanks for that.

54
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:30,562
We're going to go on to another one from Emilius.

55
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:35,526
Any advice you have for an up and coming designer with dreams

56
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,288
to become a creative director?

57
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,911
So it took me.

58
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:47,510
20 years to get to where I am now and I've been in this position for 10 and it doesn't get any

59
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,114
easier and the one thing you have to keep is your passion and your drive and if you can't get out

60
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:57,617
and out of your bed in the morning because it's raining too hard or it's too cold to go and work

61
00:03:57,677 --> 00:04:02,059
on that game that you love then you shouldn't be working on that game so keep the passion.

62
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:07,543
The other thing I would say is good advice to anybody out there is that

63
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:10,665
it when you start a game

64
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,583
You start off with a core experience that you build upon.

65
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:18,204
And over the course of making the game,

66
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:19,944
how many ever years that may be,

67
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:21,765
things change and the game evolves

68
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,226
and it takes on a life of its own.

69
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:27,187
So don't be afraid to keep re-evaluating what that core is,

70
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,268
because you might've put a feature into that game,

71
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,928
which you thought at the beginning was great

72
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:34,589
and was working, but a year or so down the line,

73
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,790
it might actually be hindering what the game could become.

74
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,691
So always examine what you're doing

75
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:41,111
and...

76
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:44,206
be brave enough to cut something out of the game

77
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:45,527
as much as you want to add to it.

78
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:49,469
You take one from Alexis.

79
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,131
How do you think one is able to maintain

80
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,032
the soul of a game in a remake?

81
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,494
That's a great question.

82
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:03,197
So when we look at doing a remake or remaster,

83
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:06,359
we've gone well beyond remasters now.

84
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,440
They really are true remakes.

85
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:14,235
We try and identify, as Alexis said, the core,

86
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,758
the soul of the game, and that is what we keep.

87
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,740
You know, working with Bluepoint was incredible,

88
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,082
working with Marco and Peter, the chief technical officer,

89
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:27,225
and how they work and how they sit their engine

90
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,346
over the top of the existing engine

91
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:33,589
and strip away everything apart from what we identify

92
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,030
as that core or the soul,

93
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,792
which for Demon's Souls is the AI and the gameplay.

94
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:40,959
And then we build everything back on top of that.

95
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,865
So the collision, the camera, you know, obviously the graphical elements,

96
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,708
the sound is built over the top.

97
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:50,393
So even in Demon's Souls on PlayStation five, you're still running the core

98
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,638
programming essence of the original on the PlayStation three.

99
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:56,339
It's very cool.

100
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,120
We'll take one from Chris that's getting some upvotes here.

101
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,761
When creating a game as difficult as Demon's Souls,

102
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:06,881
how do you balance difficult gameplay

103
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,782
with intuitive mechanics and usability in general,

104
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,023
making game hardcore but engaging and fun

105
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,803
to keep enough users playing?

106
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:16,944
Is that something you could speak to?

107
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,824
Yeah, at 7.30 in the morning.

108
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:20,965
Yeah.

109
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:26,604
It's not as difficult as people may say.

110
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:30,866
I think a lot of the frustration

111
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:32,867
with the original game of Demon's Souls

112
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:35,588
and how people thought it was too hardcore

113
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:39,551
came around because the actual system it was running on

114
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,052
wasn't capable of running it properly.

115
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:46,034
And the frustration of the load times and dying

116
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,975
and then waiting two minutes for it to load,

117
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:49,476
to run back and die again.

118
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,177
I mean, it just made you pull your hair out,

119
00:06:51,197 --> 00:06:51,777
as you can see.

120
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:52,718
I played the game back in 2009.

121
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:52,858
So...

122
00:06:54,912 --> 00:07:01,295
Um, so keeping the original core of the game as we, as I just talked about

123
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,556
maintains its essence.

124
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,456
So you're not changing that in any way.

125
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:08,038
So you're going to keep that heart core feeling.

126
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:14,120
Um, but we have to think our games change over time and how games evolve and how

127
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,923
gamers change and expectations of what a triple a title, you know, have changed

128
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:21,464
in 10, 12 years.

129
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:23,445
So it was important that we.

130
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:28,170
made those decisions very carefully about what we would add and what we wouldn't add,

131
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,591
how accessible the game should be. You know, obviously making a game on the PlayStation 5

132
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:40,213
with new features, you know, super fast SSD, you know, the new controller with the haptics feedback,

133
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:44,175
this was always going to change the game. We had to be very careful how we were going to implement

134
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:48,776
those, you know, user experiences without changing the original.

135
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:54,998
Melissa asks, what kind of challenges have you faced

136
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:58,859
while working in Japan on games as a foreign developer?

137
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:07,942
I don't experience anything,

138
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:11,083
any challenges in the sense of being a foreigner here.

139
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:14,804
Japanese people are very open in the workplace

140
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:17,345
and in society to everyone.

141
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,466
I think the challenges are the way

142
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:23,556
the working practices here are different from in the West.

143
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:27,659
It's very common for a team, any team member in the West,

144
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,361
to speak up and speak their mind.

145
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,942
It's not so common in a Japanese development team,

146
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:33,744
but it is something that,

147
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,687
you know, in Japan Studio that we worked on very heavily

148
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:41,629
to make sure that everyone has a say in the development of the game

149
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,374
and to say it's OK to speak up and to speak your mind and to be creative.

150
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,896
I mean, everybody that works in games is very creative.

151
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:52,833
And if we're not listening to them,

152
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:55,215
then we're losing precious results.

153
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:01,220
Tremaine asks, hey Tremaine, seeing you around this week.

154
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:04,382
Can you walk us through a typical day

155
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:07,185
of being a creative director, such as any pressures,

156
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,127
responsibilities, enjoyment, et cetera?

157
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:14,751
The 7 a.m. AMA is, live AMA is probably one of them.

158
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,371
Yeah, one of those.

159
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,274
I usually get up around half past four

160
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:27,327
I just scan my phone for all of the emails and the messages and stuff.

161
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:31,569
Get to work, you know, start work around, you know, half six or seven.

162
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,030
Games are a global experience now.

163
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:41,292
So I would have calls in America, both in central time in Texas and obviously

164
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:44,053
in the West Coast in California throughout the day.

165
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:45,754
Then I would get online.

166
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:51,036
Obviously, this is all work from home for a year because of, you know, 2020 and COVID.

167
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:51,256
So.

168
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:56,841
I would get online and talk to my team, go through every aspect,

169
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,921
and then even I'll get online with Europe.

170
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:02,442
So I could be doing everything from playing the game,

171
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:07,724
writing up notes to different members of staff,

172
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:10,945
chatting with the art director in Texas about the way

173
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:14,706
I can't see how the game plays down this corridor,

174
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,067
or this character doesn't look correct,

175
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:21,428
or it could be talking to a composer, or, you know.

176
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:30,712
in California or, you know, going in into the, you know, music recordings in London or, you know,

177
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:35,133
being in the voice recordings in London, directing actors or, you know, everything,

178
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:39,215
every aspect of the game has to be covered in the general day. And everybody is just

179
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:42,416
as important as everybody else. You know, it's a massive team effort.

180
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:45,857
That sounds like a lot of work.

181
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,017
It's a lot of fun too.

182
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:48,678
Yeah.

183
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:54,788
Valerie asks, with Demon's Souls, you got to develop a Souls game.

184
00:10:54,908 --> 00:10:59,571
How different is it to direct a Souls game from any other game?

185
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,232
What are the main challenges with Demon's Souls?

186
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,575
I think Demon's Souls challenges that it has legacy, it's history.

187
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,396
You know, it's the first of its kind.

188
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:15,798
It's a game that spawned a whole new genre of gaming, you know,

189
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:19,000
and there are incredible expectations.

190
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:23,918
and you have to be very, very careful in what you're doing.

191
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:27,960
As a genre of game, I think the basic rules

192
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,402
of how a game plays and the user experience

193
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:34,003
are generally the same, regardless of any game

194
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:34,663
that you're playing.

195
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,944
You can apply the same rules.

196
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,586
It's just the Demon's Souls with the Demon's Souls title,

197
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,468
you have to be respectful of its legacy.

198
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:53,136
Samuel asks, the Demon's Souls remake was built only for the PlayStation 5.

199
00:11:54,377 --> 00:11:57,958
Was the decision to target the newest hardware made early on?

200
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:06,762
So we started off the development on the PC, like all of our titles do. We work heavily on the PC

201
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:12,144
and then as we get dev kits we continue that pipeline.

202
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:16,635
The Bluepoint engine is incredible, the way that you can adjust something on the PC

203
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:20,216
and it will adjust it straight onto whichever platform you're working on

204
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:22,356
or whatever you can see on your screen.

205
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:27,018
But yeah, originally we started off on the PC

206
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:30,379
and then as we started to get specs through for the PlayStation 5,

207
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,040
we started to think about all the different features that we could adjust and add.

208
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,282
But it has always been a PlayStation 5 game

209
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,522
and a PlayStation 5 exclusive.

210
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:48,460
Gia asks, and I apologize if I'm mispronouncing names,

211
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,603
what is your team's process to identify the soul of a game

212
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,124
that you were talking about earlier when remaking a game?

213
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:57,964
What's the process?

214
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,746
So that's a lot of discussion.

215
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,028
I think with a game like Demon's Souls,

216
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,510
it was always going to be, it had to be its AI.

217
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,112
It had to be the way that the characters moved.

218
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,668
and the timing of attacks, none of that could change.

219
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:19,890
And so we spent a lot of time maintaining that.

220
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,591
I mean, we remotion captured

221
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:23,472
the whole player animation sets

222
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:26,413
and we added a whole new female animation set

223
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,154
that never existed in the original game,

224
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:30,735
but all the cadence had to remain the same.

225
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:34,817
And that was weeks and weeks of motion capture

226
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,758
to make sure that we were getting exactly what we needed

227
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:39,579
so we wouldn't change that soul.

228
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:47,107
So I think it was quite easy on Demon's Souls to identify that essence,

229
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:49,228
you know, the actual core gameplay.

230
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:55,012
It was much harder, I think, to make sure that we maintained the feeling of the game,

231
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:57,694
the despair that the world brings across.

232
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:03,598
You know, we were adding a lot more visual assets into the game

233
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:06,700
because we had a lot more power than the PlayStation 3.

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,041
You know, the PlayStation 5 is incredibly powerful.

235
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:15,184
And we wanted to showcase that world as best we could,

236
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,565
especially with visuals and sound.

237
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:21,446
But we had to maintain that feeling of despair

238
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,127
that Miyazaki put into the original game.

239
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:29,929
Harris asks, as creative director,

240
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,190
how do you balance leading your teams to achieve your vision

241
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,351
with giving them the agency and support

242
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,291
to come up with their own ideas?

243
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:46,259
It's a lot easier on Demon's Souls to do that because everybody has groundwork to work on.

244
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,740
So everybody knows, you know, a base to work on.

245
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:57,442
If you're making an original title, it's a process where I would lay down what I believe.

246
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:03,664
And this would be, that could be a story, that could be game ideas or game mechanics,

247
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,905
level ideas and level designs.

248
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:11,507
And then I would usually split the teams across each of those levels.

249
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:19,204
So you would have animators, you know, environment artists, character artists, game designers, you know,

250
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:24,888
working on each level together as a team. And it's up to them at that point to,

251
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:32,074
if they come up with ideas, to present those ideas. And for us as a team to come to a consensus about it.

252
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:36,337
But as a creative director, you have to make that final decision yourself.

253
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:40,109
and it's not personal in any way.

254
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:42,130
You just have to look at the whole of the game,

255
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,012
you know, in its entirety and make a decision

256
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:47,633
that that is the correct thing for the game.

257
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,754
Thanks.

258
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:55,977
Chris asks, what are some of your favorite memories

259
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:57,718
of remaking this game?

260
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,382
So as a game, I think some of my favorite memories

261
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,323
are just watching the game evolve and grow.

262
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,798
That's always great on any game that you work on.

263
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:12,339
You know, to look back where you came from and look at where you

264
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,480
you know, you are at the end is incredible.

265
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,381
Most of my favorite memories are just the great times with, you know,

266
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:21,841
all the different teams around the world.

267
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:25,382
And, you know, there's a great, great people that work

268
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:31,003
both in Sony and at Bluepoint and a lot of fun times together with those people.

269
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:41,535
Nicole asks, how did designing next gen haptics for the PS5 controller change the game?

270
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:49,436
So that was one of the hardest things you had to do. I mean, if you're making an original title,

271
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:53,818
you can make original game mechanics that would literally use the haptics in different and,

272
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:59,499
you know, novel and exciting ways. We wanted to use the haptics,

273
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,560
um, but we didn't.

274
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:08,127
exactly know how we were going to do it and it wasn't until we actually got the the controller

275
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:12,931
in our hands and felt how the haptics would work. Haptics is incredibly different from

276
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:21,998
the way that just a normal jaw shock would work, just a vibration. It works in you know together

277
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:27,223
with both sound and visuals all three have to work together so they have to be designed together.

278
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:31,126
So you can't just add it at the end like we used to do with you know

279
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:33,364
jaw shock and vibration.

280
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,265
It has to be something from the beginning of the game

281
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:36,785
that you're thinking about all the time,

282
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:39,986
because you're always going to add sound and visuals

283
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,927
working in harmony together.

284
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:44,448
And the only way we could do that in Demon's Souls,

285
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:45,609
as far as I was concerned,

286
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:48,029
is to make the combat grittier, right?

287
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,251
And by feeling and sensing the, you know,

288
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:54,992
the hits and the strikes and the blocks

289
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:58,333
and the whoosh of Vanguard's axe as it passed,

290
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,114
you know, as you rolled underneath it was.

291
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,453
an incredible sense that I was suddenly, you know,

292
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:05,674
thrown deeper into the combat.

293
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:07,455
So it really did enhance the game.

294
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:12,338
Brian says, hi Gavin,

295
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:16,100
Bluepoint seems to be one of the studios most dedicated

296
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,641
to high frame rate tech in the business.

297
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,763
Can you speak as to why 60 frames per second

298
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:23,784
is so important to your studio?

299
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:29,968
I think 60 frames a second probably is

300
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,194
compared to PC gaming is probably pretty slow at the moment, right?

301
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,997
I know that my son doesn't like anything that drops

302
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:40,839
below 240 hertz when he's on his PC.

303
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,162
But every time that you increase the frame rate,

304
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:50,305
you increase the fidelity, you know, you increase the feeling, the emotion.

305
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:53,187
You feel, you know, that you're pulled into the game more.

306
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:57,570
You feel like you're a better gamer because the game's giving you more chances.

307
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,491
You're seeing more.

308
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,451
Right? And so it is incredibly important to make sure that any tech that we produce now,

309
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:10,273
especially on the PlayStation 5, has to run at least at 60 frames a second.

310
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:16,434
David asks, if you could remake any game you want, what would you remake?

311
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:17,434
Oh my god.

312
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:27,357
See, I would have remade Final Fantasy VII, right? Because I just wanted to remake the scene when

313
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,037
Sephiroth kills.

314
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:32,589
you know, and I was just like, nah, but then they remade it.

315
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,070
So I'm like, OK, they've done that one.

316
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:37,833
What would I remake?

317
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:42,316
I'm not sure there are so many great games out there

318
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:47,819
and so many great gaming experiences that, you know, I would love to revisit

319
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,362
childhood gaming experiences, for instance.

320
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,184
I'm not sure a lot of them would hold up, but in my head,

321
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:55,725
they were just amazing experiences.

322
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,211
Let's see, who else we got here?

323
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:06,534
Let's see.

324
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:08,534
Sorry.

325
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:12,196
What qualities would you say a creative director

326
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:14,096
must need to be successful,

327
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:17,398
apart from the passion that you talked about earlier?

328
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:18,418
And that's from Emilius.

329
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:26,161
Oh, there's vision.

330
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,381
You have to listen.

331
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:33,022
That's incredibly important, right?

332
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:36,723
You have to listen to the people around you because everybody has an opinion

333
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,444
and everybody around you is creative

334
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:42,526
and you have to make sure that you're listening to them.

335
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:46,908
I think there's a famous line in Game of Thrones where Jon Snow is told like,

336
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:50,350
you know, to be a leader, you have to follow. Right.

337
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,410
I think that's incredibly important.

338
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,332
You have to learn, you know, everybody's job, basically.

339
00:20:56,837 --> 00:21:02,400
not down to the minutia of it, but you have to know what people are going through and what you're ordering them to do.

340
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:08,522
You know, it's not it's not good enough to go and make that character and go make it like this.

341
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:09,623
And I want it in a week.

342
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,023
Right. You can't do that.

343
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:17,126
You have to understand the processes and the workflows and the, you know, how long it takes and what people are doing

344
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,847
and how much of their life they're pouring into your creation.

345
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,829
And therefore, you have to be respectful and treat them with respect.

346
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,673
Tremaine asks, what were some major hurdles, if any,

347
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:35,897
that the team experienced doing the remake

348
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:37,279
outside of the pandemic?

349
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:37,659
Yeah.

350
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,863
Yeah, outside of the pandemic.

351
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:47,548
I think our major hurdles were always about making sure

352
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:50,451
that we were being true to the original, right?

353
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,283
You know, we'd learned a lot, Blue Point and, you know,

354
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:56,824
Japan Studio had learned a lot

355
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,345
remaking Shadow of the Colossus.

356
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,768
And it wasn't until that title was made

357
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:04,730
that we felt that we could take on Demon's Souls

358
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,491
and do it justice.

359
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:10,574
And so we knew that we could make a great experience

360
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:16,619
and we could definitely give you incredibly outstanding

361
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,721
audio and visual and sensory experience

362
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:20,462
on the PlayStation 5.

363
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,213
but it was always going to be,

364
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:25,814
are we doing the original justice

365
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:28,874
and are we always remaining and staying true

366
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,075
to that original vision?

367
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:37,536
Misha asks, in comparison to the Dark Souls series,

368
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:39,757
do you feel player progression

369
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:41,657
is something that needs to be kept?

370
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:45,118
And she says, I found learning about the progression

371
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:47,938
in Dark Souls a very useful benchmark.

372
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,891
Yes, probably.

373
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:57,515
But you have to differentiate the Demon's Souls and Dark Souls are two completely different titles.

374
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:05,120
You know, the Dark Souls series is a child of Demon's Souls and Demon's Souls is the first of its kind.

375
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:12,606
And that's not to say there are many design issues and changes that were made in the Dark Souls series.

376
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:20,492
You know, as the original development team learned more about what they wanted to create and how they felt that game should play.

377
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:28,199
I think Demon's Souls, though, stands up, you know, even today as a classic.

378
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:34,024
And I'm just glad we got the chance to remake it and bring it to a whole new generation of gamers out there.

379
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:42,490
Ibrahim asks, what would you recommend an aspiring game designer from Europe

380
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:46,153
who wants to work abroad, for example, in Japan?

381
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:49,656
Learn Japanese.

382
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:51,438
Right.

383
00:23:52,265 --> 00:24:00,232
Definitely learn Japanese. I've been here 18 years and I'm still terrible, so that will help you immensely.

384
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:09,560
If you really have the passion, you really want to go to a foreign country, I think the best way to do it is pack your bags and go to the foreign country.

385
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:20,090
Right, find a means to get there. You know, live your dream, get on that plane, you know, whatever it is, get to that foreign country and then.

386
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:24,761
you know, really start applying to companies and get your way in.

387
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:27,904
And it doesn't matter how you get in, get in at any level.

388
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:31,607
And then, you know, if you have the passion, you'll get to where you want to be,

389
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:34,329
but it's not going to come to you.

390
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:37,192
You've got to pick up your boots and get there yourself.

391
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:42,536
Uh, Tremaine is asking to, for you to remake legend of Dragoon.

392
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:43,317
Oh yeah.

393
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:46,120
So yeah, yeah, I would do that one.

394
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:51,718
Yeah. Let's see. This one just popped up.

395
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:57,001
OK. Michael asks, how have you balanced creative direction slash vision

396
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:59,943
with with schedule restraints?

397
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:03,005
Or, you know, I don't expect to get into like what you were working on

398
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:06,147
with budget specifically, but those kinds of restraints. Yeah.

399
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:12,011
Well. I'm not going to talk about budget, but Demon's Souls

400
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,452
is not a cheap game at all.

401
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,813
And it shows I mean, it's a triple A title.

402
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:16,974
It stands out there on its own.

403
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,582
And we were very lucky to get the backing to do that.

404
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:26,703
I think schedule wise, you know, you always believe as a creative director,

405
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:30,424
there's always another six months if you are kind enough to the executives.

406
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,565
And you say, look, it's great, don't you?

407
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,866
You know, and they're like, yeah, but, you know, and we're like,

408
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:36,986
well, just give me six more months and it'll be even better.

409
00:25:37,046 --> 00:25:41,308
And, you know, with a launch title, you don't get that option.

410
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:44,689
That's a drop dead deadline. And.

411
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,092
It's my first launch title in 24 years of working at Sony,

412
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:50,733
and it was a complete honor to make it,

413
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:52,875
but it was incredibly difficult,

414
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:59,300
you know, knowing that we had to go into QA and testing

415
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:03,624
and, you know, pushing and pushing and pushing

416
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:06,826
to make sure that, you know, the game was ready for that

417
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,288
so we could get the feedback

418
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:10,329
and then have enough time to implement it.

419
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,732
Always with the thing that, you know, in November.

420
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:17,009
the hardware is going to launch and we have to be there with it.

421
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:21,653
Yeah, that's kind of a hard, hard stop there.

422
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:22,994
Yeah, yeah, it's a hard stop.

423
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:27,357
Kylie asks, we've got a few more minutes, so get your questions in.

424
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,378
We'll try to get to all of them.

425
00:26:28,478 --> 00:26:34,223
Kylie asks, especially working remotely, how do you keep your team in alignment

426
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:38,046
and make sure everyone has access to the development resources they need?

427
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:47,669
Okay, so a year ago, literally a year ago, we packed up everything. Everybody took home their

428
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:53,374
equipment, set up everything in the house. We tested everything before we left the office to

429
00:26:53,414 --> 00:27:01,360
make sure it would work. So I have literally in my living room, which my family hate, I have a

430
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,365
massive desktop PC, two 4K monitors, obviously my TV.

431
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:10,375
that I use most of the time, that's why my family hates it,

432
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:13,636
and a massive PlayStation 5 dev kit

433
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:15,938
and an assortment of other equipment.

434
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:19,880
How do you keep them in line?

435
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,982
It's a lot of relying on them as professionals, right?

436
00:27:25,323 --> 00:27:27,144
You know, we don't treat people like children,

437
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:29,805
that they're professionals and they will do the work

438
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:30,885
and they'll get on and do it.

439
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:32,366
They have a passion for what they're doing.

440
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,288
And, you know, you just have to trust in people.

441
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:38,298
And team structure is very important with that.

442
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:40,479
It's also very important to make sure

443
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,760
that you're online with them, you're talking to them,

444
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,420
and that you're accessible to them,

445
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:53,003
whether that's through line, Slack, Zoom, WebEx, whatever

446
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:57,185
it may be, that they can chat to you if they have a problem

447
00:27:57,245 --> 00:27:58,265
or that they need advice.

448
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:07,776
Sari asks, how do you as a creative director fight creative blocks?

449
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,077
They put in quotes.

450
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:09,978
You don't.

451
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:12,099
There's nothing you can do.

452
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:25,567
Okay, I have ideas in my head where I've literally stopped working on them for years because I've come up with something in the story for instance that just won't work.

453
00:28:26,347 --> 00:28:29,869
And then suddenly you can be in the shower you can be driving you can be.

454
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:32,551
you know, cooking, you could be doing something, you just go,

455
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:37,595
Oh, okay, that's how it's going to work. And that's when suddenly you rush back to

456
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:41,819
that idea. And you start jotting things down or writing things down. There's no

457
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:47,283
way to get over a creative block. Right. You know, some people I know, will sit

458
00:28:47,323 --> 00:28:52,047
there and bang their head against the idea forever. And there are some of them

459
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:56,972
are great, and they can work through it. Me for myself, personally, I just leave

460
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:59,213
it alone. I'll let it go and work.

461
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:06,663
a different tangent on the same project or jump into another idea and work on that for a while

462
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:15,886
until inspiration strikes. Mowing the lawn also helps. Yeah. And any of those normal mundane

463
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:22,769
daily things where your mind drifts away and you become, you know, you're not involved with it

464
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:27,870
anymore. It suddenly wants to jump back in and take control again. And that's when those blocks

465
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,091
end up.

466
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,012
disappearing. All right. 10 seconds. Kelly asks,

467
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:36,555
what qualities do you look for in the members of your team?

468
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,939
Passion, love for what you're doing. Um, they're all skilled.

469
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,940
They all have a lot of experience, um,

470
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:50,243
and a willingness to learn and are willing to be open and are willing to be

471
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:50,783
creative.

472
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:54,615
And that's all the time we have.

473
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,616
That absolutely flew by.

474
00:29:57,196 --> 00:30:00,278
Gavin, thank you so much for getting up in the morning.

475
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:02,819
I know you're super busy and taking the time to do this.

476
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,381
Thank you to everyone in the audience

477
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:07,322
for giving us great questions to work with.

478
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:08,222
Really appreciate it.

479
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:09,383
Awesome.

480
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:10,423
Thank you so much, Chris.

481
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:12,664
And thank you for having me today.

482
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:14,445
And thank you to everybody out there.

483
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,286
And I hope you enjoyed Demon's Souls.

484
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:20,348
And I hope we can make new and exciting experiences for you

485
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:20,669
all there.

486
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:22,570
And I hope to see you around in the industry.

487
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:23,673
Take care.
