1
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:13,640
I don't know how to start these videos, so I thought it would be more interesting if

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,300
I was holding a plant when I started.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,100
Hi everyone.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,941
My name is Janessa.

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,462
I'm a product manager at Kongregate and I'm going to be talking to you about minimum viable

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:21,963
products.

7
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:27,685
I am well aware that when some people hear the term minimum viable product, their brain

8
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:31,366
fires a synapse that says abort all non-critical function.

9
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:33,247
And I get it.

10
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:38,048
Unless you are a huge nerd like some people in the room, then minimum viable products

11
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,069
probably doesn't excite you.

12
00:00:41,044 --> 00:00:44,287
But the truth of the matter is it's very likely that you have used a minimum

13
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:47,149
viable product and are may even be using one now.

14
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:51,672
So in this talk, we're going to discuss ways that you can utilize them

15
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:55,135
strategically in ways that will help your game, help your product, help your

16
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:55,815
love life.

17
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:57,497
I lied about that last one.

18
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:00,439
I want my second cup of coffee.

19
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,820
So you're just going to have to bear with me.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,364
So without further ado, let me whisk you away into the.

21
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:10,345
wonderful world of MVPs.

22
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:15,479
I guess before we get started, I could introduce myself some more.

23
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:16,320
Hi, I'm Janessa.

24
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,301
I'm a product manager at Congregate.

25
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:22,285
Some of the things that I do are I worked on our PC gaming platform cartridge.

26
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:27,049
I work on the website, data and security, which is super interesting to about 2%

27
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:28,770
of the earth population.

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,673
I'm among them and various other tasks that nobody wants to do because I'm a

29
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,815
product manager and that's what being a product manager is all about.

30
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:40,640
If that photo looks kind of familiar, it's because I took it like 20 minutes ago.

31
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:48,289
So anyway, Kongregate is a mobile publisher and open platform for browser-based games.

32
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,555
You may remember us as the Flash Games website you would secretly log into

33
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:55,500
to play games while you were in high school history class.

34
00:01:55,865 --> 00:02:01,547
While we don't necessarily condone you playing games in high school, we do appreciate you logging on.

35
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:08,789
Some of our mobile game titles include Idle Frontier, Zen Idol, Animation Throwdown, Bit Heroes, and Pocket Politics.

36
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:16,832
So I've said minimum viable product a handful of times now. It might even be 20. I don't know. I've blacked out up until this point.

37
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:21,310
But if we were to put a definition to it, what would that definition be?

38
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,891
Well, I will tell you.

39
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:27,654
The smallest solution you can build that will bring the most value to your users.

40
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:31,277
There are a lot of ways that you can utilize an MVP, but in this talk

41
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,959
specifically, we're going to cover how you can use it when you're building a

42
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:38,282
new product or when you're adding new features to your games.

43
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:43,405
I think before we go further, it's important that we do my third favorite

44
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:45,266
activity, which is setting expectations.

45
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:50,987
What is or isn't an MVP? An MVP is not just something that you've built and that you put in front of a user.

46
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,169
There's more strategy and there's more research behind it.

47
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,674
And the example that I like to use is you have found a problem that your users have,

48
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:00,817
and we have an idea of how we want to go about solving it.

49
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,841
An MVP is not, we made a thing. Let's see if anyone likes it.

50
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:10,219
Now there's nothing wrong with making a thing and seeing if anyone likes it, but it's not an MVP.

51
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,780
Why is an MVP something that you should use?

52
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:17,242
Well, to put it lightly, everything is expensive.

53
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:22,904
Actions that involve resources or time or development or meetings, it all costs money.

54
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:29,107
And chances are money is something that you have to take into consideration when you're building your product, when you're working on your game.

55
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:34,950
And MVPs are helpful because they allow you to engage your users while using minimal resources

56
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,012
to get immediate and useful feedback. If you were to just build something without knowing

57
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:45,694
anything about your users and put it in front of a person, you may just get feedback that it's bad.

58
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:51,117
Getting feedback that this is bad is not very usable or helpful. It doesn't really get you

59
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:56,399
anywhere. Starting with an MVP helps reduce the chance that all you learn is this is bad.

60
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:58,799
therefore saving you time and money as you build.

61
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:07,583
I'm a visual person and I like to visualize this process and I also think it helps other folks when they're learning about it kind of understand it a little bit more.

62
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:14,046
This is a very popular diagram that you've probably seen floating around the web or maybe even taped up on your office somewhere.

63
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:18,188
I think it does a great job showing at a high level what an MVP might look like.

64
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:25,435
The main takeaway that I want you to have is that an MVP is shipping something useful to your audience.

65
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:37,520
In this diagram, when you give a user a tire, that's not necessarily the most useful thing if the end goal is for you to get them from location A to location B.

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,243
Alternatively, giving them a skateboard, while it might not be the end solution, it might not even be the best solution, it's still a solution.

67
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:48,385
It gives them something of value. It also gives you feedback which can shape your decision.

68
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:53,988
the future iterations of your product. To be totally honest, I have a love-hate relationship

69
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:58,911
with this diagram. I think it does a really good job if you were to use it to explain what an MVP

70
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:03,413
is to like your drunk uncle at Christmas or Thanksgiving. It does a really good job showing

71
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:08,916
what a high level of what an MVP is, but I don't think it does a great job showing how an MVP

72
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:12,398
should go. Again, if we were to look at this diagram, the product jumps.

73
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,661
are pretty big, especially like scooter to bike. It's a huge product iteration. Motorcycle to car

74
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:25,522
is a huge product iteration. It's also quite expensive from a manufacturing standpoint.

75
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:29,544
And frankly, I find it to be a little misleading if you were to apply this practice to your own

76
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:34,605
product. So I like to use a diagram that makes more sense in terms of product iteration,

77
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:40,567
but is also slightly more appropriate for GDC. Ta-da! The Nintendo handheld gaming family.

78
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:47,491
When I talk about MVP iteration, I really like to use Nintendo's handheld gaming tree evolution.

79
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:49,212
You pick.

80
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:57,058
As an example, because it's more realistic in that it's more of a gradual iteration upon each next product.

81
00:05:57,838 --> 00:05:59,720
So there are four components of an MVP.

82
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,681
We're going to talk about each and every one of them.

83
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:06,685
The first one is starting with the problem, discovering the solution, gathering feedback, and then iterating.

84
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,627
Now, I know that the title of my talk is,

85
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:12,629
start your minimum viable product with a solution,

86
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,930
but actually you should be starting with the problem.

87
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,732
You can't get a solution if you don't have a problem.

88
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:20,134
When you start with a problem for your MVP,

89
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,255
the two things you must keep in mind are,

90
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,578
one, you know who you are building your product for,

91
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:28,300
and two, you know those users well enough

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,540
to know what their problems are,

93
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,881
which means you have to talk to them.

94
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:37,547
Sorry. If we were to look at an example of an MVP, Kongregate itself is actually a great example of an

95
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:43,271
MVP. Emily and Jim Greer saw this problem with indie game developers were having with distributing

96
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:47,835
their games, partly because they knew their users, partly because they were their users themselves.

97
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:52,378
The solution was to build Kongregate, which if you are not familiar by now,

98
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:55,481
is a website that empowers indie devs.

99
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:58,062
to have more control of their game distribution.

100
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:02,063
And the website you see today, with the addition of chat, the awards, the companions,

101
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:06,085
is the result of years and years of iteration and feedback from that original MVP.

102
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:12,087
And actually, the slide that you see here is from Emily Greer's talk a few years ago, in 2016.

103
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:19,150
She did a post-mortem on the website and the first 10 years of Kongregate, which is really fascinating.

104
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,813
So I pulled that slide from her talk to show what their MVP was and then what was actually next.

105
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:30,575
So you've built your MVP or you've built something and you're laying in bed,

106
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:35,116
gazing into the abyss, wondering, how do I know when I am done building?

107
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:39,018
Ask yourself, does this solve my user's problem?

108
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:42,239
You don't need to solve every solution. You just need to start with one solution.

109
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:46,521
This part is really hard because it's where you need to flex your saying no muscle.

110
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,822
Remember that the M stands for minimum.

111
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:51,382
You shipped your MVP, now what?

112
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:51,902
Feedback.

113
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:56,784
Feedback is how you help your MVP grow and stay viable, which is also the V part of the

114
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,744
word in case you missed that.

115
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,765
What does it mean when something is viable?

116
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:05,086
Viable means that your product has the ability to grow and function properly.

117
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:08,667
In order for something to be viable to your users, you need two things.

118
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:09,767
You need to listen to them.

119
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:13,669
You need to listen to them in the first place and understand what they need.

120
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,051
And two, you need to keep listening to them forever and ever and ever.

121
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:19,353
You can't just listen to them in the beginning and then stop.

122
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,534
You have to keep talking to them and listening to them.

123
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,215
Sorry to break that news to you.

124
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,016
How do you know what feedback to listen to?

125
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:28,958
Depending on how you're gathering feedback, and we'll talk about some examples in a moment,

126
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:31,520
but I can certainly feel like you're trying to drink from a fire hose.

127
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,568
To top it all off, depending on the source of feedback, much of it might not actually

128
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:37,089
be helpful.

129
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:38,751
For example, like most of Twitter.

130
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,316
Side note, I really hope the man in that photo is okay.

131
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:42,477
But I do think it's funny.

132
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,526
Well, it all comes down to your vision.

133
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,807
When you are gathering feedback, ask yourself,

134
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:50,228
is this related to our minimum viable product

135
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,089
that we started with?

136
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,510
Does it align with our overall product vision?

137
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,791
Most importantly, will this help us add more value?

138
00:08:57,212 --> 00:09:00,213
What you'll find is, you'll actually be saying no a lot

139
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:02,894
to a lot of the feedback that you receive.

140
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:03,274
I.

141
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,810
Absolutely love this tweet by Insomniac.

142
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,911
I want to cross-stitch it.

143
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:08,871
I want to hang it on a wall in my living room.

144
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:11,972
Listening doesn't mean we will always do what people tell us to.

145
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:12,632
We hear you.

146
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:14,653
Hearing doesn't mean we act or follow.

147
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:17,714
Once you've gotten useful feedback from your users,

148
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:21,875
it's time to iterate and add further value onto your product.

149
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:25,796
It's really important here that you do not iterate just for the sake of iteration.

150
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:28,791
when you iterate just for the sake of iteration,

151
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:31,653
you're really just wasting money in terms of an MVP.

152
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:33,114
We've talked about the four steps

153
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,595
of a minimum viable product.

154
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,656
Now I'd like to talk about some more examples,

155
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:38,257
specifically here at Congregate,

156
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:40,959
how we gather feedback, how we iterate upon that feedback,

157
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,121
so that you can take this and apply it to your real life.

158
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:46,203
Maybe even your romantic life, I don't know.

159
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:51,887
Internal testing is a really great way to get quick feedback and eyes on your game simply

160
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,828
by recruiting folks within your workplace.

161
00:09:54,469 --> 00:10:00,072
Even close friends and family could arguably looped into the internal playtesting tool.

162
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:04,194
Here at Congregate, the teams will have a small group of playtesters.

163
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:08,276
Usually one person is running the playtest and another is taking notes.

164
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:12,657
Each person will be on their own device playing the game.

165
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:18,279
They'll start around the same time and as observations come out, they'll say,

166
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,960
oh I'm having a hard time at this part or oh I really like the art at this

167
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,341
at this point in the game. The person who's taking notes will write all of

168
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,382
that down and at the end of the playtest the

169
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:32,202
moderator will send out a short survey to get an idea

170
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,263
of how it went.

171
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:39,026
One of our teams, in the survey they send out, they put the vision statement of the game and ask,

172
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:44,728
does the game you play fall in line with this vision statement, yes or no? I think that's a

173
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:50,131
great idea because it helps give you, the team, a good read on, are we following our vision statement?

174
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:55,934
Do our users also think that we are following the vision statement we've set for ourselves and for

175
00:10:56,014 --> 00:11:01,437
the game? Here at Congregate, we're incredibly lucky to have a seasoned team of community members.

176
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,941
who utilize among many things the power of community forums.

177
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:11,028
Oftentimes, community managers will create topic-specific feedback threads for new features,

178
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:15,454
partially so that players can stay on topic they want to, but partially also so that the

179
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,656
feedback is a bit more organized.

180
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:21,441
It also gives angry players a place to be angry.

181
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:28,106
instead of just putting it all over the forums. Additionally, the CS teams here at Kongregate

182
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:33,190
are really good at getting ahead of anticipating questions about new features or changes before

183
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,014
the release, and most of that is they just know their players and their communities really well.

184
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:42,037
It's really true that a good community manager is worth their weight in...

185
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:45,860
what's worth more than gold? Platinum. Dark matter.

186
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:52,819
Diamonds? You know what I mean. Time for some real talk. To be perfectly transparent, it's

187
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:57,902
oftentimes difficult for CS members to get all the information they need from a dev team prior

188
00:11:58,002 --> 00:12:04,586
to a release going out. And this is really a prevalent trend anywhere you go. I do recommend

189
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:09,910
taking time to ask your CS team how they can be better supported prior to any release. I mean,

190
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,032
they are the first line of defense when you get that feedback firehose.

191
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:19,462
So if they're going to be a human body shield, they might as well be a little bit prepared.

192
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:19,942
You know what I mean?

193
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:24,625
Another great option for utilizing and collecting feedback is a player council.

194
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:26,806
Our team on BitHeroes utilizes this.

195
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:31,789
It's a great option for a platform that has established audience and or active community.

196
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,852
The BitHeroes council is made up of players who have been elected by their peers.

197
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:41,916
The community manager communicates with the council via discord and shares the feedback with the product owners.

198
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:49,358
The console itself is split by roles, such as beta testers, but also includes a panel of meta specialists, such as tank DPS and so on.

199
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,779
The BitHeroes team will often use the console not only as feedback for upcoming features, but recently released ones.

200
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,341
When the team released Elemental Attacks into the system, this update sort of nerfed...

201
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:07,602
all previous builds in that attack bonuses were now ineffective against any elemental attacks.

202
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:12,963
Utilizing the player council, specifically the meta specialists, the team were able to change

203
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:18,205
that feature based on their feedback. The end result was changing the previous builds

204
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:24,986
to become 75% effective on a bonus attack. We've talked about a few use cases where feedback

205
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:29,227
has brought a fair amount of success. Now let's talk about the opposite of that.

206
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:31,376
Cartridge.

207
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:34,877
For those of you who are unfamiliar, Cartridge is a PC gaming platform.

208
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:38,518
We wanted to make a community that was very welcoming and supportive

209
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,100
for these indie game devs, as well for the people who play their games.

210
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,002
When we were in closed beta, we did what any sane person would do,

211
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:50,683
and we sent out surveys to our users so that we could gather feedback

212
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:54,485
and test the proverbial waters of how we were doing so far.

213
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:56,726
And this was kind of our first misstep.

214
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,729
First of all, the surveys were not designed well.

215
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,851
There are folks whose entire career

216
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:06,313
is dedicated to designing a good survey.

217
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:10,535
It's really easy to make a survey bad, I've learned.

218
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:12,317
I cannot understate this enough.

219
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:14,178
Invest time in writing your survey.

220
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:15,659
User test your survey.

221
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,740
If you can hire someone to write the survey,

222
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,321
that would probably be best.

223
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:22,863
Secondly, there was just too many qualitative questions.

224
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:27,184
which meant there was just a lot of qualitative data to parse.

225
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:33,645
Now qualitative data is important, but also very difficult to interpret. Again,

226
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:40,967
there are people who dedicate their lives to gathering and organizing this feedback properly,

227
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:46,988
and I have nothing but crazy respect for them. But if you get too much of it,

228
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:51,209
and you don't have someone who knows how to parse it, it can be a nightmare.

229
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:58,887
Lastly, and I'll touch on this a little bit more, we ignored red flags that we were getting in the feedback.

230
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:07,413
This is very important. If you know for a fact that you are gathering feedback from your primary users,

231
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:16,621
meaning people who you know your product is for, and the feedback they are giving you is trending in a specific direction,

232
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:20,183
that feedback will not change just because you go from closed to open beta.

233
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:28,335
it won't. You'll just be seeing more of that data in the same direction. So if we

234
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:31,457
were to look at some examples from our feedback, we really did get a lot of

235
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:35,640
positive feedback, mostly about the design. A lot of people liked it and if

236
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,262
you take a chance to go look at the design, it really is beautiful.

237
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:42,946
The team did a fantastic job there. The thing about design is even the best

238
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:48,250
design will not save you if your users don't see the value in your product,

239
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,031
which we will see momentarily.

240
00:15:50,672 --> 00:15:56,157
A lot of users thought Cartridge was supposed to be Kongregate 2.0, aka free to play games.

241
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,304
We don't have enough time to go into this. Like, this could be a whole nother GDC talk,

242
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:09,571
but getting this feedback that your players are so far from your product vision

243
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:13,755
is a huge red flag. You could not get a bigger red flag than this.

244
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:20,241
As a result, nobody was buying games because of above. Everyone thought this was supposed to be

245
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:25,866
Kongregate version 2.0. Probably the harshest feedback of all was it was slowly becoming

246
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:32,192
clear that Cartridge wasn't solving any problems that weren't being solved by many other established

247
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:38,438
platforms. Like GOG, like Steam, like at the time the newly released proverbial silverback gorilla

248
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,919
that was the Epic Games Store.

249
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:47,875
In this day and age, a new gaming platform is actually perceived by the target audience as a hassle versus a solution.

250
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:54,537
Ask any developer who's been review-bombed because they decided to release exclusively on Epic.

251
00:16:55,498 --> 00:17:01,019
Many people take severe personal offense when you suggest they have to have multiple game libraries.

252
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,761
I don't like ending on a sad note.

253
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:05,062
I'm also too caffeinated to end on a sad note.

254
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:08,284
So instead I'll end on a cute and happy one, which is companions.

255
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:13,266
Now if you're familiar, they are cute little characters that congregate players can achieve

256
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:15,247
when they earn the badge of the day.

257
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:21,430
Companions came into the picture when players had been voicing a disconnect between earning

258
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,951
the daily badges and some kind of long-term goal.

259
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:31,115
After Companions were released, the percentage of monthly average users did see a very slight decline.

260
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:35,158
However, the average badges that were being earned increased.

261
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:42,182
This means that even though a bit less users were earning them, the badges became more meaningful to the players who were pursuing them.

262
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,363
And thus ends our in-venture.

263
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:48,226
A lot of lessons were learned today, and only a few of them ended in tears.

264
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:54,251
As you leave this video, undoubtedly a completely transformed individual, I leave you with a

265
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,392
few points to summarize.

266
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,076
MVPs are about who is using your product.

267
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:03,141
It's only going to be as good as much as you understand your customer's needs.

268
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:07,046
So if you don't understand your customer, your MVP won't have very much V, if you know

269
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:07,346
what I mean.

270
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:15,648
Do not iterate for the sake of iteration. Iteration should only be towards further value to your users, not just for funsies.

271
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:22,449
Remember that development, meetings, planning, it all costs money. Everything costs money. Everything costs money.

272
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:27,770
Feedback is a double-edged sword. While it's critical to growth, it has a mind of its own.

273
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,871
But finding avenues for you to control the feedback you receive will help you wield that sword more wisely.

274
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:35,491
Say no more than you say yes.

275
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:39,552
This is a very difficult muscle to build, but having a strong product vision and

276
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:43,053
sticking with your MVP and not chasing shiny things will help you build that

277
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:43,413
habit.

278
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:47,774
Lastly, I would like to give a shout out to the folks who helped me make this

279
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:48,094
talk.

280
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:53,855
I know you just see my slides and my face, but a lot of people actually helped

281
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,915
me and the talk get to where it is today, which is on a video, hopefully

282
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:00,236
playing on Twitch, but I don't know.

283
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:00,556
We'll see.

284
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:04,816
So my deepest appreciation goes to everyone on this list for all of the

285
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:05,557
help that they gave me.

286
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:11,178
Usually at this point of the talk if I was doing it in person I would say any questions and some people might have questions

287
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:15,739
But since this is a video and we can't do that the most I can do is give you my twitter

288
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,221
Which is that it's at little dova. You can talk to me if you want or just send me a

289
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:24,762
Plant photo because I like plants. Please do not be mean to me. I will cry

290
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:27,123
Thank you so much for watching my talk today

291
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:28,923
I have to tell you it is so weird

292
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:33,925
Staring at a camera and not actually talking to a real human being because the camera just has this one

293
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:38,372
void of an eye that stares at you with no facial expressions.

294
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:41,899
It'll never truly replace a human. But yet, thank you,

295
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,746
anyway. And of course, remember to be excellent to each other.
