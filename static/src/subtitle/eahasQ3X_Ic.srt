1
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:06,523
All right.

2
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:09,084
We're going to talk about competitive gaming

3
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:12,665
on touch screens real quick.

4
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:15,186
Just a quick show of hands, who here

5
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:16,586
is an actual competitive gamer?

6
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:19,007
Most of you guys.

7
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:19,647
That's good.

8
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:21,208
A lot of people, anyway.

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,569
Who out of those competitive gamers, who today

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,370
has a deep conviction that competitive gaming can

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,311
actually be done on touch screens in the first place?

12
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:32,953
That's really good.

13
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:35,298
You know, I did this about, I want to say,

14
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:37,683
nine months ago at a different conference,

15
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:39,787
where literally, I think there was one guy

16
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,012
who stood up and said, I think it can be done.

17
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:50,310
We've obviously believed in this in a long time, and we've been working on it, and it's just great to see that more and more people are seeing that it actually can be done.

18
00:00:50,951 --> 00:01:09,188
So my name is Christian. I am the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director, originally an investor in 2.0 Megacorp, today spending 25 hours a day building out what I'm hoping and what we are hoping is going to be one of the companies that will help really build the era when...

19
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:13,734
The touchscreen generation finally gets hold of the kind of gaming experiences that all

20
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,054
of us grew up with on PCs.

21
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:22,035
I grew up with games like Unreal Tournament, Warcraft 3, and sort of fondly remember those

22
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:26,876
nights spent together with my friends, having lugged each other's PCs over to one place,

23
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:31,677
playing as a LAN party competitively, cooperatively, literally all night, and then pretending to

24
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,317
our moms that we would have slept at some point in time.

25
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:37,658
And just those experiences were incredible, visceral, deep, engaging.

26
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:43,413
and we all feel very sad that the touchscreen generation is constrained to kind of three-minute

27
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:47,133
gaming sessions. You can't have an all-nighter with three-minute gaming sessions. It just

28
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:53,535
doesn't work. So anyway, what my talk is about today is really lessons, if you like, from

29
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:59,336
building a competitive game. I feel super cheesy saying building an eSport because I

30
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:02,417
just don't know that you even can build an eSport. We've set our sights on building.

31
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:07,183
a legit, genuine, competitive game that we would want to play ourselves.

32
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:13,008
And then we've just been delighted that the community has taken it up in such a big way

33
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,890
as a competitive activity for them.

34
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,095
But anything with eSport is clickbait these days, so it's an eSports summit, so I put

35
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:21,016
eSports in my title.

36
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:23,049
Anyway, a little bit about me.

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,410
So I've actually been building game companies for a long time.

38
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,531
In fact, I used to play so much games as a kid that I never

39
00:02:30,132 --> 00:02:31,952
managed to get myself a proper job.

40
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,953
That was my mom's predictions since a very early age.

41
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:36,453
So I've actually spent all of my time since leaving

42
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:37,894
university building game companies.

43
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:40,015
I was originally a co-founder of what today is Glue Mobile,

44
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:43,376
with a dream to put what I then used to play on my Nintendo

45
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:45,736
into people's pockets through enabling them to download

46
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:46,597
games onto mobiles.

47
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:52,030
After that, building Playfish with a dream to connect people playing games through social

48
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,390
networks.

49
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,332
I was originally an investor, led the seed investment round into a company called Supercell

50
00:02:57,352 --> 00:03:00,733
that's today the largest touch screen gaming company in the world by revenue.

51
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:04,655
And I was on their board of directors for a long time until they became part of Softbank.

52
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:08,897
And as of the past three years or so, I've been part of building Super Evil Megacorp.

53
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:16,220
So I've sort of had the good fortune of building what I felt back then would be sort of the

54
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,540
next.

55
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:23,002
big growth wave in games and being there very early and made lots and lots and lots of mistakes

56
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:27,325
along the way and have had some successes and have worked with some amazing people.

57
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:32,749
And one of the things that I feel is most amazing about the touchscreen gaming market

58
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,891
today is you listen to any of the analysts or the bankers and they'll tell you it's like

59
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,833
a, I heard the term yesterday, purple ocean.

60
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:43,997
It is so red and it's so, so competitive and so visceral and no one can survive that.

61
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:46,498
It's like the reddest ocean ever, so it's now a purple ocean.

62
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:48,283
I actually didn't believe any of that.

63
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:51,724
I think if you create an amazing product, you can still punch through it in many ways.

64
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,806
But what's amazing about the notion of core gaming on touchscreens is that, I think for

65
00:03:56,846 --> 00:04:01,608
the first time as an industry, we're in a place where those of us who grew up as core

66
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:09,311
gamers finally both have the volume and the technical capability on these devices that

67
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:14,333
could potentially support some very, very large multiplayer competitive games over time.

68
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:18,611
I'm just excited to be part of this industry at a very early stage of its growth.

69
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:21,473
But it's something that we as a company are very focused on.

70
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,794
So, as a company, just a quick boilerplate on what we're doing.

71
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:26,675
We're about four years old.

72
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:34,659
We are a company that focuses very much on creating the best home for really veteran core gaming talent.

73
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,961
That's made games at places like Riot or Rockstar Games and other places.

74
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:43,284
We try to create a fairly small company, but a small company with hopefully a very big impact.

75
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,640
We are only about 50 people or so across the board.

76
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,820
We don't necessarily aim to grow that much.

77
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,421
We have about five or 10 open positions,

78
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:52,441
but that is what we believe is going to more or less be it

79
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,381
for the foreseeable future.

80
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,963
We have our own technology, so we have our own game engine,

81
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:00,163
which has been developed over a long time by one of the most

82
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,424
talented developers of console-grade game engines.

83
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:05,685
Out there, we have about $41 million in venture funding,

84
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:06,605
has some great people.

85
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,145
We really have no excuse not to succeed somehow,

86
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,306
but this industry is really hard,

87
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:13,787
so we've been learning a lot over the past couple of years.

88
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,262
Our dream as a company is ultimately to create a franchise for decades.

89
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:22,364
We would love to be, you know, the kind of companies that we loved as we grew up,

90
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:24,445
companies like Blizzard and more recently Riot,

91
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:26,746
who have been able to create a following in a community

92
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,447
by staying really true to the player

93
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:32,929
and staying really true to the core values of the community out there.

94
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,370
Because we believe that these types of...

95
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,451
You can't acquire your way, like user acquire your way

96
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:39,252
to millions and millions of happy players.

97
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,653
You've just got to build it and you've got to support the community

98
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,293
and let the community grow. And that's what we want to do.

99
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:48,342
We also want to create experiences which are not just really fun to play, but really fun to watch.

100
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:54,106
In particular, seeing how the PC eSports era has sort of had these growing audiences year on year

101
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,468
is something that we are really inspired by.

102
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:59,991
We're hoping that by being able to bring these style of experiences to touchscreens,

103
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:02,673
we can actually help grow the broader...

104
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:08,515
Esports world of the board broader spectated gameplay world if you like because in many ways it's kind of more relatable

105
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:09,855
Everyone has that device in their pockets

106
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:15,918
Anyways, I'll play your super quick video of some of our competitive gaming events over the past six months to give you a sense

107
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:22,320
Of what Vainglory is all about right now in terms of its competitive scene. Vainglory is a 3v3 MOBA single lane

108
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:23,621
with a jungle

109
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:28,783
Matches last about 20 minutes played on almost any touchscreen in the in the world today

110
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:32,825
And you have very a very wide variety of devices that play tournaments all across the world

111
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:33,908
Here's a quick compilation.

112
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:35,508
Let's see if we can get some audio as well.

113
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,569
It's not up.

114
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:39,190
It goes down.

115
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,670
He might go for Donatlip.

116
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,631
He's got to get to it.

117
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:45,172
Welcome everyone to the eSports arena here in Santana for the 2015 Pink Glory Autumn

118
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,173
Season Live finals.

119
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:46,453
Let's go.

120
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:46,753
Let's go.

121
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:47,373
Let's go.

122
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:47,653
Let's go.

123
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:47,953
Let's go.

124
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:48,213
Let's go.

125
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:48,654
Let's go.

126
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:48,874
Let's go.

127
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:49,214
Let's go.

128
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:49,474
Let's go.

129
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:49,894
Let's go.

130
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:50,414
Let's go.

131
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:50,795
Let's go.

132
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:51,595
Let's go.

133
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:52,115
Let's go.

134
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:52,695
Let's go.

135
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:52,955
Let's go.

136
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:53,376
Let's go.

137
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:53,596
Let's go.

138
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:54,036
Let's go.

139
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:54,256
Let's go.

140
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:37,736
They are going to seal the deal here at 2-0, or will they?

141
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:42,001
They take down the Kraken, one hit from Wind.

142
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:45,024
Remember that there are no Vayne turrets available.

143
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:47,066
They might look to try and end the game themselves.

144
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,092
This is game three from Liberation X.

145
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:57,718
Liberation X! Oh man, what a fantastic game.

146
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,461
I just can't believe that I've lost to them. It's been an amazing game.

147
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:17,325
So the game was originally released about just over a year ago on high-end iOS devices.

148
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,325
We've since then increased our device support a lot.

149
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:24,467
We released it on Android about seven or eight months ago, and we've since lowered the device

150
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,807
requirements a whole ton.

151
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:27,748
And we're still incredibly early.

152
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:32,850
But one of the things that have taken us by incredible surprise has been how quickly the

153
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,630
competitive community in the game has grown.

154
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,091
In fact, so much so that...

155
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:38,906
You know, every company has to be the number one at something.

156
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:43,687
And today we are by some margin, the number one touch screen eSport.

157
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:47,588
In fact, if you, whether you look at it by, by price pools, by views,

158
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,489
we had over 20 million stream views last year.

159
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:54,050
And in fact, this last weekend alone, we had the North America championships,

160
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,651
the North America regional championships, um, at the Red Bull arena in Los Angeles

161
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:02,432
this last weekend, and that on its own had over a million stream views.

162
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:03,793
So the overall.

163
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,732
kind of viewership is growing. The amount of, yeah, the price pool was over $350,000

164
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:13,355
over the past six months, only a small proportion that came from us. Much of it came from sponsors.

165
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:19,519
There's been folks like, say, Amazon, NVIDIA, Red Bull, others that have gotten involved.

166
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,503
And we've also worked with ESL, OGN, a whole bunch of other kind of enablers, if you like,

167
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:28,946
in the eSports space. All to learn, because frankly, this is something that is entirely new to us.

168
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:33,712
We're excited about the growth of competitive play, but it's something that is still new.

169
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:37,495
After every weekend that we run an event or a tournament, we still continue to have this

170
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,817
massive amount of internal feedback on how can we make this better.

171
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:42,400
We ask our players, we ask our audiences across the board.

172
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,923
And overall, the game has grown very rapidly.

173
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:49,906
We don't actually spend anything on user acquisition or any other sort of traditional mobile games

174
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:50,867
forms of growth.

175
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:53,530
All we do is we try to keep our community happy.

176
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,572
We try to invest in the things that our community want to do.

177
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:57,348
And we can take our time.

178
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,810
We're convinced that in the next three to five to seven

179
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,811
years, somebody's going to build a game on these

180
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,473
platforms, which will be the seminal game on touchscreens

181
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,055
for core gamers.

182
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:07,616
We don't think that can be rushed.

183
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:10,078
We want to try to get it right, and then gradually

184
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,719
invite more players to be part of the experience.

185
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,124
So after about a year, if you like, of operating the game,

186
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:21,246
and now six or seven months of e-sports.

187
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:26,336
or competitive play. We've learned a couple of things across the board. We've certainly

188
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:30,278
made a lot of mistakes. We've gotten some things right, some things wrong. But I wanted

189
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:35,160
to kind of share some of those. And before I do that, I want to play a quick video. One

190
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,682
of the more significant recent events in Vainglory was that even though already last year we

191
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:45,704
had a bunch of European esports teams like Team Secret, SK Gaming, G2 Esports, all acquired

192
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:49,045
Vainglory teams in Europe. Last week, TSM, Team Solomid,

193
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:54,068
Probably one of the most famous North American professional eSports organizations got into

194
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,831
Vainglory by acquiring the current world champions, Team Alliance.

195
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:01,475
And that was kind of a big deal for us because in lots of ways, even though we're focused

196
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:05,258
on making a game that's great, it's always wonderful just to have that kind of vote of

197
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:05,638
confidence.

198
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:09,882
So let me play a quick video of a profile of then Team Alliance, now Team SoloMid.

199
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:13,725
From this last weekend.

200
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:15,807
If we can have a bit of audio again.

201
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:22,955
So we recently got some pretty big news.

202
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:26,258
Alliance has now been acquired by Team SoloMid.

203
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:30,360
We are now paid professionals playing Vainglory full-time.

204
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,081
It is our jobs now.

205
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:37,925
We were absolutely incredibly stunned that we were getting this opportunity and incredibly grateful.

206
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:42,288
TSM is a really big deal and it's a big deal for us to be acquired by them.

207
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:47,748
When I found out that Alliance would be switching over to TSM, it was so super exciting.

208
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:53,350
Like, I know TSM because I was a League of Legends player for a while, so TSM is a really big name for me.

209
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,113
So just the idea of being acquired by such a great team and such a great organization.

210
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:03,436
It just really let me know that I was on the right path.

211
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:07,417
Some people would definitely take it on as a lot of pressure.

212
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:11,158
I think it's something that is actually motivating us as a team.

213
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:17,140
Now we have someone that we can represent who's well known on a global status.

214
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,302
And we really look forward to playing our best on behalf of Team SoloMid.

215
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:24,462
And we're going to take an incredible amount of pride in that.

216
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,366
It's really important winning this tournament.

217
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:31,287
We want to make kind of a new name for ourselves under TSM.

218
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:35,009
If we win this tournament, it's going to mean a ton for Team Solomid.

219
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,251
Bangalore is an esport, it's still incredibly young.

220
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:42,173
I think TSM has taken a leap of faith with us.

221
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:46,315
But if we're able to win this tournament, my smile will be enormous.

222
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:49,538
It is hard to express in words how I feel in moments of that.

223
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:53,761
I still can't express how I felt after we won VIPL,

224
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,803
but winning under the TSM banner will be incredible.

225
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:02,327
So one of the things and the reason I played that video also is the thing

226
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:05,309
that really struck a chord with me last weekend as, you know,

227
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:09,452
they filmed that video and we listened to the interviews live was previously.

228
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:15,685
We were growing this game for ourselves because we wanted to create a great game for us to play and obviously try and create as successful a community as possible.

229
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:19,887
But now there's literally people whose livelihoods right now depend on actually playing the game.

230
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,868
And it sort of gives you a different sense of responsibility when it's somebody's job to play it.

231
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:27,750
You kind of think in a different way just how big a responsibility it is to ultimately grow that game.

232
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,652
So, anyway, so in lots of ways we feel like we've had a great first year out there.

233
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:34,893
We've certainly learned a lot.

234
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:39,055
And we're hoping, in fact this year has kicked off.

235
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,531
Incredibly well for us across the board with our first season. We run quarterly season

236
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,172
So we're in the right at the end of winter season right now

237
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:51,073
We just had the North America Championships next weekend are the European Championships

238
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:56,315
In fact, I'm flying to London straight after this to host those and we have the Korean Championships as well next weekend

239
00:13:57,115 --> 00:13:59,616
and then spring season kicks off end of this month and

240
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:04,677
The cycle starts again if you like, so we've had a good first year but in terms of lessons

241
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,525
I figured what I'd do is I'd sort of split them into five different parts, and

242
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:10,706
all of these have a bunch of bullets.

243
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:14,147
Most of them, I've tried to stick to lessons which are specific to

244
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:18,128
touchscreen esports, because I'm sure many of you guys will know a lot more

245
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,869
about running PC esports than I do.

246
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,730
But certainly, I've sort of split them into product learnings,

247
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,011
community learnings, marketing learnings, business learnings, and

248
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,152
then just a whole bunch of really practical learnings.

249
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,173
So if we start with product.

250
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:40,830
One of the things which is kind of obvious, but really is probably worth restating, is

251
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,270
the importance of control accuracy.

252
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,811
We did an awful lot of work trying to figure out how to bring competitive gameplay to mobile.

253
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:51,833
One of our hypotheses early on was, hey, we need to bring more natural controls, maybe

254
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:55,133
gestures, swipes, gyroscope, any of those things into the game.

255
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,038
Turns out players hate that across the board.

256
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:00,059
We hated it ourselves, and we could validate it outside.

257
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:04,140
Because one of the philosophies that has really paid off for us

258
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,101
is to think through the control scheme of the game

259
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:08,302
in such a way that you can ultimately,

260
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:09,602
after about a minute or two of playing,

261
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,103
you even forget that you're playing on a device.

262
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,024
Your fingers just move naturally,

263
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:15,485
and the only control input we accept is a tap.

264
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,606
In fact, we spent a lot of time optimizing that tap

265
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,848
to make sure that there is absolutely zero control latency across the board.

266
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,008
And what's interesting is that we thought that

267
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:29,827
In fact, leading to the next point, we thought that screen size would be an issue because

268
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:33,228
you know what, fat fingers and a small touch screen, and you know what, even your fingers

269
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:34,989
kind of obscure part of the touch screen.

270
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,012
As it turns out, and we thought even originally we were a tablet gaming company because we

271
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:44,174
figured how on earth could you last hit on a small five-inch screen.

272
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:48,356
As it turns out, kids today are pretty incredible with their fingers and touch screens.

273
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:52,438
In fact, we spent a long time figuring out controls that doesn't obscure the screen.

274
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:57,171
But it turned out that actually a single tap-based control is like the equivalent of a, if you

275
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,493
like, a mouse cursor and a keyboard in some ways.

276
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:02,635
You have a mouse cursor that you're pressing with, and it turns out that your finger is

277
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,236
actually just as accurate.

278
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:08,679
And even if you feel like it's not quite as accurate, it turns out that when you need

279
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:12,922
to do, execute moves like kiting or juking in a MOBA, which is basically say running

280
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:15,064
in one direction and shooting in the other, running in the other direction, shooting in

281
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:18,446
the other, that is a pretty complicated mechanical thing to do on a mouse.

282
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,147
I mean, I've

283
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,249
I'm a fairly sort of, I've played an awful lot of League of Legends and other, other

284
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,750
styles of, other MOBAs on PC.

285
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,892
And it is actually one of the hardest things I find, say if you play in a ranged carry

286
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:34,595
and you need to move away while constantly shooting the opponent, or hitting the opponent,

287
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:35,716
or basically attacking the opponent.

288
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:40,579
That sort of thing is actually super easy to execute with your fingers and you can even

289
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,860
create much more complicated maneuvers where you...

290
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:47,749
So it's a preselected target, fire an ability, move, basic attack, and so on, with really

291
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:48,810
natural taps.

292
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,232
And one of the things that we've been delighted by is to see how many hyper-competitive players

293
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,512
play on very small screens.

294
00:16:55,453 --> 00:17:00,215
In fact, the number two team in North America right now plays almost exclusively on five

295
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:04,557
and a half inch screens on their iPhones, which is just incredible to me.

296
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:09,539
Like I have a, for me, an iPhone 6 Plus is probably a good size screen to play on.

297
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,160
Some people just play on iPads because they think they feel a need for the bigger screen.

298
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,263
It turns out that what you lose in screen size, you actually gain in how quickly you

299
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:19,623
can move.

300
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:22,165
So it's a bit like the acceleration setting for your mouse.

301
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:24,767
It's like, it's either less accurate or it's faster.

302
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:27,349
More accurate or faster, that way.

303
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,292
So it turns out that when you think about screen size, remember that the vast majority

304
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:34,054
of the world is going to probably play on fairly small screens and it's worth thinking

305
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:38,178
about making those guys first class consumers of your interface, whatever it is.

306
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:41,778
Third is session length.

307
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:44,179
So when we got started and we initially launched the game,

308
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,961
Vainglory's average game length is about 20 minutes.

309
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:49,122
An awful lot of people were pooh-poohing us, saying, look,

310
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:49,823
it's a mobile game.

311
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:52,965
It's been proven over and over again, mobile players don't

312
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:54,645
play for longer than three minutes, because that's the

313
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,647
sort of attention span of a mobile gamer.

314
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,748
That may very well be true for a lot of mobile gamers.

315
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:01,870
Turns out it really isn't true for everybody.

316
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,491
20 minute session is perfectly fine for people who are

317
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:05,552
interested in competitive gaming.

318
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,073
Could we also make shorter game modes?

319
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:08,453
Sure.

320
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:13,469
But what we tried to do was create a session length which allows for tactical and strategic

321
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:19,515
depth, which is akin to some of the best competitive games on PCs, which means that there are different

322
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:20,376
phases to the game.

323
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:22,438
There are phases where you outthink the opponent.

324
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:25,902
You're basically playing a game of chess as well as an action game, if you like.

325
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:27,984
You build, you counter build.

326
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:31,012
You think about objectives, you think about rotations, you think about where you should

327
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:32,733
be, about taking objectives at different times.

328
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:38,276
And what we tried to do was squeeze that experience to as short as it can be while still maintaining

329
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:41,538
the buildup, the tension, if you like, that something is building up, building up, building

330
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,820
up and resolving itself in a team fight and an objective and the next thing.

331
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,982
And then again, releasing that tension and then building up the tension again.

332
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:52,064
And it turns out that that's worked really well for us.

333
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,866
Our philosophy from the start was we didn't try to create a game.

334
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,144
There was particularly easy to learn or a game that was particularly sort of

335
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:04,005
on-boarding friendly or rewards you for absolutely everything

336
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:08,327
with massive coin fountains and things which is what mid-core games are very good at today.

337
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:12,009
We try to first and foremost solve for core gamers

338
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:14,230
and try to figure out can we create a game that has

339
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,991
legitimacy that we ourselves would love to play every day.

340
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:21,173
In fact as a company we still play every day at 5 p.m. We have a company guild

341
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,814
all of us play and even when we go home I still spend more of my time playing

342
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,535
Jimmy and Glory today than any other game out there.

343
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:31,434
Partially because I'm part of the community, but partially also because just as a core gamer, I'm hooked.

344
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,175
I don't have as much time for PC gaming today.

345
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:36,156
And I can sneak in a game of Vainglory almost anywhere right now,

346
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:39,057
as opposed to having to be in front of my game PC at home.

347
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:44,979
So, turns out, absolutely core gamers, like as was our philosophy from the start,

348
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:48,180
we figure we're going to design for gamers regardless of platform,

349
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,561
as opposed to designing for mobiles when it comes to session length.

350
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,902
And that's paid off pretty well for us in terms of the growth of the competitive scene.

351
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:55,863
It's probably also inhibited us from...

352
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:01,401
shooting to the top of the charts immediately also because it obviously has to some degree

353
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:06,486
constrained the people that we've been able to focus on inviting into the community.

354
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:10,851
But at the same time it's really helped us build a community that is incredibly passionate

355
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,434
about competitive gameplay in the game that we've looked to create.

356
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:17,638
Fourth in networking.

357
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:23,665
A game like Vainglory and any other MOBA for that matter really relies on fast networking

358
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:28,528
and high quality networking. Part of the challenge is that you're always going to be playing

359
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:33,851
on either Wi-Fi or LTE. Nobody plugs in their phone to like a fixed line network, which

360
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:37,133
means that if you think about competitive gaming, would you play a competitive PC game

361
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:43,257
over Wi-Fi? Probably not, right? Not normally. So you have to work really hard on networking,

362
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:46,639
on figuring out what sort of optimizations at the lowest level of networking you need

363
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:46,839
to do.

364
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,171
in order to create an experience that doesn't suffer from ping spikes and that creates as

365
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:58,235
kind of as steady if you like a latency experience as humanly possible. And that's something

366
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:02,977
where in particular compared to PC gaming we can grow everywhere because almost anyone

367
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:06,659
has a phone. So figuring out where to put your servers and figuring out how to create

368
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:11,402
high quality connections between the players and those servers is pretty important. And

369
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,463
then last year I sort of said this early on.

370
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,436
even as an intro to the talk.

371
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:18,996
But I feel super cheesy about saying, hey,

372
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:19,996
we're building an e-sport.

373
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,517
Fundamentally, the community decides if you're an e-sport.

374
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:24,897
We went out to create a competitive game.

375
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,698
It turned out that the community shouted back to us

376
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:29,218
super loudly, we want spectator mode,

377
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:32,379
we want you to help us organize ourselves

378
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:33,379
into tournaments and things.

379
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,119
And that's been the community deciding all of that.

380
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,100
We are wholeheartedly supporting it.

381
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,180
But I think, especially today when e-sports is such a hot

382
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,841
word, going out to say we're going to create an e-sport is

383
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:47,500
I think you sort of need to crawl before you walk, before you run, you know, make a great

384
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,441
game and make it great to be competitive.

385
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:53,702
And then after that, if the community rewards you with wanting to play competitively, then

386
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,943
support that activity and figure out how to organize it in a good way.

387
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,124
And we're still certainly very early in that journey.

388
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:57,444
But we are.

389
00:21:57,464 --> 00:21:57,664
We are.

390
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:57,864
We are.

391
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:58,044
We are.

392
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:58,224
We are.

393
00:21:58,244 --> 00:21:58,384
We are.

394
00:21:58,404 --> 00:21:58,544
We are.

395
00:21:58,564 --> 00:21:58,684
We are.

396
00:21:58,704 --> 00:21:58,844
We are.

397
00:21:58,864 --> 00:21:59,024
We are.

398
00:21:59,044 --> 00:21:59,344
We are.

399
00:21:59,384 --> 00:21:59,645
We are.

400
00:21:59,685 --> 00:21:59,925
We are.

401
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,491
a company that lives and dies by our community and we really pride ourselves in just how

402
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:10,512
much we interact, all of us, in the company, at all levels of the company with the community

403
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:13,493
in order to make sure that we continue to steer the ship in the right direction.

404
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:18,014
Which is a good segue to the second big area of learning for us, which is community.

405
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,735
In general, there's no other way to build a community than by being authentic.

406
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:24,875
Being, you know...

407
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:31,309
Delegating community somehow to somebody who creates a false persona is just a non-starter and all of you guys would probably agree with that.

408
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,573
But what's interesting about building a competitive game compared to say building casual or mid-core games,

409
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:39,835
so for companies that I've been I've been involved in or what from the outside is,

410
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:45,919
the engagement with that community has to be at a whole different level. When you build a mid-core game you can

411
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:50,483
or a casual game. To some degree, you can sort of rationalize in your mind that yes,

412
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:53,385
there will always be a vocal minority, but you know what? I'm just going to look at the

413
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:56,087
statistics and the numbers to see what's actually going on behind the scenes.

414
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:01,871
Not so much for a competitive game. Here, the vocal minority actually tends to be a vocal

415
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:07,374
majority and a set of folks who actually have a very deep vested interest in what you are doing.

416
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:13,183
So what we've tried to do is make sure that we engage with the broadest possible community

417
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:16,903
on every single community platform you can imagine, ranging from forums to Reddit to

418
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:20,644
Twitter to Facebook to any other channel in every other region.

419
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:26,766
Today, we have more than 18 local language community managers whose entire sole full-time

420
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:31,127
job is to sit there and make sure that we listen to our community and hear what they

421
00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:31,527
have to say.

422
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:36,788
And the engagement all the way from like that sort of broadest engagement all the way to

423
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:37,068
having a...

424
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:40,819
A private beta group that can help you figure out balancing of the game,

425
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,203
all the way to meeting up with team captains, to meeting up with team owners.

426
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:47,647
All of that stuff is very resource intensive, takes a lot of time,

427
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,470
but it helps us stay, have a true north.

428
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:55,035
It helps us as a company understand what it is that we are ultimately actually making and for whom.

429
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:59,394
In fact, one of the biggest surprises that came completely

430
00:23:59,434 --> 00:24:01,895
from the community is when we first launched the game, we

431
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:04,057
felt that the thing that was missing the most were social

432
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:04,417
features.

433
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:05,318
We didn't have any chat.

434
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:05,998
We didn't have teams.

435
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:06,599
We didn't have guilds.

436
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,360
We didn't have any of that sort of interaction where you

437
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,221
could find other people.

438
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,484
Actually, it turned out the community didn't want any of

439
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:13,664
that.

440
00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:14,785
What they wanted was expectation.

441
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:17,707
They wanted a way to watch other people play the game and

442
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,888
a way to stream the game and a way to share it with friends.

443
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:22,730
So this was actually the expectation client was

444
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,591
something that we created.

445
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:27,102
We actually, because of our engine, it's a multi-platform engine, we actually released

446
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:31,084
the Expectation Client on Macs, actually, because that enables us to output 4K resolution

447
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:34,245
shots from any angle and whatnot in the Halcyon Fold.

448
00:24:34,285 --> 00:24:38,326
So it lets people create very high-quality experiences and high-quality videos.

449
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:41,787
Well, the Expectation Client has been something that we've been working on together with our

450
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:43,108
community across the board.

451
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:46,069
They've asked for features, we add features, because at the end of the day, they are our

452
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:46,929
biggest content creators.

453
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,550
So that's been a collaborative effort.

454
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:53,052
And for all other kinds of content creation, it's...

455
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,664
Fundamentally, a game like Vainglory grows not through your TV ads or your Facebook ads

456
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:02,606
or your other forms of campaigns that you put together.

457
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,548
It grows by having a passionate community that wants to get their friends involved.

458
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:11,011
So facilitating that process, facilitating how to get your, how to enable your community

459
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,974
to create content and share that content is something that's turned out to be very important

460
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,975
for us and something that we try and support as much as we can.

461
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,337
And then finally, private beta.

462
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:25,269
So this is something where for us, there's just a combinatorial complexity of trying

463
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:29,771
to balance a game like Vainglory is too high for us to be able to do it internally.

464
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:36,094
And by having a fairly large group of private beta players who get the new patch a couple

465
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:40,056
of weeks before it's out, so we can try to figure out, find any problems with it, is

466
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:40,636
very useful.

467
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:45,018
But it's not just useful for that, it's actually a useful way of deepening our relationship

468
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,740
with the top players in the world in such a way that we begin to understand sort of

469
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:48,840
the...

470
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,932
thoughts and hopes and fears of some of these players and begin to understand like what

471
00:25:53,152 --> 00:26:00,696
it is ultimately about the balancing of the in-game systems that make them come back every

472
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:04,217
day and that make them feel very interested in helping push the competitive game moving

473
00:26:04,257 --> 00:26:04,497
forward.

474
00:26:05,518 --> 00:26:12,041
So, community has been, right from the start, something that's been incredibly deeply important

475
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:12,301
to us.

476
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:15,902
It's been something that we've really focused on from the start and something that we've

477
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:18,003
found to be incredibly important across the board.

478
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:23,520
However, marketing as a whole has been something that we've

479
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,702
been learning, perhaps, more about than anything else.

480
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:30,684
The first point here shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.

481
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,544
Players are pretty darn cynical out there.

482
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:36,006
And if this comes as a surprise, I'm glad you're at

483
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,567
GDC and you're learning about gaming.

484
00:26:37,587 --> 00:26:39,588
Because this thing has been true for a while.

485
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:42,790
But what's interesting about this is, in particular, like a

486
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,811
year ago when we came out and we said, hey, we're trying to

487
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:46,432
make a competitive game on touchscreens.

488
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:51,705
Like the vitriol that we would hear on places like Twitch and Reddit and other places where

489
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:56,106
you would get unfiltered feedback, if you like, was one of massive skepticism and cynicism.

490
00:26:56,846 --> 00:27:00,507
And frankly, in some ways, we deserved it because as an industry, mobile gaming, we've

491
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:02,207
been pretty bad at keeping our promises.

492
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:08,448
We put out massive, beautiful 3D rendered screenshots and then coupled that with a game

493
00:27:08,788 --> 00:27:12,849
session experience which is very janky and two minutes and wants your money on day two

494
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:14,349
and if you don't have any money, we don't care about you.

495
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:18,597
kind of mobile gaming has been pretty bad at sort of creating that expectation.

496
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,880
So when somebody stands up and says, hey, we want to make a PC style competitive

497
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,222
experience like the ones that we grew up with on touchscreens.

498
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:26,504
The first expectation is that, that we're lying.

499
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:30,528
And that's actually been really an interesting kind of journey for us.

500
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:34,051
Because all we've done is we've tried to combat that with

501
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:35,152
authenticity across the board.

502
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:38,394
And again, rather than trying to buy TV ads saying, hey, this is the thing you

503
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:40,336
should play because it's awesome, we've just worked through the community.

504
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:41,677
In fact, our best.

505
00:27:42,158 --> 00:27:44,418
community are best marketing assets across the board.

506
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:48,000
The things that are brought people into the game are all community created across the board.

507
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,761
And in fact, fundamentally when it comes to marketing a core game,

508
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:55,042
and I believe this is actually true for most core games even on PC today,

509
00:27:56,202 --> 00:28:00,023
that by far the strongest marketing channel and the strongest way to drive awareness

510
00:28:00,143 --> 00:28:02,124
of the game is the player community itself.

511
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:07,925
And in fact, our philosophy is very much one of we try to create awesome for our player base

512
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:09,906
and if we make awesome for them.

513
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:12,556
They hopefully will share it and if they do share it,

514
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:15,379
we help with the spotlight on the things that they share.

515
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:16,680
Because ultimately,

516
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,002
Vainglory is not, the Vainglory experience is much,

517
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:21,805
as much as we work on it every day and try to make it better,

518
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:24,748
ultimately it's the players that create the experience for each other.

519
00:28:25,489 --> 00:28:27,170
And helping highlight that has been a big deal for us.

520
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:29,172
So that's why all of these things

521
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:33,196
have been, has been far more important for us than any form of ad spend or marketing,

522
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,838
sort of internal marketing asset development.

523
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:40,707
One of the things that we still struggle with a lot is how to message core game on touch

524
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:44,888
because it's been messaged in so many ways and caused so much disappointment to date

525
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:49,289
that in some ways we've actually decided to let the community speak for us on this and

526
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:51,950
we simply amplify whatever it is that they feel is true about the product.

527
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,530
So that's some marketing learnings.

528
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,291
A couple of business learnings.

529
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:59,831
Free to play versus pay to win.

530
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:07,820
Right now, the touchscreen gaming, mobile gaming industry as business models are 95% plus pay to win.

531
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:10,521
In some way or form, you are actually short-cutting.

532
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:15,203
You become stronger than your neighbor, enemy, clanmate, whatever it might be by spending a bit of money.

533
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:18,483
For a competitive game, that cannot be the case, right?

534
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:23,345
We are always, have always been fundamentally focused on ensuring total fairness.

535
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:26,726
When you come into the game, you're exactly as powerful as somebody who's been in the game for 10,000 hours.

536
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:31,071
That creates a thing where you have to be much more careful

537
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:33,012
about how you think about business models and how you

538
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:35,493
think about what kind of in-game transactional models

539
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:38,595
you create to ensure that the business model is orthogonal

540
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,095
to your power in the game.

541
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:42,317
That is a promise to our players, and it's a promise

542
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:46,439
that we have kept and we aim to keep always moving forward.

543
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:49,100
So it just requires you to rethink the systems.

544
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,101
You can't simply just take systems from games that you've

545
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,362
seen in mobile previously.

546
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:54,683
And it's something, frankly, an area of

547
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:56,104
learning for us as well.

548
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,582
The other thing that should be obvious at this moment in time,

549
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:02,844
but e-sports shouldn't really be thought of as a profit center

550
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:03,644
at this moment in time.

551
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,326
Yes, you have sponsors that get involved.

552
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,827
Yes, tournament organizers get involved.

553
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:10,448
Loads of, you can get revenue through all sorts

554
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:11,169
of different sources.

555
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:13,751
But I wouldn't think of it as a profit center.

556
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:15,132
A lot of people say it's marketing,

557
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,933
but I actually don't think it's marketing either.

558
00:30:17,153 --> 00:30:19,414
Because if people don't care about playing your game,

559
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,456
they're not going to care about watching your game, typically.

560
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:24,177
There are some edge cases, like when TSM joined Vainglory,

561
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,179
a lot of TSM fans would check out, hey,

562
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:27,740
what's this new game that TSM is playing?

563
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,748
But the vast majority of cases, people watch the game

564
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,468
that they love playing.

565
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:35,130
So eSports, really, for us, is all about the product

566
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:35,611
experience.

567
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:38,532
It is fundamentally providing our players with the experience

568
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,414
of being able to play the game at any time, watch the game

569
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:44,155
being played at the highest level, learn from that

570
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:49,979
gameplay, and get into the usage or consumption pattern

571
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:52,620
that traditional sports has, where you play some, you watch

572
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,021
some, you play some, you watch some.

573
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:55,942
And that's simply what we want to provide through eSports.

574
00:30:58,512 --> 00:31:00,354
Finally, a couple of practical learnings before I wrap up.

575
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,036
And these are kind of ridiculous, but

576
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:05,218
it just has turned out to be things that we didn't expect.

577
00:31:06,258 --> 00:31:09,001
First thing, if you want to play in eSports one way or

578
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,102
the other, you have to learn TV production.

579
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:13,464
And that's like a brick and mortar business.

580
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:14,825
It's literally event organization,

581
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:19,009
thinking through everything from how do you run a live TV production that's

582
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:22,692
gonna work out, everything from how to plan a run of show to think about talent,

583
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:24,093
to training talent, to all of those things.

584
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:26,553
It's pretty time intensive.

585
00:31:26,713 --> 00:31:29,874
If you're going to get into it, you need to appreciate that there's a lot to learn there.

586
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:32,494
We've been doing this now for seven months and we're still learning tons.

587
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:36,316
In fact, this stuff is so much fun that we sometimes worry that we put too much time

588
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:38,916
into it because we ultimately need to build the game also.

589
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:40,677
The other thing is learning Wi-Fi.

590
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:46,319
It turns out Wi-Fi is actually black magic dark art in order to make Wi-Fi work really well,

591
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,419
especially in crowded environments like this.

592
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,781
It's something that, you know, when you have a tournament with an $80,000 prize pool,

593
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:56,754
outcome cannot be determined by a ping spike because of your lazy Wi-Fi setup.

594
00:31:57,174 --> 00:32:00,235
So learning and understanding high-performance Wi-Fi is something you need to make a core

595
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:01,036
competence to your company.

596
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:01,896
It's ridiculous.

597
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:03,776
I didn't expect to have to do it, but that is what it is.

598
00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:07,277
We originally dreamed that, hey, what if we just connect all the devices to, you know,

599
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:09,398
to a hardwired cable.

600
00:32:09,758 --> 00:32:13,119
It turns out players want to play on their own device always, and they want to sit in

601
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,280
all sorts of ridiculous positions while they're playing, and there's no way we can guarantee

602
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,621
that fixed-line Internet will work into that specific device.

603
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:20,902
So Wi-Fi is the way to go, and you need to learn about it.

604
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:25,108
tournament setups in general, separate tournament servers,

605
00:32:25,148 --> 00:32:27,230
figuring out, do you need a separate tournament client,

606
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,831
which I'm telling you already now,

607
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:30,312
you will need a separate tournament client.

608
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,194
Figuring out how you distribute those,

609
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:32,955
how do you provision those,

610
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:33,895
how do you make sure that everybody

611
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:34,956
has all their heroes unlocked

612
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:36,037
and all the other things

613
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:37,418
that those tournament accounts need to have.

614
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,000
How do you make sure that the integrity

615
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,501
of the tournament environment is correct?

616
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:43,023
All of that stuff is something that kind of,

617
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:46,366
we've just had to learn and develop the specs for ourselves.

618
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,108
But then finally, and perhaps more importantly,

619
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:50,109
ultimately,

620
00:32:50,832 --> 00:32:54,814
When you think about eSports, it is fundamentally about the athletes.

621
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,816
Just like the game is about the players in general,

622
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:02,038
the biggest production doesn't matter if the athletes don't get to tell their story,

623
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:03,439
don't get to have their moments of triumph.

624
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:07,341
And this has been something that we've ended up learning a ton about.

625
00:33:08,162 --> 00:33:11,563
And to explain the kind of stories that end up being told behind the scenes,

626
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:15,525
because at the end of the day, human stories is why players are interested in watching their game as an eSport.

627
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:19,708
It is, yes, it is about watching the great plays and learning from them and the item builds and whatnot.

628
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:23,749
But it really is about relating to that hero on screen.

629
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,431
And last weekend we had this, we had, you know,

630
00:33:27,491 --> 00:33:30,192
TSM were the favorites, but they were nearly knocked out

631
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:35,314
by a team with a 12-year-old ranged carry

632
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:36,775
who has incredible mechanics.

633
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:37,495
His name is D'Enzio.

634
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,823
And he's probably one of the most talented players right now in North America.

635
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:45,847
He's obviously still at school and he had his parents there, which is amazing.

636
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:50,513
But I just want to play a quick video where Dienzio tells his story and tells the story

637
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:55,459
of Halsey and Hammer's Velocity to give you a sense of just what kind of stories come

638
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:55,739
out of this.

639
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,153
I think my teammates are really, really good and passionate on how they play.

640
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:14,975
Like, they really do like playing their roles.

641
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:17,916
Like Aloha, he's really good at what he does.

642
00:34:17,996 --> 00:34:23,180
When he's playing a hero and he plays it good, he almost never messes up.

643
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,361
And Alvainz, he's just such a great support.

644
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:27,522
Like, if he's on Catherine, we would just win.

645
00:34:28,923 --> 00:34:30,705
DnZo has no limit.

646
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:34,288
I've seen him grow into a player that's tilted after one death.

647
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:38,371
Then we go in to play a top four team in Nemesis,

648
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:41,373
and he goes 1-5 in the first couple minutes,

649
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:43,075
then he goes and carries the rest of the game.

650
00:34:43,662 --> 00:34:47,484
In the first qualifier, we lost to Vega in the round of 16.

651
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:50,406
That was our first qualifier together.

652
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:55,349
And then we really wanted to go to the live championships.

653
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:59,552
And we knew we had to pull off a winning streak in the qualifier, and that's what we did.

654
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:01,653
In the second qualifier, we came...

655
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:14,557
We were very close to beating TSM, and this was huge for us mentally because we're showing ourselves, not only everybody else, that we can compete at this level.

656
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:21,212
When we tied the series with TSM, we kind of like didn't focus at that point.

657
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:22,133
We thought it was over.

658
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:23,734
There's no way we can mess up.

659
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:25,736
And then we choked and messed it up.

660
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,317
We had it.

661
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:28,318
We had the game.

662
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:29,258
It was ours.

663
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:32,140
And then when we lost, I was so disappointed.

664
00:35:32,621 --> 00:35:33,842
They didn't deserve that win.

665
00:35:34,562 --> 00:35:35,463
I want my revenge.

666
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:38,965
We're not going to make that mistake again and we're going to keep our minds focused

667
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:43,208
for our matches and make sure we take it home and then celebrate.

668
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:47,569
I'm going to say fear Dienzio.

669
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:50,769
If you ever see him out in solo queue, surrender.

670
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:53,170
There's not much you can do.

671
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,951
So these type of human stories is ultimately

672
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:58,231
what e-sports engenders.

673
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,392
And that is for us ultimately the fundamental emotional

674
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:03,812
resonance that we want to create when it comes to the game.

675
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:07,433
And that's the thing that we hope that we can help surface

676
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,613
across our community.

677
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,233
And that's the meaning of e-sports for us.

678
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:13,574
So before I leave you guys, just.

679
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:17,286
Just a final reminder why we are doing this.

680
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,547
We talk a lot about the meta of different games.

681
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:21,889
Well, we feel like the meta of the industry fundamentally

682
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,950
is that companies have built incredible businesses

683
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,152
off the back of a PC install base of about 700 to 800

684
00:36:28,232 --> 00:36:30,113
million gaming PCs out there.

685
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:33,774
Incredible happy communities of, well, sometimes salty,

686
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:36,856
but mostly happy communities of core players

687
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:40,518
off the back of fundamentally only less than a fifth

688
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:43,219
of the world's population having access to these devices.

689
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,001
And that base isn't really growing that much, that fast.

690
00:36:46,322 --> 00:36:48,123
By the end of this year, there will be over 3 billion

691
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:50,465
touchscreen devices that can play a game like Vainglory.

692
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:53,107
We're still very early in this cycle.

693
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:55,088
We believe over the next three to five to seven years,

694
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,310
somebody's going to go out there and build a company

695
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,672
that is three to five to seven times as large.

696
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:02,553
It's the largest PC gaming companies today.

697
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:05,936
That company is going to be built day by day, week by

698
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,438
week, month by month, by doing better and better and better

699
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:09,539
with our community.

700
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,261
Make our community happier every day, make the product a

701
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:12,801
little bit better.

702
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,459
every day. We're in no rush, but we're just incredibly excited to be part of that journey

703
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:21,301
and part of that evolution. I look forward to seeing where the industry is going to be

704
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:24,762
heading in the next three to five years. And with that, thank you very much. We have maybe

705
00:37:24,782 --> 00:37:25,583
time for one or two questions.

706
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:48,178
Can you talk maybe just a little bit to how you guys handled streaming?

707
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:50,861
Like it seems like it'd be a lot harder to stream from a mobile device.

708
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,743
So how do you build an audience for an eSport?

709
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:54,585
Yeah, it's a great question.

710
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,307
So if you didn't hear it, how do we handle streaming?

711
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,690
So frankly, we had to just learn it ourselves first.

712
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,815
It turns out the best way to stream from a mobile device, you can stream in many ways.

713
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:05,016
You can either use something like...

714
00:38:07,214 --> 00:38:09,276
just a sort of screen sharing, if you like, from the device.

715
00:38:09,296 --> 00:38:10,157
But that doesn't look too great.

716
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:12,078
Best way to do it is via Capture Box.

717
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:15,742
So if you have an HDMI out from the device, just capture it

718
00:38:16,402 --> 00:38:17,603
and then stream it via PC.

719
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:18,324
It's pretty clunky.

720
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:19,025
It's pretty difficult.

721
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:21,647
But it's something that core players out there will do.

722
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:23,589
And in fact, there's a lot of good Capture Boxes that are

723
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:24,089
pretty cheap.

724
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:26,832
And a good strategy could be just to share some of that

725
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:30,095
equipment and certainly have a pinned post on your forum

726
00:38:30,195 --> 00:38:32,277
saying, if you want to create content, this is how you do it.

727
00:38:32,337 --> 00:38:32,977
And keep linking to it.

728
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:36,641
Okay, apparently we have to cut it.

729
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:38,924
But I'll be at the area at the back.

730
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:40,226
Thanks again to all of you guys,

731
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:41,348
and huge thanks to our community

732
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:42,229
for helping us grow this far.

733
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:42,890
Thank you.
