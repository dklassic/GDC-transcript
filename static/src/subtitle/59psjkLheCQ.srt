1
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:06,283
So I'm Alan Fahldy.

2
00:00:06,603 --> 00:00:09,824
I'm a Vice President of Marketing at Wizards of the Coast.

3
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:12,925
And joining me here on stage is Michelle Sutterfield.

4
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:16,647
She leads all of our influencer relations types of efforts.

5
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:18,728
Between us, we have some pretty diverse,

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,328
a pretty diverse background in gaming.

7
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:23,650
Myself, I've worked on kind of different franchises,

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,530
different platforms.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,152
So I've worked at Activision, Blizzard, on Hearthstone

10
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:29,512
most recently, and then before that

11
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:30,733
on Destiny and Call of Duty.

12
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:33,074
Also worked in San Francisco here for a little while

13
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:34,574
at a company called Pocket Gems.

14
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:42,642
Michelle has a ton of experience in kind of working with influencers and helping them kind of build themselves up as businesses and brands.

15
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:47,186
And so yeah, so for the talk today, we're going to talk a little bit about Wizards history

16
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:52,351
and a little bit about the company and how that history has applied itself to what we're doing in digital today.

17
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:57,315
And the hardest thing about these talks is, you know, there's so many different people here and different companies.

18
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:01,996
We really spent time thinking about who do we think this talk is for and the lessons we're

19
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:06,057
kind of sharing with everybody. And there's really two audiences. I think one is small

20
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:11,098
and medium-sized game developers and publishers. You probably have a community, your influencer

21
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:15,699
program, and you're looking for new ideas or ways to be creative with it. So hopefully our talk

22
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:20,440
will help inspire you. And then the other one is you might be an influencer who's up and coming,

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,700
who's trying to figure out how to break out. I think Michelle will share some advice at the end

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,921
for people who kind of fit that profile.

25
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:34,249
And so I have this unduly task of boiling down 25 years of company history

26
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,673
into like a slide and a half to kind of help you understand what we're about.

27
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:42,139
And so when I was debating on how to explain this, I thought of baking cakes,

28
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,342
because I figured everybody likes cakes unless you're an evil person.

29
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:51,487
And so, personally I love tres leches, if there's any tres leches fans out there.

30
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:56,010
And so the cake you see up there is actually our 25th birthday cake from last summer.

31
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,833
I believe Cake Boss or someone associated with Cake Boss baked that for us.

32
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:03,495
So if you were baking a cake and that cake is Wizards of the Coast,

33
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:06,337
you know, what are the key ingredients that you would put in that cake?

34
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:09,820
So to put it simply, there's kind of three that I want to share today.

35
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,242
One is that from the beginning we've been about community and fellowship.

36
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:16,765
We've been all about bringing people together over a shared love of gaming.

37
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:19,767
Historically speaking, our most famous products

38
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:25,050
have quite physically brought people around tables to enjoy a game or play a game.

39
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:28,112
So that's been with us, that's been in our DNA since the very beginning.

40
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:31,355
Another piece is we are huge fans of fantasy.

41
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:35,678
So whether it's deep storytelling, world building, deep enriched characters,

42
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:39,060
We're huge fans of fantasy, and that's in our DNA.

43
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:41,322
And then the last piece is strategy.

44
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:44,345
I think everybody here, especially if you're a game dev,

45
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:46,507
you understand that the stickiest games

46
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:48,489
are the games that are pretty easy to pick up,

47
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:50,470
but are really difficult to master.

48
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:54,314
And so for us, we love these deep, deep experiences in games.

49
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:56,716
And if you've had a chance to play Magic the Gathering,

50
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:58,477
I think you'll understand what I mean.

51
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:01,841
And so how do I explain to people what we do when I go to a dinner party?

52
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:04,925
Well, we're the company that owns and publishes Dungeons & Dragons.

53
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,771
We're also the company that owns and publishes Magic the Gathering, the strategy CCG game.

54
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:13,435
And about a year ago, we did something that was very different for our company,

55
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:19,122
which is we in-house developed what we consider a very high-quality digital version of our

56
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,364
We called it Magic the Gathering Arena.

57
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:26,787
It's in open beta today and it's free to download if you want to check it out.

58
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,291
A lot of the things we're going to be discussing in this talk have to do with some of the innovations

59
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:36,333
we've been doing over the past year, kind of really fine-tuning our marketing for Magic

60
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:38,315
the Gathering Arena for reference.

61
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:41,737
So let's talk a little bit about Magic the Gathering's history.

62
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,938
This is a game that's been around 25 years,

63
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:47,678
so this is a very abridged version of our history,

64
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,059
just to help set up some context.

65
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,599
So where we started.

66
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,860
From the very beginning, local game shops

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,000
were incredibly important to us and our success.

68
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:58,281
So these shops are where people come together

69
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,641
to not just buy the product,

70
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:01,662
but they come together to actually experience it

71
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:03,282
and play and make new friends.

72
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:07,763
The other thing that's really interesting about our history is that from the very beginning

73
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:13,604
we had sort of a homebrew culture develop among our players. So people would take the game that

74
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:18,425
we created and then would go and create their own rules or variations. We often refer to that

75
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:22,286
as their own formats. So this homebrew, you know, homebrew has been around in the PC world for a

76
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:27,267
long time and even now, you know, there's modding cultures. And so we, with our physical card game,

77
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:28,628
saw that very early on.

78
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:30,177
So that was the beginning.

79
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:33,360
As the company continued to grow and it was more successful,

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,522
I think the company did something really, really smart,

81
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,264
which is it really listened to players and watched players

82
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:41,607
and tried to understand, hey, where can we invest as a company

83
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:44,449
and where can we insert ourselves to kind of make the play experience better?

84
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:48,773
And from that was born things like professional play and tournaments.

85
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:50,874
If you look back at the history of Magic,

86
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:53,557
our first Magic the Gathering World Championship

87
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:55,798
actually aired on ESPN in the 90s.

88
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,640
And so I know there's a lot of investment and things

89
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,981
happening with e-sports today.

90
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:02,523
So it's really neat to look back and see

91
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:05,004
our history in the 90s and what we were doing back then.

92
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:07,526
The other piece is that we ourselves

93
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,006
are players and gamers.

94
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:10,888
And so we invested in programs that I

95
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:13,709
think we just saw in the play patterns and behaviors.

96
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:17,532
And a very famous one is what we call Friday Night Magic, which

97
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:20,133
is this formal program where if you go to a local game

98
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,934
shop on a Friday night, you can go and either

99
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:24,536
learn how to play magic or play with others.

100
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:25,876
And then the last piece is that.

101
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:28,177
As the company continued to grow

102
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,698
and the success of the product grew,

103
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:31,898
anytime there was a new technology

104
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:33,499
or a new social media platform,

105
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,340
let's say Facebook or even before that, MySpace,

106
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,821
you would find Magic the Gathering communities

107
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:39,621
kind of blossom.

108
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,181
So that was a really interesting thing

109
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,542
for the company to kind of experience

110
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,983
and live through having been around for so many years.

111
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:46,964
So where are we going?

112
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:50,366
So having kind of a new digital game

113
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,808
that we're investing in and building,

114
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:54,369
it opens up new avenues.

115
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,630
And so one of those avenues is that we're able to work

116
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,992
with a much broader spectrum of influencers,

117
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:00,573
and we're gonna show a lot about that

118
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:01,594
later in this presentation.

119
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,494
The other piece is esports.

120
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:05,615
We recently made a pretty big announcement.

121
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:07,876
We have a $10 million prize pool

122
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:09,696
for competitive Magic the Gathering play,

123
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,177
which I believe now makes us one of the top esports

124
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,217
in the industry.

125
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:16,578
And then the last piece is we are also doing

126
00:06:16,618 --> 00:06:17,598
a lot of kind of interesting things

127
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:18,759
around community programming.

128
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,939
The screenshot is actually a calendar of just,

129
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,720
I think it was like two weeks, a few weeks ago.

130
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,321
And so we're doing a lot of interesting things

131
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:27,221
of how we program for that community.

132
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,382
But let's take a minute and let's talk about GameShops.

133
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:35,386
So I mentioned how from the very beginning and even through today,

134
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:38,846
game shops have been super, super important to our success.

135
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:43,928
So if you stop for a second and think about the local game shop from the lens of a marketing person,

136
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:48,529
such as myself, and start to kind of understand, okay, what do game shops bring to their local,

137
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,629
the local players? Let's just go down the list, right?

138
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,390
So my family in Houston, they, within a couple of miles of their house,

139
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:57,332
They have two different game shops.

140
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,136
One has, I think it's like 10 to 15 gameplay tables.

141
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,039
The other one's much tighter, much smaller,

142
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,500
has I think around two game tables.

143
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,563
So they come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.

144
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,925
The other thing that you'll understand about game shops

145
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:10,627
when you visit them is that they each have

146
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,049
their own kind of personality.

147
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:17,073
their own culture. It often comes from owners and the staff that work there.

148
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:24,358
They oftentimes serve as social hubs for a local community of gamers. So if you go to Friday Night

149
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:29,662
Magic or you go to D&D sessions at local game shops, if you're a regular kind of player there,

150
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:34,606
you'll start to see a lot of the same people and you'll likely end up making brand new friends,

151
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:36,207
which is kind of really, really neat.

152
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:40,671
The last piece is they offer a variety of programming for everybody.

153
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:44,916
If you've never played D&D, if you've never played Magic, you can find your spot at a

154
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,117
local game shop.

155
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:50,081
And then the last piece is that they're a great place to kind of check out new games.

156
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:53,064
So maybe there's a new board game or a new card game that's released.

157
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:55,447
Oftentimes that could be your first stop to kind of...

158
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:59,291
kind of understand from tastemakers, you know, what that game is like.

159
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:03,596
So if you take a step back and look at game shops from a marketing lens,

160
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:07,140
they should start to sound very familiar because they do to us, which is,

161
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,684
they start to sound a lot like a modern influencer, right? It's just

162
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:14,368
influencers oftentimes work on a much different scale and obviously a

163
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,169
different platform.

164
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:21,311
So I think it shouldn't be much of a stretch to understand that what we've experienced

165
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:25,792
in our history working with game shops and sort of the physical analog world, there's

166
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:28,813
a lot of things that kind of cross over into the digital world.

167
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:33,594
And I think amongst those things is that oftentimes the things that make game shops successful

168
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:37,155
also make modern day influencers very successful, right?

169
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:40,796
So having a variety of programming, having programming for all skill levels.

170
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:45,060
Even the way we treat our partners in game shops,

171
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,083
our partners that are influencers, I think is the same.

172
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:50,605
I mean, if an influencer succeeds streaming your game,

173
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:53,008
you succeed, and if a game shop succeeds,

174
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:54,910
our games succeed.

175
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,734
And then the last piece is this sense of homebrew culture.

176
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:00,936
I think that from the very beginning,

177
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:02,117
we've learned to kind of,

178
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:03,418
Learn from our players.

179
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:07,903
Homebrew I think is just an easy way to say, you know, players are creative.

180
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:12,648
And so I think we've also brought this homebrew culture with us into the digital world.

181
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:15,010
And we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a second.

182
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:18,073
So what happens when you listen to the community?

183
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,815
You put influencer relationships first.

184
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,496
Well, a lot of really fun ideas happen.

185
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:25,497
The screenshot that you're seeing up here,

186
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:27,098
and we'll go into more detail in just a second,

187
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:29,879
is an in-game event where we paired up Day9,

188
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,540
who is one of our most famous

189
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,881
Magic the Gathering influencers,

190
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,842
with Danny Trejo, who hopefully

191
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,183
some of you in this room recognize.

192
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,304
And they did what's called a Singleton Weekend

193
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:40,265
over Valentine's Day.

194
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:41,686
So hopefully, we thought we were being clever.

195
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:44,507
Hopefully you guys understood Singleton and Valentine's Day.

196
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:48,909
But let me show a quick trailer before Michelle comes up and goes way more into detail on our

197
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:53,531
influencer program. I think is the audio good? All right, let's show a quick trailer about it.

198
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:11,938
So this Magic the Gathering Arena Valentine's Day event, it's called Singleton because you

199
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,318
play single copies of cards.

200
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:16,249
Not because it's suggesting a date or anything.

201
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,830
Oh, would you look at all these soups.

202
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,810
Oh, minestrone.

203
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,450
Mmm.

204
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,051
Singleton?

205
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:27,111
We're having a four-day special Valentine's Day event

206
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:27,972
for Singleton?

207
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:30,812
We chose the alternate card art that people could win?

208
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:36,313
Do you want to share something?

209
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:39,914
That way we can order two entrees and both get some.

210
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,174
Heh heh heh.

211
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:42,834
Heh heh heh.

212
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:42,914
Ah.

213
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:44,115
Well.

214
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:48,790
Whether you're with your significant other, your friends,

215
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:51,992
or just with your fine self for this Valentine's Day,

216
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,493
come join us for Singleton all weekend long.

217
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,014
Yeah, unless you play a rat colony.

218
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:56,714
Wait, what?

219
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:57,975
Rigatoni.

220
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,876
I think I'll try the rigatoni.

221
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:06,679
Now, which is the one with the curly noodles?

222
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,742
It's nice to see you out of the bathroom, Danny.

223
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:13,723
This is my bathroom.

224
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,727
No, bread is for winners.

225
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,990
So the backstory behind that is we actually paired Danny and Day9 up for

226
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:33,272
We did a trailer when we announced our open beta for Magic Arena

227
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:39,014
And it just shows you having really you know what happens when you have great great relationships with with your creative community

228
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:45,237
In our brainstorming calls around what the premise of the video is I think it was Day9 himself that came up with the concept

229
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:50,820
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Danny Trejo and I were roommates because like nobody would ever expect that

230
00:11:51,260 --> 00:12:00,749
And so that created this whole cascading effect of creativity where we ask you to suspend your disbelief that Day9 and Danny Trejo are roommates.

231
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:01,630
So yes.

232
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,975
And so all of this, before I toss it to Michelle, is we don't do this in vain.

233
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,297
At the end of the day, we have a game that we want to be successful.

234
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:11,419
And I think everyone here that works on a game would agree.

235
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,140
That for us, you know, engagement and retention is the most important. If people aren't playing your

236
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,982
game, you have nothing. And so for us, we see great results when it comes to player engagement

237
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:26,243
with the influencer activities that we've done. And so we hope, you know, we hope you'll also

238
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:30,104
partake in having fun with your influencer community. So now let me welcome Michelle

239
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:37,566
up to the stage to kind of go more into detail on our program. Thanks, Alan. Hello, everyone.

240
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,707
You're a very lively crowd today.

241
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:46,936
Like Alan said, I'm the influencer manager for Magic the Gathering Arena, and what a

242
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:50,599
wild ride it's been in the past year already, and I'm so excited for what we have in the

243
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:50,999
future.

244
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,422
This is basically an overview of what I will be talking about today.

245
00:12:57,587 --> 00:13:03,474
How we want to work with our influencers is we want to make sure that our influencers are influencing our community.

246
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:09,541
Not just in the way that we want them to download and play our game, but actually how they interact with each other

247
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,605
in real life at events or even online.

248
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:18,380
So we want to make sure that we're choosing the right influencers to do that, and we are also building on those relationships.

249
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:22,023
We keep those relationships ongoing

250
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:28,589
through the special events and other features that we do for those streamers or other creators.

251
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,052
We invest in them. We hope that they invest in us back.

252
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:37,556
And that's why it's important to work further than the relationship itself and work on those offerings.

253
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:44,187
And then progression from that, you saw we had a streamer event, the Day 9 and Danny Trejo.

254
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:47,170
We do that with other streamers as well.

255
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,616
We work closely with them and our developers and create a basically homebrew

256
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:59,143
format inside of MTG Arena centered around that streamer. It's a really great opportunity for

257
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:05,067
for ourselves and the streamer because it allows them to get amazing reach.

258
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:08,730
I mean, that's Kripp's face inside of our game. That's pretty amazing.

259
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,073
But it also gives us some really great original content,

260
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,934
not only for the streamer to play,

261
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:19,057
but for the viewers to watch and also for the players inside the game.

262
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:21,398
This is something new that they get to experience.

263
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:28,179
So what sort of influencers do I reach out to?

264
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,601
And why do I reach out to them?

265
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:33,645
We have a lot of amazing values as Wizards of the Coast.

266
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,707
You can Google them right now.

267
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,849
Some of those values include inclusivity,

268
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,332
stewardship, empowerment.

269
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:44,129
And we want to reflect that in our community.

270
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,470
So when we look for influencers,

271
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,370
we don't just look for the people

272
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,011
that are bringing in the most views on Twitch,

273
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:54,032
the people that are going to, you know,

274
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:56,453
have thousands of downloads of a game.

275
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,213
Although those things are great, and we still look for them,

276
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,334
that's not our deciding factor.

277
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:04,995
Our deciding factor is which influencers

278
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,056
can we work with that will...

279
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:16,968
influence our community to be a better place and to be more involved. We look for passionate players

280
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:21,915
and not just passionate in the gameplay itself but passionate with the brand and IP.

281
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:28,050
We also use a mix of our top tier creators, going back to numbers,

282
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,972
and our micro and mid-tier influencers.

283
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:35,976
And we found that when using a big bulk of these micro influencers,

284
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:39,700
it brings so much more to our events and our numbers on Twitch

285
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,461
than just using top tier alone.

286
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:46,225
We also get more sincere creations from them,

287
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:51,109
and just great community involvement overall with the micro influencers.

288
00:15:55,112 --> 00:16:00,895
So we've seen a lot of success with this new way of thinking for Wizards of the Coast.

289
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:06,638
We've really only been overhauling influencer work for about a year since the drop of the

290
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:09,300
NDA for MTG Arena.

291
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,043
And with that drop, we actually saw, you can see there, that number, our unique streamers

292
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:17,404
grew year over year, 477%.

293
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,101
through the relationships and the offerings

294
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,241
that we have given these streamers

295
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,222
and having them all work together.

296
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:30,983
So going back to the streamer events that we do in game,

297
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:32,303
here's two examples for you.

298
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:34,224
We have Amy Zonian on top.

299
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,784
She's probably one of our micro influencers

300
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,585
reaching into mid-tier right now.

301
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:41,105
And then we have Gabby Spartz, who was mid-tier,

302
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:42,946
now reaching into top-tier influencer.

303
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:48,649
Gabby Spartz, when she did her event, it was all about big monsters and getting them on

304
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:49,210
the field.

305
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,110
It was greedy.

306
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,573
It was just a greedy, greedy draft, and we loved it so much.

307
00:16:53,774 --> 00:17:01,040
She actually doubled her average viewers because of that event alone, and not only did they

308
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:04,904
come in for that event to watch her, they stayed.

309
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:12,631
And she has actually told me in emails that that event alone has brought her to the next level

310
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:18,857
for her streaming ability and being able to just have her own business as a streamer,

311
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:23,041
which is really great for us to hear because that's what we want to make sure is happening,

312
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:25,804
right? We want to make sure that the offerings that we are giving streamers

313
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:29,188
is an investment not only to us, but it's an investment to them.

314
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,474
Then we see Amy Zonian.

315
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:33,395
Amy Zonian is awesome.

316
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:37,378
If you don't know her, she's a mechanical engineer.

317
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,899
She actually used to work for Amazon,

318
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,821
building robots, of all things.

319
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:44,284
And she loves Magic the Gathering so much,

320
00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:47,446
she quit her job as a mechanical engineer at Amazon,

321
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,088
and now full-time streams MTG Arena.

322
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,912
So she created this amazing, amazing draft,

323
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:58,454
and it ended up being the top special event draft

324
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:00,556
we've ever run inside the game.

325
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:03,477
It was so successful that we ran it twice

326
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:06,879
with her permission, and she was very excited

327
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,220
when we did that, and of course,

328
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,941
great for us, great for them.

329
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,663
Now, working with all of these streamers,

330
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:15,904
we said earlier, I work with like thousands of streamers.

331
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:25,237
And building those relationships is very important because we can get so much more out of just,

332
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:31,860
you know, a sponsorship, pay here, do this here. We have our early access events, and if you watched

333
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,383
the last one, Ravnica Allegiance, we had over 400 streamers be part of that event, and not a single

334
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:43,726
one of them were paid. And they all wanted to do it because they love the game, they love the

335
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:46,267
exclusivity, and they love the community.

336
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:48,997
It's a huge event that they all get together.

337
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,218
I make a Discord for them,

338
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:52,200
and they just love talking with each other.

339
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,063
It's just a fun time for them, right?

340
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,165
And therefore, they will invest their time,

341
00:18:57,746 --> 00:18:59,047
even if it's a non-paid event.

342
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,902
You know, hearing all this philosophy of, you know,

343
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,944
oh, the philosophy of if you help the streamers

344
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:10,246
and they grow and it's really rewarding,

345
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,968
it is really rewarding.

346
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:13,870
Not only do we see, you know, Alias V,

347
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,891
she came over from Gwent,

348
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:18,054
she is now a full-time streamer for MTG Arena,

349
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:21,016
but we see this type of conversation.

350
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,979
I get it in emails, DMs, and just out on Twitter.

351
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,441
All of the time.

352
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:29,965
This is not just a, oh, I scavengered through and found this from like a year ago.

353
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:36,072
No, this is a very, very regular conversation that is in our community.

354
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:40,536
And it's wonderful to see that because, you know, we talked about our community having

355
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:44,180
25 years and about the cake and, you know, all of these different ingredients.

356
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,563
When we dropped the NDA and we started focusing on influencer work.

357
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,285
Not only are we growing the community at large,

358
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,866
but we now created a new subset community,

359
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:54,967
and that's our streaming and creator community.

360
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:56,767
And I'm only one person.

361
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,368
I work with a lot of streamers.

362
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,589
And so when we build these relationships with them,

363
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,510
they are now not only advocates for the brand,

364
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,470
but they help me.

365
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:08,531
I've had so many new streamers come to me

366
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:10,412
because of referrals.

367
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:11,975
from other streamers.

368
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:14,097
We're top-tier influencers.

369
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,599
Referrals because of the way that we treat them.

370
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,562
I've been in many conversations in the past.

371
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:26,085
Sorry, most recently, Tice, who's one of our competitors

372
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:28,706
for the Mythic Invitational, if you know him,

373
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,187
he's a pretty big deal on Twitch.

374
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:31,889
I had a conversation with him...

375
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:39,331
The other week on the phone and he mentioned to me that what we do at Wizards of the Coast for

376
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:46,853
influencers is nothing like he's ever experienced before in other companies. And this is a top tier

377
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:50,494
creator so you know he's been working he's had lots of sponsorships with other companies.

378
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:54,278
And I asked him, oh, that's interesting, you know, tell me more about that.

379
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:58,223
Because what I think I'm doing, you know, building the relationship, putting values

380
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,145
first is not new.

381
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,828
It's just correct, right?

382
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,972
And so when I asked him about that, he said, yeah, most people don't care.

383
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:12,499
And they just pay you or they offer you something and then they move on.

384
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:19,678
You know, you're putting the effort into building a relationship and making me feel comfortable in a new community.

385
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:26,664
You're also offering me opportunities far beyond just monetary value.

386
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:33,471
And that's something that is very original. It's refreshing. It's new. And I appreciate that.

387
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:38,904
Again, not the only streamer, especially top-tier creators, that has told me that.

388
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:43,945
And if you're going to take away anything from this talk, it's that you need to care

389
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,585
more about your streamers.

390
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:52,187
When you have happy streamers, you have those happy relationships, you will get so much

391
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,968
more than you could ever imagine.

392
00:21:58,077 --> 00:22:00,158
So let's talk more about the advice.

393
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,261
I have some advice for developers and for influencers.

394
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:06,544
And a lot of this advice can actually go hand in hand

395
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:09,466
because developers, they work for a company.

396
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:13,530
Streamers, you should think of yourself as a company.

397
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,771
You are your own personal brand

398
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:18,654
and you should be acting as if you were a business.

399
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:25,078
So the first thing that you need to do for either developer or influencer side is recognize

400
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:26,679
what are your company values?

401
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,582
What is the values of your brand?

402
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:32,465
What are the goals that you're trying to reach, right?

403
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,247
As an influencer, think about what's your brand?

404
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,169
What are the values that you hold?

405
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,491
What are the goals that you're trying to reach?

406
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,273
And hopefully...

407
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,122
Those two values, the values and the goals of both parties

408
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:48,263
will align, and when those align,

409
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,265
you will get the best product possible for both sides.

410
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:57,069
Developers, again, don't just go in there and say,

411
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,530
I want the top tiers, right?

412
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,273
Invest, invest, invest, invest in your micro-influencers

413
00:23:03,313 --> 00:23:05,674
and mid-tiers, because they will grow with you.

414
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:07,836
And not only will they grow with you,

415
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,317
they will stay with you when they grow.

416
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,730
And that's where you're going to want to be.

417
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:17,752
You don't want to lose someone because you didn't invest in that relationship when they break through.

418
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:22,153
It has happened. It will happen. So invest in people.

419
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:27,135
Micro-influencers will benefit the most from your support, that is true.

420
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:33,256
But the top tier creators, when you start putting them together with micro-influencers,

421
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:35,417
can also reap the benefits of that.

422
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:40,368
So really encourage that community building,

423
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:41,909
not only for the streamers themselves,

424
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:43,350
because they'll start taking care of each other.

425
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,311
They will.

426
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,632
They'll start supporting each other.

427
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,894
Far, far beyond what we can offer.

428
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:53,057
We can only do so much with featuring streamers daily

429
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,518
or the special events.

430
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:56,299
There's a lot of things that happen in between

431
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,422
that we can't always just be throwing out sponsorships

432
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:02,144
and featuring them.

433
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:05,265
But what's happening in between to help build that community?

434
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:07,885
It's the streamers and the influencers themselves.

435
00:24:08,265 --> 00:24:10,906
When they start supporting each other with raids and hosts,

436
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,986
and you're really fostering that community

437
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:16,667
to make it a very supportive, the stewardship value, right,

438
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:20,227
environment, everyone starts growing together.

439
00:24:20,828 --> 00:24:22,968
And it's a really not only just beautiful thing,

440
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:24,828
but the data shows it works.

441
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:29,449
I mean, we grew over 400% in one year of unique streamers.

442
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:31,970
And it's really because of the community itself.

443
00:24:33,842 --> 00:24:40,206
So, yeah, for streamers, if you don't get an opportunity that you, you know, were really

444
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,747
hoping for, I'd say this, though.

445
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:43,188
Don't get discouraged.

446
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:46,170
Not every opportunity is for you, and that's okay.

447
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:52,393
We only have certain spots for certain opportunities, or sometimes we have over 400 for a special

448
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:53,014
event, right?

449
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:55,654
I've gotten emails before of people saying,

450
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,575
oh, you didn't use me for this event.

451
00:24:58,115 --> 00:24:59,235
Did I do something wrong?

452
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:01,495
And it's, oh, no, on the contrary, we love you.

453
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:03,256
We want to invest in you.

454
00:25:03,716 --> 00:25:05,856
This opportunity just wasn't for you, right?

455
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:08,257
So you can't take things personally.

456
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:11,137
You have to just keep going,

457
00:25:11,197 --> 00:25:13,898
keep doing what you are supposed to be doing

458
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:16,958
and build that relationship of positivity

459
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:18,278
and the community around you.

460
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:22,119
And you'll grow regardless as a streamer.

461
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:25,984
So what's next for us?

462
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,247
We are investing in esports, as Alan has said,

463
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:35,451
and we have our Magic Pro League in play right now.

464
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:37,393
And you can actually see our Magic Pro League

465
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:40,375
with some of our fan favorites, influencers,

466
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,437
and eight players who qualified through the game.

467
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:45,919
This next week in Boston, Massachusetts,

468
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:47,240
we will have our Mythic Invitational.

469
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,442
And it's gonna be super exciting.

470
00:25:49,902 --> 00:25:52,964
I suggest you all tune in to twitch.tv slash magic.

471
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:56,666
There's going to be a $1 million prize pool on the line,

472
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:00,027
and it's just going to be an amazing opportunity

473
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:04,708
to see what we have in store for Magic Esports moving forward,

474
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:07,949
and not only competitively, but also showcasing

475
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:10,990
our amazing community of influencers

476
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,571
who do reflect the community as a whole.

477
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:18,117
And also, I think I should plug in that we're hiring.

478
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:22,301
So please check out our job board online.

479
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,204
We would love to get some resumes in

480
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:27,766
and join our amazing team.

481
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:27,826
So.

482
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:30,509
We'll see everybody in the Alcove.

483
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:31,270
Sorry?

484
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,070
We'll see everybody in the Alcove.

485
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:32,791
Yeah, we will.

486
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:34,112
Yeah, Alcove.

487
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:36,775
So if you have any, well, do we have any more time

488
00:26:36,815 --> 00:26:37,976
for questions here or should we?

489
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,655
We have two minutes if anyone has a question now.

490
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:44,058
If not, we can end and we'll just go over to the alcove

491
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,021
and have a casual talk over there.

492
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:47,383
But if you do have a question,

493
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:48,744
there's a microphone right there in the middle.
