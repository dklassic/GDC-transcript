00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:08,650
We are here today to talk about Always Be Composing,

2
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:12,092
the flexible music system of Plants vs. Zombies Heroes.

3
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:17,134
I am Becky Allen, audio director and composer

4
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:21,596
at PopCap Games, and I worked on Plants vs. Zombies Heroes

5
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:22,776
for the last two years.

6
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:26,158
You may say, what is Plants vs. Zombies Heroes?

7
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:30,019
A collectible card game, that's right.

8
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:32,280
Who here has heard of it, played it?

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,441
Yay, all right, thanks.

10
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:41,364
So, this is an interesting project, so I'm here to talk about the music design, the music

11
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:46,826
systems and the composition, and all of the different phases of iteration throughout the

12
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:47,346
process.

13
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:50,727
We'll start at the beginning.

14
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:58,628
At the very beginning, I decided on a guiding principle, support gameplay and the player's

15
00:00:58,728 --> 00:00:59,309
experience.

16
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:04,150
I met with the game designer, Devon Lowe, and talked about...

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,620
the music for the game.

18
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:09,162
We'd already made a prototype of the game in Unity

19
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,263
and with Wwise and put in some initial hooks,

20
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:15,804
lots of hooks actually, utilizing old PVZ sounds.

21
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,246
But we knew that this was going to be a new game

22
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:22,467
in a new genre with CCG,

23
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:26,429
but still in the PVZ franchise, PVZ universe.

24
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:30,631
Also at that time, Hearthstone was very popular

25
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:33,472
and still is very popular, awesome game.

26
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:35,528
and awesome sounding game.

27
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:39,712
So we were looking at that and seeing how that sounded

28
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:41,814
and music and sound design and that,

29
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:45,757
and also looking back to other PVZ games,

30
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,279
and I was thinking, hmm,

31
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,421
how can I stretch out a little more here?

32
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:52,083
I wanna support the gameplay and the player's experience

33
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:55,266
maybe even more with more interactivity,

34
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:56,787
a little more responsiveness,

35
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,971
move that needle a little further for this project.

36
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:06,191
And meeting with the game designer, we talked initially about what was he

37
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,292
envisioning for the music.

38
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:11,816
And he said, well, I'd like there to be a progression, like a beginning,

39
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:15,980
a middle, and yeah, some kind of development there, so

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,621
that you feel the progression of the game.

41
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:22,866
And also there would be heroes in this game, so whatever that would mean.

42
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:33,041
So this is the early phase and thinking about different music styles and influences,

43
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:37,863
there was a lot of pressure early on from the team to make this sound very

44
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:46,425
PVZ1-ish, and even a little PVZ2, because they wanted the players to come over

45
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:48,526
from other PVZ games into PVZ.

46
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:54,648
So I did listen to a lot of PVZ themes,

47
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,069
especially PVZ1 themes by Laura Shigehara.

48
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,853
Of course, the wonderful PVZ2 themes of Peter McConnell are fantastic as well.

49
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:06,997
But I did sit down with Laura's music and analyze that.

50
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:12,181
And so I sat in my studio and just kind of analyzed that in a traditional, analytical way.

51
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,424
And I was like, okay, mostly minor, lots of bass lines.

52
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:19,290
incredible melodies, strong melodies.

53
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,612
So I sat in my studio and I started writing

54
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:24,053
and trying to write in that style

55
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:26,835
and finding what are the edges of that style.

56
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:29,477
Oh, if I do this too much, it doesn't feel PVC.

57
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:33,119
If I go over there too much, it doesn't feel too PVC

58
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,802
and finding where those edges are and still feeling PVC.

59
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:38,803
So I was doing that for a little while.

60
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:42,425
Meanwhile, during this sort of explorational style phase,

61
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:45,908
I was doing a lot of yoga in the morning at home.

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,643
And my daughter was watching Power Puffs in the background,

63
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:51,786
and I would hear the music of the Power Puffs,

64
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,168
and I'd hear these little fragments,

65
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,351
these little personal stingers and small phrases

66
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:59,654
that were kind of in and out and really fast,

67
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:02,336
but very identifiable, and I really liked that.

68
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:04,979
And I thought, hmm, maybe that also

69
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,481
could influence PVC Heroes.

70
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:18,022
So we had a gameplay prototype and in order to really flesh out some of these ideas,

71
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:22,264
I took a linear capture of that gameplay prototype and brought it into my DAW

72
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:29,128
and started exploring with some themes and thinking about what the role of the music would be.

73
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:34,431
I talked to Devin Lowe again, our creative director, and asked him,

74
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,473
What are the average number of hands, do you think, in this game?

75
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:41,444
Well, I think probably about eight hands would do.

76
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,606
And how long do you think an average session length would be?

77
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,106
He said about five minutes.

78
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:48,307
Okay.

79
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,848
And then he said, there's also going to be these sections

80
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:54,169
in the game where you play actively,

81
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:56,250
and then a fight combat section

82
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,931
where the game sort of plays for you

83
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,132
and the cards are battling against each other.

84
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:01,292
I'm like, okay.

85
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:02,853
Getting the ideas here.

86
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,274
And he also said there will be 20 heroes.

87
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:09,529
10 plant heroes and 10 zombie heroes.

88
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:18,473
So I started to explore and this is an early prototype of the music where I'm exploring

89
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:25,635
the hero themes. So this guy down here, Super Brains on the bottom, he's our zombie hero,

90
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:30,938
and up at the top is Green Shadow, our plant hero. And you'll hear three different things in here.

91
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:36,160
The zombie theme for Super Brains and then the plant theme.

92
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:41,374
for Green Shadow and the combat fight section, so three different things playing.

93
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:12,372
Back to super brains. ♪

94
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:15,094
Bright shadows coming in. ♪

95
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:42,051
So during this proof of concept phase, I was trying to explore going back and forth between

96
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:48,757
the heroes and also that combat music because really at that stage they didn't think that

97
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:50,939
the combat or fight music needed to be different.

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,141
And I thought we could do something.

99
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:54,042
It could be fun.

100
00:06:55,701 --> 00:07:02,708
So along came a feature in the game called the phase indicator and it was in the right hand side of the screen and

101
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:10,077
it told the player what was happening and it was first it would say zombie turn then plant turn

102
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:11,518
zombie tricks

103
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,435
combat phase, post-game, and then back to the next hand.

104
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:18,438
So this was awesome, it communicated to the player

105
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:20,620
what was happening, and also it gave us hooks

106
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,383
for the music to hang our switches,

107
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:26,526
basically switching from one kind of music to the next.

108
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,509
And we decided to use that as the music structural driver

109
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,191
for the game.

110
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:32,371
So.

111
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:42,016
With that, what are some music considerations when you have some kind of structural driver

112
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:43,457
in the game like that?

113
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:49,162
Well, first of all, the melodies per hero are indeterminate lengths, can be interrupted

114
00:07:49,222 --> 00:07:51,104
at any time based on the different gameplay.

115
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:52,665
So that's going to be tricky.

116
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:58,130
And I knew at that point that transitions would really, really be coming into play.

117
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,353
And I didn't know what to do with them or how they would work or anything, but I knew

118
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,013
that was going to be hard.

119
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:07,852
And then I thought about, well, if we're going to go from one hero to another hero in a hand,

120
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:11,695
what could make that hold together?

121
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:15,078
And I thought, well, let's have common key centers per hand.

122
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,862
So say you're in hand one, whether you're a plant or a zombie, you're in the key of

123
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:21,343
G minor.

124
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:27,588
Jump to hand four, both of them are in the hand of C minor, so common key centers per

125
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:27,728
hand.

126
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:34,116
Also, I decided at that time that I would set a common tempo of 125 BPM for the whole game.

127
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:39,578
And I just set it and kept it there, and it kept everything tight and feeling together,

128
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:41,439
and I'm glad I did that.

129
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:48,842
So, these are choices and things that I was thinking about what to change, what not to change.

130
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:53,004
Also in the hands, I thought about the drums and the progression of the drums.

131
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:57,326
So in the early hands, you have light hand percussion, kind of mysterious hands,

132
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:58,346
and then as you go...

133
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,527
to the later hands you get the drum kit.

134
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,228
So whether you're plant or zombie,

135
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:04,509
you have the same kind of percussion.

136
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,770
So that carries the glue between them as well.

137
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,131
Of course there needs to be differentiators

138
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:13,993
and I will talk about those.

139
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:14,213
So.

140
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:19,332
There's the plant faction and the zombie faction,

141
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:21,473
and they're much like teams, right?

142
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:24,135
So I'm on the plant team or I'm on the zombie team.

143
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:25,996
How should that sound?

144
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:29,599
And we're dealing with instrument sets

145
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,180
in terms of how should they sound,

146
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,262
not colors of uniforms, but instruments.

147
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:40,211
I decided that there would be a common set of instruments between the plants and the

148
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,133
zombies and that was mallets.

149
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,634
Mallets are used all over the place.

150
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:48,759
The walking baseline, pits, of course, is used all over the place as well throughout

151
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,321
all heroes.

152
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,985
There are a couple strings that are used also and a couple of other instruments that are

153
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,206
the shared common set.

154
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,089
But then you go into the perfection set.

155
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,333
And for the plants, I decided they should be woodwinds.

156
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,956
So woodwinds are the identifier for the plant faction.

157
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:10,799
And within that, let's say you are a hero

158
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,000
and you've selected your hero.

159
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:16,024
There also will be one or two unique instruments

160
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:17,385
per that hero.

161
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:20,648
So every time you hear that hero, you go, ah, that's my guy

162
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:21,228
or that's my gal.

163
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,650
Like Spadau, for example.

164
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,533
He's a funny, weird hero.

165
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:28,134
And he has bassoon.

166
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:31,085
And so that, of course, reflects his personalities.

167
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:35,307
I should say that those choices of instruments

168
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:39,049
came along as the personalities of the heroes

169
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:39,689
came into being.

170
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,150
So, you know, Spadaw being really weird,

171
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,311
Bassoon seemed unnatural.

172
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:46,252
So as the art came into place,

173
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,654
I would choose different instruments per hero.

174
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:55,297
So zombies, how should they sound?

175
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:58,105
We had the common instrument set, as I mentioned,

176
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:00,526
and then we had the per-faction instrument set.

177
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:04,266
And so for zombies, I chose trombones and lower brass,

178
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:05,267
because they're a little heavier,

179
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:07,587
and that seemed to fit very well

180
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:08,867
with their art and their style.

181
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,408
And then, of course, there's the unique

182
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:12,668
instrument set per hero.

183
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:16,029
So as those heroes came into play,

184
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,689
for example, like Rustbolt, who is really angular and weird,

185
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,010
he got the eight-bit keys,

186
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,990
and Gargantuar, who's,

187
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:29,633
but he has a little guy up there, he's got the tuba and the Harmon muted trumpets.

188
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:33,555
So these kinds of instrument choices reflect their own quirk.

189
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:42,438
So, you know, I'm going along and playing with these different instruments and

190
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:47,240
exploring, and along comes a marketing trailer. And most of the time,

191
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,501
marketing is over here, right, and development's over here, and they're

192
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:52,161
quite disparate.

193
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,153
And we're all kind of used to that.

194
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:58,675
And that was still the case right at this moment,

195
00:11:58,815 --> 00:11:59,195
I should say.

196
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,656
The creative franchise director and head of marketing

197
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:05,958
came and said, hey, we've got this great marketing trailer

198
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:09,800
to announce the game.

199
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,441
And the franchise director's like,

200
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,641
hey, can you make it like The Incredibles?

201
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,342
I'm like, sure I can.

202
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:14,942
Okay.

203
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,301
So I go out and I buy the Incredibles

204
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,062
and I go out and buy the Incredibles soundtracks

205
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,803
and I think any composer in the room,

206
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,805
if somebody says, hey, can you do it like this?

207
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:24,086
You go out and you get that music

208
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,087
and you study it and you breathe it and you live it.

209
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:29,389
You try to become it so you can kind of understand the style

210
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,431
and I did that and then spent a couple of weeks

211
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,893
working with the franchise creative director

212
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:38,355
on the trailer and we came to a really nice piece,

213
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:41,177
a two and a half minute trailer with that style

214
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:45,020
and we were going to do a live recording, which is awesome.

215
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:53,059
So it's Monday and I had told Panther Modern that I would be handing him the music or the

216
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:56,641
sessions the next day to prepare for our session at Bustier on Friday.

217
00:12:57,462 --> 00:13:02,506
But that Monday night, our head of marketing and franchise director played it for EA's

218
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:03,667
VP of marketing.

219
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:06,168
And he's like, oh, okay.

220
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,061
That's great, but what if it's a little more Batman-y?

221
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:13,824
You know, like 1960s, but kind of the 1980s remake.

222
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,466
So they brought me in on Monday around 7 o'clock,

223
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,088
and they said, well, what do you think of this?

224
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,251
And I listened to it, and man, I had to agree.

225
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:25,612
It was really awesome.

226
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:26,793
It was so good.

227
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:34,019
You know, I had to quickly let go of the two weeks of work that I had done and the idea

228
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,360
of how it was going to go.

229
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:39,462
And our head of marketing said, so what do you think?

230
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,024
Hmm, yes, good.

231
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:46,186
Can I have till tomorrow morning and I'll try to do that?

232
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:47,606
And he said, oh, sure.

233
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:51,622
And meanwhile, I'm like, oh my god, I've got Stan lined up.

234
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:53,183
We're going to record on Friday.

235
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:57,725
But I just worked that night and tried to write in that style

236
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,406
and came up with something pretty good

237
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:01,287
by the next morning.

238
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:04,068
And they came in and like, oh yeah, that's great.

239
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,069
So I wrote it all out.

240
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,450
We still recorded on Friday.

241
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,971
And then we brought in a drum kit and bass

242
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,292
and made this kind of 60s spy genre type thing.

243
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,233
It worked out really well, and I'm really grateful for this marketing trailer

244
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:25,137
because it was this watershed moment for part of the style of the music of the game.

245
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:28,420
And also a big trust was established with the team.

246
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:32,645
And from that point forward, I feel like smooth sailing for me.

247
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:34,046
So I was really grateful.

248
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,930
And another thing that I want to mention here is,

249
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,011
as I said, normally marketing's over here

250
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:41,291
and development's over here,

251
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:44,652
but the marketing trailer actually really impacted

252
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:45,472
the sound of the game,

253
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,532
and I took that style of the trailer

254
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:49,453
and put it into the combat fight sections.

255
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,013
So, I'll play that for you.

256
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:57,414
Oh, sorry.

257
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,002
And a PowerPoint problem.

258
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:06,003
Sorry.

259
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,110
I want to play it for you.

260
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,100
Uh, whoo! Thanks!

261
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:47,421
Damien's here, yeah!

262
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,382
Uh, haha,

263
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,603
anyway, I still enjoy this trailer,

264
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:53,583
I listen to it, it makes me happy.

265
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:54,984
Um, but yes,

266
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:57,284
I took part of that trailer and put it into the combat

267
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:59,225
fight sections, uh, right after this

268
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:01,226
trailer happened, and we lived with that in that

269
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:03,327
section of the game, internally

270
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,107
for quite some time.

271
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:07,088
So,

272
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,069
we go into what I call the

273
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,529
content phase of the game.

274
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,356
where both Luca Fusi, lead sound designer,

275
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,140
you're there, there you are.

276
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,244
Yay.

277
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,649
He and I were working pretty much in tandem at this point.

278
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,413
We'd have like a hero.

279
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:25,358
on the board and we'd both be working alongside each other

280
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:29,039
and kind of laughing about the weirdness of the characters

281
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,279
and he'd be making the weird voices

282
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,919
and it all just came together really

283
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
in a very fun and playful way.

284
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,601
Like I said, Spadao and his bassoon and his weird voice

285
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,881
and then Rustbolt and his 8-bit keyboards.

286
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,322
Yeah, it was just a great and happy content phase,

287
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:46,862
I should say.

288
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,083
So it took me about one week to compose

289
00:16:52,622 --> 00:17:00,750
for these heroes and it was eight hands and I would write the set for that hero and then

290
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,752
I would bring it into Wwise to integrate.

291
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:06,539
Also during this time, I should say, calculating it out,

292
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,942
I realized that 20 sets would be two hours of music.

293
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:15,264
So reduced it to 10 sets and started

294
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,386
thinking about a little bit of sharing with some of the heroes.

295
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:21,228
And it did work out for size on mobile

296
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:22,949
and also for time in terms of production.

297
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,013
So now I'm going to go into WISE,

298
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,355
show you a little bit of the integration.

299
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,210
So, here's WISE.

300
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:43,412
I wanted to show you a bit of WISE because in here I'd like to show you how the hands were laid out.

301
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:46,793
A bit of the progression from hand one to hand eight.

302
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:55,656
Also I'd like to show you some of the transition work between the zombies and the plants and how that was done.

303
00:17:56,136 --> 00:17:57,736
And so I'm going to show you through a little bit of that.

304
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,857
So here we are, interactive music hierarchy.

305
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,438
And we go into the hand counter.

306
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:09,530
You know, these are the hands, like the phase indicator would indicate next hand, next hand.

307
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,271
And we did set it up with the eight hands as Devon Lowe, our creative director, told

308
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,811
us it would be on average.

309
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:24,473
So here is hand one, and as you open up the container for hand one, you see there's a

310
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:30,815
bucket there for plants and then for zombies, and then surprise zombies are zombie tricks.

311
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:31,975
We called them eventually.

312
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,036
They were called surprise zombies for a while.

313
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,741
some transitions that I sometimes used,

314
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,202
combat fight section here,

315
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:43,365
and a post-combat that became important eventually as well.

316
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:47,048
And those are all things on the phase indicator

317
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:47,608
for the most part.

318
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:50,431
So let's just open up the plants

319
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:56,915
and the zombies.

320
00:18:59,077 --> 00:19:03,640
All right, so here we have super brains.

321
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:23,816
The early hands are more mysterious.

322
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:32,900
You hear, of course, a lot of mallets, instruments as well.

323
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,802
And now when we go to Penelope, who is known as Green Shadow in the game.

324
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:41,964
Also mallets.

325
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:42,684
That's like glue, the mallets.

326
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:43,144
You hear the bass.

327
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:43,405
They both.

328
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:43,865
Some flute and her.

329
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:46,026
Again, these early hands are very contemplative.

330
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:47,387
Not a lot of action yet.

331
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:47,587
Okay.

332
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:48,708
So that would be some of the hand one.

333
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:50,309
I want to play you a little bit about of the zombie tricks.

334
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,630
I'm going to show you an example of this.

335
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,491
Let's say we had all three fingers.

336
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:55,332
So I'm going to increase D.

337
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:55,872
So this is awful.

338
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:56,593
I may be a little early.

339
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:57,093
This is worse.

340
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:57,813
So D is higher than E.

341
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,934
So that's all four fingers there.

342
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:02,977
So this just makes you think of all these different strategies.

343
00:20:02,997 --> 00:20:04,638
Idea one of them is this mittens, minusing one.

344
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:05,618
So I have a mitten, minus two.

345
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,200
I have another mitten.

346
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,581
It's just a little bit longer than three fingers.

347
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:10,161
I have an left hand.

348
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:10,942
So this is the case.

349
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:14,499
This is what would interrupt, right here would interrupt the plant.

350
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,481
There's a tense moment.

351
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,582
What's happening?

352
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:21,964
What's happening?

353
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,445
And then that would be interrupted by combat.

354
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,251
et cetera.

355
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,833
So that is the combat.

356
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:49,074
I wanted to say a quick note here.

357
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,796
This score is a hybrid score.

358
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:54,458
It's a mix between MIDI and WAV.

359
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,540
And I'd always thought it would be a hybrid score,

360
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:01,143
and it did indeed develop into being a hybrid score.

361
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:02,784
And there are some challenges that come up

362
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,165
along the way about that.

363
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:08,087
But I'm pretty pleased with how they live side by side

364
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,388
and how they all sound together.

365
00:21:10,975 --> 00:21:15,661
The last part of that sequence really is the post-combat.

366
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:22,489
This is just at the end of the combat, plays until the next hand.

367
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,571
And then you go into the next hand.

368
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:28,156
Alright, so that's a bit of how the sequence of cues goes.

369
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:30,672
And then we want to look at transitions.

370
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:34,313
Now, we have our transitions up here on this higher level

371
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:35,553
switch container.

372
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:38,174
We did experiment with having our transitions

373
00:21:38,434 --> 00:21:41,495
in lower levels, and that got really complicated

374
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,475
and eventually found that there's actually

375
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,956
consistency between them, and we're

376
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:47,476
able to control it from a higher level.

377
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:50,217
Of course, when you have some rules established

378
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:52,018
on the higher level, then it trickles down

379
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:52,918
to everything below.

380
00:21:53,498 --> 00:21:56,439
So here we are on this level, and we set our transitions

381
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:56,839
here.

382
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:02,972
In this tab, I go to, that's not the level,

383
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,633
it's actually this level, here we go.

384
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:05,194
All right.

385
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:10,057
And whenever you're playing as a zombie,

386
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:11,838
now you always play zombies first,

387
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:13,779
and they're always interrupted by plants.

388
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,102
So after through a lot of experimentation with,

389
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:19,283
this is the hardest one actually,

390
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:23,746
in the game, I realized that it had to be custom cue,

391
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:26,788
transition from zombies to plants.

392
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:33,007
I tried immediate, I tried next bar, I tried all sorts of things with this one in particular.

393
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:39,831
But it didn't feel right musically in the game to have it any other than the custom queue.

394
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:41,332
And I'll show you how those work.

395
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:46,795
So that was what zombies to plants were.

396
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:49,797
Let me show you in the queue now how that looks.

397
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:51,958
Over here in super brains.

398
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:56,207
Let's look at that for a second.

399
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:57,808
Okay.

400
00:22:58,428 --> 00:22:59,449
So you see down here,

401
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,391
these white markers are custom cues.

402
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:05,833
That means if you play from here,

403
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:10,256
and you get a call for the plant,

404
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,437
if you interrupt, it'll change out

405
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:14,198
at that white marker or that white marker.

406
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,679
Now there are white markers,

407
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,201
custom cues on all of these.

408
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,922
So at any time,

409
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:23,445
if it's called here,

410
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,512
it'll go out at that white marker.

411
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:29,934
And here as well.

412
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:33,016
I'll show you some of those later in the hands

413
00:23:33,116 --> 00:23:34,477
because they get a little more complicated.

414
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:39,200
In any case, custom cues from where the transition points

415
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,342
established from zombies to plants.

416
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:47,885
Now, plants, let's go back up here to our transitions.

417
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:51,468
Plants to

418
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:56,340
they get interrupted by the tricks, zombie tricks.

419
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,361
And that is immediate.

420
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:00,862
Because if you tried to do it later,

421
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,323
though it sounds better musically,

422
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,603
it didn't feel responsive enough in the game.

423
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:06,784
So again, you play the game,

424
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,265
you see where you need immediate,

425
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:11,326
where you can actually extend maybe to the bar,

426
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:13,887
or to the end of a phrase, or to a custom cue.

427
00:24:13,947 --> 00:24:16,648
And this is something that you just have to play with

428
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,709
and find what feels best for gameplay.

429
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:19,889
Super important.

430
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:26,380
Let's see, any to combat was next beat.

431
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,801
Now this one you wouldn't think necessarily,

432
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:31,643
you might think to combat needs to be immediate,

433
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,045
but next beat felt just a touch better.

434
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,907
So actually consistently,

435
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,088
next beat works best for this transition.

436
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:40,210
So that's where we set transitions.

437
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,292
And they are slightly different per hand

438
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:44,833
if we go down through the hands,

439
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:47,975
but we set them right there on that hand one

440
00:24:48,256 --> 00:24:49,677
for the transitions in hand one.

441
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:54,318
So, now I'm gonna go and play a little bit further in,

442
00:24:54,338 --> 00:25:00,021
hand four, just to show how it sort of develops

443
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:03,683
and sounds a little more active.

444
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,704
Now you're into the game a bit. ♪♪♪

445
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:13,167
Got hand percussion still here. ♪♪♪

446
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:17,590
But it's a little more energetic.

447
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,491
The contemplative phase.

448
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,700
And a little bit of green shadow.

449
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:48,715
All right, so it feels you're now in the meat of the game.

450
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:51,637
And now I'm going to play a little bit of Hand 8.

451
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:56,401
So we can see where it goes, it gets more intense.

452
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,085
Boop, boop.

453
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,328
There we are, super brains.

454
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:10,373
And then we have drum kit here.

455
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:11,074
Sing along.

456
00:26:11,094 --> 00:26:11,174
Ah.

457
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,222
Thank you, Damien.

458
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:24,783
All right.

459
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:25,864
And a little green shadow.

460
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:27,325
I bet you know this one, too. ♪♪♪

461
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,229
Also drum kit.

462
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:37,794
Gluing them together.

463
00:26:38,114 --> 00:26:40,096
Does it work?

464
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:45,581
All right. So you hear a progression from one to eight,

465
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:48,323
you know, as per our creative director's request.

466
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:49,564
Beginning, middle, end.

467
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:58,482
progression and then you saw here the transitions and a bit of how the segments work.

468
00:26:58,502 --> 00:27:01,608
So with that I'm going to go back to PowerPoint.

469
00:27:12,337 --> 00:27:13,797
So this content phase continues.

470
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:17,518
Remember how I used the trailer music

471
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:19,459
in the combat sections for,

472
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:22,479
trailer music from the marketing trailer

473
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:23,580
in the combat sections?

474
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,460
And now we've been living with that in the game

475
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,821
for a little while and so has the team.

476
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:30,161
And how was that working?

477
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:33,822
Well, not super great actually.

478
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,983
Because it was like too stingery.

479
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:38,664
Ba-da-ba-da, ba-da-ba-da.

480
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:39,864
And it was a bit.

481
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:44,389
jarring and irritating. It was the right style, but it wasn't quite the right thing.

482
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:51,791
So I decided to go in for a second recording session, which fortunately was approved in

483
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:58,213
the budget, which is a blessing. And I wrote eight specific combat cues, which are slightly

484
00:27:58,273 --> 00:28:02,674
more melodic, but still completely in that same style.

485
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:05,755
Also for this second recording session.

486
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,626
These things called comics or narratives were coming on board.

487
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:14,249
And each hero would get an introductory comic.

488
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:17,851
And it would be, hi, I'm the hero, and

489
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:21,793
then it would have these panels, comic panels, panel one, panel two, panel three.

490
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:27,556
And then they also had three more comics, adventure or story comics.

491
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:30,598
Also again, panel one, panel two, panel three.

492
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:34,840
So I talked to the art director and I said, well, let's see, if we had four,

493
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:41,110
Comics per hero, 4 times 20 is 80.

494
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,091
That's a lot of music, right?

495
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,232
That's really too much for this game.

496
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:48,214
And so I, so I thought we need to develop a system here.

497
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:53,238
If we can set some some consistency within the panels,

498
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,060
we can have a bucket of a mix and match type thing.

499
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,521
So it's four seconds per each panel.

500
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:05,631
one, two, or three, and now you can pull from panel one bucket for any time, which didn't

501
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:09,093
matter which comic, and it'll pull from these different buckets.

502
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:14,516
So it was good to work that out, and we recorded that in our second session, and this is how

503
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:14,896
it sounded.

504
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:28,383
So any time a comic comes in, it'll pull and sound different, but they all work really

505
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:28,843
well together.

506
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:36,975
So, along comes the MIDI phase.

507
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,717
I like this part of the story.

508
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:44,379
So, Guy Whitmore had decided, you know,

509
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,580
this is a great pop cap enterprise project

510
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,262
that we should record our own sample library

511
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:51,623
for our games, for mobile games.

512
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,294
He and I worked together to decide which instruments we should record based on the projects that

513
00:29:58,314 --> 00:30:02,617
were in production at the time and also looking out to the future what would be good ones

514
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:03,358
to have in general.

515
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:05,199
So we came up with a list of 24 instruments.

516
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:08,438
I always knew this was in the plan.

517
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:12,839
It didn't happen, it happened midway through production for Heroes.

518
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,960
I'd already finished seven Heroes by this time writing for East-West libraries.

519
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,081
But we were undergoing this sample library exercise and knowing that we'd be moving over

520
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:25,522
to those samples eventually.

521
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:28,022
And you may ask why?

522
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:31,903
But mobile, you know, we're always thinking about size and ways to be smart.

523
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,215
and this is a really smart way to do it.

524
00:30:34,675 --> 00:30:37,876
And also no licensing fees by having a sample library

525
00:30:37,896 --> 00:30:39,097
that you pull from within the game.

526
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:42,878
So, we went to Studio X

527
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:44,779
and we recorded these 24 instruments.

528
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,540
Three different articulations,

529
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,361
three different dynamics per instrument.

530
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,101
And then Guy,

531
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,483
hired Panther Modern and his team of specialists,

532
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,063
which maybe there's some in the room today.

533
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,704
There are many people who helped us

534
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:02,426
in terms of editing all of these materials

535
00:31:02,546 --> 00:31:04,547
and creating these mirrored sets,

536
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:07,208
a mirrored set for contact and for WISE.

537
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:10,650
So you write in your DAW with your contact set

538
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,931
and then you bring it over to WISE

539
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:15,273
and it's pretty darn close set.

540
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:18,174
So it worked beautifully and they did a great job.

541
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:19,955
So thank you, thank you so much.

542
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,083
So some of our instruments here, alto flute, saxophone,

543
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:32,786
this is just our list of instruments that I used mostly.

544
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:39,530
Then I brought them over to Logic and I'll talk about that.

545
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:44,073
Hired Panther Modern to help with the MIDI arrangements

546
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:45,133
because I was going to take.

547
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:50,040
the seven sets I already had and moved them over to the PopCap sample library.

548
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,362
So I asked him if he could help with that.

549
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:56,004
And also asked him about MIDI exporting,

550
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:59,026
because Pro Tools didn't seem very good at MIDI exporting.

551
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:01,408
So he said, yeah, Logic is way better.

552
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,590
So I decided, well, OK, then I will learn Logic.

553
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:10,314
And I think at PopCap, no one's too shy to learn a new DAW

554
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,095
in the middle of everything.

555
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:15,845
And I thank you all for being so brave.

556
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:18,487
Because I'm like, OK, I can do this too.

557
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:21,149
So I decided I'll learn logic.

558
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:24,751
And what was great about that is some of you probably all

559
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:28,414
know this, but there's such a great community around logic.

560
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:30,255
You go onto YouTube, you ask any question,

561
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,816
and there is a tutorial video.

562
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:35,959
And I basically got up and running very quickly,

563
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,501
one or two weeks, and I felt like I was fluid.

564
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,342
And if I had any questions, I'd just go to YouTube.

565
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:40,582
Hello.

566
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:44,396
all you gracious people who've shared information,

567
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:45,997
really helped me.

568
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:47,978
So I was able to get up and running quickly.

569
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,180
And I want to say, I am not a Pro Tools hater.

570
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:54,261
I still do like it for multiple movies,

571
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:55,482
I think it's a great tool,

572
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:58,664
but I do think it's good to choose the right tool

573
00:32:58,944 --> 00:32:59,424
for the job.

574
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,685
And Logic was the best for MIDI,

575
00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:03,906
and I still also use Pro Tools.

576
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:08,148
So, I had given

577
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:14,729
Green Shadow was the first one to Stan Lippard to do the MIDI arrangements and to the PopCap

578
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:15,089
samples.

579
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,792
He came into PopCap and we sat down and we listened to it.

580
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:25,425
And it did not sound the same.

581
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:27,846
I'd been writing to the East-West libraries, primarily,

582
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,947
that are beautiful, and different.

583
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,707
And our PopCap sample library is fantastic, too,

584
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:35,788
but it's totally different.

585
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,708
So the sounds were not the same.

586
00:33:38,388 --> 00:33:40,789
And the music, even though they were the same cues,

587
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:42,669
it just felt wrong.

588
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,150
And I had a day of depression.

589
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,370
But I pulled right out.

590
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,951
And I learned at that moment that a French horn

591
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:51,171
from one sample library is not the same as a French horn,

592
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:52,352
necessarily, to the other.

593
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:59,072
or the mallets, or several instruments in this case, weren't matches.

594
00:33:59,532 --> 00:34:05,838
And so I think it's very important, if you can, to write to the sample library that you'll

595
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:07,640
be using ultimately at the end.

596
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,582
Try to start there if you can.

597
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:16,328
It took a lot of time and effort to get to a place where I was comfortable with this

598
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:17,529
sample library.

599
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:22,302
A couple of weeks with green shadow and then I was fully comfortable with it.

600
00:34:22,842 --> 00:34:24,163
But we had to learn techniques.

601
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:25,664
So we did.

602
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:29,788
We sat down for a couple of weeks and we learned that layering helped, layering different kinds

603
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:35,072
of instruments, switching out, reorchestration in some cases, velocity changes.

604
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,682
Actually, duration changes in the mallets were really key.

605
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:42,624
It took, as I said, about two weeks on that.

606
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:45,727
And then after we learned some of these tricks,

607
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:49,429
it went faster per each hero after that.

608
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,651
And this is some of the layering that was done.

609
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:56,033
Didn't lean as, I leaned a lot on the French horns

610
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,955
in East-West, and then for PopCap,

611
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,837
I leaned more on the trombones.

612
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:05,140
And then did more layering with vibes.

613
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,162
This is how it sounds for Superbrains MIDI.

614
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:38,929
Aaah...

615
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:16,439
All right, so I think it turned out really well and eventually after getting

616
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:22,465
them all into MIDI and into the game, I totally forgot what it sounded like

617
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:27,850
before. I love it and I actually think it fits way better with the aesthetic and I

618
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:33,095
love it. I just grew to totally love MIDI and I'll tell you more why later.

619
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,353
So, I wanna talk a little bit about size.

620
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,754
We are a mobile studio, and we have to be very mindful

621
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:45,735
of our size because of the devices that we are played on.

622
00:36:46,635 --> 00:36:49,496
And about midway through, we went through an exercise

623
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:51,416
and established what our size would be.

624
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:53,677
And we sort of claimed 80 megs.

625
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:57,297
40 for music, 40 for sound effects and VO.

626
00:36:58,078 --> 00:36:59,718
Luca made a beautiful pie chart.

627
00:37:00,078 --> 00:37:03,059
We met with the TD, we showed it to the executive producer,

628
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:04,759
and they said, fine, okay.

629
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,814
Now, at that time, we were still kind of in this Hearthstone

630
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:11,715
era, that's sort of a big game.

631
00:37:14,075 --> 00:37:16,776
But now, at this point, we're in late production.

632
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:18,076
I wanna switch to late production.

633
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,257
And along came Clash Royale, and that was a quick game.

634
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:25,798
It loaded quickly, and everybody was loving it,

635
00:37:25,818 --> 00:37:30,759
and we had some pressure to come down to 30 megabytes.

636
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,880
Right, we got an email over the weekend,

637
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,780
and we're like, oh, you're too big,

638
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,720
you need to be 30 megabytes.

639
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:41,342
I think we all broke out in rashes at that moment.

640
00:37:42,962 --> 00:37:49,124
The executive producer came by our meeting fortunately that day and he said, hey, just

641
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:49,784
see what you can do.

642
00:37:50,404 --> 00:37:51,705
So we saw what we could do.

643
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:54,185
And we held to 60 megabytes.

644
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:57,826
And with our wise wizard, Damien Kastbauer right here.

645
00:37:58,622 --> 00:38:02,985
He pulled all the levers and whys to make it work

646
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:05,266
and to go down to 60 and make it sound awesome.

647
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,448
He used over 21 different compression settings

648
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:10,149
for the different sound types,

649
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,711
really massaging it and crafting it.

650
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:16,033
We switched some things from stereo to mono,

651
00:38:16,053 --> 00:38:16,774
but not everything.

652
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:19,596
We streamed all the wave music

653
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:24,279
and we streamed larger wave assets, like hero assets.

654
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:29,126
We also reduced the instrument ranges for the instrument sets.

655
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:32,850
So in some cases, if there's a higher range that's not needed,

656
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,132
I could just stretch out the note or just remove that.

657
00:38:36,373 --> 00:38:38,414
So I just went in and kind of did some pruning.

658
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:40,416
And that worked out well.

659
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:43,619
Also reduced the variation on the stingers of the block sounds.

660
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,240
Bow, bow, end of game.

661
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:48,983
And we got down to 60, and it sounds great.

662
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:50,805
And that's where we stayed.

663
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:55,209
Now, music, the late phase.

664
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,693
We'd been playing the game now for quite some time.

665
00:38:58,774 --> 00:39:00,075
The music has been in the game,

666
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,919
and it hasn't changed too much for several months.

667
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,341
How's it working?

668
00:39:05,162 --> 00:39:05,862
How's it not working?

669
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:09,396
Luke had been playing it a lot and he was like,

670
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:12,038
well, he was saying that in hand eight,

671
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,980
because his games were longer than five minutes.

672
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,903
So some real world stuff, real world info is coming in now.

673
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,545
You know, these are, sometimes they're shorter

674
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:22,167
than five minutes, but sometimes, you know,

675
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:22,987
it's an eight minute game.

676
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:24,529
And how's that working?

677
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:30,554
It wasn't responding quite as much as we wanted it to,

678
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,415
as I wanted it to.

679
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:34,557
You remember, I wanted it to really be the

680
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:38,031
connected to the gameplay experience and responsive

681
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,813
and for it to give emotional feedback to the player.

682
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:44,516
So, how could we make it more responsive?

683
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:48,099
MIDI was going to become our friend.

684
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:52,242
Now, one thing I thought was,

685
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:56,365
ha, well, when you get further in the game

686
00:39:56,446 --> 00:39:58,047
and you're up by a certain amount,

687
00:39:58,347 --> 00:40:00,649
you wanna feel good, you wanna feel lifted.

688
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,052
You know, remember Barry Manilow.

689
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:05,096
How he did that?

690
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:06,456
He transposed.

691
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:07,556
Okay, and it worked.

692
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:09,977
So, not all of you remember Barry Manilow,

693
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:10,697
and I realize that.

694
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:12,918
Anyway, he did transposition.

695
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:15,378
I'm like, oh yeah, we should try that.

696
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,160
So, Damien and I sat down together and figured out,

697
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,860
Damien was like, oh.

698
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:25,775
we could, huh, could we do this with MIDI?

699
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:29,316
And so we created an RTPC

700
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,617
for players' relative health in Wwise.

701
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,538
And with MIDI, what we were able to do

702
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,519
was if you're up by five points,

703
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:40,140
all the MIDI music went up a whole step.

704
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,260
And if you're up by 10 points,

705
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,821
all the MIDI music went up two whole steps.

706
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:46,786
And it worked.

707
00:40:47,266 --> 00:40:47,827
It was awesome.

708
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:49,969
That's why we love MIDI.

709
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,251
It really was flexible.

710
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:53,513
It was something that you can really work with.

711
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:56,656
And at that point, the waves were

712
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:57,757
starting to become an issue.

713
00:40:57,777 --> 00:40:59,920
Because remember, this is a hybrid score.

714
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,083
And the super block waves, ba-pow,

715
00:41:03,303 --> 00:41:04,925
would actually happen over the sections

716
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:05,886
where there's MIDI music.

717
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:10,860
And if you transpose your MIDI and you don't transpose those brass stingers, it does not

718
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,320
sound good.

719
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:17,703
So they were feeling kind of like clunky, the waves, like pulling us down.

720
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:24,766
And we utilized the same RTPC, but used playback speed for the waves.

721
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:29,608
And we're able to get that working, but it was really not as easy to do.

722
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:32,269
But it did get sounding great.

723
00:41:34,697 --> 00:41:37,017
Then we utilized the same health parameter,

724
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:41,098
same point spread, and added an overlay track

725
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:43,739
to the plants when they're not doing well,

726
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:45,420
and the zombies when they're not doing well.

727
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,720
For the plants I used a bass clarinet pattern,

728
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,441
and the zombies I used a trombone pattern,

729
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:53,382
and so the same RTPC would call that for a negative

730
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:54,422
when you're down by 10.

731
00:41:57,483 --> 00:41:59,364
A different health parameter that we used

732
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:01,805
when the player was not doing well

733
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:04,385
was we utilized parameters to drive switches.

734
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:10,246
And by that, I added a horizontal music layer,

735
00:42:10,426 --> 00:42:14,407
an overlay track, and it switched to a low health sub-track

736
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:17,088
to a cello, ostinato, and bass pitts part.

737
00:42:17,908 --> 00:42:21,049
So whether you are a zombie or a plant, it's the same.

738
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:23,690
You're down to your last five and you're not doing well.

739
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,891
Yeah, you kind of got that JAWS type thing happening.

740
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:32,272
We also, at this phase, because we're kind of like,

741
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:33,393
how can we get this more responsive?

742
00:42:35,557 --> 00:42:41,344
Luca had been thinking about those kinds of ideas way early on, and he had this EKG, we

743
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:46,771
called it, game parameter, which was a combination of many different things of how the player

744
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:47,372
was feeling.

745
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:51,396
So a combination of many different things I cannot explain right now.

746
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,444
But basically, if you follow that parameter,

747
00:42:54,464 --> 00:42:56,444
it would be an intensity change.

748
00:42:56,945 --> 00:43:00,826
And so we thought, oh, we'll try that with Spadau and Cyborg

749
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:02,687
on some drums.

750
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,788
Let's try it on some drums.

751
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:06,389
So we added some subtracts and layers with drums.

752
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:09,210
And it was working in the game, and we could hear it.

753
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,631
But the material itself, the drum tracks,

754
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:14,233
it was live drums that I had recorded at Bastyr.

755
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:17,214
I never recorded really very much variation at all, never

756
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,755
any variation in intensity.

757
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:31,382
So there wasn't much feeling difference and I think I'd love to come back to this someday with different drums and put in more intense drums to have that match and follow.

758
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:37,446
Because I think it's a great feature but we decided it's not actually, you actually don't feel the lift because the material wasn't there.

759
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:41,128
So we tried and it was awesome and we decided to not use it for now.

760
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:46,602
So other late music changes were in the combat section.

761
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:50,023
Remember I wrote those phrases, we recorded them in our second session.

762
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:54,945
And they would get interrupted at the next beat in the game.

763
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:58,466
But it sounded a little weird to me early on in the game or

764
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:02,728
if there weren't many sidekicks on board during the combat sections.

765
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:08,470
So we decided, I could probably edit those combat phrases into shorter,

766
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:09,510
a shorten along.

767
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,071
So we utilized a game parameter.

768
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:15,837
based on how many cards are on board,

769
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:18,018
on the deck, in the combat area,

770
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:20,920
and if there are three or less, I believe,

771
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,161
then it goes to a short combat,

772
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:23,221
and if there are three or more,

773
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:25,282
then it goes to a long combat.

774
00:44:25,643 --> 00:44:26,703
So we've changed that as well,

775
00:44:26,723 --> 00:44:27,904
and now it's more responsive.

776
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:30,305
So all these changes, a little more responsive.

777
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:33,808
And now I'm gonna play for you

778
00:44:33,828 --> 00:44:36,369
a little bit of how the transpositions sound.

779
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:53,283
So right now it's 16 for Solar Flare versus 15 for Tisha.

780
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:57,985
So no transposition.

781
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:06,248
But now she's up by 7.

782
00:45:12,103 --> 00:45:14,645
Transposition on.

783
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:17,647
Alright!

784
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:41,927
So that's how that sounded in the game.

785
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:45,309
So I just want to recap a little bit.

786
00:45:45,629 --> 00:45:50,372
The guiding principles that we set early on to be for the game

787
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:53,473
player, the player's experience, always coming back to that

788
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:57,256
as our guiding principle allowed for changes

789
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,196
to happen along the way.

790
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:01,338
And for our phases, I would say from the prototype

791
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:04,560
to content, MIDI, late phase even, where you think

792
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,740
you might be done, no, no.

793
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,120
You're not done.

794
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,961
You can re-look at it.

795
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:09,941
You can reassess it.

796
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:11,162
You can say, can this be better?

797
00:46:11,842 --> 00:46:15,223
And utilizing your tools and an open mind and a flexible mind,

798
00:46:15,723 --> 00:46:18,824
and flexible team, I should say as well,

799
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:21,485
you can make these changes all the way along

800
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:22,245
through the process.

801
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:27,146
So speaking of a team, it does take a village,

802
00:46:27,186 --> 00:46:28,567
and a very fine one, indeed.

803
00:46:29,698 --> 00:46:32,559
So I want to thank everybody on PVZ Hero's team.

804
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,382
Luca Fusi, lead sound designer extraordinaire, thank you.

805
00:46:37,622 --> 00:46:40,624
Technical sound designers RJ, Mattingly,

806
00:46:41,304 --> 00:46:44,466
Damien Kastbauer, interactive mixer Damien Kastbauer,

807
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:47,808
and Wizard of Wise, as we all know you to be.

808
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:51,650
Panther Modern, MIDI and orchestra arranger,

809
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:53,611
music mixer Corey Krockenberg,

810
00:46:53,631 --> 00:46:55,112
for all those trailers and the brass,

811
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:56,953
it sounded so good, at Bastyr.

812
00:46:57,979 --> 00:47:05,040
our additional sound designers, Sound Rangers, Formosa, RJ and Jacqueline, and of course

813
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,440
our studio audio director, Guy, for trusting this project to me.

814
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:15,381
I am so grateful for having this opportunity because I loved these last two years on this

815
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:16,742
project so much.

816
00:47:16,802 --> 00:47:17,902
It's been the best of my whole career.

817
00:47:18,842 --> 00:47:22,263
And then thank you very much for your time today.

818
00:47:22,283 --> 00:47:24,143
I'm ready to take some questions if you have any.

819
00:47:24,163 --> 00:47:24,283
Thanks.

820
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:24,563
Thank you.

821
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:24,903
Have a good day.

822
00:47:24,923 --> 00:47:24,983
Bye.

823
00:47:25,023 --> 00:47:25,123
Bye.

824
00:47:25,163 --> 00:47:25,323
Thanks.

825
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:25,683
Have a good day.

826
00:47:25,703 --> 00:47:25,763
Bye.

827
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:25,843
Bye.

828
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:25,923
Bye.

829
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:26,003
Bye.

830
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:26,663
Thank you.

831
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:32,089
the first 11 people, I think, that asked questions,

832
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:34,652
you get a mushroom, so don't be shy.

833
00:47:34,672 --> 00:47:41,401
Okay.

834
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,682
Thank you.

835
00:47:42,702 --> 00:47:44,264
Thank you.

836
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:44,685
Thank you.

837
00:47:44,705 --> 00:47:46,407
So, thank you.

838
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:46,567
Wow.

839
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,088
A little shoot.

840
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:50,816
I kind of went through the same thing as you.

841
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:52,777
I was tasked with a mobile game

842
00:47:53,257 --> 00:47:56,339
and went to listen to what was out there.

843
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,100
And this was the first game I listened to

844
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:01,181
and realized I was out of my league.

845
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:04,563
So kudos to you and the PopCamp team.

846
00:48:05,263 --> 00:48:08,105
My question is, why when you realized

847
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:12,067
that the Stingers weren't working as real-time music,

848
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:13,848
did you not just convert everything,

849
00:48:14,048 --> 00:48:15,049
or pre-recorded music,

850
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:17,950
did you not just go all MIDI all the time?

851
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:25,363
Yeah, I guess I could have done the stingers as samples.

852
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:26,764
That is possible.

853
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:28,545
But I really like the live brass.

854
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:32,728
And I didn't want to use the PopCap Sample Library brass

855
00:48:32,808 --> 00:48:35,570
because the stingers had these great bends to them.

856
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,211
Pow, pow, their articulations.

857
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:40,513
You just, you only get that in live.

858
00:48:41,313 --> 00:48:43,555
And so for brass I decided that just had to be

859
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:44,155
the live waves.

860
00:48:45,116 --> 00:48:45,376
Thank you.

861
00:48:45,596 --> 00:48:46,256
Yeah, you're welcome.

862
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:50,975
I'm sorry, Masha, if I hit you.

863
00:48:51,476 --> 00:48:52,316
Oh, that was a good one.

864
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:56,138
So I was wondering about the transposition

865
00:48:56,758 --> 00:48:59,020
with using the wave files.

866
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:03,022
Did you have to change the tempo at all,

867
00:49:03,222 --> 00:49:05,243
or were all the wave files such short phrases

868
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:08,604
that they didn't change tempo when you transposed them?

869
00:49:09,385 --> 00:49:10,946
Oh, okay, so the only ones,

870
00:49:11,286 --> 00:49:14,888
only waves that transposed were the block stingers.

871
00:49:15,688 --> 00:49:16,949
Bam, ba-dum!

872
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:17,329
And...

873
00:49:18,347 --> 00:49:21,747
When we did that pitch thing, they of course sped up just a little bit, but

874
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:23,968
that was fine because they were not time based anyway.

875
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,428
They were just kind of attacks.

876
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:30,830
The combat phrases, the fight music, that did not transpose.

877
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,510
I'm like, how will that sound?

878
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:37,491
But it did sound fine, in my opinion, to transpose up and

879
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,852
then combat section does stay where it was.

880
00:49:39,892 --> 00:49:41,912
So we did not transpose the combat section.

881
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:43,193
Okay, thank you.

882
00:49:45,057 --> 00:49:45,897
Hi, thank you so much.

883
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:48,838
I believe they sort of asked the questions

884
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:51,699
that I was about to ask, but now I have the mushroom,

885
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:54,200
so I might as well just leave.

886
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,081
No, okay.

887
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:57,041
But no, I actually did have a question.

888
00:49:57,061 --> 00:50:00,603
So what, I guess it was related to the key

889
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,704
that you chose to have things in.

890
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:09,289
How did the different kind of gameplay keys work together?

891
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:13,193
You have sort of each character has their own theme

892
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:15,716
and motif in the right key.

893
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:17,778
I may maybe just touch on that a bit.

894
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:18,278
Sure, sure.

895
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:20,801
Yeah, each character has their own motif.

896
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:24,344
And each in each hand, I set common key centers.

897
00:50:24,384 --> 00:50:28,288
So hand one through hand three, it's all G minor.

898
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:31,577
And then at hand four, they all switched to C minor.

899
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:36,278
And then hand five, I started getting a little more crazy.

900
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:39,900
And I did C and D minor.

901
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,682
So it could be in C and D. And then seven and eight,

902
00:50:45,882 --> 00:50:49,563
it was C, D, and G. And they're all complementary.

903
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:52,024
So it was fine to switch between those keys.

904
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:53,004
OK, thank you.

905
00:50:53,204 --> 00:50:55,465
That kind of stayed safe, I think.

906
00:50:58,012 --> 00:50:59,815
I'll pass on the mushroom. I've already got one.

907
00:51:00,275 --> 00:51:01,236
Are you sure? You don't want a double?

908
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:03,118
No, give it to somebody else.

909
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:03,679
Is that a little friend?

910
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:04,280
Give it to somebody else.

911
00:51:05,803 --> 00:51:09,727
I'm curious about your decision, because you guys are always pushing the envelope, which I love,

912
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:14,131
but I was curious that, you know, you were talking about these late changes etc, which,

913
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,655
knowing the way you guys do things, were probably fairly, you know, you know you're going to be

914
00:51:18,835 --> 00:51:23,219
changing up until almost the minute it was done, so I'm kind of curious on why there was the

915
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:26,963
decision to do the live recording, what seemed to be sort of earlier on in the process, because then

916
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,765
you've, like as you even sort of said it yourself, it's kind of like, oh.

917
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:31,686
we can't do anything with that.

918
00:51:31,806 --> 00:51:34,046
So whilst obviously the live recordings

919
00:51:34,106 --> 00:51:35,427
give you a really awesome sound,

920
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:37,547
wouldn't it have been sort of more flexible

921
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:41,188
to do a semi-okay version of that in samples,

922
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:43,129
which you could then leave the recording to the end

923
00:51:43,169 --> 00:51:44,989
and then if you've changed things, it sort of,

924
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,869
so what was the benefit of doing the live recording?

925
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:48,010
What was the decision on that one?

926
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,770
Oh, well, I think because of the marketing trailer.

927
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:53,111
Marketing trailer came quite early

928
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:57,092
and it was, they had budget for live recording for it

929
00:51:57,892 --> 00:51:58,032
and.

930
00:51:58,743 --> 00:51:59,764
So you took advantage of that.

931
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:00,645
Took advantage of that.

932
00:52:00,845 --> 00:52:01,005
Right.

933
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:04,727
And then in editing and chopping that up and those, the beautiful brass sound that

934
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:08,329
that brought to the game and putting that into the game, I'm like, ah, I kind of

935
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:09,350
fell in love with that brass.

936
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,190
No, no, no, no.

937
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:10,750
Thank you.

938
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:11,551
That makes complete sense.

939
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:12,431
Cause I do exactly the same thing.

940
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:13,592
It's like, well, I'm not going to waste this.

941
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:14,292
Right.

942
00:52:14,352 --> 00:52:17,674
But, but through your talk, it's like, but that would have been really much better

943
00:52:17,694 --> 00:52:19,515
to do at the end, but of course you did have that choice.

944
00:52:19,675 --> 00:52:20,136
Well, and yeah.

945
00:52:20,156 --> 00:52:21,977
And that's, you know, kind of like how things go.

946
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:25,979
You don't know always where things will happen and you flex and you follow.

947
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:26,940
Thank you for sharing.

948
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,280
Yeah.

949
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,300
Thanks for asking.

950
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:30,453
Hi.

951
00:52:31,654 --> 00:52:32,635
We're getting good at this, yes.

952
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:33,915
Sweet.

953
00:52:35,136 --> 00:52:37,037
So, always be recording.

954
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:40,540
Always be composing, always be mixing, all of this.

955
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:44,002
You had someone come into your office

956
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,884
and basically say, cut out half of this.

957
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:50,726
Was there any concession that you had to make

958
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:51,867
in the composing?

959
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:53,368
Was there anything you had to change?

960
00:52:54,008 --> 00:52:56,150
Or was Damian just that good and made it work?

961
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,011
He was that good.

962
00:52:59,874 --> 00:53:00,314
For real?

963
00:53:00,475 --> 00:53:01,515
Yeah, we did not.

964
00:53:01,535 --> 00:53:01,915
Wow.

965
00:53:01,935 --> 00:53:04,197
Well, no, you know, we took out variations.

966
00:53:05,918 --> 00:53:10,200
Our concessions were in variations with the sound effects and the music.

967
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:16,204
So some concessions, but never really a large amount of content was changed.

968
00:53:16,844 --> 00:53:23,268
I think we really held to it because we believed in how it was all working together.

969
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:28,931
And because Damien is so good with wise and knows the tools and how to really...

970
00:53:30,853 --> 00:53:37,317
get it working in, I think that's why we're able to not really have to change the content.

971
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:38,318
Cool, thank you very much.

972
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:40,640
Yeah, I think if we didn't have Damien, we would have had it too.

973
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,060
Cool, thank you.

974
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,841
You're welcome.

975
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:44,842
Hello, thank you for your talk.

976
00:53:45,543 --> 00:53:45,923
You're welcome.

977
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:47,404
Ah, sorry about that.

978
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:49,245
That was like a ground ball.

979
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:55,909
I was just curious, for your live recordings, where were some microphone configurations that you use?

980
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:56,810
Oh.

981
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,330
Hahaha.

982
00:53:58,205 --> 00:54:00,287
I don't remember.

983
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:05,032
We went to Bastyr and, oh, OK.

984
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:09,718
So we were in Bastyr, and we had an 18-piece brass group.

985
00:54:10,018 --> 00:54:10,939
It was a giant church.

986
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:12,060
It's a giant church.

987
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:15,704
And I think they had many different sets of mics.

988
00:54:16,065 --> 00:54:17,466
I don't remember exactly on the brass,

989
00:54:17,507 --> 00:54:19,489
but I do really remember the drums.

990
00:54:20,443 --> 00:54:23,404
They built out a little room in the middle of the stage,

991
00:54:23,684 --> 00:54:27,025
a little drum room to record the drum kit in that space

992
00:54:27,065 --> 00:54:28,526
so it wouldn't just be such a wash.

993
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:30,186
And so that was fantastic.

994
00:54:30,506 --> 00:54:32,347
And then we recorded the bass inside the studio

995
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:35,508
and the brass, we took advantage of that beautiful space.

996
00:54:35,748 --> 00:54:38,069
And so I can't remember exactly all their micing technique

997
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:40,990
that they used for that, but thank you.

998
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,731
Yeah, standard kind of, yeah.

999
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:47,092
Thank you for your talk.

1000
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:47,612
Oh yeah.

1001
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:48,192
Come on.

1002
00:54:54,516 --> 00:54:59,521
I'm just curious about the MIDI sample library.

1003
00:55:00,222 --> 00:55:04,206
And you said you made 24 instruments.

1004
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:08,731
It sounds really good, but I want to know about more.

1005
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:13,616
And how many variations in each instrument do you have?

1006
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:17,391
Oh yeah, we did three different articulations

1007
00:55:17,972 --> 00:55:20,353
and three different dynamic ranges.

1008
00:55:20,893 --> 00:55:23,334
So usually a soft, medium, a loud,

1009
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:24,995
and depending on the instrument,

1010
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:26,496
what kind of articulations.

1011
00:55:27,936 --> 00:55:30,037
So that was about pretty much what we did for each,

1012
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,738
sometimes four articulations.

1013
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:35,720
And then we went and chose which ones we wanted

1014
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,382
and needed for our games and further called that down.

1015
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:41,083
But now we have all of that for the future.

1016
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:42,663
Huh?

1017
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:46,317
Each note.

1018
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:50,298
Imagine Guy and I sitting for two weeks.

1019
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:51,058
Baap.

1020
00:55:52,038 --> 00:55:52,458
Baap.

1021
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:53,999
Baap.

1022
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:55,659
Oh, no, that last one was pitchy.

1023
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,880
Baap.

1024
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,520
That was our reality.

1025
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:01,701
Total zen.

1026
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:06,762
So three articulations, three dynamic range, and for each tone?

1027
00:56:07,403 --> 00:56:08,023
For each pitch.

1028
00:56:08,403 --> 00:56:08,823
Each pitch.

1029
00:56:09,183 --> 00:56:09,803
Each pitch, yeah.

1030
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:11,304
And it did take about two weeks.

1031
00:56:11,464 --> 00:56:12,504
It took exactly two weeks.

1032
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:13,770
to do 24 hours a week.

1033
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,470
It's a fantastic job.

1034
00:56:14,631 --> 00:56:15,551
Thank you.

1035
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:16,211
Thank you.

1036
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:17,412
Hi.

1037
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:18,232
Hi.

1038
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:20,994
Thanks for the talk.

1039
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,355
You're welcome.

1040
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:26,565
I just wanted to ask a question, obviously.

1041
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:33,830
So, you sounded like you composed or maybe you just arranged in Logic and then exported

1042
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:40,294
MIDI and were playing a similar or the same samples back in Wwise.

1043
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:42,916
I just was wondering if you could talk a little bit about...

1044
00:56:44,744 --> 00:56:47,786
Any mixing that had to be done in Wwise,

1045
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:50,628
or I'm assuming you're applying your ambience,

1046
00:56:51,128 --> 00:56:53,850
your reverb in Wwise, and what was that like to like,

1047
00:56:54,351 --> 00:56:57,693
did that make, did that help sell the transitions to have?

1048
00:56:57,753 --> 00:57:00,815
Absolutely, yeah we had the same kind of reverb in Wwise,

1049
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,877
and we used that as a glue between everything,

1050
00:57:03,957 --> 00:57:05,078
and I think that's important,

1051
00:57:05,258 --> 00:57:06,999
because it makes everything feel like

1052
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,001
it's coming from the same space, so yes we did.

1053
00:57:10,621 --> 00:57:16,605
Yeah, I wonder if you could do that even with waves, or if you just didn't mix it with reverb

1054
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:18,126
and then you applied it in Wwise.

1055
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:23,190
We had a little bit of reverb on the waves, but we also utilized the same reverb within

1056
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:23,750
Wwise.

1057
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:28,373
I don't think we brought anything in too wet because we knew that we would be utilizing

1058
00:57:28,393 --> 00:57:29,414
the reverb within Wwise.

1059
00:57:29,794 --> 00:57:30,394
Cool, thank you.

1060
00:57:30,535 --> 00:57:31,075
Yeah, you're welcome.

1061
00:57:33,577 --> 00:57:37,059
I think we have probably time for two more questions, and then our time is up.

1062
00:57:38,184 --> 00:57:38,604
Thank you.

1063
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:39,945
This is perfect.

1064
00:57:40,205 --> 00:57:40,365
Hi.

1065
00:57:41,186 --> 00:57:41,426
Hi.

1066
00:57:41,526 --> 00:57:43,507
I had a question that I just changed my mind though.

1067
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,289
The first question was about musical genre.

1068
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:48,350
Did you go back and look specifically

1069
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:52,092
at certain references, styles, composers,

1070
00:57:52,232 --> 00:57:54,513
or did it just come out of your experience?

1071
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:58,575
But I was wondering about MIDI controllers,

1072
00:57:58,635 --> 00:58:00,016
just based on that last question.

1073
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:03,918
Were you using expression control and things in Wwise?

1074
00:58:05,575 --> 00:58:08,357
Oh, not really much, no.

1075
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:11,879
I didn't really use much of that in Wwise.

1076
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,301
I've been using the pitch bend lately.

1077
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:15,882
Thank you.

1078
00:58:15,902 --> 00:58:16,243
Yeah, it's fine.

1079
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:18,524
But you can.

1080
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:22,087
I bet you can if you want to and it's flexible enough to do that.

1081
00:58:22,787 --> 00:58:25,309
The MIDI system in Wwise has a little ways to go.

1082
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,531
Definitely there's no editing in there.

1083
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:31,874
So if you wanted to even change any kind of velocity at all, you have to go back to your

1084
00:58:31,894 --> 00:58:32,854
DAW and then bring it back in.

1085
00:58:34,938 --> 00:58:36,219
but still love it.

1086
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:37,020
Thank you.

1087
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,181
Okay, last question.

1088
00:58:39,722 --> 00:58:43,725
And before I forget, everybody please fill in your surveys.

1089
00:58:44,866 --> 00:58:47,809
Ooh, and mention how great the mushrooms are.

1090
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:48,649
Okay. Thank you.

1091
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:52,253
First of all, this is a great, sorry.

1092
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:54,595
This is a great talk, you have a brilliant mind.

1093
00:58:54,655 --> 00:58:55,775
I really, really do.

1094
00:58:55,796 --> 00:58:56,396
Thanks.

1095
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,018
My question is kinda when you talked about

1096
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:00,479
when you had to reduce the size,

1097
00:59:02,657 --> 00:59:04,238
when you mentioned different techniques,

1098
00:59:04,258 --> 00:59:06,578
like kind of carving and compression and things like that,

1099
00:59:06,938 --> 00:59:09,619
was it a matter of reducing the data

1100
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,759
in the actual file and the playback?

1101
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:14,420
Because was that the result of all the changes you made

1102
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,880
in reducing it from like 80 to 60?

1103
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,121
Was that the result of it?

1104
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,121
You understand?

1105
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:22,522
It's more about, well, we did a lot of compressions.

1106
00:59:22,922 --> 00:59:23,542
Right. Compression.

1107
00:59:23,622 --> 00:59:26,262
So if that's what you mean, yeah, we did a lot of that.

1108
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:27,843
And then we did some...

1109
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:31,282
But I mean, maybe let me clarify.

1110
00:59:31,662 --> 00:59:33,783
Like the net cut that you achieved,

1111
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:38,304
how would you summarize the achievement you got

1112
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:39,404
with all the changes you made?

1113
00:59:39,484 --> 00:59:42,285
Was that a reduction in kind of like the size

1114
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:45,065
of the print of the file, or what was the actual result,

1115
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:46,726
the cumulative result of all the processes?

1116
00:59:46,766 --> 00:59:49,526
60 megabyte memory footprint on device

1117
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:53,867
was the result of all the different wizardry

1118
00:59:53,947 --> 00:59:55,088
that Damien did in Wwise.

1119
00:59:55,108 --> 00:59:56,428
Okay.

1120
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,068
So we had 80, and then we went to 60.

1121
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:00,530
And then we did have a lot of things that are streaming.

1122
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,693
So basically it just became smaller and helpful to the game

1123
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:06,555
because when, you know, especially on mobile,

1124
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,057
they want download to be quick.

1125
01:00:09,717 --> 01:00:11,258
And also for the footprint on the phone

1126
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:13,700
to not be too large because people will just remove it.

1127
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,622
Yeah, that's probably true.

1128
01:00:15,982 --> 01:00:16,282
Okay.

1129
01:00:17,143 --> 01:00:17,583
Thank you.

1130
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:18,864
Thank you. Appreciate it.

1131
01:00:18,884 --> 01:00:19,084
Yeah.

1132
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:20,505
Well, thank you everybody.

1133
01:00:20,525 --> 01:00:21,746
I appreciate your time.
