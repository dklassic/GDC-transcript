00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:08,280
Hi, my name is Brianna Lindsay,

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,800
and we are going to be talking about

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,561
on Explosive New Spider-Man

4
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:13,801
and creating visual effects

5
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,101
for Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales.

6
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:18,542
I'm one of the lead effects artists at Insomniac Games

7
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:19,882
and I got to work on this project.

8
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:23,203
And I'm really delighted to be here talking today with you

9
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:26,004
about some of the effects that we made for this game.

10
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,304
So this talk has a couple of themes.

11
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:30,645
Some of them were,

12
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:33,105
one of the ones that we intended right from the start

13
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:35,766
was finding a voice for your hero through visual effects.

14
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:38,788
and really telling their story and making them unique.

15
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,649
An explosive new Spider-Man.

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,350
So an explosive new Spider-Man was one of the pillars

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,191
of this game and it's something that the effects team

18
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:46,912
really glommed onto.

19
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:51,015
We found a lot of fun in making Miles our own hero

20
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:54,617
and finding ways to differentiate him from the hero

21
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:56,778
of the 2018 game Marvel's Spider-Man.

22
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:03,933
Another pillar of this talk is technical tips and tricks that we learned working on a cross-generation game.

23
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:12,161
So there were a lot of things that we picked up along the way in terms of learnings when it comes to pushing next-gen visual effects,

24
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:18,027
as well as working on a cross-generation title, working on something that had to be on both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

25
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:23,690
And the last theme was something that kind of evolved as I was working on this talk.

26
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,671
And that one is really pushing forward through the unknown,

27
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,333
taking risks and working together to create something new and great.

28
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:35,316
There were a number of effects that, you know, when we were starting to work on this game,

29
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:37,377
we weren't entirely sure how we were going to pull them off.

30
00:01:38,237 --> 00:01:43,682
And I really feel like we learned a lot by taking a risk, by challenging ourselves, and

31
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:46,284
by pushing forward through the unknown.

32
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:49,306
And it was really wonderful to be able to work on that.

33
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:53,205
So I'm going to give you a quick overview of this talk.

34
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:56,808
During our time together, we're going to be talking about Miles's powers.

35
00:01:56,808 --> 00:02:02,693
That includes his venom powers, so that's his bioelectricity that generates within himself.

36
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:08,357
That's also his camouflage ability, so his camouflage is when he turns invisible.

37
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:09,879
We're also going to touch on creating spectacle.

38
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,122
So spectacle is a really important part of this game,

39
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:17,625
and it's something that we sort of had to work together as the visual effects team to push.

40
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:23,324
We're also going to be talking about the enemy powers, that includes programmable matter.

41
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:29,947
So Miles as his own explosive new Spider-Man needs explosive villains to be able to fight.

42
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:34,189
We're also going to be talking about his webs. So Spider-Man isn't really Spider-Man

43
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,770
without his webs and I thought it would be important for us to talk about that.

44
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:41,858
We're also going to be talking about an all new accessible game.

45
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:45,801
We had a philosophy of anyone can wear the mask while working on Spider-Man.

46
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:49,783
And as an effects department, we were really able to make a big difference for players

47
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:53,886
with visual and cognitive needs with our contrast options.

48
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:57,449
And lastly, we're just going to talk about challenges for new generation and some of

49
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,910
the learnings and takeaways that we had while working on this project.

50
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:04,344
So let's get into it. Let's start talking about Miles' Venom powers.

51
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:09,387
They're central to the character and a pillar, a part of the pillar of creating an amazing new Spider-Man.

52
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:15,289
So this is our next generation shot that we made for the PS5 reveal.

53
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:22,192
And this is, in the scene we see Miles draining electricity from an overloading reactor.

54
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:27,194
And as the camera moves across his arm, we see his suit peel away as his arm flashes with electricity.

55
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:32,197
And as the camera continues, his mask eventually disintegrates as well,

56
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:34,177
revealing who he is to the player.

57
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:39,800
And for these shots, we really had to figure out creating a soft body simulation pipeline,

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,901
just so that we could get that suit disintegrating and coming apart.

59
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:46,463
We also had to figure out how we were going to get that X-ray kind of effect on his skin,

60
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:49,944
so you can kind of see his bones and his viscera through that.

61
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:53,445
We also had to work on the glass particles flying at the camera,

62
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,606
and of course the suit burning up.

63
00:03:56,307 --> 00:04:01,909
So these were all challenges that we were eager to dive into as an effects team.

64
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,750
So when we kind of started on this, this was really just a pitch on paper.

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,012
We had this really beautiful script that was written for this that honestly sent chills down

66
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:16,434
my spine. All we really had was this piece of concept art and the script. And, you know,

67
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:22,397
in this script, we hear Peter Parker talking to the player and telling the player, you know,

68
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:24,637
Miles, this is your chance to go be a hero.

69
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:29,619
And that script, it sort of described,

70
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:32,180
we sort of see Miles put his hands into the reactor.

71
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,101
We see him absorb this power into himself.

72
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,322
And this is really his defining moment as a hero.

73
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:41,904
This is where Miles decides to save his neighborhood

74
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:43,724
within New York City.

75
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:46,965
And it's a moment of self-sacrifice

76
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:49,366
because as he absorbs this into himself,

77
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:50,367
it's a really dangerous moment

78
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:51,227
where he could potentially die.

79
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:56,028
So when I heard this script, I mean, it honestly sent chills down my spine.

80
00:04:56,028 --> 00:05:00,469
This was a huge opportunity for the effects team to sort of push ourselves

81
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:01,909
and to create something new and amazing.

82
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:05,650
However, I was also really nervous when I heard it because, you know,

83
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,211
we didn't have the tools to pull it off.

84
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:10,511
We had to develop those along the way.

85
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:15,973
So one of the big problems that we needed really high-quality Venom electricity,

86
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:18,713
so that electricity that crackles down his arm,

87
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,514
that's something that we had to develop for this.

88
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:27,158
We have a little bit of electricity, it's biological, and it's something that comes

89
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:27,679
from Miles himself.

90
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,503
And this really differentiates him from Peter Parker, the Spider-Man in our previous game,

91
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:38,107
Marvel's Spider-Man, because his abilities are more technology-based.

92
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:41,390
We also had to figure out how to do soft-body simulations.

93
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,574
We didn't really have a pipeline to be able to do things like simulations of fabric tearing

94
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:46,714
off.

95
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:50,178
So that was the question we were asking ourselves,

96
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:52,079
was, OK, well, we really want to do this.

97
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,299
We think it's really, really cool.

98
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,660
How are we going to pull this off?

99
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,822
So just so everybody watching at home understands,

100
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:02,204
when it comes to this shot, the effects team

101
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,185
was responsible for a great deal of it.

102
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:05,726
When you remove the character from the equation,

103
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:08,607
you can really kind of see the soft body simulation

104
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:11,008
in question, as well as the glass particulates.

105
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:16,673
the electricity that kind of crawls down. We need to do that for both arms of course.

106
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:20,997
And you know, since I took the character out, you can't see it, but there's also that sort of

107
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:24,781
x-ray effect that's going on on the character. So you can kind of see his bones and his viscera

108
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:29,305
inside of his body, because it's really important for Miles as a character that this is coming from him.

109
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:35,413
So, some of the solutions that we came up with to pull this off, we ended up leaning

110
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:37,956
on some current-gen techniques to start.

111
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:41,821
We painted vertex colors to drive that sort of slow reveal of the electricity.

112
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:47,568
Our artist, Jenna, did a pass on this and she did an amazing job on creating this electricity.

113
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,632
So one of the things we found was that we could afford more vertices on next gen.

114
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:54,835
And we really tried to use that to our advantage where we could.

115
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:59,379
By using more vertices, we were able to sort of push that fidelity on the next gen console.

116
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:04,164
And we were also able to use the, you know, everybody's sort of used this technique,

117
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:09,048
I'm sure, where you use vertex colors, you color a vertice, like red, green, or blue.

118
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,409
In this case, I think we used red.

119
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,933
just to be able to drive that precise wipe.

120
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,095
So there's material nodes in our material editor,

121
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,917
vertex color nodes, that we sort of lean

122
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:20,958
into to be able to drive this.

123
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,360
This is kind of what that looks like in the particle editor.

124
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,482
So as you can see, we were able to get

125
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:29,224
like a lot of precise control, kind of leveraging

126
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:30,806
a current gen technique.

127
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:33,528
In addition to that, we also layered on some

128
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:35,169
of those little particle quads.

129
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,930
So you're able to sort of see.

130
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:42,434
those additional tertiary lightenings at the ends.

131
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:47,938
So we did layer in some particle quads in addition to using meshes.

132
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:52,801
But I really liked that we were able to essentially model this out to get more fidelity for this shot.

133
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:59,469
Next up, we're going to talk about simulations and what we call our Anamvert pipeline.

134
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:05,133
So we needed to develop a pipeline for bringing in baked soft body simulations that really

135
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,854
didn't exist in Marvel's Spider-Man.

136
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:11,237
Our solution for this was the Anamvert pipeline.

137
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:14,680
The Anamvert pipeline can support tens of thousands of soft body polygons.

138
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,221
So this is kind of what this ends up looking like.

139
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:24,683
This is something that our artist Matthew simulated in Houdini and exported out of Maya.

140
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:26,504
This is actually taken from Maya.

141
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:31,825
But we were able to support 29,000 verts, which I thought was pretty awesome and impressive

142
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:33,966
for this next-gen shot.

143
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:37,107
And this AnimVert pipeline,

144
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:38,787
we sort of had a prototype version of it,

145
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,287
but we really fleshed this out

146
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,647
and finished it out for our trailer.

147
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,968
And we really gained some useful new technology

148
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,829
that we were able to leverage in other parts of the game.

149
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,729
So just a huge credit to our entire programming staff,

150
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:53,270
especially our animation programmers

151
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,111
who were able to help us flesh out this pipeline,

152
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:57,751
because I'm really just impressed

153
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:00,211
that we were able to pull this together for this trailer.

154
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,251
And then we also used paint vertex weights

155
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,672
to drive the burning edges of the sleeve.

156
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,513
So it was really important for us

157
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:09,793
when we were working on this shot

158
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:12,154
to have the audience reveal and understand

159
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:13,655
who Miles is while they're watching it.

160
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,676
So as the camera is moving,

161
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:18,497
you're not entirely sure who it is

162
00:09:18,497 --> 00:09:21,338
until the camera starts pulling up closer and closer

163
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:24,599
and you see, oh, at the end it's Miles.

164
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,379
It's who Miles is.

165
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,341
So what we did was we sort of used vertex color again here.

166
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:33,763
We just sort of painted using the red channel to drive that erosion.

167
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:36,785
So this is actually a GIF.

168
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:42,089
It moves pretty slowly because this shot took place over the course of a couple seconds.

169
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:47,232
But using that red channel, we're sort of able to erode out the simulated chunks.

170
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:54,655
And then also by using an additional color channel, in this case the green channel, we're able to erode out,

171
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:59,837
we're able to put that hot burning erosion edge in addition to eroding out the alpha.

172
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:05,338
So that's kind of how we were able to layer those together to create that soot burning up effect.

173
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:11,043
Next, I'd like to talk about that X-ray skin effect that Miles has.

174
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:19,591
So this is a sort of a rotating GIF of his arm meshes and it sort of highlights his bones

175
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,773
and tissue and viscera.

176
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:27,719
And these sort of reveal in that sequence, they kind of flash on at certain points.

177
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,482
And we drove this through something called Parallax Occlusion Maps.

178
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:38,346
But this was a really important part of expressing who Miles is as a character

179
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:42,748
through visual effects, because this is really a power that's coming from inside

180
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:47,551
of him. We thought it was important that, you know, the audience and the viewer be

181
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:49,092
able to see inside of him.

182
00:10:49,092 --> 00:10:49,352
So.

183
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:54,036
This is his skin texture that we use to drive those parallax occlusion maps.

184
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:58,160
This is sort of a current-gen technique. I'm sure many of you have used gray packs before.

185
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,666
I've also heard this called texture packing, but it's simply where you put different materials

186
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,929
inside of your red, green, and blue channels because you really only care about that

187
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,930
black and white information on those channels.

188
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:15,925
So basically, we use parallax occlusion mapping

189
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,688
for bones and veins.

190
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:19,271
That's essentially kind of like a height map

191
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,856
that doesn't displace the surface of an object.

192
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:22,978
We use it to fake depth.

193
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:27,705
It technically uses ray marching and it is expensive.

194
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:30,167
And it's sort of painted and authored like height maps.

195
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,769
But parallax occlusion maps, I mean,

196
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,950
you essentially want to use these any time

197
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,553
where you really want to get that sort of fake depth.

198
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:39,015
It's really good for kind of pushing downwards.

199
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,496
It's really good for craters,

200
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:42,238
but we kind of saw an opportunity here.

201
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:45,561
This was actually one of our artists, Jenna's ideas,

202
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:47,322
just to be able to use it to fake depth on a character.

203
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:50,525
So you can kind of see the inside of them.

204
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:59,656
So, at least when it comes to the material graph, the parallax occlusion maps are actually

205
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:02,597
these UV modifiers that go into the UV texture.

206
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:08,958
So you can kind of see here the parallax occlusion information is kind of going into that UV channel.

207
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,379
And you know, on the blue channel, we're using that blue channel texture to drive just some

208
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,040
of the cloudy noise inside of miles.

209
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,909
We're using the red channel to drive some of the squiggly veins inside of his arms and

210
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:23,275
then the green channel is the one that's primarily being used for his bones.

211
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,017
And then...

212
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:28,231
This is just another example of this.

213
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,174
We're using more parallax occlusion

214
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:34,317
to drive that squiggly look.

215
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,920
So we actually are using some UV translate in this as well,

216
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,123
so that as it's moving, you get some additional motion.

217
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:44,187
So you can see that UV parallax occlusion, UV modifier

218
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:48,331
feeding into the UV translate nodes on the bottom.

219
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:49,312
And this is a

220
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:55,261
you know, just a really useful technique to kind of get some additional motion into the depth

221
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:59,608
just by using some UV translate nodes to sort of get that additional motion.

222
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:04,657
Next, I kind of want to talk about Mega Venom Blast.

223
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:09,898
So this is sort of the penultimate venom power that Miles has.

224
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:13,279
And it was really important to us as we were working on this that it looked like the comic

225
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:13,859
books.

226
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:18,740
It's also biological in nature, so this is something that comes from inside of Miles.

227
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,021
This differentiates him from Peter Parker, who uses more technical gadgets.

228
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,442
It was important for us that it felt web-like.

229
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:29,343
So this is something that is Spider-Man's electricity.

230
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:32,484
This is not, you know, Electro's electricity.

231
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:35,846
This isn't the electricity of some other hero.

232
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,146
It also needs to work in 360 degrees.

233
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:41,468
So we really need to be able to see this mesh in gameplay.

234
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:47,590
And this is really the ultimate in Miles's powers and the expression of himself.

235
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,975
And it really needs to support our game pillar of an explosive new Spider-Man.

236
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:56,361
So this was one of my favorite pieces of art

237
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,223
of Mega Venom Blast from the Marvel Comics.

238
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:02,905
You can kind of see here it has that really nice sort of graphical look.

239
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:05,186
Spider-Man is just in the air.

240
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:08,728
And as he's letting this power out of himself,

241
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,289
it sort of explodes into this web shape.

242
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,310
And this was a really powerful image.

243
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,111
And, you know, it's really a challenge when you're looking at something like this.

244
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:21,013
It obviously works really well in the 2D sort of graphic state.

245
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,794
But, you know, the question we have to ask ourselves as real time effects artists

246
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:24,255
is, OK, well,

247
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,797
This is wonderful, I love looking at this.

248
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:29,920
How do I get this to translate into three dimensions?

249
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,184
So this was the one that we ended up having

250
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:35,685
in the end on our game.

251
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:38,248
As you can see, it goes out in 360 degrees.

252
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:42,051
We have a little electricity on miles

253
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:43,533
and then he jumps up in the air

254
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:45,174
and he does this mega venom blast.

255
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:47,116
It does have that kind of web shape to it.

256
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:55,321
We layer in a couple of different particle quads as well as this large venom mesh that we use to sort of drive that look.

257
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:58,282
So this is sort of what that looks like in our editor.

258
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:03,643
And as you can see, we use quads, sparks, we have an effects light on there.

259
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:07,204
I believe on the PlayStation 5 version that light is also a shadow caster.

260
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:12,766
We have all these elements sort of working together along with this 360 degree web mesh.

261
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,489
So when you look at the mesh by itself, when you isolate that,

262
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:20,892
this is really the heart of MegaVenom Blast and that explosion.

263
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:25,056
And it's driven by this mesh that we used,

264
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:28,439
and we found that we could use more vertices on next-gen especially.

265
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:32,402
But it's driven by this mesh, and it's driven by a material sort of coursing through it.

266
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:34,944
At the end of the day, I mean, it's a relatively simple technique,

267
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,707
but what makes it effective is that we have

268
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:40,469
more fidelity on this mesh than what we could have on previous generations.

269
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,451
So this is what that looks like in Maya.

270
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,273
This is just the mesh in question for Maya.

271
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:48,535
And really, we kind of fight on next generation platforms

272
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:51,897
that we can utilize meshes more thoroughly.

273
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,559
And I'm really hoping that for anyone looking at home,

274
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,521
you know, just wondering how can I push visual effects

275
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:57,181
for the next generation?

276
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,884
you know, you consider just using more meshes,

277
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:03,706
you can probably get more fidelity in your visuals that way.

278
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:05,928
The other benefit to building effects in this way

279
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:07,990
is that it also sort of minimizes overdraw.

280
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,612
So, you know, when you have more of this negative space

281
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:14,374
that's actually negative space and not, you know,

282
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,876
just alphaing out on materials,

283
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:18,778
it kind of saves performance in a different way.

284
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,359
I mean, it is more expensive on the vertices side,

285
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,481
but you're not really paying those overdraw costs

286
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,262
that you would pay if this was all quads.

287
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,175
Next, I want to talk about the venom sleeve.

288
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:34,616
So one of the things that we had to figure out was having electricity crawl down Miles'

289
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:34,916
arm.

290
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:39,257
This was, and it was really important that it felt biological, that it was kind of, you

291
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:42,058
know, inside of him, that it was coming from him.

292
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,918
So this is different from Peter's technical gadgets.

293
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:47,299
So Miles has his own Spider-Man.

294
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:53,000
He is sort of generating the power from within, whereas Peter Parker creates gadgets.

295
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:55,942
So we really had to ask ourselves,

296
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:58,484
how can we get this Venom electricity

297
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,066
that comes from within Miles Morales

298
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,807
working on all of his suits?

299
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:03,988
And how can we get it looking good?

300
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,270
Because one consideration with the Spider-Man games

301
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,871
is that the player can unlock different suits.

302
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:11,333
They all have different silhouettes

303
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,354
and different shapes to them.

304
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:15,056
So, you know, we really needed something

305
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:17,558
that would fit very, very closely,

306
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,959
you know, basically be inside of the mesh.

307
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,464
as well as give us that fidelity across different suits.

308
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:26,146
So I think this is one of my favorite examples

309
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,228
of the venom sleeve in action.

310
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:32,592
This is kind of right before that large reactor shot

311
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,314
that we already talked about.

312
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,176
But here, Miles is absorbing that reactor energy

313
00:17:36,176 --> 00:17:36,796
into himself.

314
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:43,302
and we also sort of use color storytelling in here. This was actually one of our artists,

315
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:49,487
Jenna's idea, but as Miles is taking this blue new form of electricity into himself, it changes

316
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:55,592
into yellow venom electricity as he can train, gets mastery over it. Some other details in here

317
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:58,794
that I really liked that we did, if you look closely at his rib cage, you might see

318
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:03,878
like a bit of a silhouette of a rib cage in there. Also his skin is kind of flashing again

319
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:08,601
with some parallax occlusion. You can kind of see hints at his skull just to sort of give that

320
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:15,205
feeling of you know this is really affecting him and this is a really big moment in the

321
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:20,088
narrative as his moment of sacrifice. So the way that we sort of did the venom sleeve

322
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:26,261
We created this mesh that goes over all of Spider-Man's suits.

323
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,923
So it's something that our character team ended up

324
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:30,944
modeling and skinning and implementing

325
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,206
on all of the different suits.

326
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,168
Then we just sort of had a universal texture

327
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:38,330
that a material set with different wipes

328
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,433
is sort of applied to all of those same meshes.

329
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,115
We also worked with our gameplay team

330
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:46,817
so that this suit isn't technically on.

331
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:52,585
all the time, mostly because we found that it got expensive to have all that alpha on the character at all times.

332
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:57,532
So our gameplay team very carefully, cleverly put this into look groups so that

333
00:18:57,532 --> 00:19:00,997
we were able to turn this on when we needed to and turned it off when we didn't need it.

334
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:06,119
This is kind of similar to the Parallax Occlusion maps

335
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,260
with like the bones and the viscera.

336
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,521
We use a gray pack texture here to drive the different veins

337
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,202
for the Venom Sleeve reveal.

338
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:16,344
So that was just really beneficial

339
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:19,845
because as this was a cross-platform title,

340
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:21,226
we found that texture memory

341
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,148
is still a concern on PS4 especially.

342
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:26,389
But this was still a useful technique on PS5 as well.

343
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,392
So we basically split those different visceral channels out

344
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:36,516
into, you know, we use our red, green, and blue channels separately.

345
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:39,698
You know, and here we have the mirrored texture

346
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:43,681
kind of being split, and we can sort of select the left and the right side of it.

347
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:47,403
And then here are sort of the controls that sort of drive that

348
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:51,486
wipe. The progression node in the bottom left, that's sort of the main

349
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:55,409
driver that we use most of the time for driving this

350
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:56,450
reveal over time.

351
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,494
It's supposed to be a gameplay team who has control over how fast or slow that needs to be,

352
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,976
depending on when and where we're using it.

353
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:10,619
We also have some additional knobs in here for some key moments where we need to tweak the speed of Venom.

354
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:16,975
So another thing that we did within the venom sleeve that we found to be very beneficial

355
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:21,477
was using a displacement, just a little bit of displacement to prevent clipping.

356
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:26,820
So that was kind of helpful to ensure that the sleeve works on all of Miles' suits.

357
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,322
So anytime he bends his elbow or deforms his shoulder,

358
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:34,024
by offsetting a little bit in the material and by pushing it a little bit toward the camera,

359
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:39,147
we're really able to prevent any clipping and to make sure that this is properly visible at all

360
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:44,051
times. Another place where this is useful is also in the fingers, just because there might be a lot

361
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:49,514
of clipping there. All right, so thanks for talking to me with me about Venom powers. Now we're going

362
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:54,658
to move on to camouflage and invisibility, which is another one of Miles's key powers.

363
00:20:54,658 --> 00:21:00,702
So this is an early piece of concept art. This kind of shows Miles turning invisible.

364
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:03,124
So there's a lot of things in here that we ended up...

365
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:06,866
using in the final version of Camouflage.

366
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,627
Things like the fact that he's tinted a little bit blue,

367
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:12,549
he's invisible, of course, he has a fresnel on him,

368
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:15,910
he has the chromatic aberration inside of his body.

369
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,451
We didn't end up using everything in here.

370
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:19,752
We didn't make the enemies red,

371
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,833
we didn't really do a full screen effect,

372
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,994
like what's in this concept.

373
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,835
But a lot of these early ideas

374
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:26,676
did end up making it into the game.

375
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:29,916
And this is the in-game version.

376
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,377
So this is sort of where Miles turns fully invisible.

377
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:35,357
And this basically took us three different materials

378
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:36,238
to pull off.

379
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:39,218
The chromatic aberration that was in that earlier concept

380
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:41,119
is something that you can also see here.

381
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,619
So you can really see that the green and the red channels,

382
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:45,119
especially if you look at the windows

383
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,080
and the distance through Miles,

384
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,080
you can really kind of see that those are a little bit offset

385
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,300
from each other.

386
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,921
And you can also kind of see that a bit on the snow

387
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:54,021
through his legs,

388
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,701
but I think it's most prominent on those windows.

389
00:21:56,242 --> 00:22:00,545
There's also that transition, so he kind of starts fully opaque,

390
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:05,228
and he sort of gets that kind of like patchwork transition where he turns invisible.

391
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:10,592
So the way that we sort of pulled this effect off, we used some things called precomposite

392
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:16,336
and postcomposite materials to drive that transition. Precomposite materials are materials

393
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:21,120
that erode out of mesh, so these sort of tell the pixels to not be drawn. And those are applied,

394
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,562
like if you think about your render order, those are applied basically before the materials are

395
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:24,902
drawn.

396
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:30,046
The post composites are materials that apply after the main material is drawn.

397
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:35,410
So the post composites are materials that basically in the render order we draw everything

398
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,991
we put the post composites on after.

399
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:40,293
So that's how you can kind of think about pre's before post is after.

400
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,634
That's why they're called pre and post composites.

401
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:45,175
In general, these materials are really useful

402
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:48,296
because we can apply them over entire meshes

403
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:50,276
without them being material overrides.

404
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:51,176
So they're reusable.

405
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:53,537
We can put them on all sorts of objects in the game.

406
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:57,318
You know, they're something that we utilize a lot

407
00:22:57,318 --> 00:22:58,538
in our workflows.

408
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:00,058
And the camouflage effect,

409
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:03,259
it required both a pre and post composite shader

410
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,839
where after the transition is complete,

411
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,920
then we go to a complete material swap

412
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,520
and take a sip of water.

413
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:16,114
So this is the precomposite material.

414
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:20,038
You can kind of see the alpha erodes out.

415
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:23,661
It erodes out the mesh before the pixels are fully drawn.

416
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:27,083
So with the precomposite, this is sort of a yes, no,

417
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,846
is there, is not there kind of setup.

418
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:31,867
We don't really have like a shades of gray width

419
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:34,189
and that's just sort of because of where it sort of comes

420
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:35,590
in the material rendering order.

421
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,393
However, it's still really useful for cases like this

422
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:40,975
where we want to fully erode out somebody.

423
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:44,567
This was the post-composite material.

424
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:49,694
You'll notice that the erosion pattern on it, this mirrors the erosion pattern in the

425
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,636
pre-composite material.

426
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:54,842
So they're basically the same except the post-composite is inverse.

427
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:59,027
So as the pre-composite erodes out, the post-composite erodes in.

428
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:06,039
And it contains similar shading information to the main shader that has that chromatic aberration in it.

429
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,581
You know, it's blue, it has that fresnel.

430
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,584
The math is basically the same between those two,

431
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:12,748
except the post-composite also has that erosion information

432
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:16,854
because it's used for that transition between the solid and the invisible state.

433
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:22,537
Once the erosion is complete, we do a swap at that point for the main invisibility shader.

434
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:28,700
And the reason why we do that is because having the pre and post composite shaders is more expensive.

435
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,962
If you do that whole material swap, that ends up being cheaper, and that was more performant.

436
00:24:32,962 --> 00:24:37,644
And because this was a cross-generation title especially, we needed to make sure that it ran in frame on the PS4.

437
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:41,186
And then this basically...

438
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,948
applies over the pre-composite when you do that swap.

439
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:50,232
It allows for the illusion where milestones are visible while also having solid parts.

440
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:51,853
So when we set this up,

441
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:54,776
our gameplay programming team is wonderful.

442
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:57,337
They set up these configs for us so that we can

443
00:24:57,337 --> 00:25:00,740
implement our effects into the game using them.

444
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,162
So we did need some help

445
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:05,443
from our friendly neighborhood programmers to make this happen.

446
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:09,308
And then, oh yeah, chromatic aberration.

447
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:15,313
So the chromatic aberration is really driven by offsetting the red and the green channels

448
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,694
from each other on the frame buffer.

449
00:25:16,694 --> 00:25:18,615
So you can kind of see we have two frame grabs there.

450
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:22,458
They're eventually being combined into one where the red is being combined separately

451
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:23,899
from the green and blue of the other.

452
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:32,885
frame buffer. And then, you know, earlier on in the math, we're just offsetting one of them

453
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:38,569
by like 0.01 and we're offsetting the other by negative 0.01. So those offsets are just a little

454
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:43,553
bit, you only really need a little bit, and then that ends up being combined in the end to create

455
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:44,553
some chromatic aberration.

456
00:25:45,582 --> 00:25:52,901
So we also found as we were working on camouflage that we needed some special one-off variants.

457
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,625
So there were really some...

458
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:58,959
cases in the game where Miles had these emotional beats,

459
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:04,902
and originally we didn't set up camo to really have any other timing except for that zero to one.

460
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:09,364
However, we really wanted to make sure that we were including these moments

461
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:11,865
using visual effects to sort of help the player understand

462
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:16,627
times where Miles was doubting himself or when he was scared or when he wanted to hide.

463
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:20,961
And this required a few custom setups to make it happen,

464
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:25,545
but it was totally worth it to help Miles become his own explosive new Spider-Man.

465
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:30,569
So one such example, this is actually the first time that we see camouflage in-game.

466
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:33,091
In this moment, Miles is threatened by Roxxon forces,

467
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,816
and we had to slow down the camouflage transition to really make this feed feel good.

468
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:41,279
So the transition is usually about a second long.

469
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,541
And it's basically that zero to one parameter material

470
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,022
we just talked about.

471
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:49,544
But our programming team exposed some knobs for us

472
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:53,227
in the cinematic so that we were able to really slow this down.

473
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:54,988
And I love showing this beat too,

474
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,990
because especially when the camera is looking right

475
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,771
through miles at those ROXON officers,

476
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:04,334
you can really see that chromatic aberration there.

477
00:27:06,021 --> 00:27:11,086
Another time where we had to do this was this moment where Miles, this is right after the

478
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:15,732
bridge explodes, and he doubts himself as Spider-Man and he's not really able to control

479
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:18,855
his camo powers, so his hand by itself turns invisible.

480
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:25,883
And in order to get this beat, the camo ability was sort of designed to go over all...

481
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:30,647
of the character. It wasn't really designed to go on one part of the character. So our character

482
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:36,271
team sort of split that hand off to be its own mesh. And then we made a custom material, so the

483
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:40,714
pre-composite material is really only eroding out his fingers. And this was really nice because it

484
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:46,398
kind of gave Miles that moment where, you know, he's able to question himself before realizing

485
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,760
that, yes, I am Spider-Man and I can do this.

486
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:55,406
This was another camouflage beat that we did where Miles tries to disappear.

487
00:27:55,406 --> 00:28:02,050
This is right after he's captured and the Roxxon guards are hitting him.

488
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,071
And we had to speed up camo in this beat.

489
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:07,993
We had to make it really fast just so he could try to go invisible and then he'd get hit

490
00:28:07,993 --> 00:28:10,474
and then he would come out of it.

491
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:15,176
And this is sort of building up right to the moment before we do our first mega venom blast.

492
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:17,978
So it was a really fun beat to work on.

493
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,819
All right, next we're going to talk about creating spectacle.

494
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:23,801
So Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales

495
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:27,125
is a game that really requires intensive spectacle beats

496
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,128
so that Miles can demonstrate his heroic abilities.

497
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:31,850
So one of the challenges that we asked ourselves

498
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,332
while we were working on this was,

499
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:35,154
how do we up this for a new generation

500
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:37,256
for what we accomplished in Marvel's Spider-Man?

501
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:42,759
One of the solutions to that was coming up with a new simulation pipeline.

502
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:49,242
So, AnimChunk is our new rigid body pipeline, and we developed it to replace the previous pipeline we had in Marvel's Spider-Man.

503
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:54,904
This new pipeline that we developed, thanks to the fantastic work of our core team,

504
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:57,966
it allows us to get in high-quality large-scale simulations more quickly.

505
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:03,490
And a large part of why we developed this is because spectacle is overall very important to the game.

506
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:10,257
So a really good example of this new pipeline comes in from our bridge trailer and also our bridge mission.

507
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:14,721
So this particular sequence is in the bridge mission.

508
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:19,185
It's when the bridge kind of comes down and miles in this sequence is

509
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:23,686
It's really sort of a moment where he develops himself as a hero.

510
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:29,827
And this particular simulation, this had over 250,000 vertices.

511
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:32,628
And I was really proud of our art team for working on this,

512
00:29:32,628 --> 00:29:37,469
including Matthew Bennett, Jin Choi, and Alex Heligo.

513
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:41,470
They were able to really push the next-gen fidelity and spectacle on this.

514
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,751
Next, we're going to talk about one of the simulations that we did for our Winter Break mission.

515
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,832
This is actually the opening mission to the game.

516
00:29:49,612 --> 00:29:54,875
This particular sequence was a really good example of using both of our new simulation pipelines.

517
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:59,677
So this includes both the rigid body atom chunk pipeline that we just talked about,

518
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:03,339
as well as our soft body atom vert pipeline.

519
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:10,003
So the soft body can really be seen on the streamers that fall down from this happy holiday sign,

520
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:15,706
as well as the atom vert can really be kind of seen on those chunks of the sign as it comes down.

521
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:22,248
One thing that was really great about this sequence was that we were able to push the

522
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:29,111
fidelity in terms of sparks and debris particulate coming out in this sequence.

523
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:35,424
on the PlayStation 5 even more so than we could on the PlayStation 4.

524
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:39,508
And this was a kind of a really great place where we were able to really leverage that hardware

525
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:46,354
in terms of creating that spectacle. And then another sequence that I thought was really great

526
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:49,998
that we were able to really push for next gen is a sequence where this power plant explodes.

527
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:56,622
The next-gen hardware afforded us the ability to have more particles, as well as shadow

528
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:57,442
casting lights.

529
00:30:57,442 --> 00:31:01,524
If you look at some of the lights on these explosions on the ground, especially in this

530
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:04,566
part right here, it really added a lot of drama.

531
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:07,908
And the next-generation hardware was a place where we could really allow that to shine.

532
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:17,236
Next, I'm going to talk about Programmable Matter, which is essentially the energy weapons

533
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:20,739
that Miles' nemeses, the Underground, use in their game.

534
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:25,605
So with Programmable Matter, Miles Morales, as a hero, we kind of needed to give him a

535
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:29,369
really new enemy in order to complement him as an explosive new Spider-Man.

536
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,493
So this is where the Tinker and the Underground come in.

537
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:37,501
They used nanoparticle-driven weapon tech called programmable matter in the game.

538
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:41,167
And of course, we as VFX artists had to come up with a solution for that.

539
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:45,742
So we had to come up with new and different effects systems to be able to support this,

540
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:49,365
to make it unique and different from what we accomplished in the original Marvel's Spider-Man.

541
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:55,089
So one of the first things that we did when we were working on programmable matter was come up

542
00:31:55,089 --> 00:32:00,374
with a list of rules for it, so that we sort of understood what it was and how it worked.

543
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:04,097
So we decided that programmable matter required nanotech printing.

544
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:09,300
It formed an internal lattice, so it had a support structure inside of it as it printed.

545
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:15,864
It was always printed from a source, so this never came from the air, it wasn't magical,

546
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:20,607
it was always something that was tangible and came from a specific place.

547
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:26,730
It is technically a metal, so programmable matter, it is metallic, it's not plastic,

548
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,192
it has metallic properties to it.

549
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:34,276
And it's always created by Finn Mason, who's the tinkerer in our game.

550
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:38,979
So this was an early pre-visualization of programmable matter that we did to sort of

551
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:41,501
help us cement what this looked like.

552
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,403
And originally, programmable matter was green.

553
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:47,486
Of course, we ended up changing the colors while we were working on it.

554
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:50,909
But this kind of demonstrates some of those early principles that we came up with.

555
00:32:51,689 --> 00:32:57,450
for this. So you can kind of see it, it comes from a source, it creates an internal support structure as it prints.

556
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:05,572
You can kind of see the particulate sort of spread over it as it comes into its final shape.

557
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:11,933
And this was a really kind of a great guiding pre-visualization for us as we work to translate this into real time.

558
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:16,153
One thing that we wanted to leverage when we were working with this was GPU particles,

559
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:19,674
which is something that we didn't have on the original Marvel's Spider-Man.

560
00:33:20,914 --> 00:33:24,515
So this is kind of what we had in game in the end.

561
00:33:24,515 --> 00:33:30,376
So you can kind of see that a lot of that original pre-visualization made it into the game.

562
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:35,897
So we do have that internal structure that kind of prints using a material graph

563
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:41,598
that is followed by support struts on the inside, which kind of prints the skin on top.

564
00:33:41,598 --> 00:33:46,199
We leverage a lot of GPU particles with a little bit of noise on them to kind of help.

565
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:48,460
fill everything in at the end.

566
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,323
And then, of course, we also use particle lights

567
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:54,284
just to sort of make sure that everything kind of ties

568
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,346
into the scene correctly.

569
00:33:56,346 --> 00:34:04,751
So the inside of the programmable ladder lattice

570
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,794
is controlled sort of like a material wipe.

571
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:11,556
This is driven much like we drove our sleeves.

572
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,517
So this is driven with a wipe that

573
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,699
is controlled by vertex colors defined in Maya.

574
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,961
And we use a lot more geometry for detail.

575
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:23,344
So one big thing about next gen is that, you know, you can use more vertices

576
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:27,686
and leveraging vertex wipes really allows you that precision to kind of give you

577
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:31,809
that really controlled sort of look you're looking for, especially in

578
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:35,531
any kind of cinematic beat where you really want to have control over that.

579
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:41,671
The inside of these lattice models also contained an additional mesh.

580
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:48,634
So these were sort of the interior lattices that went inside of each of those segments

581
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:52,917
as they sort of snapped into place. And we use this in the cinematic as well as the gameplay

582
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:57,599
versions. So a lot of segments are sort of driven with the same sort of technique where you have

583
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,621
the vertex colors controlling a precise wipe.

584
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:04,546
And then when it comes to timing that,

585
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:06,748
this is just sort of a custom input value.

586
00:35:06,748 --> 00:35:09,411
So we have the x in that custom input node.

587
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:11,833
That is something that is exposed to us

588
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,336
and that we can manipulate and control and keyframe

589
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:16,218
in the particle editor.

590
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:20,462
So we use custom input values quite a bit while we work,

591
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:22,464
because it gives us more precise control

592
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:24,366
over the timing of when those come online.

593
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:29,003
Another thing that we used quite a bit was GPU particles.

594
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:32,827
So a lot of the underground attacks are driven by GPU particles.

595
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:36,951
So you can kind of see, this is the gauntlet enemy's AoE impact.

596
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:41,134
When the enemy hits the ground, it creates this awesome shape.

597
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:44,377
They actually destroy their programmable matter technology as they do this.

598
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:51,620
So GBA particles were new to Miles Morales since we had a CPU driven system only in the first Marvel Spider-Man.

599
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,622
So because this was new technology, we really wanted, well new to our game engine,

600
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:59,583
because it's something we hadn't had previously.

601
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:03,805
We leveraged it heavily when it comes to the underground attacks.

602
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:10,015
And we use them to help Parabola Matter feel more threatening and unique and different.

603
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:13,497
So this is the main gauntlet enemy attack.

604
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:17,020
You can kind of see that he jumps up in the air and he punches the ground.

605
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:22,584
He breaks his gauntlet mesh and he reprints it using one of those detailed material wipes.

606
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:29,068
And another thing that we used in here, if you look at this you can kind of see that it has a mesh that distorts

607
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:33,011
and it creates some really awesome looking shapes as it...

608
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:41,418
spreads out as a shockwave. And it's really using GPU particles in this instance helped to make it

609
00:36:41,418 --> 00:36:46,722
feel a lot more unique versus what we had in our previous game. Next I want to talk about webs.

610
00:36:46,722 --> 00:36:50,785
You can't really have Spider-Man without webs, so I thought it would be important to talk about that.

611
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:55,368
So with webs, webs are one of the things that make Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

612
00:36:55,368 --> 00:36:58,851
Peter and Miles share webs, and we didn't really change these much from Marvel's Spider-Man.

613
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:02,438
However, it's still kind of worth reviewing how we did it.

614
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:05,061
Webs are a team effort between VFX and many other departments,

615
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:08,806
including animation, rigging, rendering, and gameplay.

616
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:11,369
And it's one of the things that we get asked about the most.

617
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:13,952
So I wanted to make sure that I included it in this talk.

618
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:16,314
So the first thing I want to talk about

619
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:17,576
are the traversal webs.

620
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:18,657
So these are the webs that

621
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,019
Miles uses when he's swinging across the city.

622
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:26,422
So you can kind of see here, this is in the bridge mission where he's swinging around.

623
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:31,945
It's basically just those web lines that he uses to get all over the place.

624
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:36,548
These are basically splines. They're programmatic in nature.

625
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:42,270
On the effects team, what we do is we control the shader material that goes over the webs,

626
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,531
as well as the web knots that are placed over the spline.

627
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:51,073
So with the traversal webs, the knots are basically meshes that are placed procedurally

628
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:53,654
across that spline.

629
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:56,194
And then the webline itself is programmatic.

630
00:37:56,194 --> 00:38:01,296
So we didn't really adjust this much from Marvel's Spider-Man, but I still think it's

631
00:38:01,296 --> 00:38:02,817
a pretty cool system and worth talking about.

632
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:07,100
Another web system I wanted to talk about are the web jackets.

633
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,061
So these are webs that the players can put on enemies during gameplay.

634
00:38:11,061 --> 00:38:12,882
They serve a function in gameplay.

635
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:15,403
They allow the player to immobilize enemies.

636
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:20,445
And essentially because they are webs, they do need to be skin tight to fit over the character.

637
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:24,586
So with these kinds of webs, we have face webs as well as the body webs.

638
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:29,208
Each of these kinds of webs are skinned in Maya to each character model.

639
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,909
So we have to get that character in the proper bind pose,

640
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:36,150
and then we create layers of meshes over it.

641
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:41,672
We do have our meshes set up in such a way that they play nicely with the UVs and materials

642
00:38:41,672 --> 00:38:43,253
in our engine for webs.

643
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:47,814
And the materials for the webs, they basically drive the terrain and the appearance.

644
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:50,275
So when these go on and off, they kind of erode in and out.

645
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:52,374
A lot of that is material-driven.

646
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:56,778
Next, I wanted to talk about the Stick Stuff Together web.

647
00:38:56,778 --> 00:38:59,520
So these are the web cones and web tunnels.

648
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,241
You can kind of see them here where

649
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:05,023
Miles is trying to stop this bus from going over the bridge.

650
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:08,125
He places a number of web tunnels on the bus.

651
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,826
And these are, we kind of call them Stick Stuff Together

652
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:13,428
webs, but they're really sort of a collaborative effort

653
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:14,749
between departments.

654
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:17,550
When we create these, they're modeled in Maya

655
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,232
using a custom tool set up for creating them.

656
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,994
And the materials are then applied in engine to these.

657
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:27,717
And after that, they're rigged and animated

658
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:30,459
by our tech animation and animation department.

659
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:32,541
So on the effects side, a lot of what we do

660
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,604
is mostly just generating the initial meshes

661
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:38,607
and then we'll generate the materials that go with it.

662
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:41,089
However, when it comes to controlling them

663
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,330
and animating them and placing them,

664
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,393
a lot of that is done by our animation team.

665
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:46,854
And webs are really a team effort.

666
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,213
So something that I thought was really important to touch on

667
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:54,214
in this talk was accessibility.

668
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:55,995
Accessibility was very important for us

669
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:57,376
for Next Generation.

670
00:39:57,376 --> 00:40:00,137
And at Insomnia Games, we had a really big push

671
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:02,097
to create the most accessible game possible.

672
00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:04,118
So many departments, including visual effects,

673
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:06,459
decided to pitch in and see what we could do

674
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:08,700
to make this game one of the most accessible games

675
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,340
we've ever made.

676
00:40:10,692 --> 00:40:13,935
So we had this philosophy of anyone can wear the mask.

677
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:16,938
Basically, we thought anyone should be able to be Spider-Man.

678
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:21,061
And we wanted as many players as possible to enjoy that fantasy of being Spider-Man.

679
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:25,425
So released within the effects team, we sort of drove what we called contrast

680
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,107
features in Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales.

681
00:40:28,107 --> 00:40:31,250
And we found that we could have a really big impact on the game in this way.

682
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,972
And I'll get into what contrast features are in a second.

683
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:37,697
One of the things that we created for this was the high contrast background.

684
00:40:37,697 --> 00:40:40,740
So that is designed to help low vision players enjoy our game.

685
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,386
This is essentially a full screen quad that we put over the screen that desaturates the world.

686
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:51,494
And then after we desaturate the world, we'll flag relevant effects for combat to draw on top of that full screen quad.

687
00:40:52,295 --> 00:41:00,044
And we'll also add high contrast shaders to enemies and combatants and relevant objects to gameplay in order to help them stand out.

688
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:02,046
And this is kind of what that looks like in action.

689
00:41:02,046 --> 00:41:06,431
This is, you can kind of see the skybox is darkened, the enemies get bright shaders.

690
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:15,247
relevant effects to the combat, drawn on top of that background. So this is a really beneficial

691
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:21,933
mode for anybody who has vision issues, anybody that might have cognitive issues. They might

692
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:26,477
benefit from this because it basically reduces visual clutter and visual noise and it tells the

693
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:26,817
player...

694
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:33,000
you know, what is important for them in combat. And we found that this was very helpful for a

695
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,181
variety of players. And part of why this is so important, I'm going to get a little personal

696
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:44,424
with this, but this is a video from the original Marvel's Spider-Man, and this is the Fisk boss

697
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:45,624
fight. So this is the first.

698
00:41:46,164 --> 00:41:47,885
boss fight in that game.

699
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:51,106
And my fiance is a low vision player.

700
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:54,648
And when he played through this segment of the game, when I went to watch him

701
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:58,129
play it at home, he was unable to get through this segment of the boss fight.

702
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:03,352
And the reason for that was because he was unable to tell the difference

703
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:04,692
between the boss and the ads.

704
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:09,515
And looking at this as a visual effects artist, I know this is a problem that we can solve,

705
00:42:09,515 --> 00:42:14,939
especially as a real-time effects community. I think that it's something that pretty much

706
00:42:14,939 --> 00:42:22,043
anybody could come up with a solution for. So the solution that, well, this is just sort of

707
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:27,667
a simulation of what that low vision looks like. So this is actually a simulation I did of my

708
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:31,149
fiancé's sight. So he's losing some of his central vision.

709
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:35,991
So for a low vision player, you can imagine it's very frustrating when you're playing in a fight like this.

710
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:40,132
You're not able to really tell who's the boss and who the adds are.

711
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:44,414
But thanks to the contrast features that we added to Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales,

712
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:49,936
my fiancé, I'm glad to report, was able to play through that game entirely by himself without assistance.

713
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:52,877
And part of that was because of these contrast features that we added.

714
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:58,341
And at least for me personally, I think this is probably one of the things that I thought was the

715
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:03,526
coolest part of creating a next generation title, was really thinking holistically about game

716
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:08,170
development and thinking about ways that we can make games more accessible than ever to new players.

717
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,112
And honestly, this is probably one of the things I'm most proud of.

718
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:18,358
So one of the tricks that we did for the high contrast background was basically making the

719
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:22,580
skybox really dark. So in order to detect the skybox so that you can color it something other

720
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,183
than skybox colored, you just have to compare the depth buffer to the far clip value and you can

721
00:43:27,183 --> 00:43:31,966
just do a lerp really easy. That darkens the skybox while keeping the foreground intact.

722
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:37,169
So another thing that we did for this title was develop contrast shaders.

723
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:41,352
So the contrast shaders are designed to be bright and easy to spot for low vision players.

724
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:49,116
They're also customizable, so players can select different colors for ranged enemies versus melee enemies versus bosses.

725
00:43:49,116 --> 00:43:53,678
And it's really important to us, at least for our game, that players are able to distinguish those.

726
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:57,060
Of course, everybody might have a different solution for their own titles.

727
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,561
It worked for us in Spider-Man.

728
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:01,602
might not work for every game out there.

729
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:03,784
So hopefully you can kind of look at this

730
00:44:03,784 --> 00:44:06,025
and think about ways that you could develop a similar mode

731
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:08,066
for your own game.

732
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:10,447
So the contrast shaders are sort of set up in a config file.

733
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,809
And this is driven by our gameplay team,

734
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:15,290
who is wonderful and set this up for us.

735
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:19,632
And this ties into our UI for easy player customization.

736
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:22,474
It was really important for us that the players

737
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:24,835
were able to pick different colors

738
00:44:24,835 --> 00:44:26,256
and customize their experience.

739
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:31,572
So lastly, I'm going to talk about some of the challenges we encountered for the new generation

740
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:34,855
and some of the takeaways and learnings that we had.

741
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:41,821
So some of the challenges that we faced with this title was that Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales

742
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:46,064
really needed to be a next-gen title while also at the same time being a cross-platform title.

743
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:47,205
It had to release on the PS4, too.

744
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:51,709
So one of the challenges we had was how can we make a game perform on PS4

745
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:54,151
while still finding ways to push next-gen quality?

746
00:44:54,712 --> 00:45:00,876
One of the solutions that we came up with that was, I think, really helpful was that within our internal editor,

747
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:04,878
we basically set it up so that we could split some of the particle emitters per platform.

748
00:45:04,878 --> 00:45:10,402
So in this example, this is actually a smoke emitter, and the smoke emitter is flagged to be PS5 only,

749
00:45:10,402 --> 00:45:15,626
and that's because we wanted this particular smoke to cast shadows, and it's disabled on the PS4.

750
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:21,209
And there is a similar PS4-only emitter within this effects package that doesn't have shadows on it.

751
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:27,335
So this was a great solution for us to be cost effective in terms of not needing to re-implement

752
00:45:27,335 --> 00:45:29,116
some of these emitters multiple times.

753
00:45:29,116 --> 00:45:33,960
And it really helped us out in terms of delivering that next-gen quality.

754
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,025
So with this system, with the PS4, PS5 emitters, it allowed us to selectively add a bunch of

755
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:43,689
particle upgrades for the PS5 that might have been unperforming on the PS4.

756
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,134
Some of those included making more of our particles lit.

757
00:45:47,134 --> 00:45:50,098
We were able to afford more particle lighting

758
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:53,303
on this generation, which definitely added more drama

759
00:45:53,303 --> 00:45:54,685
to our effects.

760
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,409
More shadow casting particles, so those large columns of steam,

761
00:45:57,409 --> 00:45:59,572
we were able to have those cast shadows.

762
00:46:00,472 --> 00:46:02,713
We were also able to have more shadow casting particle lights.

763
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:09,858
So those are for instances when you want to have a light inside of an effects package that casts a shadow.

764
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:13,941
We could afford more of those and switch between the PS4 and the PS5.

765
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,183
We were able to afford denser smoke and fires.

766
00:46:16,183 --> 00:46:19,245
So, you know, in order to get things performing on the PS4,

767
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:22,868
sometimes we couldn't afford quite as many embers or smoke as we wanted to,

768
00:46:22,868 --> 00:46:24,569
whereas on the PS5 we could afford more.

769
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:27,111
So we leveraged that system in those cases.

770
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:30,458
And we can also afford more GPU particles in some instances,

771
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:31,664
which was wonderful.

772
00:46:32,806 --> 00:46:34,667
Some other limitations that we ran into,

773
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:38,649
the PS4 had more memory limits compared to PS5.

774
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:40,691
Part of that meant that simulations had to be smaller

775
00:46:40,691 --> 00:46:42,892
for the PlayStation 4, unfortunately.

776
00:46:42,892 --> 00:46:45,954
We were able to afford more on the PlayStation 5.

777
00:46:45,954 --> 00:46:48,456
Text to memory was more of a concern on the PlayStation 4,

778
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:52,439
so we were limited to how many smoke maps we could use

779
00:46:52,439 --> 00:46:55,661
on that console versus how many variety of maps

780
00:46:55,661 --> 00:46:57,282
we could use on the PlayStation 5.

781
00:46:58,102 --> 00:47:01,165
Loading times were also something we had to be mindful of.

782
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:03,767
So the PlayStation 5's solid state drive

783
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:05,829
meant that we were able to load scenes very fast.

784
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:08,631
Unfortunately on the PlayStation 4,

785
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:11,994
we had to preload in simulations a little bit earlier

786
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:14,396
just so that we could have that play correctly on time.

787
00:47:15,688 --> 00:47:20,712
Some other findings, the PlayStation 5, it had more memory in the solid-state drive,

788
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:24,375
so that was a huge advantage. So we were able to load in our simulations very quickly on that platform.

789
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:30,160
The GPU, it definitely needed more space for ray tracing. So one finding was that although we could

790
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,264
afford a little more GPU particles, that didn't mean that we could go crazy, right? You know,

791
00:47:34,264 --> 00:47:41,029
just because we have a great new hardware doesn't necessarily mean that we can, you know, go to 11

792
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:42,210
with GPU particles.

793
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,847
We also found that we still need to watch overdraw on next-gen,

794
00:47:45,847 --> 00:47:48,632
so alpha and overdraw is still going to be expensive.

795
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:52,621
That's one of the reasons why leveraging meshes with negative space worked out so well for us.

796
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:58,566
And one of the big wins was that we could afford more vertices on the PlayStation 5

797
00:47:58,566 --> 00:47:59,606
versus the PlayStation 4.

798
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:03,728
And that was a huge benefit that we definitely leveraged.

799
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:07,269
And that allowed us to use more meshes where it made sense.

800
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:09,690
However, we still had to be careful to watch vertex density.

801
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:15,252
So whenever we had really small splashes, we couldn't put 10,000 verts on something like that.

802
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:20,593
We still had to be somewhat mindful of how dense the vertices got.

803
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:28,168
So some general learnings from working on this project, just the non-technical learnings.

804
00:48:28,168 --> 00:48:33,171
The ambition of NextGen was a little nerve-wracking, but one of the big takeaways for me was that

805
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:37,333
you can't create great things if you don't try, and it's definitely okay to be a little

806
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,213
nervous.

807
00:48:38,213 --> 00:48:42,415
When you're feeling a little nervous, it means that you're on the right track and you're

808
00:48:42,415 --> 00:48:44,756
going outside of your comfort zone and making something wonderful.

809
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:51,386
An example of this is when we had to build our Annenverte pipeline to make that reveal shot a reality.

810
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:56,472
Because the simulation, it was really important that we saw the fabric tear away so we could reveal who Miles was.

811
00:48:56,472 --> 00:49:02,539
And if we hadn't really taken that leap of faith, I don't think we would have made a shot as great as that shot was.

812
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,003
And we wouldn't have developed this wonderful new pipeline that we can use in our engine.

813
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:11,008
We also took a chance on accessibility features, and we delivered a much more accessible game.

814
00:49:11,008 --> 00:49:16,252
So one thing that was really wonderful working on this title is that, you know, I didn't really go

815
00:49:16,252 --> 00:49:19,455
into this title thinking that, you know, it was going to be the most accessible game ever, but

816
00:49:19,455 --> 00:49:23,598
the more passionate we got about it, the more excited we got about accessibility,

817
00:49:23,598 --> 00:49:28,262
and the more the studio rallied behind creating the most accessible game we could.

818
00:49:28,262 --> 00:49:31,245
I feel like we really kind of pulled together and made something great.

819
00:49:31,765 --> 00:49:35,908
And it was really personally satisfying to see someone I care about be able to play through

820
00:49:35,908 --> 00:49:40,852
the game from start to finish by himself, even though he is a low vision player.

821
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:45,775
And one of the benefits of this too is that we found all kinds of players, not necessarily

822
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,137
just low vision ones, benefited from the contrast options.

823
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:52,375
We were also able to give Miles his own unique powers that were different from Peter's through

824
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:57,182
visual effects. So it was really wonderful to be able to tell that story and to tell that narrative

825
00:49:57,182 --> 00:50:01,588
of Miles becoming his own hero and Miles having his own experiences through visuals.

826
00:50:03,306 --> 00:50:08,169
Some other additional learnings, when working on new hardware, old techniques can be leveraged

827
00:50:08,169 --> 00:50:09,990
in new ways.

828
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:15,594
So using vertex blending with detailed color usage to drive material transitions.

829
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:19,596
So we were able to leverage more vertices and that was kind of new, but vertex painting,

830
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:24,099
I mean that's kind of an old technique, but blending the old with the new was kind of

831
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:25,920
a big discovery on this project.

832
00:50:26,807 --> 00:50:29,810
I also learned that it's really important to thank your programming team for

833
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:33,573
all the amazing work that they do to enable you to push toward a new generation

834
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:34,133
of greatness.

835
00:50:34,133 --> 00:50:37,315
So a lot of what we did and what we covered in this talk wouldn't have been

836
00:50:37,315 --> 00:50:39,497
possible without our wonderful programming staff.

837
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:43,540
They really enabled the visual effects team to do their best and be their best.

838
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,463
I also learned that over-communicating is good.

839
00:50:47,463 --> 00:50:52,528
On this project, we really had to rally together to create something wonderful.

840
00:50:52,528 --> 00:50:59,795
The more that we work together and problem-solve together, the better we were able to deliver

841
00:50:59,795 --> 00:51:00,936
this project.

842
00:51:01,787 --> 00:51:04,571
And lastly, you know, I really love this project.

843
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:08,295
The people I worked with were some of the best in the industry,

844
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:10,478
and I'm really proud of what we did together.

845
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:14,543
And I'm really glad that I was able to talk with you all about

846
00:51:14,543 --> 00:51:17,386
the effects that we did for this game.

847
00:51:17,386 --> 00:51:19,549
And thank you very much. Let's have some Q&A.
