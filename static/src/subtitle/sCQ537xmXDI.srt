1
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:07,061
It is now 1.20.

2
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:09,997
I shall begin.

3
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:15,615
So this is from Indy to Fable and back, 30 years of wisdom.

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,456
You'll note the inverted commas as Rami said yesterday,

5
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:19,717
all advice is bad advice

6
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:22,038
and I'm sure this will be no different.

7
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:23,038
My name is Dean Carter.

8
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:25,179
I'm the managing director of Fluttermind LLC,

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:27,120
at Fluttermind, imaginatively.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,861
And I've had the genuine pleasure

11
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:32,382
of being in this industry professionally for 33 years.

12
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:36,184
I've been writing games since I was 14 years old.

13
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:37,504
That was back in 1984,

14
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,905
for those who can't be bothered to do the maths,

15
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:40,665
which I quite understand.

16
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,866
It is after lunch after all.

17
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:45,586
So without further ado, before I start,

18
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:48,428
I need to mention a basic housekeeping thing,

19
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:51,030
so please turn off your mobile phone ringers,

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,911
don't stand up and have loud conversations,

21
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:53,972
don't throw things,

22
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:57,894
and please fill in the online review form thing

23
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:59,495
so the people who run this

24
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:01,596
know not to book me again next year.

25
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,638
I'd be very much appreciated.

26
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,704
So, 33 years, what have I done with that time?

27
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:09,745
Justify your existence.

28
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:12,966
I created a game called Druid on the Commodore 64,

29
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,606
which did relatively well,

30
00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:16,147
which is kind of second from top left.

31
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:20,008
I was part of the core team on the original Dungeon Keeper,

32
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,008
which is sort of top right.

33
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,349
There's some very old people in this audience.

34
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:27,030
I started the Fable franchise with my brother Simon

35
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,550
and Ian Lovett, who are both down there.

36
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,191
If you want to throw things at them, it's fine.

37
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:30,851
That is allowed.

38
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:34,864
I wrote Inkaboto, which is game bottom middle,

39
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:39,506
which did really well, and I loved making it.

40
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:41,947
And my current project is a game called Wardenclyffe,

41
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:42,927
which is bottom right over there

42
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:43,908
with the weird bunny thing.

43
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:46,489
You'll see the bunny theme revisited

44
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,689
several times during this.

45
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,512
So I've worked in companies of all scales,

46
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,193
tiny, solo, bedroom, 80s, indie things,

47
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,894
you know, those nerdy pictures you see

48
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:56,755
from that period of time.

49
00:01:56,755 --> 00:02:01,018
And all the way up through AAA to EA,

50
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:03,939
boo, and Microsoft.

51
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:09,563
And so I've kind of seen it all several times

52
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,503
in one form or another.

53
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:12,805
But before I go on, I'd actually like to ask

54
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:13,945
the audience a few questions

55
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,146
so I get to know you all a little better.

56
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:17,848
How many people here have released a game professionally?

57
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:24,953
How many people have released a game here unprofessionally?

58
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:28,295
Yeah, it's a more difficult one to ask.

59
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:28,935
Yeah, I'm both.

60
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:30,416
How many of you would self-define as artists?

61
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,219
Okay, the stoned, well-dressed ones.

62
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:39,110
How many of you would define yourselves as coders?

63
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,071
People who tap away at keys.

64
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:41,352
A lot of you, good Lord.

65
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:43,213
Yeah, you're the pale, precise ones, right?

66
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:46,195
And how many of you are solo developers?

67
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:48,316
People who don't let anybody else into your life

68
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:50,157
because you're complete control freaks?

69
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:50,718
Yeah, okay, right.

70
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:53,460
Yeah, they're the lonely, haunted-looking ones.

71
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,015
I feel your pain, that's me nowadays.

72
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:57,516
Okay, thank you for that.

73
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:59,277
This talk isn't like a lot of other talks.

74
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,958
It's not how to make lots of money.

75
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,259
It's not a survivor bias, the opera,

76
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:05,200
or whatever else somebody's doing down the road.

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,101
It's just a collection of weird stuff

78
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,001
I've learned along the way

79
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,742
that I'd kind of wish I'd known a little bit earlier

80
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:10,923
and would have made my life a little bit easier.

81
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,064
So with that, let's take a look

82
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:14,224
at the first thing I learned.

83
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:15,625
So, start as you mean to go on, that's what I say.

84
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:29,375
My first game, Rockman, made $7,500 for two weeks of work.

85
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,715
Yay. 1985.

86
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:39,237
I worked out that I could make 26 games a year,

87
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:44,779
which is $195,000 or, ka-ching, $438,077 in today's money.

88
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:46,490
Good Lord.

89
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,751
See, my takeaway really should have been

90
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:49,711
I was a complete idiot.

91
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:53,392
Because even in the 80s, making games profitably

92
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:54,193
was nearly impossible.

93
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,433
I really should read you sentences and then write them.

94
00:03:56,433 --> 00:04:00,054
Even the best 80s developers only got 12 to 14% royalties

95
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:00,795
for a finished game.

96
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:02,235
That is literally, you'd end up with a situation like this.

97
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:02,935
Hello, Mr. Publisher.

98
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:03,415
I've got a game.

99
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:04,276
Have you finished it?

100
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:04,396
Yes.

101
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:05,656
I'll have that then.

102
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:05,936
I'll give you 12%.

103
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:06,136
Thank you.

104
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:06,516
That was it.

105
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,705
That was your relationship.

106
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:21,506
You had no control over covers, absolutely nothing.

107
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:23,227
It was very, very hard to make money.

108
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:24,889
And so that's why a lot of people of my age

109
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,790
who come from my background kind of went stuff this

110
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,451
and went did something more profitable instead.

111
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:31,833
Everything is cyclic and I know a lot of developers here

112
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,574
are struggling again to make money.

113
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,536
It's nothing new, but this time you've got a larger audience

114
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:38,617
you've got more distribution channels

115
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,098
and you have decades of development to learn from.

116
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,780
Decades of mistakes I have made on people like me.

117
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,981
You can avoid making them.

118
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:48,709
So, again, I should have practiced the order of that

119
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:49,930
a bit better, too.

120
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,230
So moving on from that, this is one of the things I really

121
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,811
should have learned a bit quicker.

122
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:58,973
This started with my very, very first game, again, Rockman,

123
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:02,574
which when I was developing it, looked like this.

124
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,214
Now you'll notice a couple of things.

125
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:06,995
The artists there are kind of crossing their arms and

126
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:10,357
biting their lips and kind of going, his light sources are

127
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:12,637
coming from all sorts of different directions.

128
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:15,498
He clearly has a very poor grasp of shadow and form.

129
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:21,531
The more keen-eyed amongst you will notice it's in black and white.

130
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:25,372
And this was on a ZX Spectrum, which wasn't black and white.

131
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:27,533
So why was it black and white?

132
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,234
Because I was poor, and my family were poor,

133
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:32,515
and my development machine was literally a ZX Spectrum

134
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:34,175
and a black and white television set.

135
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:39,397
Now, the problem here is I forgot that a majority of my audience

136
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:42,418
were not poor people like me with a black and white TV set.

137
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,459
So when they got to play the game, it looked like this.

138
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:48,938
I'm now going to use a quote from a review.

139
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:50,258
Hiddishly garish graphics.

140
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:50,398
I was 15.

141
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:51,539
It hurt.

142
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,280
But the takeaway here really should have been

143
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,442
players see things completely differently

144
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:01,362
to you as a developer.

145
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:04,463
Your development environment is not representative

146
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:06,224
of the final experience the player's gonna have.

147
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,845
A black and white TV was not representative

148
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:09,905
of my player's final hardware.

149
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:12,846
And while nobody here is developing in black and white,

150
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,267
and it's for artistic reasons.

151
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:18,159
It's important to remember that, I did not hear anything.

152
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,420
It is important to remember players perceive things

153
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,540
completely differently to you.

154
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,461
Your players are not hunched over a copy of Unity

155
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:26,941
with gray borders surrounding a tiny screen.

156
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:28,382
Your players are not looking for bugs.

157
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:30,902
Your players have not seen the same scenarios

158
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:33,143
50 times over that day alone.

159
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,503
If you forget that, it can lead to complexity

160
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:37,064
and difficulty creep, so watch out.

161
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:42,565
And then there's the real world to take into consideration.

162
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:50,617
Your real players lounge on a sofa or relax near their PC,

163
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,920
probably with a beer.

164
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,162
Real players don't pay attention or understand

165
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:57,705
that crucial information is crucial.

166
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:59,968
Real players go on holiday and need

167
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,569
to remember what they were doing when they return.

168
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,953
Real players take a break because they need the toilet

169
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:05,674
after all that beer.

170
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:12,743
And if you haven't tested your mobile game on the toilet, you're in trouble, because that's what real players do.

171
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:15,045
That if you're developing mobile, that is...

172
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:18,448
Just think of that for a moment, it's kind of troubling, isn't it?

173
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:23,872
And finally, the most humbling thing of all is real players don't care about your game as much as you do.

174
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,634
That's just the way the world is.

175
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:28,536
It's fine.

176
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:33,540
Fundamentally, players live inside their own brains, and not yours.

177
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:37,561
Your players aren't living your life, experiencing things through your senses.

178
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:41,306
Some of your players don't speak English as a first language.

179
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,688
Some aren't straight white guys.

180
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:44,590
Ah! Shakara!

181
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,574
But most of all, stuff that's absolutely obvious to you

182
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:53,821
will seem utterly bizarre and alien to somebody who does not live in your own head.

183
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,822
So when you are designing, design for players' minds,

184
00:07:57,822 --> 00:08:02,224
not yours, because every single time you decide

185
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:04,405
some group of players isn't worth worrying about

186
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:07,186
or caring about, you pretty much guarantee

187
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,587
they don't care about you or your game.

188
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:14,450
A lot of people are gonna disagree with me on this one.

189
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,271
So I'm gonna start off with some quotes

190
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:18,492
to make me sound more authoritative.

191
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:19,152
My personal favorite.

192
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:27,777
Specialization is for insects.

193
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:30,798
Robert Heinlein, I've decided he speaks that way

194
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,159
because he was kind of a dick

195
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,019
in a lot of the rest of his life.

196
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:33,480
Second one from Valve.

197
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,841
An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating.

198
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,982
That's from Valve, so there, yeah.

199
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:41,104
But when they're referring to T-shaped individuals,

200
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,924
they're talking about people

201
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:45,966
who have a breadth of experience in their lives

202
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:50,608
and also a very narrow, tight, laser beam focus

203
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,950
of expertise in some small thing.

204
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:57,805
So in the early days, in the early days.

205
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,941
In the 80s, I was making typefaces,

206
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,583
I was doing my own art, I coded engines,

207
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,944
sound effects, music, I dealt directly with a SID chip,

208
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:08,606
I wrote an assembler, all those fun things.

209
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:10,307
Even during my time at Bullfrog in the 90s,

210
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:13,469
I was coding user interfaces one day,

211
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,931
and then a shadow renderer for the engine the next day.

212
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,411
And that's not because I'm special or magic,

213
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:20,053
it's just because that's what everybody did at the time,

214
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:21,594
that's how companies didn't spend

215
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,195
all of their money in two weeks.

216
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,156
They got everybody to do everything all the time.

217
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,737
And so you ended up with teams that were made up

218
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,458
of multi-skilled weirdos.

219
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,559
I'm sure this seems very familiar to solo devs

220
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,759
in the audience, incidentally.

221
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,380
Indie teams are getting bigger

222
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,800
and production values are rising.

223
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,541
So you might be thinking it's wiser to specialize,

224
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,221
but people tend to forget something here.

225
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:47,803
And that is developing a broad skillset isn't just for you.

226
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:59,900
Large teams require collaboration and clear communication beyond anything else.

227
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,461
Being a generalist doesn't just help you get more work done with fewer people.

228
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:07,943
It helps you learn how different disciplines think, their vocabulary, their workflow, their

229
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:08,363
pain.

230
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:13,805
Knowledge breeds respect for others, and that helps everybody you work with.

231
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:17,886
It stops you making assumptions about how difficult a task is.

232
00:10:17,886 --> 00:10:19,507
It stops you saying, just.

233
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,210
Can you just make the main character run 10% faster?

234
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,591
But that'll break the engine.

235
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:25,012
Oh, just do it.

236
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:28,414
Can you just make all the reds a bit brighter in all the art?

237
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:29,755
There's 42 gigs worth of textures.

238
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,076
Every time you say just,

239
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:33,357
you suggest you know that a task is easy.

240
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:34,918
It might not be.

241
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:36,820
And if you don't know that, you should shut up.

242
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,201
Learning more about other's areas of work

243
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,603
makes you less of an arse to work with.

244
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:42,683
So, there's a good reason.

245
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:49,196
I also personally believe that ignorance is an energy,

246
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:49,736
so use it.

247
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:52,580
Those of you who put up your hands saying you're coders

248
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,802
or artists or whatever else,

249
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:55,564
I know I didn't mention designers,

250
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:56,645
I love you too, worry not.

251
00:10:56,645 --> 00:11:01,131
Don't forget that most of all, you are human.

252
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:03,079
You were designed to adapt.

253
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,160
You can do pretty much anything if you put your mind to it.

254
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,781
If you're sitting there saying,

255
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,562
I can't do art or maths or coding or whatever else.

256
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:12,263
I said all those things at one point in my career

257
00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:13,864
and I was wrong every single time

258
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,424
because I'm an idiot, as I said earlier.

259
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,145
At various points, I was convinced I would never learn

260
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,146
how to do 3D vector maths from scratch.

261
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,148
I would never learn about music theory and production

262
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,509
or color theory, as you saw in Rockman earlier.

263
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:26,349
Not a good start.

264
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:27,029
In each case, I was wrong.

265
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,908
So be a human, learn a skill outside your area of specialty.

266
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:36,772
This is my challenge to you today.

267
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,776
If you're a programmer, learn to make a 3D model

268
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:39,978
and get it in game.

269
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:40,860
It's a pain in the ass.

270
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:44,730
If you're an artist, learn how to code something in Lua.

271
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,950
Free engines like Love2D exist.

272
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,831
They're fantastic and very easy to use, so have a go.

273
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,392
You're a human, learn music theory,

274
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,552
learn Islamic design techniques,

275
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:57,133
learn filmmaking, theater, learn anything and everything.

276
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,774
Think of yourself as an artist or code at last.

277
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,195
Be a human first, because that's what you are,

278
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:03,815
and that's the most valuable thing about you.

279
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,770
I'm not dropping a mic, I'm having a drink.

280
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,530
Rapid team growth is dangerous.

281
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:14,830
I love this quote,

282
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,631
primarily because it uses pizza as a metric,

283
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:20,591
which is just fantastic.

284
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,012
It indicates that he's trying to at least

285
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:25,572
be a little bit my people.

286
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:29,173
So yes, that's Werner Vogels from Amazon.

287
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:33,134
If your team can eat more than two pizzas, it's too large.

288
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,054
I've given him that voice.

289
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,435
It's not quite the same one as I used, but never mind.

290
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:42,364
So where does this come from?

291
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,646
Early on in Fable's development at Big Blue Box,

292
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:46,707
there were just three of us,

293
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,548
me and those two guys sitting down there.

294
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:51,671
Communication was really, really easy

295
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,553
and we were living off savings and a bank loan

296
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:58,055
and it was kind of weird and stressful and unstable,

297
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:00,337
but still kind of fun.

298
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:03,179
Team morale and cohesion were pretty darn high.

299
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,381
We didn't really think about those things as an issue.

300
00:13:06,381 --> 00:13:07,562
And then we got a deal.

301
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,603
The team grew bigger.

302
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,451
got a larger office, started to fill it with new people,

303
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,232
and everything was okay, up until we hit around 12 people.

304
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:18,674
And that's when the rumor mill suddenly developed.

305
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,095
We'd have people coming up to us and saying,

306
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:23,255
I don't know if you know, but half the team is saying

307
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:24,816
this game's gonna be canned in two weeks, is that true?

308
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:25,016
And we'd go, no?

309
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:29,398
And where the hell did that come from?

310
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:32,839
And the answer is, that's just what happens

311
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,000
when you start to grow teams, because what happens is

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,321
you can't have everybody in every meeting at the same time.

313
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:40,610
with a large team.

314
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,671
It's just not going to work.

315
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:43,913
And so what happens is you end up with pockets

316
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:45,895
and cliques of people going into different meetings

317
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:48,457
and gaps in knowledge develop and people fill it.

318
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,018
They either make up their own crap

319
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:51,639
or they misinterpret something they've half heard

320
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,120
they don't think they're supposed to have heard

321
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,922
and things start to break down a little bit.

322
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:56,343
And we thought we were unique.

323
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,465
We thought this was just us being really, really rubbish,

324
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:01,167
but it turns out that this is really, really common

325
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,848
and there are really good reasons for it,

326
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:03,629
which I'm going to go into.

327
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:08,205
Primarily, communication paths do not grow linearly

328
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,749
with team size.

329
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,191
So as I said, with a small team,

330
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:14,774
you just have a couple of people sitting around,

331
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:15,736
can you do thing?

332
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:16,797
Yes, I can do thing.

333
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:18,740
There you go, team communication 101, sorted.

334
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,861
We're experts at this.

335
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:23,937
It's not quite the same as it grows.

336
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:26,099
There's actually an equation for this as well.

337
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,061
So a guy called Fred Brooks who wrote a book

338
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:32,484
called The Mythical Man Month, which is quite a mouthful,

339
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:33,845
and I think everybody is told to read

340
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:34,946
when they first start ComSky,

341
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:39,129
or they did when I was growing up a very long time ago,

342
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,491
decided that this equation here tells you

343
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:44,254
how many communication lines there are

344
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:45,695
for any team of any size,

345
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:46,756
as long as you can figure out what N is,

346
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:49,598
i.e. you can count the people in your team.

347
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,220
And what you end up with is, doink, that.

348
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,802
Two people, one line of communication,

349
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,884
all the way up to eight people, 28 communications.

350
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:01,646
Every one of those lines represents a potential cock up,

351
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:04,929
represents a potential for somebody to misinterpret

352
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,450
something that's said by somebody else

353
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,251
and to get things horribly wrong.

354
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:11,294
To, for example, make a cave piece 400 meters long

355
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:12,955
rather than 40 meters long.

356
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,997
People have seen Spinal Tap, yay?

357
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:17,778
Stonehenge.

358
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:18,479
It happens.

359
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,172
And this is why producers exist.

360
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,013
That's what they're there for.

361
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:25,435
They're people who don't seem very valuable

362
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:28,537
when you have a company right in the very beginning.

363
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:29,879
You're kind of going, well, I'm doing art,

364
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,100
I'm making stuff, it goes in the game,

365
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,941
and I'm doing coding, it goes in the game.

366
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,242
I'm doing design, I'm telling you what to do.

367
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:35,523
No, you're not.

368
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:37,465
Oh, all right then.

369
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:39,406
And then you have producers.

370
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,208
And the producers, producers,

371
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,830
just gonna come and rearrange the fridge magnets

372
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,251
on the front of our fridge again.

373
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,312
But they're the people who stop that riotous array of lines

374
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:53,615
becoming a horrific spider web that bogs you down and kills

375
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:53,815
your game.

376
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,897
That was far more dramatic than I intended it to be.

377
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:57,638
It's just bad.

378
00:15:57,638 --> 00:16:01,601
There's also something called the Ringelmann effect.

379
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:05,964
Larger groups lead to less motivation, coordination, and

380
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,024
productivity.

381
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,567
I've decided this guy's very posh for no good reason.

382
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,788
He shouldn't be posh because he's actually from 1913, and

383
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,309
he's a French agricultural engineer.

384
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,851
But yeah, he discovered this, that basically

385
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,753
as his team sizes grew, everything turned to crap.

386
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:21,914
That's the technical way of referring to it.

387
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,034
So why?

388
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:22,635
Why decreased motivation?

389
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:23,475
Well, in a larger group, it's hard to feel

390
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:26,337
that your work counts.

391
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:30,400
You start to feel like a cog in a machine,

392
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,881
and if you kind of go, you know what,

393
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:36,623
I'm feeling knackered, it's Friday.

394
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:37,784
I'm not sure anybody's gonna care

395
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:39,525
if I spend one more hour doing this.

396
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:40,766
That's just the way it is.

397
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,641
Why decrease coordination?

398
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,042
Well, I showed you the spider web of lines earlier.

399
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:49,285
In a larger group, the communication pathways have exploded.

400
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:50,746
Again, this is why we need producers.

401
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:53,408
So what are the suggested solutions?

402
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:54,809
It's okay saying there's this problem.

403
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,310
So what do we do to fix it?

404
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,772
Okay, I urge you not to look at Maximilian Ringelmann's

405
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:02,854
research on this, because it's kind of horrible.

406
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:05,476
His fixes basically involve you turning your company

407
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:07,217
into a version of the Hunger Games.

408
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:10,645
I'm not quite sure why, but things like,

409
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,947
increase surveillance, I told you he's posh.

410
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:15,250
Create internal competition,

411
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,212
have them at each other's throats.

412
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:18,574
That doesn't seem good.

413
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:21,998
This is a room full of indie developers, we don't do that.

414
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:25,055
So there is one suggestion of all that research

415
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:28,098
which does seem to work, and we applied it

416
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,159
in varying degrees as we went on, and it does seem to work.

417
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,061
And that's simply increase identifiability.

418
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,643
In a larger team, it's important to assure

419
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:37,125
everybody knows the meaning of each person's contribution.

420
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,547
People want to feel useful and needed.

421
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:42,069
They want to know what their role is and why they're useful,

422
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,950
and that they're not just another cog in the machine.

423
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,652
In Bullfrog, Big Blue Box, and Lionhead,

424
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:48,093
this involved making sure we took time

425
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:49,675
to talk to everyone all the time.

426
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,862
We'd also have Friday meetings so people could show off

427
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:55,123
what they were doing and giving people an opportunity

428
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:57,745
to show off is great.

429
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:58,145
But most of all,

430
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:02,027
think before growing your team.

431
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,509
Think really hard about whether it's the right time,

432
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:07,290
whether you have the right support in place.

433
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,431
And most of all, be nice to producers.

434
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:08,891
This one's a weird one.

435
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:11,453
It'll take a while to explain.

436
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:12,233
Let that one sink in.

437
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,041
So excellence has a cost.

438
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:28,102
On Fable, I once asked an animator for digging animation.

439
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:29,722
Simple request.

440
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,083
What I got back was a Pixar quality,

441
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,243
12 second animation of a tired farm laborer,

442
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:37,464
resting on his shovel, wiping his brow,

443
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,404
pushing the spade into the earth,

444
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:40,505
levering up a chunk of turf

445
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:43,125
and suffering from acute back pain.

446
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,786
It was beautiful.

447
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:46,766
It was beautiful.

448
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,206
It was characterful.

449
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,367
It was art.

450
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,107
It was useless.

451
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,412
Because this was the player's dig animation.

452
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:59,095
The player's gonna see that thing a hundred times or more in the game.

453
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:02,799
It wasn't just too long, it was also far too specific.

454
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,362
I had to ask for the animation to be made more bland.

455
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:07,903
Duller.

456
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,505
Just think how counterintuitive that sounds for me.

457
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:11,546
I mean, just...

458
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:13,047
Hello, I'm really sorry, the, um...

459
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,289
Can you just, like, make it really...

460
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:15,410
Uh, uh.

461
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:15,870
Like, I know that...

462
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,611
...goes all the back...

463
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:16,851
...and then...

464
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:17,391
Like, can you...

465
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:17,591
Uh, uh.

466
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,092
It's just weird.

467
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,218
But that's what's necessary.

468
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:23,399
If you have really good people,

469
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,902
they take pride in their craft.

470
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:27,423
Pride in work leads to excellence

471
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:30,406
and usually quite memorable assets.

472
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:33,209
But this level of excellence isn't always a good thing.

473
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:37,273
Because blandness helps disguise repetition.

474
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:42,455
There usually isn't enough manpower to make every single asset in your game one use.

475
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:45,457
And if you're reusing assets, specificity is really bad.

476
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:50,841
Because people's brains are designed to spot patterns in both visuals and audio.

477
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:56,245
Players notice NPCs talking about having taken an arrow to the knee for the 500th time.

478
00:19:56,245 --> 00:20:04,030
Players notice the same boulder engraved with eldritch runes strewn around the same environment a hundred times.

479
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,211
They kind of go, hmm, there it is again.

480
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:12,696
Players notice these patterns, these specifics, and consider the game a little bit worse each time they see them.

481
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:16,098
Slightly worse than a game with blander assets.

482
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:19,479
So when you're asking for content to be made,

483
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,000
communicate the context of your assets.

484
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,001
Be really clear about how often they will be seen or heard.

485
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,931
Tell content creators how specific it needs to be.

486
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:28,831
And in a lot of cases,

487
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,752
you'll find your assets need to be bland

488
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:34,633
and anything else will actively make your game worse.

489
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,514
And you might find that your content creators thank you

490
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,614
for not wasting their time.

491
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:43,636
So before we move on to the next subject,

492
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:46,856
this is a quick diagram showing the continuum of game types

493
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:49,177
as defined by me right now.

494
00:20:49,177 --> 00:20:50,297
That there are no others, that's it.

495
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:51,598
Don't bother reading anything else.

496
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:57,498
Not quite true, but just for the moment, let's pretend.

497
00:20:57,498 --> 00:21:00,619
So we get mechanical at one end, like Tetris, chess,

498
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:03,760
where just the rules and the configurations of things

499
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,820
are everything.

500
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,941
All the way up to purely experiential things,

501
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:10,842
like Proteus, where just being in the world is the thing.

502
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:12,883
And some people are very denigrating

503
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,643
towards those sorts of things, but they're a thing.

504
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:15,884
They have their worth, they have their place.

505
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:17,684
So that's the precursor to prototypes can be misleading.

506
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,179
If your game is experiential,

507
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,061
it's actually really difficult to make a prototype.

508
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:33,044
With mechanics-driven games, a janky prototype is fine,

509
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:35,625
as long as it lets you test the mechanics and rules,

510
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,447
it's useful.

511
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:40,149
With an experiential game, it's all about look and feel.

512
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,908
And that means that a janky prototype

513
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:44,589
really isn't helpful in the slightest.

514
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,270
Because if simply being in your world

515
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,611
is a majority of your game's appeal,

516
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:50,473
you can't really test that until the experience

517
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,695
is close to 100% there, because until that point,

518
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:56,116
it's not the world you want people to be wandering around.

519
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:58,517
You can't test a roller coaster, for example,

520
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,259
by sitting somebody on one of these chairs

521
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,761
and making whooshing noises at them.

522
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:04,981
It doesn't work.

523
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:07,523
An experiential game, sometimes so-called polish,

524
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:08,443
is the game.

525
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:15,126
So that is not the sentence I wrote originally.

526
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:19,488
I actually originally wrote a much, much ruder one, which I'm

527
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:20,228
going to paraphrase here.

528
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:24,910
Fable was a lurching, joyless, horrific experience until the

529
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,910
last couple of months.

530
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,691
If you weren't there, you do not know.

531
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:28,811
It was horrible.

532
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:31,292
Thank you very much to those who didn't get it.

533
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,453
It was afterwards, too.

534
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,073
Thanks.

535
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:34,633
Much appreciated.

536
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,604
Despite having lots of game mechanics in it, Fable was very much an experiential game.

537
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:47,490
The music, the mood, the charm we were going for, these things really defined Fable.

538
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,474
Not the raw mechanics and rules and resources.

539
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:53,597
Not the things you can prototype relatively easily.

540
00:22:53,597 --> 00:22:56,800
During development we actually threw away at least one entire combat system.

541
00:22:57,498 --> 00:23:02,683
With what I know now, I suspect that 90% of the reason we threw it away is simply that it wasn't polished.

542
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:08,289
It wasn't finished. We didn't have finished sound effects, weapon trails, hit particles.

543
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:11,592
And it's really hard to evaluate something like combat without all those things.

544
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:17,718
Nevertheless, here are the lessons I learned from that whole Fable experience and how it applies to prototyping.

545
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,856
There's a weird effect in music production where the louder a track is played,

546
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:26,118
the better the listener thinks the sound quality is.

547
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,741
Exactly the same track. Just turn the volume to 11.

548
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,663
They go, that's awesome, man, what have you done?

549
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:32,886
I've turned it to 11. That's it.

550
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:35,609
Quality judgments can be distorted by unrelated factors.

551
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,293
Ugly prototypes can lead to weird cognitive distortions

552
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,655
that utterly undermine their value.

553
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:45,877
For experiential games, a bland prototype is often better than an ugly one.

554
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:48,600
If you don't have representative graphics, prototype without graphics.

555
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,062
Use plain boxes and spheres instead.

556
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,986
If you have to, keep the prototype completely separate from the rest of the things in the

557
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:56,707
game so you can judge it in isolation.

558
00:23:56,707 --> 00:24:03,273
Most importantly, define the prototype's success criteria so you reject for the right reasons.

559
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:06,937
Before you start, make sure you know, are you prototyping something experiential?

560
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:08,903
What is the scope of your prototype?

561
00:24:08,903 --> 00:24:10,523
How do you define success?

562
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:14,224
If success isn't even achievable at this point,

563
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:16,505
be especially careful,

564
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:19,506
and possibly think again about doing a prototype.

565
00:24:19,506 --> 00:24:21,786
Worst thing about experiential games, incidentally,

566
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,027
is that you might have to rely on faith

567
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,887
for considerably longer than is comfortable,

568
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:26,787
but that's okay.

569
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:29,028
That's what experiential games are like.

570
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:30,228
Art style is more important than you think.

571
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:32,409
I'm sure artists are here going,

572
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:35,349
well, I think art style is quite important, actually,

573
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,430
so I doubt it's more important than I think.

574
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:40,277
Okay. Be nice.

575
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:41,918
They also say things like,

576
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:47,561
an art style is something you discover once you've learned to draw properly.

577
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:48,301
You hack.

578
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,962
Which is also fair.

579
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:52,103
We'll talk about this afterwards.

580
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:57,386
That's okay, if only you're going to really make art your specialty.

581
00:24:57,386 --> 00:24:59,287
I'm not an artist. I cannot draw.

582
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:02,469
Okay? I state that now openly, cleanly, plainly.

583
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:02,969
I cannot draw.

584
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,923
But I made that for my wife a couple of years ago.

585
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:11,404
I used a 2D vector package.

586
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:13,226
It's a really, really simple image.

587
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:13,366
It's that.

588
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:18,350
Without colors and gradients, it is just that and no more.

589
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,392
You can see how simple it is.

590
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:23,215
Because I'm not an artist, I used a strong style

591
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:25,477
to introduce very strong limitations.

592
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:27,558
And limitations made it easier to come up

593
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:29,120
with variations quickly,

594
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,322
which allowed me to curate rather than create.

595
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,124
And yes, I chose two very similar sounding words,

596
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:34,865
which isn't good.

597
00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:39,859
Choosing the right style also does something magical.

598
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:42,301
Style has the fact you can't draw.

599
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:45,763
This is my current project, Wardenclyffe.

600
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:45,863
Doink.

601
00:25:45,863 --> 00:25:48,325
As I said, I'm not an artist.

602
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:49,186
I really can't draw.

603
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:51,287
I can't model in 3D either, but still.

604
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:55,090
I chose a style that restricted the complexity of my scenes,

605
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,991
which allowed me to curate rather than create.

606
00:25:58,567 --> 00:25:59,727
There's also something else.

607
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:02,689
Successful games often have a very, very strong visual style.

608
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:05,550
My brother and I did a little test quite regularly

609
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,491
called the one inch test, which isn't as rude as it sounds.

610
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,212
It's pretty simple.

611
00:26:09,212 --> 00:26:12,013
I'm going to show you a bunch of screenshot sections,

612
00:26:12,013 --> 00:26:13,694
no main character, nothing.

613
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:17,836
I want you to shout out what you think the games are quickly.

614
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:18,316
Boink.

615
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:19,877
Awesome.

616
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:20,477
Crossy road.

617
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:20,717
Right on.

618
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:29,036
Monument Valley.

619
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:30,477
Isn't that amazing?

620
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:33,640
You just recognize those games out of thousands you know of

621
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,121
with minimal information.

622
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:38,543
The takeaway here should be style is marketing.

623
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:41,786
Ultimately, a unique visual style tells players there

624
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:43,888
might be something unique about your game.

625
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:46,410
And having players believe your game is unique is half

626
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:46,610
the battle.

627
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,010
That's my final point.

628
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,352
I'm not even going to talk about it.

629
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:50,433
It's amazing, but goodbye.

630
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:50,913
It's not mine.

631
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:51,373
Slide is going.

632
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:51,794
Three, two, one.

633
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:58,287
Streamline your process.

634
00:26:58,287 --> 00:26:59,348
What does your iteration cost?

635
00:26:59,348 --> 00:26:59,928
No, really.

636
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:03,090
Do you know how much time you waste on iterations?

637
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,812
The little gaps between making a change and evaluating it.

638
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:07,473
That's the bit I'm trying to get you to think about.

639
00:27:07,473 --> 00:27:11,717
If you do think you recognize that, be honest.

640
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:12,177
This was the...

641
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:17,304
very first editor I'd used. It's a piece of graph paper which I used during sport at school.

642
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,265
Yes, I was that nerd.

643
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:22,206
I was under the impression that it took me ten minutes to make a level,

644
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:24,387
but in truth, of course, iterating like that,

645
00:27:24,387 --> 00:27:27,448
hand-coding it, and then typing in data tables in BASIC,

646
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:30,629
is idiotic, and so therefore I never iterated.

647
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:32,449
And I just did not want to write an editor.

648
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,830
I was stupid, and the game suffered.

649
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:38,109
And while I'm not quite that stupid anymore,

650
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:39,650
even with Wardenclyffe now,

651
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,731
I find myself walking to the same place time and time again

652
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:44,172
in order to test out a ritual.

653
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:47,654
And part of my brain is resisting writing the tools

654
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:49,194
allowing me to make my job easier.

655
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:52,376
And I was trying to think about why this happens.

656
00:27:52,376 --> 00:27:53,176
And I realized.

657
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,454
that I wasn't convinced it was real work.

658
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,036
I couldn't take it off on a spreadsheet and go,

659
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:01,358
that's it, that's something new in the game players will see.

660
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:03,721
Because the players weren't seeing it,

661
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,242
I didn't see it as real.

662
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:06,123
But it was real.

663
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:08,326
It's a form of self-sabotage, so resist it.

664
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:09,066
Here's some closing thoughts,

665
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,588
because I'm rapidly running out of time

666
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,170
and I didn't speak anywhere near as quickly

667
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,911
as I planned to, believe it or not.

668
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:19,149
Don't let technology deter your game's core promise.

669
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:20,870
We did that on Dungeon Keeper.

670
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,293
We had a very, very slow AI update,

671
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:25,916
and Simon and I actually completely wrecked the game

672
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:28,618
by trying to make it so you didn't build very much

673
00:28:28,618 --> 00:28:29,680
in Dungeon Keeper,

674
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,401
because it took a second to update the map

675
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:32,282
each time that happens.

676
00:28:32,282 --> 00:28:33,944
We went, oh, well, we'll roll the tech.

677
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:34,785
Don't do that.

678
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:35,826
Rethink the tech first.

679
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,315
Static screenshots have to look good too.

680
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:40,016
No one pixel lines.

681
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:42,376
I learned that one from Spellraiser.

682
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:44,337
Single pixel lines shimmer horribly.

683
00:28:44,337 --> 00:28:46,537
And Spellraiser looks really great moving,

684
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:47,958
but dear God, it looks dreadful in stills.

685
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:48,978
So don't do that either.

686
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:49,838
David Lynch.

687
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:50,799
David Lynch said,

688
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,720
people only see doughnuts, not holes.

689
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,961
By which he meant, nobody knows what you cut out.

690
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,981
So when you find yourself cutting things

691
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:00,922
to get a game out on time,

692
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:03,122
or to finish up a speech very quickly,

693
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:04,343
don't worry about the things

694
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,143
that people don't ever get to see.

695
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:09,353
unless you told them about them for some years.

696
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:10,634
And finally, don't panic if your current game sucks.

697
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:10,794
Fix it.

698
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:11,994
Making games is all about making bad games.

699
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:20,639
Being a successful designer means you need to be comfortable with your game sucking.

700
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:25,362
And of course, discovering the steps to improve it.

701
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:28,363
If your game is bad right now, that's okay.

702
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:29,104
Don't beat yourself up.
