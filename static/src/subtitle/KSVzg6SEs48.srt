1
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:07,857
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:09,078
I'm a little bit surprised.

3
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:09,819
There's a lot of people.

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:10,840
But I'm really happy.

5
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:12,622
And I hope you get something out of this talk.

6
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,565
So welcome to my talk about design tests

7
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,007
and what to expect from them.

8
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:19,609
Trolling the internet and the vault,

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,713
I became aware that nobody is shining light upon this topic.

10
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:24,695
So I'm here to break that silence.

11
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:28,797
I'm Peter Buchard, and I worked at Playdead in Copenhagen.

12
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:30,818
I worked on Limbo and Inside.

13
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:33,959
And I'm currently at Studio Gobo in Brighton, England,

14
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,560
where we worked on Disney Infinity,

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,621
and we're currently working on a big co-op devs

16
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:39,161
project with Ubisoft.

17
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:44,983
And speaking of Studio Gobo and their partner company,

18
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:47,264
Electric Square, they're currently hiring.

19
00:00:47,644 --> 00:00:49,685
So if anybody fancy a cool career

20
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:51,906
at an awesome studio in England, then

21
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,806
have a look at their websites.

22
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:57,334
So I've been a bit more than 10 years in the industry.

23
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:00,917
And from time to time, I felt the urge

24
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,799
to try to look for other design opportunities.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,302
And that has led me to receive some tests

26
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:08,784
from the big companies, probably some of the ones

27
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:09,865
that you all want to work at.

28
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:13,388
So I'm here to share some of my knowledge

29
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:14,629
about doing those tests.

30
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,893
I did a game designer test where I got an interview.

31
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,555
I did a level designer one where I

32
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,615
had to push for some feedback.

33
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:26,057
I did an RPG designer one, where I gave up on.

34
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:27,158
I'll talk more about that.

35
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:31,661
I did a level and mission designer and scripter position,

36
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:33,822
where I got a job offer, declined it.

37
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:37,725
A single player designer and a multiplayer designer,

38
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:38,786
two tests at once.

39
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:39,747
We'll talk more about that.

40
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:41,448
I got an answer, but no feedback.

41
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,209
Oh, sorry.

42
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:49,052
I see the way that tests are being used by the companies as a new tendency in modern

43
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:53,193
recruitment, and especially for the big companies who receive a lot of applications for their

44
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:54,213
open design positions.

45
00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:59,635
So instead of just requiring an attractive resume and an impressive portfolio, companies

46
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:01,816
now also require you to do a test.

47
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,418
And the test functions like a natural filter, because it's only the most dedicated people

48
00:02:07,598 --> 00:02:09,918
who even get through that first process.

49
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,184
And it also creates a foundation for the companies

50
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:15,846
to compare you guys, or me, or whatever, one to one,

51
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:17,427
because of that test.

52
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:20,850
Because the companies have found this

53
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,651
to be a cheap and easy way for them

54
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,993
to create a better base for their decision,

55
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:27,775
they seem to forget the individual in that process.

56
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,297
And that's a little bit why I'm here to let you know.

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,783
So will I be telling you how to pass these tests?

58
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:40,730
No, that's not what this talk is about.

59
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,411
The talk is not about how to deliver the perfect answer

60
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,332
to these tests, but it's more about preparing you folks

61
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,913
for the experience of being an individual in that process.

62
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:52,115
And it all might come off a bit gloomy.

63
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:54,556
The fact is, I actually had a lot of fun,

64
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:56,817
and it was really interesting to do these tests,

65
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,658
and I learned a lot from it.

66
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:02,020
But today, I'll touch upon three major topics

67
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,421
that is worth keeping in mind when you decide to go

68
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:05,881
on a design test adventure.

69
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:09,919
I'll be going into details about the format of an answer.

70
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:12,900
I'll be giving examples of what to be expected

71
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,261
in terms of the workload that can be involved

72
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:16,221
when answering these tests.

73
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,522
And I'll be diving into what you can expect

74
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:21,442
in regards to feedback from the people who ask you

75
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:22,803
to do the test in the first place.

76
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:25,484
But first of all, I think it would make sense

77
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:26,904
to just have a look at one test,

78
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,125
so that anyone here in the audience

79
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,605
who might wonder what constitutes a real-world test

80
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,046
that anybody in here might be asked to do one day.

81
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:38,470
On that note, I also want to say, when I present some of

82
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,453
the tests up here, there's going to be a lot of text on

83
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:40,853
the screen.

84
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,256
Don't try to read all of it.

85
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:45,479
I'm going to share a link at the end of the talk where you

86
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:47,741
can download a PDF with all the tests

87
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,522
that I'm talking about.

88
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,367
So you can try it at home and fail or exceed.

89
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,668
You can do all the kinds of stuff you want.

90
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,820
So here's one of the tests.

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,862
This test was done for a big AAA company who are highly

92
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:01,903
regarded in our industry.

93
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,605
And I feel it's fairly representative of the type of

94
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:05,926
tests that you can expect to get.

95
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,768
This was, by the way, for a level designer position.

96
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,211
As you can see, they ask for some slightly generic

97
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:16,413
information about what games you play and what scripting

98
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,834
and 3D experiences you have.

99
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:21,636
It seems to serve as a more personalized resume where you

100
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,898
actually get to explain yourself a little bit.

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,592
Then there's the final part, which is the actual test.

102
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:31,253
And even though this was supposed

103
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:32,954
to be a level design test, you can

104
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:35,655
see that it requires a rather broad understanding of game

105
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:36,455
design to answer.

106
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:40,356
It will have you designing enemies, mechanics,

107
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:40,997
and puzzles.

108
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,898
What's fairly unique about this test

109
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:47,839
is that it actually clearly states a format that you

110
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,619
should be answering in.

111
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,720
And it also tells you to answer the questions in two

112
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,521
or less paragraphs.

113
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,820
And finally, it states that the level scenario should fit on a

114
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,760
two-page document.

115
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,280
This is a lot of good information that you can

116
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,061
squeeze your answer into.

117
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:04,341
But as you'll see as we continue with some of the

118
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:06,402
other examples, this is not always the case.

119
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,743
Generally speaking, tests, they are answered with

120
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,003
paragraphs of text.

121
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,284
But depending on the job type, there's usually other formats

122
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,024
to consider, too.

123
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:20,485
For game design, it's primarily text,

124
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:21,785
diagrams, and images.

125
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,282
For systems design or technical design,

126
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:27,544
there's usually some code, some scripts,

127
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,646
that has to be analyzed, modified, or created.

128
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:36,450
For level design, it's 2D and 3D mockups

129
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,051
of scenarios, maps, and levels.

130
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:43,895
But I have found that when the test isn't giving any specific

131
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:47,296
indications for the desired format, then you run into the

132
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:50,477
dilemma of wanting to make sure that your ideas and answers

133
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,458
are fully understood and that the reader isn't left with the

134
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:54,838
feeling of you leaving things out.

135
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:58,660
But at the same time, you don't want to intimidate or

136
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,560
bore anybody with walls of text.

137
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,181
At least, this has been one of my greatest concerns when

138
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:03,981
answering these tests.

139
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:09,876
So what can you do to approach this format?

140
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:12,097
The best thing you can do is to make sure

141
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,158
that you read and understand the entire test.

142
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,319
I know it sounds simple, but as I'll

143
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,419
show in some of my examples what my approach was,

144
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,420
you don't always do that.

145
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:24,022
And then make sure that you feel that your ideas reads well.

146
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:27,003
You could potentially have an interesting savvy friend

147
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,804
or just somebody who's better at grammar than you

148
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:31,025
read through it, because they might have some input for you

149
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,465
on how to formulate yourself better.

150
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,160
Of course, if you're lucky enough,

151
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,641
you'll be able to get information

152
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:39,363
about the exact persons or the teams that

153
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:40,583
will be reviewing your test.

154
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:44,226
And from that, try to pick an appropriate format.

155
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,947
But remember, often these tests, they

156
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,588
are sent out by the HR department.

157
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,951
And honestly, they rarely have a clue about the actual tests,

158
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:54,872
its context, or its precise purpose.

159
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,411
So let's have a look at a test in question

160
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:01,773
and how I decided to approach the format.

161
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:05,635
This test was for a game designer position.

162
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:08,697
Firstly, the assignment itself.

163
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:12,419
You'll be creating a design specification for a grenade

164
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,800
system used in an FPS.

165
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:17,662
Then the test states a suggested structure.

166
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:20,804
And this is really cool because they mentioned before

167
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:23,545
that it was a design specification.

168
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,546
And that can be very different from company to company.

169
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:29,796
So apparently they have a structure for that.

170
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:34,980
Then it mentions format, as you can see here.

171
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,182
But what's a bit funny about that is it says that you can

172
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,985
do anything you want, as long as it's easily reviewed.

173
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:42,707
But honestly, what does that mean?

174
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:45,950
A sentence like that does not help you find your format.

175
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,122
So the test I just showed you was a rather technical game

176
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:52,722
designer test.

177
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:55,364
So there was some tech questions that came with it.

178
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:56,785
But because they were more straightforward,

179
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:57,866
I'm not going to dive into it.

180
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,468
But for reference, I'll just go over quickly

181
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,489
the three steps there were.

182
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,931
There was stuff about explaining a script's behavior.

183
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,712
Then there was stuff about fixing errors in a script.

184
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,814
And finally, it was about suggesting a new script

185
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:12,876
structure for a set of new requirements.

186
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:18,731
So I ended up with a 12-page answer that featured eight

187
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,253
images and seven diagrams.

188
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,877
And to back my design up, I decided to do what I call a

189
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:27,021
brief feature and context analysis, which is something

190
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,283
I've gotten very familiar with while working

191
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:30,164
at Studio Gobo, too.

192
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,949
And of course, there was eight additional pages to answer the

193
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:34,590
technical test.

194
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:42,259
So I want to briefly explain my way of using feature and context analysis, since it's a

195
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,742
design tool that I've used quite a lot for these types of tests, but also in a more professional

196
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:47,262
capacity.

197
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:53,686
The basic idea is to look at how similar features are treated in other games, but also look

198
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,307
at the context that the feature is supposed to be used in.

199
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:58,989
So in my case, with the test you just saw,

200
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,051
I would look at other grenade systems.

201
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:03,512
And I wouldn't just look at first-person grenade systems,

202
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:05,734
because the first-person approach they're asking for,

203
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:07,595
I might be able to pick some cool things up

204
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,936
for the third-person approaches that is out there.

205
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:13,119
So I put that into my test.

206
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,401
But for context, I looked at other games

207
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:18,462
from the same studio as a way to see

208
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:21,264
how I would approach my design so it fit

209
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:22,245
within their way of thinking.

210
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:26,399
But if the feature is for a more specific scenario,

211
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,604
then it could have been looking at the narrative where

212
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:35,008
it's being injected, or the mechanics that surrounds it,

213
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:36,169
or it has to fit in with.

214
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,511
Or it could be something completely different.

215
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:46,312
So based on their previous games, I argued that a normal grenade system wouldn't really

216
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:46,732
cut it.

217
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:49,134
It would have to take some sort of twist to the mechanic.

218
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:53,698
So I suggested magnetic grenades, that when you threw them, they would somehow get influenced

219
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,259
by the metal that was in the world.

220
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,664
From there on, I followed their suggested format, which made a lot of sense to me, because

221
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:06,229
it was those type of questions that you need to be answering in a professional capacity

222
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:06,549
anyway.

223
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:11,229
At Studio Go, we call that a creative brief when we try to

224
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:12,690
draw those kind of outlines up.

225
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:18,613
But in this case, because I wasn't there to present it, I

226
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:20,374
thought it was OK with a little bit more text.

227
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:23,056
I ended up, oh, sorry.

228
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,317
So what happened with this approach?

229
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:28,279
I ended up getting the interview where it clearly

230
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:31,661
felt like the people in the room had only skimmed my

231
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:35,403
answer, so I felt I could have created a more elegant answer

232
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,024
and that my answer might have been too long.

233
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:45,900
And we didn't even touch upon the technical stuff

234
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,101
in the meeting, which meant I didn't get any feedback on that.

235
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:51,042
And I didn't know if I had done it right or wrong or anything.

236
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,583
So I'll bring another test forward now.

237
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:56,845
This test was made for a company that does a lot of open world

238
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:57,505
AAA games.

239
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,746
And it was for a level and mission designer slash scripter

240
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:01,146
position.

241
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:05,728
So the actual assignment, this is as simple as it gets.

242
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,729
Design a new mission for this game.

243
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,270
Then it states some requirements.

244
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:16,099
and that is where the mission is supposed to be injected the

245
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,640
location in the game and some narrative considerations

246
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,400
to take into account.

247
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:31,343
And then it also has a suggestion for the format.

248
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:34,463
But as you can see, it says you can do anything you want.

249
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,567
And it even says there's no limit

250
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:38,889
to the quantity of pitches.

251
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,391
So what does that mean?

252
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,194
Do you do two pitches, or 10 pitches?

253
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:45,237
Or do you do one really awesome pitch?

254
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:46,759
I don't know.

255
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,782
I did one really awesome pitch, I hope.

256
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,535
Like the first test I presented to you,

257
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,296
this test was also threefold.

258
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,577
The first part had the meat of convincing them

259
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:00,397
that I can design in the way they want,

260
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:01,618
and it fits with their games.

261
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:05,699
The remaining part seems to be gauging what I see as quality,

262
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:09,560
where I get my inspiration from, but also my ability

263
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,201
to reflect on my own design ideas

264
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:14,301
and analyze other people's designs.

265
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:17,182
So like with my first example, these parts

266
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:20,223
seem like a more elaborated part of a resume or a cover letter,

267
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:20,923
if you want.

268
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,722
Because I wanted to illustrate that I liked and understood

269
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:28,223
their games, I did another basic context analysis

270
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,944
where I looked at the place they asked me to inject the mission.

271
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:33,045
For me, it made a lot of sense to consider

272
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:37,287
what the player had learned and what tools the player could

273
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,408
access at the time, and also what

274
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:42,069
the immediate mechanics and tools were after the mission.

275
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,091
Because I felt that this would be designer consideration

276
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:47,672
that I would do that if I was working on that

277
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:48,773
in a professional capacity.

278
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,714
So at the same time.

279
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:59,047
I also wanted to give a narrative wrapper, so I wrote a narrative outline for that to

280
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,690
show them and understand that narrative is important.

281
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:08,476
But by the time that I added up all the relevant screenshots from the game, the illustrations

282
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:10,918
of my map layouts, I ended up with 30 pages.

283
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,642
Not 30 pages of text, but 30 pages with a lot of imagery and whatnot.

284
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,523
And again, you ask yourself.

285
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,922
Is this showing what I have to do if I get the job when I need to do my designs?

286
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:28,224
Or does it say, this guy is really thorough and he knows how to make himself clear when

287
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:28,725
he has to?

288
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:32,226
And you're also thinking, can they even be bothered to read through this?

289
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:36,048
I could probably have explained and tried to sell the idea of the mission in one, two,

290
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,029
three pages, really.

291
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:41,231
But I feel that when answering these tests, it's important to show who you are and what

292
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:42,271
type of designer you are.

293
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,791
Being a designer requires you to be able to approach designing

294
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,032
in many various ways.

295
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,694
The way you structure your answers

296
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,456
shows a lot about how you get your ideas,

297
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,877
if you're good at understanding context,

298
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,978
and if you're good at communicating

299
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:00,659
your own designs.

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,462
So I was aiming to try to show that I could design

301
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:07,062
almost anything for anything.

302
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:10,067
and not just answer one specific question.

303
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:12,828
But of course, you guys have to find your way of doing it

304
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,569
and something you feel comfortable with.

305
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,911
So on an end note about formats, let's

306
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,672
look at some of the format suggestions that

307
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:20,992
existed within these tests.

308
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:23,794
It says, whatever mixture of mediums

309
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,755
that delivers the best impact efficiently.

310
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,616
Detailed design documentation.

311
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,838
Any form you require, as long as it's easily reviewed.

312
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:36,843
As you can see here, you will encounter very open-ended tests.

313
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:40,626
And you have to ask yourself how you want to be perceived,

314
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:43,067
and see if you can find a way to rationalize

315
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,228
what they might be expecting.

316
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:49,512
Some tests do have a stated length limitation, which really

317
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,113
helps in understanding what depth they

318
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,494
want you to be answering in.

319
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:56,557
And the same with the suggestion to the structure.

320
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:59,318
It can tell you a lot about what they'd like you to focus on.

321
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,180
So we touch upon the format.

322
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,281
But as you can figure from my 30-page example, another

323
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:09,901
important thing to prepare for is the amount of work that has

324
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,142
to be committed to a test from its received until

325
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:12,922
you send it off.

326
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,502
The majority of the tests that I have encountered, I've been

327
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,623
told to answer within seven days.

328
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,503
But I've also had four-day tests, 10-day tests.

329
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:25,304
And I have the odd pleasure of receiving two tests at a time,

330
00:15:25,664 --> 00:15:28,384
where one was a 48-hour test and one was a seven-day test.

331
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:29,925
And I had to do both of them in seven days.

332
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:36,877
So I feel it's important to take these time frames into account

333
00:15:36,897 --> 00:15:37,817
when answering the test.

334
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:40,179
But you will find it really difficult to assess,

335
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:43,241
especially if you're studying or working while answering.

336
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:46,503
You'll be hit with the feeling of having much less time

337
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:50,185
and resources than other potential candidates who

338
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:52,046
could be spending 10-plus hours a day,

339
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:54,568
and you'll only be able to squeeze in a few hours

340
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:55,989
every night.

341
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:01,690
You can maybe you can imagine being lucky enough to send out

342
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,232
more than one application at a time,

343
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:06,434
and then you receive two tests at the same time.

344
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:09,577
This is, of course, a luxury problem, but still.

345
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:13,100
So the short story is that when answering these tests,

346
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:14,642
it can feel a bit overwhelming.

347
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:16,704
Let's have a look at some of the tests

348
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,326
that I feel have had a big workload connected to them.

349
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:26,331
As part of one of my examples for workload,

350
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,292
I'll bring forward a test that I actually gave up on.

351
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:29,573
Let's go over the test.

352
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,855
So first of all, it has a statement for the assignment.

353
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:37,477
Design on paper and implement using this Unity UI

354
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,138
tool that was on the shop.

355
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:42,200
A crafting system for a futuristic RPG.

356
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:45,482
Followed by a design brief detailing

357
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:48,684
the context for the system and some function requirements.

358
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,211
After this, we see some more specific requirements

359
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:54,852
for the crafting system's features and its content.

360
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,914
And then there is a list of required deliverables

361
00:16:58,494 --> 00:16:59,935
in terms of documents and files.

362
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,636
Furthermore, it states some generic requirements

363
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:03,177
for the answer.

364
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:06,898
And finally, it concludes by listing some topics

365
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:09,060
that, if included, would be considered a bonus.

366
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,320
No pressure.

367
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:15,363
So what went wrong for me with this test?

368
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,213
Firstly, I didn't do my homework.

369
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:20,874
I didn't consider all parts of this test before I started it.

370
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:22,895
This meant that the first thing I did

371
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:25,816
was research crafting systems and sources of inspiration

372
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,177
before understanding the exact requirements

373
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:30,138
for the implementation of that prototype.

374
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:32,499
The result was that when I finally

375
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,860
had a solid design idea that I believed in,

376
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,581
then I found out that the free Unity UI tool was

377
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:40,462
a bit deprecated and a bit broken.

378
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,443
And I didn't have the time to find and fix the bugs.

379
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,681
Secondly, I also realized how much work it would take to

380
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,562
implement all the desired features.

381
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:52,643
I felt that it would be near impossible for me to deliver

382
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:55,044
something that feature-wise would live up to my own

383
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:57,905
quality expectations, but also that I would be under

384
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:01,767
delivering on the requirements stated in the test, let alone

385
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:02,427
the bonus goals.

386
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:06,328
So with three days left on the test, I gave up.

387
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:07,629
I threw the towel in the ring.

388
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:09,546
Retro, oh, sorry.

389
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:13,548
And this left me with a feeling of not being good enough

390
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:14,148
for the industry.

391
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,590
Retrospectively, I've considered that part of the test

392
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,372
might have been to test how I would react in a situation

393
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:23,233
where there were exceptional high requirements.

394
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:25,734
And sometimes I regret not actually

395
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:27,355
trying to submit something for that test.

396
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:28,936
But honestly?

397
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,114
At the time, I just felt like giving up.

398
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,235
And with companies throwing these tests after applicants

399
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,837
without much consideration, I'd say it's OK to let go and

400
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:39,697
give up on some of them.

401
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:42,178
You might not even be the right fit for that position

402
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:43,859
if it feels bad to do the test.

403
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,581
So now you'll all at least know that if you end up in

404
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:50,481
this situation, you're not alone.

405
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:51,562
Other people have been there.

406
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:54,243
And maybe you can sleep better at night with that.

407
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:57,323
So another example of big workloads

408
00:18:57,563 --> 00:18:58,924
is when a studio decided to ask me

409
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:00,986
to do both a multiplayer and a single player

410
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,709
test at the same time, expecting the answer within seven days.

411
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,193
Since this might be a slightly unique situation,

412
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,154
I'll just have a look at the multiplayer test

413
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:13,776
and go over it, because it has plenty of work in it,

414
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:14,437
as I will show.

415
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:19,321
Firstly, they want you to design a gun recoil system.

416
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,832
Then they want you to fix a really hard technical problem

417
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:25,614
of over-the-shoulder aiming in a third-person shooter.

418
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:31,699
The third part will have you design a multiplayer skill

419
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,642
balancing system, and surely also a full multiplayer mode.

420
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,285
And then after that, broadly outline design ideas

421
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,886
for an engaging progression system.

422
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,972
And finally, present ideas for a new mechanic.

423
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:48,674
So as you can see, the test basically

424
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,955
want you to do five different designs

425
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,036
and solve a difficult technical problem.

426
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:55,477
I like these type of tests.

427
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:56,357
I like answering them.

428
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:58,918
But it felt like I could dive down and use seven days

429
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,839
on each of these questions if I really wanted to.

430
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:09,248
After squeezing these six answers onto 15 pages with imagery, tables, diagrams, it still

431
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:12,730
felt like I might have been over-delivering and somehow should be able to create a more

432
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,570
elegant answer.

433
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,391
I feel it's a really good example of where you as a designer have a hard time guessing

434
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:22,393
where the focus should be applied and where to elaborate and where to cut it to the bone.

435
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,062
As you can see, some of these tests

436
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:26,925
seems to be requiring a lot of work.

437
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,188
And a lot of work can mean long answers, which in turn

438
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,711
can be conceived badly, because the recipients don't have

439
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:32,753
a lot of time to go over them.

440
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:34,615
So you want to make sure that you cover

441
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:36,258
all the relevant aspects, but also keep

442
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:38,501
it relatively digestible, which, of course,

443
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,744
comes back to the format concern.

444
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:45,241
Here I want to add that I have asked for time extensions

445
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:48,283
on these, and the companies are usually very open to this

446
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:50,965
if they know that the engagement was something you had before

447
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:52,046
you even received the test.

448
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:55,448
So keep that in mind if you ever feel like you're out of time.

449
00:20:56,729 --> 00:21:02,093
So when it comes to feedback, you

450
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,234
would imagine that it was simple.

451
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,515
Do this test.

452
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,537
You say, sure, it's cool.

453
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:07,858
Here you go.

454
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:09,079
Here's an answer.

455
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,852
And they say, thanks.

456
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:12,233
Then they think about it.

457
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,736
And then they say, no, because of something.

458
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,338
Or they say, yeah, let's talk more about it.

459
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,201
But sadly, the current reality of things is different, and

460
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,423
since the companies have introduced this test to save

461
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:24,984
resources.

462
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:29,207
So after spending all that time.

463
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:37,140
worrying about the format of your answer and doubting your ability to even complete a test on time, you managed to pull through and

464
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:43,702
deliver something you're truly proud of, and it cost you quite some time. Now, what can you expect in return?

465
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,183
Be realistic. Absolutely nothing.

466
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:54,107
Should you accept no feedback? No, I don't think so. So if you don't receive tangible feedback, you should try to ask for it.

467
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,949
If you all do that, maybe some of the companies will realize that they should be treating this a little bit differently.

468
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:03,358
But now, let's have a look at some of the feedback

469
00:22:03,398 --> 00:22:05,939
that I have received over the years.

470
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,820
So let's first start with the seven and the two-day test.

471
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,541
After finishing, I received this.

472
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:14,262
We wanted to let you know that the tests has

473
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:16,743
been reviewed by our leads, and unfortunately, they

474
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,924
have decided not to move forward with the interview process

475
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:19,385
at this time.

476
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:22,685
And as you can guess, this feels a bit off,

477
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,906
because I pour my heart and my soul into a test.

478
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:27,708
And then the leads sit down and actually review it.

479
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:30,190
And they don't give me any feedback or insights

480
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,311
into why they choose not to continue with me.

481
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,233
Secondly.

482
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,739
I want to bring forward an example from interacting only

483
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:40,600
with the recruiter, not the actual company.

484
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,002
I honestly think there was a great mismatch between my

485
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:46,343
profile and the profile desired by that company.

486
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:49,425
My theory is that it was the recruiter who was aiming very

487
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:52,506
broad with candidates for the position.

488
00:22:53,427 --> 00:22:55,888
Since it was a recruiter who asked me to do the test, I

489
00:22:55,948 --> 00:22:59,049
felt it was OK to require the recruiter to also make sure I

490
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,310
receive feedback for that test.

491
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,951
They should be protecting my interest, too, right?

492
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,618
So after having asked for feedback quite a few times,

493
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:07,699
I got this.

494
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,862
We have reviewed the test, and we

495
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:13,764
feel like the test is incomplete or vague at best.

496
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:16,347
The level design proposal is way too high level

497
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:17,247
and not detailed enough.

498
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,910
And you might be thinking, this seems harsh,

499
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,870
or it's really short.

500
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:25,193
But as my other examples show, this is actually good feedback,

501
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,536
because they're actually letting me know what part of the test

502
00:23:28,936 --> 00:23:32,699
they didn't like, and also that it's too high level, which

503
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,500
meant that I learned something from doing this test.

504
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,503
I also have examples of situations

505
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:39,984
where it seems like the companies forgot

506
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:42,446
to check my profile before they asked me to do the test.

507
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:48,359
From the test I answered with 30 pages, three days later I received this.

508
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:50,542
Thanks for your reply, Peter.

509
00:23:51,783 --> 00:23:54,767
We just found out that a US work visa would be tough to get in your case.

510
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:01,354
So that just hurts, and it leaves you wondering how to do better in the future.

511
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:04,338
And the last one in the same category.

512
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:08,757
We were impressed with the effort you put forth in the

513
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:09,398
scripting test.

514
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:11,759
While your background is impressive, we were going to

515
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,660
focus on candidates not requiring sponsorship.

516
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,782
We apologize for not recognizing this requirement

517
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:16,302
ahead of time.

518
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:20,585
But at least they recognized they made sort of a mistake.

519
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:24,047
And of course, it's also reassuring to receive positive

520
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,808
feedback in regards to my answer.

521
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:28,950
My point about feedback, therefore, is that it can cause

522
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,851
a lot of frustration not to be able to learn

523
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:31,752
from doing these tests.

524
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,277
And if you feel comfortable enough,

525
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:36,178
then try to push a little extra to receive

526
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:36,939
some of that feedback.

527
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:39,660
I hope that these concrete examples will

528
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,341
help you prepare for similar situations

529
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:43,682
and let you rest assure that you're not the only one

530
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:44,823
to have dealt with these results.

531
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:48,504
So we're here at the end of my talk.

532
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:52,266
And I just want to quickly recap some of the major topics

533
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:53,127
from the talk.

534
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:56,008
Design test comes in many shapes and forms.

535
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:58,309
So prepare to be an agile designer,

536
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,030
even though you feel specialized

537
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,691
within one single design area.

538
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:05,523
Read, understand, and consider all parts of the test

539
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,663
before you start answering it.

540
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:08,884
Seek, oh, sorry.

541
00:25:09,244 --> 00:25:12,284
You don't have to sit with the test completely alone.

542
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,305
It's always good with inspiration.

543
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:20,066
You will find yourself wanting to design entire worlds

544
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:23,827
and games to make your ideas and passion for it come through.

545
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:25,848
So prepare for the test to take time

546
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:27,808
and utilize that time as well as possible.

547
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,922
Don't do everything you can to adapt.

548
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:40,046
You want to leave some of you and your answers, as long as

549
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:41,508
it's easily readable, of course.

550
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,473
Lastly, and probably most importantly, prepare to do a

551
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:49,195
lot of work, potentially multiple times, and all that

552
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:51,177
without receiving any feedback at all.

553
00:25:51,698 --> 00:25:52,278
But don't give up.

554
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:53,920
So.

555
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:55,858
That was it for me.

556
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:57,879
I hope that this helps you guys find,

557
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:00,960
help you chase the perfect designer job.

558
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,520
Here's a link to the tests.

559
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,381
I hope that it will also help you prepare

560
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:06,901
for any future tests that you might be doing.

561
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:11,163
I was told to please remind you to do the surveys

562
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,243
at the end of this, but I'm really happy you all came

563
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,083
and thanks for coming.
