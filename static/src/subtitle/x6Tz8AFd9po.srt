1
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:11,565
Today's topics will cover a short introduction and background on who we are, how to source

2
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:18,634
vehicles, planning and prepping for a vehicle recording session, the actual recording session,

3
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:21,697
editing and asset creation, and also implementing.

4
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:24,843
So who are we?

5
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:28,545
We're an audio outsourcing company based in Stockholm,

6
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:28,945
Sweden.

7
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:31,907
We do sound design for film, games, and trailers.

8
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:34,909
We do complex field recording, like guns, ambulances,

9
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,029
vehicles, and much more.

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,351
We produce sound effect libraries that we sell online.

11
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,112
We also have a long experience from music.

12
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:45,113
Our composer, Mats Lundgren, is highly skilled at

13
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:47,934
composting and producing adaptive music for games.

14
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:51,915
And Bernard here on my side is also a very well-established

15
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,235
mix engineer and has done several international number

16
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:59,997
ones and recorded and mixed the music for the Mamma Mia

17
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:00,277
movies.

18
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:06,098
So here's a small selection of titles where our sounds or

19
00:01:06,178 --> 00:01:07,118
music can be heard.

20
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:27,257
We also recorded for these two films, which we are very proud of.

21
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:34,101
And right now we're involved in a research project together with Volvo Cars,

22
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:39,625
where we are looking at self-driving cars and the interaction between the user and the vehicle.

23
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:46,589
We'll focus on establishing a trust to feel safe in the vehicle and also on preventing motion sickness.

24
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:53,471
And here's what a day at the office can look like.

25
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,286
Thank you.

26
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:23,014
OK, hi, I'm Bernard.

27
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:26,356
I want to tell you a little story about how this vehicle

28
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,057
recording once started.

29
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:32,479
My background and my work through life has been music

30
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,820
recording and music producing.

31
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,402
But my hobby has been, from the beginning,

32
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:38,803
cars and car racing.

33
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:46,027
And from 2001 and onwards, I was driving the Swedish

34
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,208
championships for GT cars.

35
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:49,929
Actually, in that Porsche you see there.

36
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:55,526
And one of my fastest competitors had a computer game

37
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,666
company called Simbin.

38
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:03,389
They were doing simulation games for PC, computer games,

39
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,631
for simulation games for racing cars.

40
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:15,213
He knew about my profession and asked me if we could record some race cars and try to

41
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:18,193
do that to deliver assets for his game.

42
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:25,075
And what we did was we brought my race car and we hired a lot of film recording equipment

43
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,555
and went to a racetrack.

44
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:31,816
We also prepared the car by taking off the silencers.

45
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:36,499
to get an open exhaust sound. Swedish racetracks have

46
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,622
very hard sound regulations, but we wanted to have

47
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:42,184
the straight exhaust sound, so that's what we did.

48
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,601
We put some mics in different spots,

49
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:48,464
and put the recorders in red.

50
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:52,168
And I started and drove out on the track.

51
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:56,012
And I managed to do like four laps

52
00:05:56,192 --> 00:06:00,836
before the track owner came out yelling and told us to stop,

53
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,198
because it was too noisy.

54
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:07,343
But we got four laps, and it sounded like this.

55
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,304
And I'll see you next time.

56
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:16,426
Bye.

57
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:16,588
Bye.

58
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:16,831
Bye.

59
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:49,105
Yeah, okay.

60
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:55,410
And then, well, back in the studio, we discussed how to get this organic sound into the games,

61
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:03,996
because what we had heard earlier was loop-based sounds recorded on dinos, and we felt that

62
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:11,961
they are really dead in sounding, and often roomy, because the dinos were often in a room,

63
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:12,401
actually.

64
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:22,511
And we took, we tried to find out our own method to put the actual driving sound into the game.

65
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:28,257
And what we did in the beginning was to create loops with basic audio tools,

66
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:33,242
like we did some evening out the RPM on a...

67
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:41,797
sound like this. We used software samplers and programmed the pitch wheel to get almost

68
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:48,382
a straight RPM and try to loop and managed to do really good things. And that was how

69
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:53,705
it started, actually. And we started to record race cars for this company first.

70
00:07:54,606 --> 00:08:00,593
And after a while, we were contacted by other computer game companies to record other types

71
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:07,101
of vehicles, a lot of military stuff like tanks, airplanes, and that's the way it was.

72
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:12,227
And if you look here, this is a bit like what it looked like when we were starting.

73
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,533
And today, it's more or less like this.

74
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:17,774
You see all the bags.

75
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:20,956
And we are lots of people coming at the same time.

76
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:24,439
And we can manage to do, like maybe if we're talking cars,

77
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,123
maybe five to seven cars a day if we are well organized.

78
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:31,125
OK.

79
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,152
So I will talk a bit about the sourcing of the vehicles.

80
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:41,193
Where do we find them?

81
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:45,258
Obviously, internet is a great resource.

82
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,862
You can search for clubs with car owners.

83
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:52,905
You can also search authorities on license plates

84
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,727
if you walk down the street and hear a car that you like.

85
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:00,531
Or even search for certain models.

86
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,374
We also approach museums and private collectors

87
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:03,954
around the world.

88
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,641
And we have a huge network, since Ben had mentioned,

89
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:11,742
he's been racing, I grew up in a car family as well,

90
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:14,142
we have a huge network among friends as well,

91
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,523
which keeps growing the more things we do.

92
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:22,144
It can be challenging sourcing.

93
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:29,085
Once I tried to find tanks in France at a museum,

94
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:34,146
and I don't know any French except the bad words.

95
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:39,591
So I tried to write in English and then I used Google Translate

96
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,873
and I sent them emails and I thought it went pretty well.

97
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,075
I could translate their emails back

98
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:47,297
and it came to a point where they didn't understand anything

99
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,280
and asked me to call them, and then we ran into issues

100
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,383
and we needed a French-speaking person to help us out.

101
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,426
Another example is with a Messerschmitt 109,

102
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,307
a German plane from the Second World War,

103
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:01,708
which is very rare.

104
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,590
There's like five of them with the original engine flying.

105
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,533
And I tried to get access for almost two years, I think,

106
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:11,975
before I got an email from someone who knew someone,

107
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,376
and that opened all the doors for us.

108
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:16,598
And that recording was later used for Dunkirk as well,

109
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:19,620
because it was so hard for them to find anything else.

110
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:25,976
You need to figure out what to record.

111
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:28,238
It doesn't have to be authentic,

112
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,280
like many of the old World War II stuff

113
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,541
has replaced engines.

114
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:36,506
And that's the case with the Messerschmitts,

115
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:37,547
for instance, the 109s.

116
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:38,487
There's lots of them,

117
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,369
but very few have the right engine.

118
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,472
Also, tanks can have replaced engines and so on.

119
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:45,494
And then...

120
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:50,059
we need to look at if you want a stock car or a modified car.

121
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,001
Stock cars often sound very boring.

122
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:54,904
There's not much tone coming out from the exhaust pipes.

123
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,787
And you need that tone to make assets for games.

124
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:01,430
So for games, it's often more you're better off with a

125
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,074
modified exhaust system, while for film, it's the other way

126
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:05,695
around often.

127
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:18,897
And then you need to understand what the client is looking for, as in this case, if the client wants the Volvo in the lower picture, and you find the Volvo in the upper picture, the client is not going to understand really what you did.

128
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,441
Sourcing is extremely time consuming.

129
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:31,122
Some clients want video approvals on every car you find.

130
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:32,603
So you need to find a car first.

131
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:35,364
You need to make sure it has the right information.

132
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:37,684
And then you need to make a video with it

133
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:40,185
where you record the engine running

134
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:41,226
and some blips and stuff.

135
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,786
And then you need to send that to the client

136
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,847
and either you get an approval or a disapproval.

137
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,688
And if you get a disapproval,

138
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:48,288
you need to start all over again.

139
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:52,767
And if you can't find the correct vehicle,

140
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:55,513
can be old collector items and stuff,

141
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:57,196
then you need to find a substitute

142
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:58,619
that's as close as possible.

143
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,163
So you need to do a lot of research on that.

144
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:07,133
And once you get to actually record, you might want to be

145
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:08,854
cost and time efficient.

146
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:12,574
You might need, like Bernard said, we do between five and

147
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:14,015
eight cars in a day.

148
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:16,375
So you need to find all these cars.

149
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:19,256
You need them at the same location at the same time.

150
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:24,157
So then you need to look at if there's a location nearby

151
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:26,097
where you can get all the cars, or if you need

152
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:29,198
transportation to collect the cars and bring

153
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:29,958
them to the location.

154
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,318
And nowadays, we have the luxury of actually having a

155
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:36,180
person dedicated to only doing this, which is very, very

156
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:36,541
helpful.

157
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:44,987
It saves us a lot of time.

158
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:48,670
Then we have the planning and the preparation.

159
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,952
Planning is everything, as it says here.

160
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:54,795
You need paperwork in place.

161
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:57,497
You need an agreement with the owner to clarify what you

162
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:58,317
expect to get.

163
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:01,239
involved.

164
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,900
And more important, also you need an agreement with the

165
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,781
client that covers access fees, track rentals, travel

166
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,822
expenses, equipment, staff, insurances, delivery dates,

167
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:13,422
and so on.

168
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:18,103
And very important is to also cover the what if.

169
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:21,224
We make sure that we can't be held responsible for things

170
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:25,345
that we can't control, such as cancellations due to weather,

171
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,106
delayed flights, vehicles not starting, and damaging

172
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,007
vehicles, and so on.

173
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:36,886
As an example, in the film we showed earlier, there was this

174
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,747
huge bomb plane flying by.

175
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:43,152
And when we went to Canada to record that plane, we were not

176
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:44,092
sure about the weather.

177
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:45,614
So we needed to have three days.

178
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:48,837
Even if we just needed one day to record, we needed the two

179
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,739
extra days in case there would be bad weather.

180
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,501
So it's things like that that you need to

181
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,262
consider all the time.

182
00:13:57,192 --> 00:14:00,414
And recently we also had a client who asked for vehicles

183
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:01,654
that were driven on snow.

184
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,235
And Sweden is known for snow, I guess.

185
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,316
We didn't think it would be a problem at

186
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:07,096
this time of the year.

187
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,637
But there were no snow in sight at all.

188
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:10,637
We looked everywhere.

189
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,698
We followed the forecast all over Sweden,

190
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:13,618
and there was no snow.

191
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:14,799
So we got a bit panicked.

192
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,140
And then I saw on Facebook a friend of mine was out skiing

193
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,181
somewhere, cross country.

194
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,961
So I called him and I asked him, where are you?

195
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,822
And he got us the number to the skiing facility.

196
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:30,543
And we had them open it up for us nighttime, putting on all

197
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:32,844
the lights so we could record their nighttime and we could

198
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:33,884
deliver on the date.

199
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:39,845
But if we wouldn't have had the clause that we can't be

200
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:43,066
held responsible, then it would have been problematic if

201
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:44,027
we didn't find any snow.

202
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:48,780
Another example is with one client, we recorded very, very

203
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,561
old vehicles.

204
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:53,226
And when we came to one location, the vehicle didn't

205
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:54,007
start at all.

206
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:57,892
It did start the day before, so they were kind of puzzled it

207
00:14:57,912 --> 00:14:58,873
didn't start this time.

208
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:03,479
But in that case, we needed to add in the agreement that for

209
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:03,959
every

210
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,823
recording session, we would make sure there was a mechanic

211
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:08,644
at the place as well.

212
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,066
So they would start the vehicle the day before to make

213
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:11,687
sure it ran.

214
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,909
And when we came to the location, there would be a

215
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,832
mechanic, so in case it didn't start, we at least had the

216
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:20,015
chance to work with this mechanic to get it started.

217
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:25,306
Also, with damaging vehicles, we learned the hard way.

218
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:29,350
We recorded a Lamborghini that broke down.

219
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:31,152
It's not fun.

220
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:32,313
It was not our fault.

221
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,795
But that meant we couldn't deliver anything to the

222
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:36,717
client, and they didn't pay for anything.

223
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,459
So we had to cover all the expenses ourselves.

224
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,577
On the other hand, when it comes to responsibility,

225
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:46,820
we take full responsibility for everything that we can affect,

226
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,822
making sure that we have equipment that works,

227
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:53,304
that we have staff that is doing what they should, and so on.

228
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:56,406
So you need to take responsibilities as well.

229
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,811
Another part of planning and preparations

230
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:06,213
is finding a location.

231
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:12,084
We started out driving on public roads, driving cars for 200 miles per hour.

232
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,787
And it's irresponsible and it's dangerous.

233
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:20,452
You get a less controlled recording session, which gives a less good result.

234
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:22,174
So don't try it at home.

235
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:26,438
Today we always try to rent a track, if possible.

236
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,042
So when you know where you will be recording,

237
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:35,044
you need to look at a map and try to identify disturbances

238
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,465
and problems with the location.

239
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:40,227
It can be nearby airports, it can be railways, highways,

240
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,468
or other noise disturbances.

241
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,291
But it can also be safety regulations, restrictions,

242
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:50,032
and limited daylight, depending on where you are.

243
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,094
So you need to identify all these things.

244
00:16:55,765 --> 00:17:01,646
You need to explain the intention for the people at the location, if it's an airport for instance,

245
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:07,288
and explain in detail what we need to do, that we're attaching equipment on their vehicles,

246
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:15,470
the driving that is required, staff on the airstrip, we need to be out on the actual airstrip,

247
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:21,692
you're not allowed to do that everywhere, and maybe you need to do very, very low flybys.

248
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:28,242
Again, when we recorded that plane in Canada,

249
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,843
it's a huge bomber plane from World War II.

250
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:35,604
There was only one flying at the time when we did that.

251
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,185
We were at the commercial airport

252
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,505
where they were not allowed to do flyovers

253
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,266
on a low altitude.

254
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,306
So to work around that,

255
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:47,247
the pilot reported to the tower

256
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:48,407
that we're coming in to land.

257
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,891
They came in, and when they were where we were,

258
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,392
they reported to the tower back again,

259
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:54,554
we were aborting the landing,

260
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:56,515
and then they took off again.

261
00:17:57,496 --> 00:17:59,719
And they repeated that seven times, I think.

262
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:04,563
So if there is a will, there is a way.

263
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:08,347
You also need to keep an eye on the weather forecast.

264
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:09,988
Is it a cancel or is it a go?

265
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,471
Sometimes you don't really know,

266
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:13,692
and then it's a bit of a gamble.

267
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,839
If you're abroad, language might be an issue.

268
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,742
So it could be a good thing to have the maneuvers you want

269
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:25,804
to perform translated on the paper or in the predator.

270
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:27,905
You need a good driver.

271
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,567
We are lucky to have Bernard, who's extremely experienced.

272
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:33,409
Whenever we can, we let him drive, not planes, though, and

273
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,350
tanks maybe, but cars.

274
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:40,193
And then you have the unknown and the unwanted.

275
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:48,020
This first example here that I'm going to play to you is in Swedish, but I think you will get it.

276
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,942
This is a sound dampener.

277
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:54,504
You did this when I came and drove by here.

278
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,925
When I came down here, it was still heard down there.

279
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:58,927
On the other side of the forest, it was still there.

280
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,187
I understand.

281
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:02,048
Now it's done with the noise.

282
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:03,509
Now I'm taking this with a lens filter.

283
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:05,070
We've had enough of his shit.

284
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,891
She's obviously not too happy.

285
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:11,405
And she eventually called the police.

286
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:15,648
Police came, and they were super excited what we were doing.

287
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:17,729
They didn't care about the poor lady.

288
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:25,615
And the other example is from a very frustrated recordist.

289
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:29,118
Fucking birds.

290
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,341
Fuck you, fucking birds.

291
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:35,263
Die, you fucking birds.

292
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:48,195
We were recording old planes and there were obviously birds, different kinds of

293
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:54,160
different kind of were birds I guess. So here's a simple rule of field recording

294
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,062
there's always birds if you want to record planes and there's always planes

295
00:19:58,183 --> 00:19:59,203
if you want to record birds.

296
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:08,406
Next part of the planning and preparation is equipment.

297
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,689
You need to charge batteries, of course, and all that.

298
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:16,735
You need to bring zip ties, gaffer tape, cables, memory cards,

299
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:18,878
backup drives, sync to machines.

300
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:25,360
You need to look at the weather. Some zip types, they break if it's too cold.

301
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,021
Some gaffer tape doesn't stick if it's too cold or wet.

302
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,622
And you still need a gaffer tape that's very gentle to the vehicles,

303
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:34,943
especially if it's like luxury vehicles.

304
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:37,584
So there's these kinds of things to consider.

305
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,553
You might want to have rental equipment.

306
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,294
If we go abroad and record planes,

307
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:46,717
we need tons of sandbags and microphone stands and cables.

308
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:49,279
And it's much better, of course, to rent that on the location

309
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,760
and have it delivered to the airport

310
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,262
than trying to bring that in your luggage.

311
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,525
Another thing is packing your bags,

312
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:00,887
which might sound ridiculous.

313
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,888
But we have learned the importance of that

314
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:03,969
as well the hard way.

315
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:10,069
And we try to bring as much as possible in our carry-ons.

316
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,574
It causes you some issues in the security, but it's well

317
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:13,935
worth it.

318
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,821
The rest that we can't bring in the carry-ons, we split up in

319
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:19,721
different bags.

320
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,642
But I would advise you not to put all the recorders in one

321
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,022
bag and all the microphones in another bag.

322
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:29,143
Because when you go to Japan and you change flight

323
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:32,143
somewhere, and then you arrive in Japan and one bag is lost,

324
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:35,144
then you only have recorders or only microphones.

325
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:37,344
And it will make it very difficult.

326
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:41,165
Yep.

327
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:42,945
Bernard will talk a bit more about the equipment.

328
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:52,301
OK, here's a picture of the basic recorders and the

329
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:55,522
microphones we have just put out on the table just for you

330
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:55,903
to see.

331
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:58,044
And I will show you a list here.

332
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,425
We start with the recorders.

333
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:03,267
We usually record vehicles at 96 kilohertz, 24 bits.

334
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:09,931
And occasionally, especially for special sound effects,

335
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:15,355
we go up to 192 kilohertz, but usually 96 for vehicles.

336
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,078
The onboard recorders we use on the vehicles

337
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,040
are often this first list,

338
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,621
Sonosax R4+, Saxon Fusion,

339
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,763
Zoom F8, Sound Devices 702, and the new MixPre.

340
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:34,550
And for exterior, we use sound devices 788, 7022T,

341
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:38,694
SEX, Confucian, and some smaller recorders

342
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:43,199
like the Sony D100 and M10 and the Olympus LS12.

343
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,123
And, yeah, that's just a list of the equipment.

344
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:49,606
And then we will look a bit closer on the microphones.

345
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:54,754
So this is a basic setup we do for recording cars.

346
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:58,957
The car here is a McLaren 570S, I think.

347
00:22:59,618 --> 00:23:00,798
It has a twin exhaust.

348
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:06,243
What we use on the exhaust, always as basic, is the DPA 4062.

349
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:06,923
They can stand 155 dB.

350
00:23:10,326 --> 00:23:13,910
They are taped on this one here, one there and one there.

351
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,715
And then we have two electric voices, RE50,

352
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:21,981
which are really good to take up a little bit more of the low frequencies.

353
00:23:23,258 --> 00:23:26,279
And you can see it here, one there, and one there.

354
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,281
And also, we have an extra 4062 sitting a bit from the

355
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:39,305
exhaust to get a bit more of the low frequencies, because

356
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,826
the wavelength has some time to grow from the sound.

357
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:46,448
Occasionally, we use some extra mics also for low end

358
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:49,069
and bite, and I will show you some examples a bit later.

359
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:52,953
If we look here, we have an engine.

360
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:58,598
This is a Datsun 240 Fairlady, 240Z.

361
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,184
We use DPA 4061s and 4062s, depending on noise level.

362
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:08,568
Often, the 4062s we put on the intake.

363
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:11,931
And on the intake, if we can, we try

364
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:15,814
to open the intake and put the microphone inside

365
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:16,575
if it's possible.

366
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:21,629
We use the Shure VP88 for stereo image.

367
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:24,874
When you're mixing the engine and you want some stereo image,

368
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:28,300
it's very difficult to get a good stereo image

369
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,424
if you don't have a stereo microphone, which

370
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,666
you can pan a bit out.

371
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:38,039
We use occasionally, of course, the Sennheiser MKH 8020.

372
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,822
Actually, you can see it here on the picture.

373
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:44,425
And the Crown PZM.

374
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:48,829
And actually, we try with different mics all the time to

375
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:51,051
get the different sounds out of the engine.

376
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,092
Here we have a setup for the interior of the car.

377
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:02,574
It's a stereo pair, DPA4021s, which you can see here.

378
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:05,536
With a head-through coil.

379
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:16,745
suction cup. Yeah, it's here on the on the window stereo pair and we have the Sennheiser

380
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:23,570
AmbioMic for VR reasons and also that it has a good sound for the interior and occasionally we

381
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:32,036
also use extra stereo pair of DPA4061s. I think the next one is also this is from a

382
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:34,919
and Mercedes AMG GTR.

383
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,321
also the ambient mic.

384
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:39,862
OK.

385
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:41,764
Let me see where we are.

386
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:49,469
For the exterior microphones, I had to show you the basic

387
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:52,971
configuration we use almost always for recording.

388
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,694
This is an airfield north of Stockholm, which we often rent,

389
00:25:57,655 --> 00:26:00,637
an old military airfield which is not used

390
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:02,898
anymore for airplanes.

391
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:07,270
So we basically start at, we have the station A,

392
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:10,634
we have the station B, and we have two turning points.

393
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:14,957
and also a place for a distant microphone placement.

394
00:26:15,597 --> 00:26:18,078
So if we have a look on the station A,

395
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,959
this is me and a Dodge Challenger.

396
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,121
We use the HoloPhone, which is actually

397
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:29,142
an eight-channel microphone, but we use four channels for it

398
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:32,904
and record it in quad, left, right, and left surround,

399
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:33,624
right surround.

400
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,124
It's this one here.

401
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:43,490
We also use a very wide stereo pair, in this case Sennheiser MKH 8060.

402
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:51,335
You can see the right-hand microphone here, and it's a very wide stereo pair actually.

403
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:57,399
The left one is before this picture, so you couldn't see it.

404
00:26:58,036 --> 00:27:00,698
And also we use a shotgun, handheld, of course,

405
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:02,519
a Neumann RSM-191.

406
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:06,242
It's the one laying down here on the ground.

407
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:11,646
So this is station A. And station B is this one,

408
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:15,149
handheld Sanken CSS5.

409
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:22,374
And we have an ORTF set up with Sennheiser MKH-8040

410
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:24,015
in this package down here.

411
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,827
And for the turning points, we have an RTF set up for the first turning point,

412
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,209
which shops microphones.

413
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:38,575
And turning point two, in this case, a little simpler recorder.

414
00:27:38,976 --> 00:27:42,720
And also on the distant microphones, we have a simpler recorder.

415
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:47,904
This is the basic thing we do for car recording.

416
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:52,487
And of course, it's very different with every vehicle.

417
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,389
So if we go to this picture, this is.

418
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,025
A Spitfire recorded at the Duxford in England, in north of London.

419
00:28:03,926 --> 00:28:09,030
This is for the movie Dunkirk and Richard King, who was the supervising sound editor for the movie,

420
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:13,294
asked us absolutely to put mics inside the engine compartment.

421
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,556
And that was not something they really liked.

422
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:16,777
During flight.

423
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:18,418
During flight, yeah, actually.

424
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:23,122
So you can see me here trying to put in an Electrovoice RE50

425
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:24,363
in the compartment.

426
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:28,106
And we had them to, of course, take off all the hoods

427
00:28:28,446 --> 00:28:29,007
from the plane.

428
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:30,568
But we managed to do that.

429
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:34,691
If we go to next picture, we have

430
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:39,915
this is our colleague, Niklas, recording this cigarette Top Gun

431
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:40,636
boat.

432
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:45,599
And he used the same setup as we did on the car.

433
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:50,462
So this is a DPA 4062 taped on the boat.

434
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,504
And here is actually an RE50 in a plastic cone

435
00:28:55,224 --> 00:28:56,205
to get rid of wind.

436
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:59,887
I think it did 100 knots or something, that boat.

437
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:01,588
It's super fast.

438
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:09,346
Coming over here, we have a recording of a military APC vehicle.

439
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:11,267
This is the exhaust.

440
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:16,889
Again, a 4062 here, an ElectroVoice RE50.

441
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:23,232
And also we use, in this case, we use the DV Moon mic also to get up some extra low frequencies.

442
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:33,458
Next picture is the tracks on the tank, which in this case has an RE-50 microphone attached.

443
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:34,900
No cable yet, but...

444
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,963
Here we have a motorcycle.

445
00:29:40,023 --> 00:29:44,226
Motorcycles are very difficult. There is always a lot of wind

446
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:48,249
issues, and it's difficult to fasten the microphones.

447
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:51,612
And there's also no place to put a recorder.

448
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:54,614
So what we do, we use a backpack on the driver.

449
00:29:55,655 --> 00:30:01,419
And you can see here is an ElectroVoice RE50 striped to

450
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:03,501
the back of the motorcycle.

451
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:07,063
And this is at station A. So you can see the wide pair and

452
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,704
the hollow foam.

453
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:12,467
And this is what it looks like in the backpack.

454
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,472
In this case, a Saxon Fusion and a Sony.

455
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:17,775
No, a Zoom F8, of course.

456
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:22,902
While recording planes, there's...

457
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:27,407
Different ways we record them, we record them standing still

458
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:34,729
on ground with all the RPMs we can drive on ground.

459
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,750
And it's very difficult to know what

460
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,151
microphone will sound good.

461
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:42,311
So we have microphones everywhere.

462
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:53,678
As you can see, there are microphones here, there, there, there, there in front, in the back, on the sides, and also very different distances.

463
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,343
And it's impossible to know which of the microphone that sounds good until we are at the studio, actually.

464
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:03,825
So that's something we learn more and more.

465
00:31:03,885 --> 00:31:11,950
But also, there's so much wind, so it's impossible to find out before what mics are sounding good.

466
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,691
Okay, then we come to this little thing.

467
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:22,434
This is about the recording schedule.

468
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:26,477
It's actually a long list of maneuvers that we do

469
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:33,962
by driving and reversing and going around the turning points

470
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:36,283
at different speeds.

471
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:40,686
If you are interested of the actual checklist for this,

472
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:42,507
we can talk about it a bit later,

473
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:44,489
but it's a bit too long to take in this.

474
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:53,060
speech. The thing is, we do everything actually often in three speeds. We call it the granny

475
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,585
driving, the medium driving, and the bank robber driving.

476
00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:01,408
So that's three of the different things.

477
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:05,411
And we try to get all the maneuvers you can do with the

478
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:07,233
car actually recorded.

479
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:14,278
And we also, of course, record fully on the cars, or

480
00:32:14,338 --> 00:32:17,220
vehicles, all vehicles, as much as we can.

481
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:23,226
And we also record IR sweeps on the interior,

482
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:26,389
so you can use the acoustics for later

483
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:29,572
if there is a dialogue inside the car or whatever like that.

484
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:32,756
OK.

485
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,438
And there, here's a very important rule.

486
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:41,627
for recording three times, you can forget it anyway.

487
00:32:42,768 --> 00:32:44,610
It's always a problem.

488
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,913
But we have to slate all recorders very good to know

489
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,315
when you come back to the studio.

490
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,777
When you're recording, you always know what you're doing.

491
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:55,461
But like two days later, you have forgot everything.

492
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:58,464
So slating all recorders are very important.

493
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:09,512
Yes, as I told you a bit before, of course, recording vehicles,

494
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:14,016
different vehicles require different methods, of course.

495
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:19,061
If we look at planes, we record them standing still on ground

496
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:22,043
and, as I told you, different RPMs, as much

497
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:23,304
as we can do on ground.

498
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:26,367
And then, of course, we record flybys.

499
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:31,013
On tanks and heavy vehicles, it's, for instance,

500
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:33,555
very difficult to record ramps because they

501
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,236
have such a short RPM range.

502
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:41,459
So there we concentrate a bit on steady RPMs

503
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,661
and try to get with as much load as possible, of course.

504
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:47,803
And also the same with boats.

505
00:33:54,282 --> 00:34:01,750
Here we have some difficult tests that can occur with recordings.

506
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:04,413
First one, I have wind.

507
00:34:05,814 --> 00:34:08,137
Wind is always a problem when you record vehicles.

508
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,419
So I will show you fast.

509
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:12,641
Here's a little trick that we use a lot.

510
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:15,164
This is a McDonald's cup.

511
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:21,153
And also as you saw on the boat picture before, you use it as a windshield.

512
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:24,818
Put the microphone inside to get rid of wind.

513
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:25,820
Highly professional.

514
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,241
Highly professional, yes.

515
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:30,626
You always have to go to McDonald's first to pick up some.

516
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:37,556
That was the first you took it, yeah?

517
00:34:38,797 --> 00:34:41,380
And unwanted noise, like nearby traffic,

518
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,821
humans on location.

519
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:48,567
We have had dogs catching microphones running off.

520
00:34:48,747 --> 00:34:50,949
Heard of sheep coming out on fields

521
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:54,372
right next to the track, which is, of course, dangerous.

522
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,275
And yeah, stuff like that.

523
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:05,451
Yes, we have had, of course, a lot of failure on equipment during the years.

524
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:08,193
And yeah, it's the same picture here.

525
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,777
You can see this is a burnt shore beta M58.

526
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:17,542
While recording cars and old vehicles, something is always really hot.

527
00:35:18,423 --> 00:35:19,744
And that is a problem.

528
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:20,765
So cables.

529
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:24,566
they melt and microphones burn up.

530
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:30,047
And also in the beginning, we recorded almost everything to

531
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,468
try to record to hard disk.

532
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:36,469
But that didn't work good on race cars, because it sounded

533
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:39,149
great, and the recordings worked fine in the pit and

534
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:40,769
going out in the pit lane.

535
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:44,170
But then when the G-forces went too high, the

536
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,290
hard disk stopped.

537
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,811
So there was nothing when the car came in.

538
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:54,514
So nowadays we record everything to these small SD cards.

539
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,375
Yeah.

540
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:58,856
Okay, it's yours.

541
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,838
This is recording tanks in the UK.

542
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:06,140
So far we have only rolled the tank out on the field.

543
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,782
And you can already see what the field is starting to look like.

544
00:36:09,802 --> 00:36:12,964
So you can imagine after the bank robber driving what it looks like.

545
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:16,726
And then you might have this.

546
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:36,919
So it was obviously someone's feet.

547
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:37,500
Oops, sorry.

548
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,884
We had been given permission, of course, to go there, but some mistake must have occurred

549
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:44,184
somehow.

550
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:49,787
Yeah, they didn't understand that a tank makes some issues.

551
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:57,392
And, yeah, the next one is yours.

552
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:06,877
Yeah, the next one is, yeah, bad driving due to drivers not understanding why we are doing

553
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:13,602
different maneuvers, which of course can be difficult if you're not into sound recording.

554
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:22,289
And also there can be, as Max mentioned before, communication problems with the driver or the

555
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:22,649
pilot.

556
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:29,919
So we try to, for cars and motorcycles and that type of vehicles, we try to drive ourselves.

557
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:37,951
A few of us are driving different things, but when we come to a plane, of course, I have no problem.

558
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:41,493
plane education or pilot education,

559
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:43,314
so then we have to trust the pilot,

560
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,917
but we usually use somebody that we can speak to

561
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:49,338
as an, what do you call it?

562
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,039
Like a specialist.

563
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,261
Yeah, that can transfer what we want,

564
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:56,283
so the pilot understands.

565
00:37:57,303 --> 00:38:00,786
And we write these long lists with maneuvers to do.

566
00:38:02,165 --> 00:38:09,090
And about communication problems, I went to Japan to record cars and there was this one car that we could not drive ourselves.

567
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,411
It was a Japanese driver.

568
00:38:11,312 --> 00:38:14,014
He didn't know any English. I didn't know any Japanese.

569
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:17,476
And it was very difficult to get what we needed.

570
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:22,120
So the only Japanese word I actually know is moikai, which means one more time.

571
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:26,483
Okay.

572
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:27,984
So...

573
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:30,826
Next.

574
00:38:32,217 --> 00:38:37,265
This is also a rule, back up, back up, back up, which is very

575
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:39,729
important, of course, so you know that you have something

576
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,793
with you when you come back home.

577
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:44,498
Let's see, where are we next?

578
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:49,807
OK, a little bit about editing and asset creation.

579
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:56,111
Today in the studio, we use mainly Prutools for doing

580
00:38:56,231 --> 00:39:01,174
assets, and we use FMOD and Rev for testing sounds when we

581
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,495
are doing loops, for instance, or ramps.

582
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:06,798
But Pro Tools is our main tool.

583
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,540
And you can see a list there of plugins.

584
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:14,083
But we are like four or five people doing assets.

585
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:19,727
And all of us have our own personal choice to what tools

586
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:20,327
to work with.

587
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:24,210
OK.

588
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:33,214
The first thing we do when we come back to this recording studio is to line up everything in time.

589
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:41,119
All our recordings are done and we try to sync everything at 100 percent.

590
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:48,264
And it will look like if we look on the Protus project, you can see here, I will go briefly through.

591
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:53,288
This is a car recording done here in US actually, a Camaro, I think.

592
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:56,910
The first two are like a stereo pair on the interior.

593
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:00,772
Then you have five microphones on the exhaust,

594
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:04,334
and you have four microphones in the engine compartment.

595
00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:09,056
And then these channels here are the station A,

596
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:11,097
which is the holophone in quad,

597
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:14,139
the wide stereo pair,

598
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:17,581
and the handheld RSM-191.

599
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:25,535
And this is two stereo tracks from the station B.

600
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:30,558
And then you have the turning points, two stereo pairs also.

601
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:35,759
So this is what it looks like when you buy a sound from us.

602
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:41,320
Maybe it's cleaned up a bit, of course.

603
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,680
But everything is in time all the time.

604
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,601
So it's very easy to, for instance, edit to a picture if

605
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:50,301
you have an interior thing.

606
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:52,942
And listen for an acceleration, for instance.

607
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:54,582
And then you go over to a.

608
00:40:55,502 --> 00:40:59,384
exterior picture when the car is passing by you can just cut between here and

609
00:40:59,484 --> 00:41:06,487
everything is in sync. So yeah and back one I think yes

610
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:12,452
When creating assets, of course, it's very important

611
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:15,936
that the customer come with the requirement they have for

612
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:16,617
their game.

613
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,004
Depending on what engine they are using, and if it's a loop

614
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:29,329
based system, or ramp based granular playback system, or

615
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:31,191
maybe a combination of both.

616
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:37,480
Also, of course, the sound perspective they want in the assets are very important.

617
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:46,932
And if it's a mono, stereo, surround or surround asset they want.

618
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:49,815
I have a little bit more here to show you.

619
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:58,548
Here is what we do often for ramps, for instance.

620
00:41:59,348 --> 00:42:03,109
It's very difficult to record ramps on some vehicles because

621
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:08,491
you want to load all from the idle and the full load all the

622
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:10,191
way up to the top of RPM.

623
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:15,433
And if it's a powerful sports car, it's easier to get the

624
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:17,213
load on a higher gear.

625
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:22,836
But in the end, then the car will go very, very fast in the

626
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,438
ends, and that's not good because you get more wind.

627
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:32,522
And so often you have to stitch the ramps together from

628
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:35,404
different gear drivings.

629
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:38,165
So I have a little acceleration here.

630
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:41,387
This is what you will hear is this.

631
00:42:42,888 --> 00:42:53,622
Combined, here is the engine and the exhaust on the car and it's stitched so it's the end of the ramp is from another take.

632
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:58,928
It sounds like this. This is the same Camaro as you saw before the picture.

633
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:29,814
As you could hear, there is a supercharger engine also.

634
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:31,835
So the winding comes from the engine compartment.

635
00:43:33,075 --> 00:43:34,756
And we have the acceleration.

636
00:43:34,816 --> 00:43:37,577
This is just the basic recording.

637
00:44:04,816 --> 00:44:06,158
OK.

638
00:44:09,082 --> 00:44:11,506
So finally, implementing a few words on that

639
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:12,928
will be quite quick.

640
00:44:16,576 --> 00:44:19,238
There's a few considerations when you make your assets.

641
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:23,141
You need to look at what frequencies the vehicles are in

642
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,965
and make room for your vehicles in the rest of the game.

643
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:31,789
So if many vehicles have quite a broad range of frequencies,

644
00:44:32,029 --> 00:44:34,031
you need a low end to make it feel powerful

645
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,913
and you need some of the mid to make it sound cool and so on.

646
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,936
And it's important that you get this through in the game.

647
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:46,467
You have to be careful not making sounds too repetitive.

648
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:52,297
In a film, for instance, if you have a car chase or something,

649
00:44:52,337 --> 00:44:54,078
you can always change the camera.

650
00:44:54,118 --> 00:44:57,520
So you can alternate the sound a bit from inside, outside,

651
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,000
and all that.

652
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:00,622
But in many driving games, you have the camera

653
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:03,263
fixed a couple of meters behind the cars for hours.

654
00:45:04,124 --> 00:45:06,265
And that can become quite annoying to listen to

655
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:09,146
if it's too raw sound or so.

656
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,028
So you need to be careful how you tackle that.

657
00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:27,558
With the music, an example of that is I worked on the Mad Max game, and when there's like vehicle combat in that game, there's can be like 5, 6, 7, V8 engines roaring, so it's already quite messy.

658
00:45:28,438 --> 00:45:31,320
And on top of that you want combat music.

659
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,944
So I specifically asked Mats from Pol, who did the music for

660
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:40,189
that game, to make music with less bass information in it,

661
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:43,592
and try to make the music a bit wider so that we could fit

662
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:45,775
the vehicles in between that.

663
00:45:48,657 --> 00:45:51,261
And we also add a lot of add-ons, of course.

664
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:54,846
The engine is just, as I see it, a small part of the vehicle.

665
00:45:54,987 --> 00:45:57,010
All the add-ons are super important.

666
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,176
It can be suspension sounds, chassis transmission, turbos,

667
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:02,678
superchargers, as we're hearing here.

668
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,880
the wheels on the ground, different surfaces and all that.

669
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,841
And I'm gonna show you just very quick in F mode

670
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:11,682
what that can look like.

671
00:46:12,662 --> 00:46:15,123
Yesterday when trying this we had a bit of an issue

672
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:18,244
going between the software, so please bear with me

673
00:46:18,304 --> 00:46:19,764
if you get static on the screen here.

674
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:26,075
Now, it worked fine that way, anyway.

675
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:28,956
So here we have a few different add-ons.

676
00:46:29,096 --> 00:46:33,898
It's Speedwind here, Rolling Tarmac, Tarmac Skids,

677
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:37,079
I think it is on this one, Chassis Rattle,

678
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,579
and Suspension Sounds.

679
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,181
All of this is looping sounds, except for the suspension

680
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:45,302
sounds, which are triggered one shots.

681
00:46:45,822 --> 00:46:47,543
So I'm going to go through these very quick.

682
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:48,603
We don't have much time left here.

683
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:51,504
Speedwind, of course, speed driven.

684
00:46:57,345 --> 00:47:02,587
Maybe it doesn't sound much like this, but adding it on the vehicle makes the vehicle

685
00:47:02,607 --> 00:47:05,668
sit in the world immediately in a very nice way.

686
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:12,910
And then we have tarmac rolling, also speed driven of course.

687
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:18,712
A bit dirty tarmac is setting, there's some dirt in it.

688
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:29,473
And together with the speed we get this.

689
00:47:36,964 --> 00:47:39,127
It adds a lot to the sense of speed.

690
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:45,195
Then we can add skids and spins on this.

691
00:48:00,194 --> 00:48:08,136
Next up we have the chassis rattle. Sounds like this. Also speed driven.

692
00:48:08,156 --> 00:48:11,776
This might be an old vehicle, quite squeaky.

693
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:18,878
I can add speed with that as well.

694
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,380
Then we have the suspension. It's driven by

695
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,220
pyramid polygonal droppings here.

696
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:39,453
And this, of course, has to be fed from the physics of the game

697
00:48:39,573 --> 00:48:42,596
to work properly, but it gives a nice package.

698
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:45,840
So now I'm going to try to go back.

699
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,322
So fingers crossed it's going to work here.

700
00:48:52,117 --> 00:48:52,857
Yep.

701
00:48:55,918 --> 00:48:59,660
So last year, we have some other considerations

702
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:05,062
with implementing, which is more of a game design issues

703
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:07,843
that you can get into.

704
00:49:09,284 --> 00:49:10,904
Game directors is one of them.

705
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:13,785
They make the decisions.

706
00:49:13,846 --> 00:49:16,667
They decide whether the vehicle should be easy to drive,

707
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:18,768
difficult to drive, if there should be a learning curve.

708
00:49:19,888 --> 00:49:23,089
And they also have a saying about what's good and bad often.

709
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,372
And the decisions they make,

710
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:31,673
especially whether it's gonna be hard or easy to drive,

711
00:49:31,713 --> 00:49:34,974
that affects physics and vehicle behavior.

712
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,376
And that indirectly affects audio, of course.

713
00:49:41,137 --> 00:49:43,798
So that's something you need to try to sort out

714
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,338
quite early on on a project.

715
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:47,396
You have level design.

716
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:52,439
If you have V8 cars, powerful muscle cars, physics driven,

717
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,462
going around in the desert, that would mean you wouldn't

718
00:49:57,482 --> 00:49:58,083
have any grip.

719
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:00,845
You would be spinning and skidding around most of the

720
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:03,366
time, but you still need a proper game play and a

721
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:04,427
drivable car.

722
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:07,249
So that gives you quite a contradiction to work with.

723
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:16,264
Another problem with the level design can be, if it's a huge area, nothing that really affects the driving.

724
00:50:16,685 --> 00:50:18,646
So you can go full throttle all the time.

725
00:50:19,886 --> 00:50:25,709
You will eventually either gear out and get a quite annoying sound by just staying on the...

726
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:28,491
straight RPM for a very long time.

727
00:50:29,952 --> 00:50:31,753
Or you might want to try infinite gears,

728
00:50:31,813 --> 00:50:33,875
and then you will have a vehicle just gearing up,

729
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:35,396
gearing up, gearing up, gearing up,

730
00:50:35,476 --> 00:50:37,097
and that will sound ridiculous after a while.

731
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:40,360
On the other hand, if the level design is done

732
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,122
in a different way, you might need to brake sometime,

733
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:45,985
you need to turn, and all that can make the sound

734
00:50:46,045 --> 00:50:46,805
much more alive.

735
00:50:47,286 --> 00:50:48,667
So it's also something you need to look at.

736
00:50:49,794 --> 00:50:51,535
Game pacing, very important.

737
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:54,497
If you have an action game where you enter a vehicle and

738
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:57,519
it should be up at full speed in three seconds and get

739
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,861
through seven gears in that time, it will

740
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:00,621
sound very weird.

741
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:03,163
So you're going to need some kind of filter in between to

742
00:51:03,203 --> 00:51:03,943
make it sound OK.

743
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:12,566
Also, with the physics, the friction on the ground and all that will affect.

744
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:20,211
So you might have done the coolest skidding sounds with a huge difference between low

745
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:21,592
skid, high skid and all that.

746
00:51:21,652 --> 00:51:26,935
But if the friction is set up so you just get one value, totally full skid all the time,

747
00:51:27,955 --> 00:51:32,258
then you need to have like a smoother or something in between that as well to make it work properly.

748
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:39,019
I often say that audio is often the symptom on something else being the cause,

749
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,101
because you get it like a sound bug reported.

750
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,602
Okay, there's something wrong with the audio.

751
00:51:43,062 --> 00:51:44,983
But when you start scratching on the surface,

752
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:46,765
you realize that this is not actually the audio.

753
00:51:46,785 --> 00:51:49,347
The audio is doing exactly what it's told,

754
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:52,829
but it's the physics driving the audio that's not set up correctly.

755
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:56,252
And then we have the mix.

756
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:58,954
You need to make the audio interesting over time.

757
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:07,109
One way to do that with vehicles can be to actually highlight when the player does something.

758
00:52:07,189 --> 00:52:14,736
It can be when he turns, he or she, by the way, brakes, accelerates, bumps into something

759
00:52:14,776 --> 00:52:19,521
and then you can bring up the engine or certain parts during the gameplay.

760
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:24,365
If you just have the engine up front in your face all the time it would be very, very boring

761
00:52:24,385 --> 00:52:24,605
I think.

762
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:33,123
So other sounds to bring up can also be the rattles and the wheels and all that and also the music of course if you're driving for a long period of time.

763
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:41,819
Finally, I will show you just a very short example from in-game clips.

764
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:48,604
It's some footage from Battlefield V. I had the honor to work in-house creating vehicles

765
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:54,989
along DICE, an amazing audio team for Battlefield V. And there's also some footage from the

766
00:52:55,049 --> 00:52:59,612
older Mad Max that I worked on a long time ago, which I still think holds up pretty well

767
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:02,675
actually with great work from Avalanche's audio team.

768
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:08,667
This clip starts out with a V1 rocket coming in the sky,

769
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:13,596
and that sound comes from a crazy Pulse Jet Snowmobile recording that we did.

770
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:49,024
They're not the grand moats or what sits on the hood!

771
00:53:49,044 --> 00:53:49,666
Great power for us!

772
00:54:15,023 --> 00:54:17,624
Yep, that's it for us, so QA.

773
00:54:25,127 --> 00:54:26,908
Hey Max, it's Mike from Grand Trees.

774
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:27,448
How's it going?

775
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:28,468
Hey, good to see you.

776
00:54:28,548 --> 00:54:29,649
Good to see you too.

777
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:32,850
What do you guys use for syncing all the field recorders on site?

778
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,511
Do you guys just jam sync things and then sort of split the recorders up or?

779
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,211
We actually do it very, very manually.

780
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:42,494
First of all, we set the clocks in all the recorders to

781
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:43,655
be at the same time.

782
00:54:44,737 --> 00:54:48,140
Then when we start recording one vehicle, we stop with the

783
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,905
onboard recorders at the first position, do a hand clap, go

784
00:54:52,985 --> 00:54:55,767
up to the next position, do another hand clap, up to the

785
00:54:55,827 --> 00:54:57,549
next position, hand clap, and to the last

786
00:54:57,609 --> 00:54:58,570
position, and hand clap.

787
00:54:58,850 --> 00:54:59,211
Gotcha.

788
00:55:00,412 --> 00:55:00,632
Thanks.

789
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:04,627
How you guys doing? Thank you for the talk. It was great.

790
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:10,829
Um, quick question with, uh, older cars, you have a manual transmission, so when you let off the gas,

791
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,630
the engine naturally decelerates, you get that nice, natural deceleration sound.

792
00:55:14,991 --> 00:55:18,992
But if you're recording more of a modern passenger car, that's not necessarily like a McLaren,

793
00:55:19,412 --> 00:55:23,793
and you have an automatic transmission, when you let off the gas, the engine just goes down to idle.

794
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:30,216
How do, how would you, in a, like, normal automatic car, get that nice deceleration sound, like, from a higher speed?

795
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:39,043
On most automatic cars you have the possibility to lock the gears in first and second.

796
00:55:39,063 --> 00:55:40,224
That's what I do all the time.

797
00:55:40,444 --> 00:55:41,505
Okay, thank you very much.

798
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:42,967
Thank you.

799
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:48,708
Thanks for the talk, and great.

800
00:55:49,148 --> 00:55:51,690
But my question is, you know, like,

801
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,592
what all these sounds have in common,

802
00:55:53,632 --> 00:55:55,013
like whether you're doing vehicles,

803
00:55:55,193 --> 00:55:57,175
or like firearms, tanks, and all that,

804
00:55:57,195 --> 00:55:58,816
they're all like really, really loud.

805
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:01,198
So like when you guys are on location,

806
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:05,942
what's generally like a rule of thumb,

807
00:56:06,142 --> 00:56:08,124
like where you set dBs,

808
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,845
like when you're recording stuff like that,

809
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:12,788
like minus 20, or like does it depend

810
00:56:12,908 --> 00:56:14,910
on whether you're doing it interior, exterior?

811
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,472
That's a topic of its own, really.

812
00:56:19,532 --> 00:56:22,073
Depends on what vehicle or what the recorders you have

813
00:56:22,154 --> 00:56:23,514
and how the preamps work.

814
00:56:23,594 --> 00:56:26,897
Some preamps work better if you drive them pretty hot.

815
00:56:27,037 --> 00:56:28,297
Some don't have to be that hot.

816
00:56:28,337 --> 00:56:30,159
Depends on if you use limiters or not.

817
00:56:30,399 --> 00:56:32,680
We have been going a bit back and forth on that.

818
00:56:33,621 --> 00:56:35,862
On the new recorders we have, which are the Sonos Access,

819
00:56:35,882 --> 00:56:36,863
there are no limiters.

820
00:56:37,063 --> 00:56:38,944
That solves the question for us easy.

821
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:46,412
But not too loud of course, that's not good, but I wouldn't do it too low either.

822
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:52,858
Yeah, because I've recorded access to some firearms too for first-person shooter stuff,

823
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:56,442
and doing vehicles, but I've noticed that at least the gears that I have,

824
00:56:56,482 --> 00:57:01,908
like Soundgear 702 and the Zooms and such, I had to run them really, really cold,

825
00:57:02,288 --> 00:57:03,209
just so they didn't clip.

826
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,401
Yeah, yeah.

827
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:06,502
On the other hand, when you do firearms,

828
00:57:06,942 --> 00:57:08,964
you need the transient to clip because you

829
00:57:09,364 --> 00:57:11,785
need to set your levels on the tails, I would say.

830
00:57:12,106 --> 00:57:12,306
Yeah.

831
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:17,049
And also, there's also, when we record vehicles,

832
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:19,891
we almost always have the same combination,

833
00:57:19,951 --> 00:57:21,332
this recorder with this mic.

834
00:57:21,632 --> 00:57:23,333
And you get an experience.

835
00:57:23,413 --> 00:57:25,294
You know, this is a quite loud car.

836
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:28,376
Let's put it on seven, for instance, or whatever.

837
00:57:28,436 --> 00:57:28,656
Yeah.

838
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:31,398
So you learn, like, a bit.

839
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,986
what the different recorders. It just really depends on the gear that you have. Yeah,

840
00:57:35,748 --> 00:57:39,318
together with the mics. Great. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you.

841
00:57:42,278 --> 00:57:42,679
Thank you.

842
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:43,679
That was an awesome talk.

843
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,400
So my question specifically about how you schedule your

844
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,762
recordings, do you usually go into a recording session with

845
00:57:49,962 --> 00:57:53,383
all of the possible maneuvers you would want to record,

846
00:57:53,624 --> 00:57:54,684
scheduled pre-hand?

847
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:58,146
Or do you have just the things you want to record for the

848
00:57:58,186 --> 00:57:59,526
specific needs of the project?

849
00:58:00,026 --> 00:58:02,187
And also, is this different for film versus games, where

850
00:58:02,227 --> 00:58:04,408
films are more scripted versus games where you could have a?

851
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:07,929
whole array of things that you possibly need the vehicle to do.

852
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:09,970
We have a very structured driving schedule.

853
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:13,530
We always try to do that on every vehicle,

854
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:17,351
no matter what, to future proof.

855
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,852
Many game developers think they only need onboards,

856
00:58:19,912 --> 00:58:21,932
but then they start doing trailers,

857
00:58:22,072 --> 00:58:23,852
promos, and all that kind of things,

858
00:58:23,932 --> 00:58:26,913
and then the exterior stuff comes in quite handy as well often.

859
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:28,653
So we always try to cover that.

860
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:31,770
OK, so you'll cover every possible maneuver

861
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,211
that the vehicle can do?

862
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:33,511
Yes.

863
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:33,871
Yeah.

864
00:58:34,151 --> 00:58:35,032
Everything we can find.

865
00:58:35,452 --> 00:58:37,273
I think we are out of time here, so we

866
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:39,954
need to keep taking the questions outside.

867
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:41,475
But just grab us outside.

868
00:58:41,515 --> 00:58:43,056
We're happy to answer any questions you have.

869
00:58:44,957 --> 00:58:45,537
Thanks for coming.
