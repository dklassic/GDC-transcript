1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,878
Just a reminder before we start to silence your cell phones.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,203
I'm Bronwyn, I'm a technical artist at Valve, and today I'm going to be discussing the what's,

3
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:15,806
how's, and why's of the content that drives the Counter-Strike global offensive economy.

4
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:18,068
So what is this talk?

5
00:00:18,488 --> 00:00:19,989
I should first start by telling you what it isn't.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,072
I'm not going to spend a long time talking about the advantages of adding an economy

7
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:24,633
to your game.

8
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:27,755
I'm going to assume that the reason you're here is you already have an idea about that.

9
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:31,295
If on the other hand, that is something you want to learn some more about,

10
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:34,918
we recently gave a series of talks at the Steam Developer Days on economies.

11
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:37,920
All that content is freely available to watch on YouTube,

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,122
so just head over to steamdevdays.com for some links.

13
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:45,645
So instead, this talk is about how we generated a large volume of content

14
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:48,226
with a really small team in order to kickstart our economy.

15
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:52,930
I'll be discussing the things that our customers value about the economy content

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,932
and how that information is helping us continue to make good decisions going forward.

17
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:00,228
Counter-Strike is an online multiplayer game.

18
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:02,230
It's a team-based first-person shooter,

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,612
and it's had several versions over the last 14 years.

20
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:07,734
Counter-Strike Global Offensive

21
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:09,175
is the latest, greatest version.

22
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:10,877
Like we do with our other products,

23
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:12,938
we use Steam to update CSGO regularly

24
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,460
as we strive to create the best experience possible.

25
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,303
In a multiplayer game, a big part of having

26
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:20,204
a good experience is provided by other players.

27
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:22,666
Our customers generate a huge amount of value

28
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,568
for each other just by participating in the game.

29
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:26,850
We want to encourage them to keep doing that.

30
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:32,176
The way that we encourage them is just by providing a bunch of fun and value to them,

31
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:37,719
and more importantly, by making it easy for them to provide a bunch of value to each other.

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,301
Involved products like Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2,

33
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:46,183
we found that a great way to help meet all of these goals at once is to add an economy to the game.

34
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:51,946
We can measure the success of our economy by checking in just on a few broad metrics,

35
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,807
and they're maybe not the ones that you'd expect.

36
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:54,867
After all...

37
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,651
Adding an economy isn't a goal in and of itself.

38
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:00,073
We're adding an economy in service of our other goals.

39
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:02,295
So the kinds of things that we're going to check on

40
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:05,157
are things like player numbers, player retention,

41
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,359
and individual play time.

42
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,781
Because after all, if our customers are having fun,

43
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,142
they're gonna keep coming back for more.

44
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:14,885
Since Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2

45
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,186
both have thriving economies,

46
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:18,108
we were able to crib a bunch of ideas from them.

47
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,029
They both use multiple channels

48
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,691
for distributing items to their players.

49
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,953
This gives customers lots of options for getting items.

50
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:29,084
Having lots of ways for customers to interact with the economy is a big positive

51
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:30,645
because it means a broader participation.

52
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:33,066
And economies are essentially multiplayer games.

53
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,607
The more people participating, the more fun it is.

54
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:40,790
In both Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2, not every item is available through every channel.

55
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,712
This is perfect when the goal is to provide lots of different ways to interact with the economy

56
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:48,613
and to see how our customers want to consume content.

57
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:53,316
But it's really difficult to directly compare the value of items in these different categories.

58
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:56,753
And at this point in CS Go's economy design discussion,

59
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,594
figuring out the value of individual items

60
00:02:58,614 --> 00:02:59,934
was actually really important,

61
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:02,534
because leaving aside the how for the moment,

62
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:05,135
we still weren't sure what our customers wanted to consume.

63
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:08,516
So let's focus for a second on the marketplace.

64
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,376
This is one of the ways that our customers

65
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:11,656
can get at the content.

66
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:15,197
Customers can list items from their inventories

67
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,437
for sale for Steam Wallet funds.

68
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,398
The listings are in real currency amounts,

69
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:20,558
and they're set by the lister.

70
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:24,016
Because identical items can be listed for different amounts,

71
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,957
there's a constant downward price pressure

72
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:30,941
as the price pressure makes the supply and demand at a given price point equalize.

73
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:34,024
So, as a company, we had a unique opportunity.

74
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:37,126
This was the first time that we were launching an economy

75
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,687
since the market went live.

76
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,650
We decided that CSGO would become our first game

77
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,672
in which every item can be placed on the marketplace.

78
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:47,878
and individual items can't be bought any other way.

79
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,540
In fact, the only thing that we plan to sell directly

80
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,361
were the keys used to open our case drops.

81
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,223
So in this proposed market-centered economy,

82
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:58,085
the supply of items comes from our players.

83
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,526
They come from in-game drops,

84
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:00,947
so the more players we have playing,

85
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:02,388
the more supply there is.

86
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,662
The demand also comes from our players.

87
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:09,024
They're only going to purchase things that they feel are being sold for a fair price.

88
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,485
And with enough listings, the downward price pressure of the free market

89
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,566
is going to ensure that a fair price gets found.

90
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:18,707
So this sounded like a great way to simply ask our customers what they value.

91
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:20,968
So what did we decide to ship?

92
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,790
We could make weapon skins, character customization.

93
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,110
We could do...

94
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:29,692
new weapons, or we could just do cosmetic mesh changes

95
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:30,633
to existing weapons.

96
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:33,576
All these things have been modded by CS players in the past.

97
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,478
In fact, all the examples that I just showed

98
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,581
are community mods from GameBanana.

99
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,064
So clearly there is a demand for customization.

100
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:42,807
Whatever it was that we decided to ship,

101
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,709
we needed to create a lot of items

102
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:45,930
in order to fill out the economy.

103
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,653
So it's important that we make it as easy as possible to do so.

104
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,528
And in keeping with our goal of helping our players generate value for each other,

105
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:56,535
we'd like to make it possible for community members to contribute items to the game

106
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,218
and make money from their in-game sales.

107
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,586
We also need a lot of variety in order to figure out what our customers want.

108
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,814
We know that economies are more fun when there are more people participating.

109
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:09,477
They're also more fun when there are lots of items to compare

110
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:11,239
and lots of different ways to compare them.

111
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,762
So we didn't want to just create items with a broad range of value.

112
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:17,525
We also wanted to create items that could be valued in different ways

113
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,467
because players with different priorities

114
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:21,689
can actually care about different aspects of the same item.

115
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,051
So we'll want to keep these goals in mind

116
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,893
as we figure out which thing we want to start with.

117
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,211
The way we choose which of our options to go with

118
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,933
is to assess the benefits associated with each type of product

119
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:34,654
and then compare that against the risks associated with shipping it

120
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:37,535
and the resources required to actually complete the task.

121
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:41,197
At the time, CSGO was actually a really small team.

122
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:43,898
Our art team consisted of two technical artists,

123
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:45,219
and that's the whole list.

124
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:47,337
we are pretty resource limited.

125
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,700
So let's take characters, for example.

126
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,904
We know that customizable characters in TF2 and Dota 2

127
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:54,466
are really valuable and popular,

128
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:56,589
but they work best when there's lots of chances

129
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:57,650
to see the customization.

130
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:01,482
In Dota 2, the game is top-down, so you get to see your character all the time.

131
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:04,202
And in TF2, although it's a first-person game,

132
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,843
there are taunts and kill cams that give you lots of opportunities

133
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:09,184
to see your customization or show it off to other players.

134
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:13,065
CSGO is also a first-person game, but we don't have taunts.

135
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,305
So the chances to show off your customization

136
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,346
are actually a lot fewer than our other products.

137
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:20,627
And so the value here isn't maybe as high as we'd first hoped.

138
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:26,586
There's also a lot of challenges here, and there's a big risk that we could make team identification difficult.

139
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:32,048
Since CSGO is a team-based game, team ID is a really big part of having a good experience.

140
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,129
So it's possible that someone could have a customized character,

141
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:37,570
be really happy that they had something different and unique,

142
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,632
but they made everybody else that they were playing with less happy

143
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,333
because it was more difficult for everyone else to tell friend from foe.

144
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:45,173
It's also...

145
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:47,873
a big resource investment.

146
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,314
Not only do we have to take time

147
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:50,975
to try and solve our team ID problems,

148
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,576
but there's a lot of content that needs to be created,

149
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:55,257
and it's fairly complicated content.

150
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:57,778
With our small team, it would take a really long time

151
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,880
to make enough content to be able to ship the economy.

152
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,181
That's bad for us, because we'd like to ship something

153
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,081
as soon as possible,

154
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:05,182
especially something that we have doubts about,

155
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:06,503
because then we can get data back

156
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:08,144
that either validates our decision making

157
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,165
or indicates a different direction that we ought to go.

158
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,087
So on the whole, it didn't seem like characters

159
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:14,347
were the best place to start.

160
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:16,168
What about new weapons?

161
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,341
It could be really fun having a lot of gameplay variation.

162
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,583
On the other hand, our players practice intensely

163
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:23,543
with their favorite weapons,

164
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,245
right down to learning the recoil pattern

165
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:26,585
so that they can learn to compensate.

166
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:29,167
They're not going to throw away all that time investment

167
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:31,209
and try something new just for the sake of variety.

168
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,230
That means if we make new weapons,

169
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,971
they have to have a unique tactical value

170
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:36,512
that's going to attract players to them.

171
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:39,674
And really, there's only so many different options

172
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:42,156
that we can provide that are meaningful in variety.

173
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:47,007
And so actually, the value of shipping weapons goes down the more of them we ship,

174
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,929
which is directly counter to our goal of providing lots of items.

175
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:54,413
There's also a risk anytime we ship new weapons

176
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:56,695
that we're going to destabilize competitive play.

177
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:59,338
That could potentially make our customers so unhappy

178
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,159
that they just leave the game and never come back.

179
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,001
And that's the worst outcome that we can think of.

180
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,784
There's a fair amount of resources required to do weapon balancing to attempt to mitigate that risk,

181
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,827
on top of just the content work required to create the weapon meshes.

182
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:15,172
So again, it looks like new weapons are maybe not our best place to start.

183
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:17,414
So what about weapon mesh changes?

184
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:19,995
There's actually a surprising amount of benefit here.

185
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,677
After all, if you're changing your weapon,

186
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,018
it's something you're holding in your hands.

187
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:24,920
So even from the first-person view,

188
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,522
you see your customization all the time.

189
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:28,864
It's also something that could make other players

190
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:30,446
more happy that you have it.

191
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,648
Not only do they get to see something new and cool

192
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,010
because you're walking around with the weapon,

193
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,591
but if you drop it into the world,

194
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,293
someone else can pick it up and play with it

195
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:38,775
and have a positive experience.

196
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:41,773
We did have a couple of doubts, though,

197
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:44,175
so let's just see what those could be.

198
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,617
So we actually got pretty far along this path.

199
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:49,359
We customized the Hecka to the AK-47.

200
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,680
We played with it in-game,

201
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,162
and we did find that our concerns were validated.

202
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:55,644
The first thing is that weapon identification

203
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:56,744
is made a lot more difficult

204
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:58,045
with all of these different silhouettes.

205
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,688
It's super hard to tell just by looking at these guys

206
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:02,689
that the functionality for every one of these weapons

207
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:03,490
is identical.

208
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,791
And that brings me to my second point.

209
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,731
We were a little bit worried about how it would feel

210
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,411
to have different components that didn't actually affect gameplay,

211
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,812
and the answer is that it felt really artificial.

212
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:17,013
In the real world, if you changed out things like stocks and grips,

213
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,253
the weapon's recoil and accuracy would change,

214
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,633
and the experience of getting weapon components

215
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,294
that didn't affect the gameplay at all

216
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:24,794
was actually kind of disappointing.

217
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:29,135
So we reassessed the risk even upwards from where we thought it was.

218
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,416
There's also a bunch of work here, obviously, just to make the components.

219
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,226
So that leaves us with weapon skins.

220
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,710
At this point, we were getting actually really concerned

221
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,573
because how many different camouflaged weapons can we make

222
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:42,995
that people are really gonna care about?

223
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:45,959
But as we got further along in gathering reference,

224
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,701
we discovered that there's a whole world out there

225
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,582
we weren't even aware of.

226
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,934
People make crazy things for their weapons.

227
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,836
Everything from intricate Victorian scroll work

228
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:55,717
right up to straight up graffiti.

229
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,178
These things are essentially just blank canvases

230
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:00,039
and that means that there's room for whimsy.

231
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,420
That's not the case with our weapon mesh changes

232
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,681
where those things have to be based on real world components.

233
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,642
For weapon skins, we can make pretty much

234
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:07,723
whatever we can imagine.

235
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,524
So the benefit is a lot greater than we first thought.

236
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,825
They're also not very risky.

237
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,846
There's a little bit of risk that the color changes

238
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,307
would make the weapon identification

239
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:17,087
a little more difficult.

240
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,801
but on the whole it's nothing compared to our other options.

241
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:22,682
And then there's just the work of making the textures,

242
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:25,343
which is less than any of our other options.

243
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:27,324
It's also really easy for the community

244
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:29,344
to make these easier than anything else.

245
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:31,045
So we have a pretty clear winner.

246
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,547
In the real world, weapon finishes come in a vast array

247
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:36,467
of styles and colors.

248
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,288
So we already had a really good indication

249
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:40,269
of how far we could go with creating variety.

250
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,150
Now we just needed a way to make

251
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,470
a lot of things really quickly.

252
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:46,754
Since both our artists were technical artists,

253
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:48,395
we did a very typical tech art thing.

254
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:49,915
Instead of starting to concept

255
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:51,436
what the weapon finishes might look like,

256
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:53,077
we jumped right into the task

257
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:54,537
of trying to make them easier to produce.

258
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:57,859
We started with a basic idea.

259
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,580
Painting detail into textures takes a long time.

260
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,560
It's a lot of work,

261
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,541
and doing that on a large number of items

262
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:04,541
seemed really inefficient,

263
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,262
so we wanted to automate the process.

264
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:09,323
Since CSGO's art style is fairly realistic,

265
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:11,584
we started by taking a look at real-world reference.

266
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:16,759
Paint wears off metal in a really predictable way, so there are certain effects that we know we want to reproduce.

267
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:20,141
For one thing, it chips off the exposed corners and edges.

268
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,982
It wears quickest where it gets the most contact,

269
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,604
and grime and discoloration accrete in the cavities.

270
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:29,966
And another thing is that when people paint their weapons, they typically don't paint the whole thing.

271
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:33,468
They're really careful not to get paint in the mechanism, for obvious reasons.

272
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:40,669
So each weapon has its own characteristic areas where the substrate, that's the original surface of the weapon, is always visible.

273
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,012
So in this case, only the receiver, the grip, and the buttstock have been painted.

274
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:49,614
There is one thing about this example that isn't ideal though, and it has to do with scale.

275
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:55,898
This has a really durable paint on it, and so the way the paint chips off is in these kind of larger chunks.

276
00:11:56,638 --> 00:12:00,960
That looks pretty cool on a rifle, but if you tried to apply that to a pistol, it might look out of scale.

277
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:04,890
And that's an important distinction because we want to ship as general a solution as possible.

278
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,032
Whatever we make, it has to apply to everything.

279
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:13,538
So we kept looking through our reference and we found an example where the wear pattern is filled with these smaller sized scratches.

280
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:16,180
This indicates that this has a lower quality paint,

281
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,484
but this scale of detail is going to work well on every type of weapon that we have.

282
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:21,885
So we're going to try and target this look.

283
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:26,209
It's pretty easy to replicate all of these features

284
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,629
as long as we have good enough information

285
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:28,870
about the topology of the mesh.

286
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,910
In fact, the most important things to know

287
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,771
are just the cavity and the occlusion.

288
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,812
That's going to tell us our low points

289
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:35,952
and our high points for the mesh

290
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:38,073
so that we can figure out where the paint should chip first.

291
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,713
For our scratches, we can just tile the texture

292
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:41,614
over the entire weapon.

293
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:45,035
We can start by just combining the cavity and the occlusion.

294
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,345
The brightest areas are the places where the paint

295
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,225
should wear off first.

296
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:49,926
This is a pretty soft blend though,

297
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:51,807
and our scratches need to have hard edges.

298
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:53,807
So we can just use a smooth step in the shader

299
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:54,788
to adjust the contrast.

300
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:56,328
For the artists in the audience,

301
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,529
a smooth step is really similar

302
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,150
to Photoshop's levels operation.

303
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,971
So this gives us our blend between our paint

304
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:03,451
and our original substrate.

305
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,853
Now's the time to bring in our grime.

306
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:08,573
We can just do that using the cavity

307
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:09,914
that tells us where to place the grime.

308
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,195
And the grime itself is another tiling texture

309
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:13,395
similar to the scratches.

310
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,183
So next we'll add in the ambient occlusion

311
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:19,024
to get the paint and the substrate

312
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,285
to sit in the same world together.

313
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:21,966
That's already looking pretty good.

314
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,908
There's one small problem though,

315
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:25,689
and that's that there are a couple areas

316
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:27,231
where we have some markings and etchings

317
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:29,192
on the original weapon that really ought to show through.

318
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:31,194
I don't think you can see it because it's a bit dark,

319
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:32,034
but trust me, they're there.

320
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,396
We want to see those even over the paint.

321
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:35,897
So the cheapest thing we could think of

322
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,699
was just to add them to the ambient occlusion.

323
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:39,400
Since that's just getting multiplied

324
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,081
over the surface of the paint anyway,

325
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,523
we can get our details back in dark over the top.

326
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,325
So another thing that we saw in our reference

327
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:49,685
was that the paint wears off quickest

328
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:50,705
where it's touched the most.

329
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,506
There's no way to know where things get touched

330
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:54,826
just from the topology of the mesh.

331
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:56,387
It has to do with human interaction,

332
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,747
so we need to have an artist's control over this.

333
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,889
We added a wear influence texture that is artist-created.

334
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:04,929
For the most part, we just grabbed details

335
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,950
from the original source texture PSDs,

336
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,250
and then we just painted a couple of blobby details

337
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,671
over the group in the magazine with these big soft brushes.

338
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,247
We spent hardly any time adjusting this mask at all,

339
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:17,809
and this is the effect that it produces.

340
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:19,230
You can see, especially on the grip,

341
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,211
the paint is wearing where it's touched the most.

342
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:23,032
So let's add lighting.

343
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:27,054
So at this point, we've authored almost no new content by hand.

344
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:30,616
The only things that we've created are really the grime texture and the scratch texture,

345
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:33,598
and those things are going to be reused over every single weapon in the game anyway.

346
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,537
The fun part is, since the shader has a wear input,

347
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:40,739
we can just animate that input

348
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,520
and see the wear crawl over the surface.

349
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:45,303
This is great because it shows us

350
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,844
that we can get a wide variety of looks

351
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:48,966
just by editing a single shader parameter.

352
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,889
It was around this time that we started

353
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:54,391
testing the content in-game under real game lighting,

354
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,633
and what we found was a little bit concerning.

355
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:59,275
So here's a typical first-person view of a weapon.

356
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:04,029
I'm showing it without the world or the view model arms just so you can focus on what's important.

357
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,534
You can see that the way that this texture has been authored it calls out all of the edges and plane changes so that even

358
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:11,274
if we disable

359
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:16,598
directional lighting all of the plane changes are obvious and you can understand the form really well.

360
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:22,421
But what happens when we add our paint onto it? A lot of those plane changes just straight-up disappear.

361
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,910
Even with directional lighting, we still have a problem.

362
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,050
Surfaces that have the same normal

363
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,351
but different spatial offsets

364
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:31,091
still look as though they've been merged into one.

365
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,153
One of our concept artists is a big model-making nerd,

366
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:39,153
so as we were figuring out the paint system,

367
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,614
he recommended that we check out work by Mink Jimenez.

368
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,574
I recommend this to any of you in the audience.

369
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:46,575
If you're a texture artist, a shader artist,

370
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:47,895
check this stuff out.

371
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:49,436
He's got a lot of amazing techniques

372
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,476
that are actually really helpful.

373
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,837
He uses a technique called modulation.

374
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:55,144
It gets painted on as part of the base coat

375
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:56,444
before he adds the details,

376
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,485
and it's used to call out geometric details,

377
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,106
as well as edges and plane changes.

378
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,646
So this isn't exactly lighting,

379
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,847
although some of the directions of the gradients

380
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,228
could be influenced by lighting.

381
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:11,369
Instead, the goal is to create value contrast

382
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:12,909
at every single one of the edges.

383
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,810
The details are painted on afterwards,

384
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,811
and they reduce the obviousness of the effect,

385
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:19,871
but the improvement in the viewer's understanding

386
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:20,792
of the form remains.

387
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:23,052
We tried it out.

388
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,779
Truthfully, this was not at all fun.

389
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,880
The process was just to grab an element

390
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,681
and then planar map a gradient onto it.

391
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:32,123
We then rotate the gradient until it's following

392
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,003
the way that we want.

393
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:34,965
Some of the more complicated weapons,

394
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:36,786
like the machine guns, I swear,

395
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,027
these things are like the Death Star.

396
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,948
They have all these tiny little greebly bits on it.

397
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:41,689
Some of them took up to two days.

398
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:44,450
On average, about two hours per weapon.

399
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:48,113
The result, though, it works.

400
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:51,650
Adding in the modulation shows us our plane changes again.

401
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,511
That means that we can move forward

402
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:54,912
without having to worry about the paint

403
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:56,813
destroying the viewer's understanding of the form.

404
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,475
We obviously don't want to just apply solid paints

405
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:01,275
to every weapon though.

406
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:03,757
It's a pretty promising start,

407
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,619
but we researched a bunch of different finishing techniques

408
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,780
and decided that our first technique

409
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,761
would be inspired by hydro dipping.

410
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:14,172
This technique uses a film with a printed pattern on it.

411
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:15,773
It's floated into a tank of water

412
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:17,654
and then sprayed with an activator.

413
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,655
The activator dissolves the film

414
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:20,856
but leaves the pigment behind.

415
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:23,197
And then you take your primed component

416
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:24,998
and just roll it through the pigment

417
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,278
to pick it up onto the surface.

418
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,400
We imitate this in a super cheap way.

419
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,621
Since hydrographics have seams in them

420
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:33,162
from being dipped from multiple angles

421
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:34,663
and because the weapon's disassembled

422
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:35,803
before it's dipped anyway,

423
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,885
we can just tile a texture over our unwrap.

424
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:40,826
If we have seams in the result,

425
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:42,948
I just dialed up the realism.

426
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:45,571
So you'd think that the first thing we'd try

427
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:47,873
would be to replace the flat color from our prototype

428
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:49,234
with a bunch of different textures,

429
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:50,875
but that seems so single use.

430
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,757
And in the long run, it didn't seem like

431
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,699
a good first investment because we'd still have to

432
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:55,900
create a lot of different images.

433
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:57,982
So in order to be more efficient,

434
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:00,464
we tried procedural coloration of patterns.

435
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:02,366
I'm showing this to you really small

436
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:03,767
because it's super hard on the eyes.

437
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,250
Authoring these again is not super fun,

438
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,631
but once you have one.

439
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:10,429
you can use it in a bunch of different ways.

440
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:13,130
So you can change its scale, its orientation,

441
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,410
drive different colors through it,

442
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,390
and create a bunch of meaningful variation,

443
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,651
again, just by driving some shader parameters.

444
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:22,852
We looked at a bunch of different examples of hydrodipping,

445
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,292
and we found that for the most part,

446
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:25,732
people don't dip the entire weapon.

447
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,573
They'll take certain components

448
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,213
and just use an accent color on them.

449
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:31,934
We thought that this look was more appealing

450
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,014
than the head-to-toe camo.

451
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,727
In order to replicate it, we paint a bunch of

452
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,708
paint-by-number textures for our weapons.

453
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,148
So they combine with the patterns in order to create

454
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:42,629
a weapon-specific color mask.

455
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,611
The colorized paint ends up looking like this.

456
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,372
Everywhere that's blue gets the same color,

457
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:53,093
everywhere that's green gets the same color.

458
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,773
It transforms our head-to-toe camo gun

459
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:57,354
into something that's a little bit more appealing.

460
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:01,138
The results of the composite can be randomized

461
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:04,460
by varying the rotation and the offsets of the texture.

462
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:06,562
The wearer is randomized also.

463
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:08,863
And that means that every single item we generate

464
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,704
with this system is per pixel unique.

465
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,126
So this is all looking really promising,

466
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,107
but this is a pretty expensive shader

467
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:16,728
and it has a lot of texture inputs,

468
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,729
meaning that it's pretty heavy on memory as well.

469
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:20,330
So obviously it would be better

470
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,751
not to run this thing every frame.

471
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,853
In fact, we'd like to run it for just one frame

472
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:26,133
and then save out the results.

473
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,071
I've been showing everything so far in the context of the weapon meshes,

474
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:34,094
but actually, all of our inputs are just texture information.

475
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:36,555
And so we can run this thing in a flat plane,

476
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:37,816
like a render target,

477
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,898
and still get the exact same results.

478
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,440
That's cool because we can just save this out

479
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,881
and use it as a normal texture.

480
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:48,343
That gives us an interesting advantage.

481
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:51,585
It means that we don't have to edit any of the materials for our weapons.

482
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,186
We can just swap out the base texture

483
00:19:53,286 --> 00:19:54,787
and still get all the variety that we want.

484
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:57,850
So our first foray into generating the new texture

485
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,870
through a render target wasn't all that promising.

486
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,371
We had a two-second hitch every time we generated a weapon,

487
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,212
which for a competitive game is plainly unacceptable.

488
00:20:07,993 --> 00:20:08,893
So we asked for some help.

489
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,534
We stopped trying to do everything

490
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:11,714
with just technical artist

491
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:13,255
and involved a rendering programmer.

492
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,443
He made some optimizations to the way that we copy

493
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:19,804
the information out of the render target and save it out.

494
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:21,844
I'm not gonna go into detail on this stuff.

495
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,485
If you're interested, I can come back to the slide

496
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:24,545
during the question period.

497
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:27,686
The upshot is that it only takes about six milliseconds

498
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,726
for a single frame, usually towards the beginning

499
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:30,887
of a round when it doesn't matter.

500
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,747
And then the rest of the work happens in a separate thread,

501
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:34,707
so there's no gameplay hitch.

502
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,948
So now that we have a fully functioning prototype,

503
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:40,629
we felt confident enough to start creating some new styles.

504
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:44,227
The first reference that we looked at consisted of spray-painted weapons.

505
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:47,310
We started with hydrographics because it was easier to solve those problems.

506
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,573
Here's the thing, with hydrographics, we don't care if we have seams in the results,

507
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:54,976
but with spray paints, really, they should be seamless.

508
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:57,658
So normally we just do a triplanar mapping,

509
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,501
so we project the texture from the cardinal directions and then blend over the surface normals.

510
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,363
This requires having mesh data to work with, though,

511
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:08,426
and far from having the position and normal information from our mesh,

512
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:09,307
what we actually have...

513
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,531
is just the flat plane of a render target

514
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,851
with no normals at all.

515
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:17,253
So what we actually need to do is get all of that

516
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,934
position and normal information into a texture format.

517
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:23,776
Now the normal information's not that complicated,

518
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:25,477
we just render an object space normal map.

519
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:28,378
But you should bear in mind that we never authored

520
00:21:28,398 --> 00:21:31,099
the UVs for any of these weapons for procedural solutions.

521
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,440
In fact, all of the content had shipped

522
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,541
to our customers months before.

523
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,179
So there are some areas here where we have overlaps

524
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,940
or mirrors in the UVs.

525
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,041
This would be a problem if we were shading

526
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:44,962
with this information, but actually it turns out

527
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:47,403
to be plenty good enough for just doing the blend

528
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:48,983
between the different texture projections.

529
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:52,765
Our position didn't turn out quite that well.

530
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,306
We need a lot of precision here

531
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,706
in order for it to look accurate.

532
00:21:57,387 --> 00:22:00,288
We save out 32-bit uncompressed textures for the position

533
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:01,809
and it's still not enough.

534
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:04,570
We end up with some pretty serious blockiness in the mesh.

535
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:07,670
We solved this by multi-sampling.

536
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:10,314
We just used a Gaussian kernel to average the positions

537
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,998
and the result is actually pretty credible.

538
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:16,724
In terms of visual range though,

539
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:18,666
the difference between hydrographics and spray paints

540
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:19,668
is not all that large.

541
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:21,130
So we've managed to add some variety,

542
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,632
but we want to go quite a lot further.

543
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:24,796
As we were looking at our reference,

544
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:26,057
we found that another common way

545
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:28,499
that people customize their weapons is through anodization.

546
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,441
Our standard shader for the weapons

547
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,142
does actually let us achieve this effect,

548
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:33,964
so we don't need to make any changes

549
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,185
to the way we're rendering in game.

550
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,407
What we do is just tint the specular highlights

551
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:38,648
by the base texture's color.

552
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,891
And so we can get some nice, juicy highlights like this.

553
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:45,394
So in this example, the paint's colored red

554
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:46,715
and baked into the base texture,

555
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:48,236
and then we just tint the specular highlights

556
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,718
where the paint appears and not over the substrate.

557
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:54,000
It's pretty, but it looks really weird

558
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,561
having it over the entire weapon.

559
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,022
So remember that mask that we used

560
00:22:58,182 --> 00:23:00,003
to create accent colors for our hydrographics?

561
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:01,744
We didn't use all the channels, did we?

562
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:03,065
We still have one left.

563
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,286
So we added another per-weapon mask

564
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:06,767
to limit the anodization effect.

565
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:09,588
After the mask is made for a particular weapon,

566
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:12,069
the only overhead to creating a new anodized style

567
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:13,690
is just picking a new color.

568
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:17,012
We didn't stop there.

569
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:17,872
How could we?

570
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:19,513
We have so much texture information

571
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,334
that has so many useful things in it.

572
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,908
We haven't taken full advantage of it yet, so we added some more styles.

573
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:28,231
We finally got around to creating an uncolorized hydrographic.

574
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:32,955
We also converted our hydrographic and spray paint styles into anodized looks.

575
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:37,298
We made a solid paint style just using our paint by number mask

576
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,920
to generate a paint that has up to four colors in it.

577
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:44,264
And lastly, we created a patina style that instead of wearing down

578
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:46,366
to the substrate, wears to a thicker patina.

579
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:50,226
We didn't create any new per-weapon texture inputs

580
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:51,067
for any of these.

581
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:52,888
We just remixed the stuff that we already had

582
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:53,609
using our shader.

583
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,692
I really want to stress that this is pretty much

584
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:58,853
just procedural art.

585
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:00,735
It's the cheapest kind of art that we can make,

586
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:03,337
and it communicates the copper material really well.

587
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:05,139
Is the video playing, guys?

588
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:05,839
Yes?

589
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:06,680
Okay, excellent.

590
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:09,482
It communicates the copper material really well,

591
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:11,164
and it also looks interesting and different

592
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,606
at all the different wear levels,

593
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,167
and so we've managed to create a game.

594
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,135
a bunch of variety just by driving

595
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,295
a single shader parameter.

596
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:22,976
So to recap so far, we have a procedural compositing system

597
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,657
that works at runtime that we can use to generate

598
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:27,678
an essentially infinite number of textures.

599
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:29,599
In order for the system to work,

600
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,819
we need the following inputs.

601
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:32,519
The original source texture,

602
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,920
which was authored before we even had this idea.

603
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,261
The cavity, AO, position, and normal.

604
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,002
All of these things are just generated

605
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,463
using out-of-the-box tools from our existing mesh.

606
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:45,023
We create a paint-by-number texture.

607
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:47,514
That's done just by colorizing elements of the mesh

608
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:48,554
and then rendering to texture,

609
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:49,834
so it takes hardly any time at all.

610
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:53,335
And then our artist generated wear influence map.

611
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:55,536
Now we mostly just cribbed some layers

612
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,316
from the original source texture PSD,

613
00:24:57,356 --> 00:24:58,996
so again, this isn't a big time investment.

614
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:01,657
In fact, the only texture that took a significant time

615
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:04,418
at all was the MIG Jimenez style modulation.

616
00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:08,118
This guy took, on average, about two hours per weapon.

617
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,019
So if we add all these together,

618
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:13,360
it took us about a half a day to create a paintable weapon.

619
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:17,484
Even with a really small staff of just a couple of artists,

620
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:19,544
that means that we could blow through all 30 weapons

621
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:22,665
in the game at the time in about a week and a half.

622
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:25,006
Now this does look like an awful lot

623
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:26,727
of texture inputs to our shader.

624
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:28,427
Some of them are grayscale though,

625
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:30,628
so we just combine them into a single texture

626
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,489
by copying those into the textures individual channels.

627
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,171
The other component that we need,

628
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:40,491
aside from having the weapon be prepped to be paintable,

629
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:43,012
is the finish that we're going to apply to it.

630
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:46,398
What we author depends a little bit on the finish style,

631
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:48,358
but for the most part, we create a pattern

632
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:50,259
and then choose the colors for that pattern

633
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,580
and then set just a couple of shader parameters,

634
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,941
like the specular intensity.

635
00:25:57,062 --> 00:25:58,243
Once all the weapons have been prepped,

636
00:25:58,263 --> 00:26:00,444
we can very easily author a single finish

637
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:02,345
and apply it to any one of the weapons.

638
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:04,946
Let me zoom in on a random one here,

639
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:06,867
and you can see all of the detail

640
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,408
that's been procedurally placed.

641
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,649
And I'll show you another variant,

642
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:12,470
just because they're so darn easy to make.

643
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,661
So a single weapon finish can create a huge amount

644
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:18,521
of variety, both by randomizing its parameters

645
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:20,362
and by applying it to different weapons.

646
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:23,562
At this point, it's time that we stop focusing on the tech

647
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:25,003
and move on to the art.

648
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:27,483
Over the course of gathering our reference,

649
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,643
we discovered that people in the real world

650
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:31,884
create hideous, hideous things.

651
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:36,185
It really begs the question, what do our customers want?

652
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:38,845
The game's art style is grounded in the real world

653
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:40,085
and we've already gone down the path

654
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:42,446
of replicating some real world finishing techniques.

655
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:46,008
But there's a really broad range of service providers in the real world

656
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:49,832
creating a broad range of things that cater to a broad range of tastes.

657
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:53,675
In our game world, we're the only service providers

658
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:55,256
and our tastes might not match demand.

659
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:58,599
So we needed to focus less on the things that we personally liked

660
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:01,021
and more on creating a broad range of variety

661
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:02,602
in order to measure people's reactions.

662
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,889
So we shipped things with a big range of aesthetics,

663
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:07,730
and we deliberately shipped items

664
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,151
that were contentious within the team.

665
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:12,173
So among all these items, you can see a bunch of things

666
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:13,955
that are people's least favorite

667
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,816
out of all the test content that we made.

668
00:27:17,317 --> 00:27:19,719
We also shipped an in-game tool for creating finishes

669
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,679
that we call the Workbench.

670
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,421
It allows the community to author weapon finishes

671
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,923
for themselves and upload them to the community workshop.

672
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,764
They've done that with enthusiasm,

673
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:29,566
creating over 30,000 finishes.

674
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,067
We've already started shipping

675
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:32,388
some of the highest rated items.

676
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:35,818
letting our community express their aesthetic preferences directly

677
00:27:35,938 --> 00:27:38,020
by just putting the things they make right into the game.

678
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:41,883
We call our economy update the Arms Deal Update,

679
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,806
and it introduced the weapon finishes that people can collect and equip

680
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:47,207
to customize their play experience.

681
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:51,110
Our initial offering contained over 100 weapon finishes,

682
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,111
all created in-house,

683
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:54,553
which we've since expanded almost fourfold

684
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:56,174
with the help of our community contributors.

685
00:27:57,345 --> 00:28:01,007
Each of these finish has random variations created by the pattern placement and the wear,

686
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:06,388
meaning that there are actually tens of millions of unique items in our economy.

687
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:11,550
So checking back in with our goals, so far we've managed to meet the first three.

688
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,472
It's really easy to make a weapon finish, the community contributes to their creation,

689
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:17,892
and we have a large variety of different looks.

690
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:20,773
Our last two goals are to have a broad range of value.

691
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,074
and to create items that can be valued in different ways.

692
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:25,854
So to know if we're meeting these two goals,

693
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,215
we're going to have to check our data.

694
00:28:28,695 --> 00:28:30,756
Wealth and finishes are, by definition, luxury goods.

695
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,116
They're things that our customers like to have,

696
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:35,517
but they're not actually necessary in order to play the game.

697
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:37,977
In fact, they don't have any gameplay impact at all.

698
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,858
There's plenty of academic discussion on the dimensions of luxury goods.

699
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:48,592
I've collected together just a few of them that we can use to identify what might contribute

700
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,413
to the value of items in the economy.

701
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:53,416
So let's start with conspicuousness.

702
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:57,639
This is the public display of your status as a person with access to luxury goods.

703
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:05,846
This is a graph of the sale price of a black laminate AK-47 over its first three months.

704
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:07,696
This isn't privileged information.

705
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:09,717
Anybody can see any graphs that look like this

706
00:29:09,737 --> 00:29:11,057
for any of the weapons in our economy

707
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:13,138
just by visiting the marketplace.

708
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:16,179
You can see that the price is pretty stable around $10,

709
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,919
so that means that the community values this item pretty highly.

710
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,080
Here's another item, the Doomkitti FAMAS.

711
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:25,021
Prices for this item started pretty high, around $7.50,

712
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:27,742
and dropped really rapidly over just a couple of days.

713
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:31,543
Now it maintains a fairly steady price of about $0.07.

714
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:33,583
So this guy isn't a huge hit.

715
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,864
So what's so different between these two items?

716
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,131
While the finishes themselves are superfluous,

717
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:41,372
the weapons that they apply to aren't.

718
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:43,594
So this is a graph of weapon utility

719
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:45,075
over several rounds of the game.

720
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:49,037
It shows which weapons get used most frequently.

721
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:51,459
The status from last October

722
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,900
when we'd first shipped the economy.

723
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,342
The AK-47 has the highest utility of any weapon

724
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:57,923
in the primary weapon category.

725
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,001
The M4 and the AWP are next, with roughly the same utility each,

726
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:05,141
and then the rest of the primary weapons don't have a big share.

727
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,462
So our FAMAS is the one that I prematurely pointed to.

728
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:12,163
That's the one from the previous slide that had a really low price on the marketplace.

729
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:15,504
You can see it gets used a little bit in the beginning rounds of the game,

730
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:17,424
but by the time we reach the later rounds,

731
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:21,785
it has this tiny little share, sandwiched between the much higher utility weapons.

732
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,186
This shows us that if you have a fancy AK-47,

733
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:27,367
you have a lot of chances to show it off.

734
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,300
And if you have a fancy FAMAS, you don't.

735
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,281
If we look at the prices of weapon finishes

736
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:34,401
that have the same scarcity,

737
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,341
we can see exactly this breakdown.

738
00:30:36,842 --> 00:30:39,102
The AK's on top, and then the M4 is in the off,

739
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:41,383
and then a cluster of the rest of the weapons down below.

740
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,043
This shows us that the amount of time

741
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:45,164
that you spend holding a weapon

742
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,964
influences its value quite a lot.

743
00:30:47,504 --> 00:30:48,545
That's just what we'd expect.

744
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:50,845
More time holding a weapon means more chances

745
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:52,466
to show off your customization,

746
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,166
and also to enjoy it for yourself.

747
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:57,367
So conspicuousness is definitely a big factor on price.

748
00:30:58,202 --> 00:30:59,783
That means that when we create a weapon finish,

749
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,544
just applying it to different weapons

750
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:03,484
can create a big range of value.

751
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:07,906
The next item on our list, heritage and personal history,

752
00:31:08,106 --> 00:31:10,087
encompasses things like historic value,

753
00:31:10,227 --> 00:31:11,768
nostalgia, personal meaning.

754
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:14,029
It's really easy to see how those kinds of things

755
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:16,230
can influence the real world value of an item.

756
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,351
Things like heirlooms,

757
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:20,672
items that belong to famous personages,

758
00:31:21,272 --> 00:31:23,753
items created as part of a venerable brand.

759
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:25,734
But what about in a video game?

760
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,848
Maybe it's less obvious, but Counter-Strike as a product

761
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,228
has a 14-year history.

762
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,389
This is the Desert Eagle,

763
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:35,130
more commonly known by its nickname, the Deagle.

764
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:39,152
It was a very popular choice in previous versions of the game,

765
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:41,173
where it was a weapon with a very high utility.

766
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:44,254
We have made some changes since,

767
00:31:44,394 --> 00:31:47,376
but last October when we shipped our first round of content,

768
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:51,217
the utility of the Deagle in CSGO

769
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:52,938
was actually not particularly high.

770
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,459
In fact, the utility of the P250 outweighs it.

771
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:57,444
quite considerably.

772
00:31:59,765 --> 00:32:03,267
Since that's the case, we'd expect that the P250

773
00:32:03,627 --> 00:32:05,388
would have a higher value, but it doesn't.

774
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:06,928
The Deagle's actually the one on top.

775
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:09,690
It retains its high value because people are used

776
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,830
to valuing it highly.

777
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,012
So this is an example that shows that heritage

778
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:16,133
and personal history can actually affect

779
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,014
players' valuation of items in a game.

780
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,616
Scarcity is easy to explain.

781
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,296
The less of something there is,

782
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:25,657
the more value each unit has.

783
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:28,637
We sorted our items into collections.

784
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:31,018
Each collection contains items

785
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,499
from different quality tiers.

786
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:35,140
The quality tiers correlate roughly with scarcity,

787
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,721
so it's more common to get an item

788
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,821
from a lower quality tier

789
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,542
than an item from a higher quality tier.

790
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:42,183
We do have two different types of drops.

791
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,744
We drop cases and individual items.

792
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:46,985
The cases can be opened with a key,

793
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,606
and it gives you one item from a collection

794
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:50,966
that's associated with that case.

795
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:54,132
So this collection here is from a case,

796
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,253
and this one is made up of individual items.

797
00:32:56,993 --> 00:32:58,774
So we control the rate at which both the cases

798
00:32:58,915 --> 00:33:01,776
and the individual items drop relative to each other.

799
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:03,577
The thing that we don't control

800
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:05,618
is the rate at which cases are opened.

801
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:08,620
We've used our best guess at case opening rates

802
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,860
before shipping the economy

803
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:12,202
in order to try and balance the number of drops

804
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:14,003
so that our quality tiers would stay

805
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,323
roughly correlated with scarcity.

806
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:17,405
But in our first couple of months,

807
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:19,886
our customers opened way more cases than we'd expected.

808
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:22,877
And that means that case items are actually more common

809
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:24,278
than drops.

810
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,740
So as a result, the quality tier of an item

811
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,082
doesn't actually represent scarcity

812
00:33:29,522 --> 00:33:31,464
relative to items that have a different provenance.

813
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:33,885
So there are two items here that I particularly

814
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:35,086
want to call your attention to.

815
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:37,908
This is the red laminate AK-47

816
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:39,750
and the black laminate AK-47.

817
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:42,392
Visually, they're fairly similar.

818
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:45,494
The red one is actually a little bit punchier,

819
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:47,476
so that's one way that we might have expected

820
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:49,177
that it has a higher value,

821
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:50,298
because it's more striking.

822
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:55,610
It also has a quality tier two tiers above the black laminate AK-47,

823
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,372
so that's two ways in which we could expect it has a higher value.

824
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,956
Except due to the volume of cases opened,

825
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:04,858
there are actually more red laminates in the world than black laminates.

826
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,343
So the red laminate AK-47, which we expected originally to have a high value,

827
00:34:10,443 --> 00:34:13,206
is consistently around $4 cheaper than the black.

828
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:17,979
Exacerbating this effect is the fact that if you have a red laminate AK-47,

829
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,641
you're twice as likely to list it on the marketplace as if you have a black.

830
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,382
So scarcity's influence on price is pretty extreme.

831
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:28,543
In fact, it's one of the clearest predictors of value that we have.

832
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:32,925
There's one more interesting feature on this graph that I want to call your attention to.

833
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,426
It's right here, where the price of both of these items got depressed.

834
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:40,388
This is actually on the date where we shipped a bunch of new weapon finishes,

835
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:41,408
including some for the AK-47.

836
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,891
So the value of the older finishes actually decreased

837
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:49,833
relative to the new, more unique, more scarce finishes.

838
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:53,815
We have found over time that as the pool of items increases,

839
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:55,577
this effect gets a little bit diffused.

840
00:34:56,497 --> 00:34:58,038
But when we first shipped the economy,

841
00:34:58,218 --> 00:35:00,559
it was a pretty obvious drop of a couple of bucks.

842
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:03,621
In the real world,

843
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:05,582
quality assessment would be polysensual.

844
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:08,404
Kinetic feel and smell would give you indications

845
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:10,205
as to the quality of materials and assembly.

846
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,281
In our game world, our only indications are visual and descriptive,

847
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:17,542
but we found, to our surprise, that they are just as influential.

848
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:21,042
We expected that wear would influence desirability.

849
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,943
For one thing, we thought the worn beat-up weapons looked really cool

850
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:25,803
because we're artists and we think that way.

851
00:35:26,843 --> 00:35:30,504
We also expected that the worn weapons would correlate with this kind of veteran status,

852
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:33,305
a kind of fictional bonus on top of the aesthetic interest.

853
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:36,705
Because of that, we considered making our weapons wear over time,

854
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:39,146
so that the more you use a weapon, the more worn it gets.

855
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:42,800
Pretty much everybody we showed the tech to had the same idea.

856
00:35:42,861 --> 00:35:44,562
It was a really popular idea.

857
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:47,303
We wanted players to show off their worn weapons

858
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:48,184
as badges of honor.

859
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:50,746
We ended up not doing it for two reasons.

860
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:53,728
The first reason is that some of the paints look better

861
00:35:53,788 --> 00:35:55,129
with less wear rather than more,

862
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:57,070
or at least that's how we assessed them.

863
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,331
And so it would be really difficult in order to get

864
00:35:59,351 --> 00:36:02,053
the weapons to always wear towards an ideal state.

865
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,816
The other thing is that in order for people to show off

866
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:07,276
worn weapons as badges of honor,

867
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:10,800
they have to represent a significant time investment,

868
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,282
and that means that the wear could happen too slowly for our players to perceive.

869
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:18,585
Now, we don't want to affect people's inventories in a way that's difficult to communicate,

870
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:20,606
and so we ended up not shipping that.

871
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:25,629
Instead, each item has a random amount of wear applied to it at grant time.

872
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:32,109
The where has a bell curve so that it's most common to get an item with just a middling amount of where.

873
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:37,073
So the items with the most and the least amount of where have the most scarcity.

874
00:36:37,593 --> 00:36:43,078
Given our previous examples then, we could expect that the items with the most and least amounts of where would have the highest value.

875
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,121
If that were true, our graph would look like this.

876
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:49,123
We have Val's card on the left and Factory New on the right.

877
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:51,282
You'd think that there would be an uptick in value

878
00:36:51,822 --> 00:36:53,463
for both of those just because of scarcity.

879
00:36:54,143 --> 00:36:55,564
But almost with that exception,

880
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:58,425
the battle scarred exteriors, our most worn exteriors,

881
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,646
are seen as significantly lower quality

882
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,847
than the factory new finishes.

883
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:06,889
This definitely shows that the impact of quality evaluation

884
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:09,270
affects the price on the marketplace.

885
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:11,591
So creating our scratched aesthetic

886
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,592
did actually give us a broad range of value,

887
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:15,673
even if we had originally imagined

888
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,774
the value spread exactly backwards.

889
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:21,117
So let's finally talk about the aesthetics

890
00:37:21,277 --> 00:37:22,317
of individual finishes.

891
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:24,898
Aesthetics in the context of luxury

892
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:27,300
is a consumer's ability to discriminate value

893
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,960
just based on visual characteristics.

894
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,461
We created a broad range of aesthetics

895
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,442
from subdued military styles

896
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:35,383
all the way to flashy items that were shiny.

897
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:38,144
So because the game can have a stealth component to it,

898
00:37:38,365 --> 00:37:40,706
we actually expected that players would prefer items

899
00:37:40,746 --> 00:37:42,566
that they felt gave them a better camouflage.

900
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:44,407
So how do we test our assumptions?

901
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:46,848
We can't just look at price on the marketplace.

902
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:50,378
It's way too heavily influenced by all the other factors on this list.

903
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:56,202
It's also worth noting that the price on the marketplace doesn't capture the total value of the items in our economy.

904
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:59,464
Less than 2% of our items are listed on the marketplace.

905
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:01,705
The rest of them are collected and equipped,

906
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:05,488
and they provide a value to their owners that isn't expressed in dollar amounts.

907
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,189
So let's look at some non-market data.

908
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,992
We added crafting to the game shortly after the economy went live.

909
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:15,176
Crafting is just taking a number of items

910
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:16,717
and trading them in with the game

911
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:17,858
instead of with another player

912
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,261
in order to get a different item back.

913
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:23,184
We use the fiction of a contract with the arms dealer.

914
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:26,207
It's essentially a way of trading in with the game controller

915
00:38:26,748 --> 00:38:29,130
instead of the player, and we use specific contracts

916
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,133
that define which items can be crafted into which other items.

917
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:35,276
We've organized our items into collections.

918
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:38,584
and we allow players to trade up inside of those collections.

919
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:40,846
Ten items from one quality tier

920
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:43,569
will get you a random item from the next tier up.

921
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,252
We can identify our most desired items

922
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,074
by looking at just a couple of factors.

923
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,836
For one thing, we'll look at our crafting data.

924
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:53,838
We can see which items are traded in

925
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,019
more frequently than usual.

926
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,821
We can also look at the origin of an item.

927
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:00,842
If lots of them are created via crafting,

928
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:03,383
we're either looking at the item that was desired,

929
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,885
or we're looking at an item in the same tier

930
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,105
as the one that you hoped you got,

931
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,566
or we're looking at an item that's transitional.

932
00:39:09,787 --> 00:39:11,047
It's something that someone crafted

933
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:13,789
in order to work their way towards a yet higher tier.

934
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,271
So if we look only at the items

935
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:19,731
that are created via crafting,

936
00:39:19,752 --> 00:39:21,252
but not subsequently traded in,

937
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:22,953
this gives us a pretty clear picture

938
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,774
of the favorite items from this collection.

939
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:27,412
We can further narrow aesthetic preferences

940
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:28,752
by looking at equip rates.

941
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,773
Items that are equipped at an unusually high rate

942
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:33,733
that are also worked towards via crafting

943
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:36,094
give us our best picture of our most loved items.

944
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,394
So for example, if you own a Desert Eagle

945
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:39,775
with the Cobalt Disruption finish,

946
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:42,635
you're 16% more likely to equip this one

947
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,136
than any other finish, even if you have lots of them.

948
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:48,076
So if we look only at the craft targets

949
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,857
that satisfy these two qualifications,

950
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,098
we actually end up with a pretty small list.

951
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:53,718
Whoops, sorry.

952
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:57,136
So people like anodized finishes a lot.

953
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:58,817
More than half the items on this list

954
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:00,259
are either anodized or metallic.

955
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:03,302
They also like saturated colors on black

956
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:04,383
or very bright finishes.

957
00:40:04,883 --> 00:40:06,565
And they also like weapons that have a sleek

958
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:07,926
kind of spy movie aesthetic.

959
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:09,788
The easiest thing to see though,

960
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:10,869
looking at all of these items,

961
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:12,990
is that most of them have a single predominant color.

962
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:15,613
I should note that this is really different

963
00:40:15,633 --> 00:40:17,074
from looking at price on the marketplace.

964
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,736
Although some of these items

965
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,357
do have a high price on the marketplace,

966
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:21,538
that's not true for all of them.

967
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,042
In fact, some of them are worth only about 50 cents,

968
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,625
and some of them are worth as much as, sorry, $30.

969
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,308
Scarcity also isn't reflected very well here.

970
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:33,390
Some of these items are really rare,

971
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,632
and some of them, there's a lot of them in the world.

972
00:40:36,112 --> 00:40:38,254
So looking at crafting and equip rates for these items

973
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:40,976
gives us a new window into what players value

974
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:42,798
about our economy content.

975
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:45,640
So this covers the high end of our aesthetic range.

976
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:47,762
What about the low end?

977
00:40:49,022 --> 00:40:50,624
Everybody starts with a default loadout.

978
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:53,766
As you play, you get drops of weapons with finishes.

979
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:55,547
The first time you get one,

980
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:59,290
you are 90% likely to equip it.

981
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:01,812
At least, that's true for most weapons.

982
00:41:02,413 --> 00:41:04,314
For some of them, even when you get it,

983
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,537
you dislike it so much, you'd rather have the default.

984
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:10,259
If we look only at the rejects,

985
00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:12,961
we can see, again, a pattern.

986
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,823
These are all camouflage-inspired.

987
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:16,744
In fact,

988
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:19,912
These are all items that look like our original inspiration.

989
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:25,973
So, although we started off thinking that the military camouflage was really cool,

990
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:30,935
it turns out that what our community really values are finishes that look more like paint guns.

991
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:36,676
This is great. We needed a reminder that although Counter-Strike is military-inspired,

992
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,837
it's not a military simulation. It's a sport.

993
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,138
When our customers play, they don't aspire to be soldiers.

994
00:41:43,538 --> 00:41:45,499
They aspire to be elite Counter-Strike players.

995
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:47,568
So maybe it's not that surprising

996
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,789
that the closest real-world analog we've got

997
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:52,150
to our preferred aesthetic comes from a sport.

998
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:54,911
If you looked at our content,

999
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:56,852
you'd assume that we understood this right from the start

1000
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:58,833
and decided to put the bright items

1001
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,253
at the top of our quality tiers

1002
00:42:00,293 --> 00:42:01,714
because we thought they had the most value.

1003
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:04,155
Actually, that wasn't what we were thinking.

1004
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:06,056
It was a risk mitigation strategy.

1005
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:07,577
We were genuinely worried

1006
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:09,457
that people wouldn't like the bright items.

1007
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:12,299
So instead of thinking of these as being sorted by value,

1008
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:14,440
we originally sorted them by risk.

1009
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:16,857
After all, if you got a rare item,

1010
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:18,258
you'd like it because it was rare,

1011
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:20,500
even if it was an aesthetic that you didn't appreciate.

1012
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:23,943
And for everybody else, if they don't have a rare item,

1013
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:25,484
they're happy because they don't have to see

1014
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:26,665
the bright stuff very often,

1015
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:28,206
because there aren't very many of them in the world.

1016
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:30,508
Well, now we know we were wrong.

1017
00:42:31,188 --> 00:42:32,369
Would that have changed our design?

1018
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,372
It may have, and let me explain how.

1019
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:38,114
We need to properly map out our design space.

1020
00:42:38,534 --> 00:42:39,995
We can think of the facets of luxury

1021
00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:41,236
as the axes in that space.

1022
00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:43,378
We've figured out the bounds of the axes

1023
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:44,359
by examining our data.

1024
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,600
Conspicuousness varies with the utility of the weapon.

1025
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,401
Scarcity, oops, sorry.

1026
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:51,841
Heritage and personnel history

1027
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:53,202
from the novel to the familiar.

1028
00:42:54,182 --> 00:42:55,542
Scarcity varies with supply

1029
00:42:55,602 --> 00:42:57,843
as well as how frequently you encounter an item,

1030
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:00,324
sorry, a finish for a particular weapon.

1031
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:04,505
Quality varies from our original scratched aesthetic

1032
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:05,585
to factory new.

1033
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:07,146
And our aesthetic style,

1034
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:08,486
which was the most difficult for us

1035
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:09,446
to tease out of the data,

1036
00:43:09,966 --> 00:43:12,347
varies from our original military aesthetic

1037
00:43:12,427 --> 00:43:14,808
to visually salient sports-inspired styles.

1038
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:18,564
The last thing that we want is for all of these axes

1039
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:20,565
to be aligned, collapsing our design space.

1040
00:43:20,585 --> 00:43:23,287
That would be possible if we didn't understand

1041
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:24,508
how these axes were defined.

1042
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:27,650
In fact, we'd align scarcity and aesthetics

1043
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,631
by putting most of our visually salient items

1044
00:43:29,671 --> 00:43:30,851
at the top of our collections.

1045
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:32,973
Fortunately, our design space

1046
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,414
has more than just those two axes,

1047
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:35,975
or we could have had a serious problem.

1048
00:43:37,676 --> 00:43:40,818
The worst scenario is that each item in the economy

1049
00:43:41,178 --> 00:43:42,719
has all the facets of a luxury good,

1050
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:44,120
each in equal degrees.

1051
00:43:45,073 --> 00:43:46,893
That doesn't encourage interactions in which players

1052
00:43:46,933 --> 00:43:48,474
both feel they're getting the better end of the deal.

1053
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:51,435
Someone's always going to be ahead of you on the ladder

1054
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,875
and somebody behind, and there's only one direction

1055
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:55,136
to trade in that makes any sense.

1056
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:58,737
That is the best way I can think of to stifle the economy.

1057
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,138
Instead, what we'd like is to have ways

1058
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:03,738
to create value in every axis.

1059
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:06,059
Understanding not only what the axes are,

1060
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:08,620
but how to place an item along it,

1061
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,761
lets us determine if we're providing enough variety of value.

1062
00:44:12,622 --> 00:44:14,823
Ideally, there wouldn't be any items in the economy

1063
00:44:15,003 --> 00:44:17,344
that had perfectly equal value on every axis.

1064
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:20,405
Having that range of value is really important.

1065
00:44:20,946 --> 00:44:22,786
We can create a range of items that have

1066
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,187
different value on different axes,

1067
00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:26,288
and then players with orthogonal goals

1068
00:44:26,348 --> 00:44:27,948
can trade with each other, and each feel like

1069
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:29,229
they're getting the better end of the deal,

1070
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:32,230
even if the total value of the items is unequal.

1071
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,951
So I could, for example, want to collect rare items,

1072
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:38,332
but maybe I don't care if they're bright or shiny.

1073
00:44:38,953 --> 00:44:40,933
Or I could want to collect items that are bright colors.

1074
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:43,265
but maybe it doesn't matter to me if they're factory new.

1075
00:44:43,986 --> 00:44:46,086
Those trades can happen even if the value's unequal,

1076
00:44:46,326 --> 00:44:47,407
and players with different goals

1077
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,307
can value different items in different ways.

1078
00:44:50,548 --> 00:44:51,888
So the finer we slice our axes,

1079
00:44:51,948 --> 00:44:54,269
the more nuanced trading and marketplace transactions

1080
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:54,749
can get.

1081
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:57,950
By creating our content in a semi-procedural way,

1082
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,171
we were able to slice our axes very fine indeed,

1083
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:02,491
creating a broad range of value

1084
00:45:02,512 --> 00:45:04,872
and creating value on multiple axes.

1085
00:45:05,693 --> 00:45:08,834
So with our players exchanging over 30 million items

1086
00:45:08,854 --> 00:45:10,294
with each other on the marketplace so far,

1087
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,792
It certainly seems like we've met our goals.

1088
00:45:14,514 --> 00:45:16,055
So let's wrap up by checking back in

1089
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:17,216
with our product level goals.

1090
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:19,718
We'd hope that the economy would improve

1091
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:20,758
the longevity of our game,

1092
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:22,880
provide fun and value to our customers,

1093
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,581
and make it easier for our customers

1094
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,283
to provide fun and value to each other.

1095
00:45:27,264 --> 00:45:28,464
Remember that we only have to check in

1096
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,625
on a couple of broad metrics

1097
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,886
to see if we're meeting our goals.

1098
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:33,088
It's our player numbers, player retention,

1099
00:45:33,468 --> 00:45:35,090
and our individual play times.

1100
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:39,174
This is taken from SteamGraph.net.

1101
00:45:39,354 --> 00:45:42,196
It's a community website that monitors the numbers

1102
00:45:42,216 --> 00:45:44,078
we publish about who's playing what on Steam.

1103
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:47,941
It shows our peak concurrent player numbers daily.

1104
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:49,742
So here's some notable landmarks.

1105
00:45:49,762 --> 00:45:50,943
Here are the games in beta.

1106
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:53,986
This is the launch of our game.

1107
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:56,207
And here are a couple of free weekends.

1108
00:45:57,609 --> 00:45:59,550
This is the Steam Summer Sale

1109
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,533
that preceded the Economy launch.

1110
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:06,734
So after our economy launch, we had a pretty dramatic increase

1111
00:46:06,774 --> 00:46:09,415
in peak player numbers, bringing us to regular highs

1112
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:12,355
that we'd only achieved previously by making the game temporarily free.

1113
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,336
This last spike here is DreamHack.

1114
00:46:15,836 --> 00:46:18,177
It's a big tournament for CSGO with a high viewership.

1115
00:46:19,118 --> 00:46:19,898
This game was also on...

1116
00:46:20,538 --> 00:46:22,358
Our game was also on sale for this time period,

1117
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,060
and that caused a huge player spike, nearly doubling our player count.

1118
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:31,042
There was a large influx of new players around this time and they stuck around at a really high rate.

1119
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:35,326
In fact, they stuck around at a much higher rate than players from previous sales.

1120
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:40,692
And so we can see that not only are our player numbers up, but our player retention is up.

1121
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:47,258
Since that event, we've been able to reach a new plateau of about 100,000 peaking current players daily

1122
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,981
and about 2.3 million monthly unique players.

1123
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:54,756
In the aggregate, it certainly looks like we've met our goals for adding the economy,

1124
00:46:55,077 --> 00:46:57,138
and individual players are sending us the same signal.

1125
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:00,441
They're playing more frequently and for longer,

1126
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:03,264
which is our best indication that we're providing them with lots of fun.

1127
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:06,847
And as they continue to play together and exchange items with each other,

1128
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:10,010
they're creating loads of value for each other as well.

1129
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,072
Our one remaining goal is that we increase the longevity of the game.

1130
00:47:13,573 --> 00:47:16,755
Now only time will tell, but with such a large community of returning players,

1131
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:18,857
CSGO's future looks really bright.

1132
00:47:20,864 --> 00:47:22,686
I'd like to open the floor for questions now.

1133
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:25,668
So if you have questions, please step up to the mics.

1134
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:30,212
Hi, Rondon.

1135
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:30,272
Hi.

1136
00:47:31,153 --> 00:47:33,195
Can we have a little light in here for the audience?

1137
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:40,214
You mentioned that there were only two technical artists, yourself and one other, working on CS Go to bring the economy update.

1138
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:50,903
About how big was the rest of the team, and I'm particularly interested in how the decisions were made to either proceed or not proceed with doing the economy in the context of how many people there were.

1139
00:47:51,503 --> 00:47:58,949
So we had, let me think back, around the time we probably had about 12 people on the team total.

1140
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:02,189
that team size has increased since then,

1141
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:04,451
which is good because it means we can do more stuff.

1142
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,773
But everyone was really behind the economy.

1143
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:10,354
I mean, looking at the success of TF2 and Dota 2,

1144
00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:13,496
we really wanted to improve our player numbers.

1145
00:48:14,837 --> 00:48:16,317
Typically after you launch a product,

1146
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:18,158
the product cycle goes like this, right?

1147
00:48:18,178 --> 00:48:19,319
You have this big spike at launch,

1148
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,000
and then it just continues downwards

1149
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,321
until you have this long tail.

1150
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,663
TF2 and Dota 2 both have this big spike,

1151
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:26,903
and then they just keep going up.

1152
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:28,965
And that's the model that we wanted to.

1153
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:30,301
to go for, right?

1154
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:32,562
So pretty much everybody on the team

1155
00:48:32,602 --> 00:48:33,943
was really pulling for the economy.

1156
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:35,723
It wasn't like we just had technical artists going,

1157
00:48:36,004 --> 00:48:37,364
hey, let's make an economy.

1158
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:39,385
Yeah, it was a whole team decision.

1159
00:48:43,126 --> 00:48:45,627
I have some links that you guys might wanna check out.

1160
00:48:45,647 --> 00:48:48,108
Hi.

1161
00:48:48,148 --> 00:48:48,709
One more question.

1162
00:48:49,649 --> 00:48:52,290
You have this game mode where you unlock, like.

1163
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:55,777
further weapons, the more kills you earn, right?

1164
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,802
Where you start with a pistol, and then you perform your first kill, and then you

1165
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:02,003
use the machine gun and whatnot.

1166
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:05,357
Right, so there's an in-game economy that's a game mechanic

1167
00:49:05,397 --> 00:49:07,819
that's totally separate from this kind of meta economy.

1168
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,722
And what happens is if you make a kill,

1169
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,263
you earn more money in-game,

1170
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,525
which allows you to buy a more expensive weapon later on.

1171
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:16,667
And that's actually a good catch,

1172
00:49:16,727 --> 00:49:18,969
because that graph that I was showing about weapon utility,

1173
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,532
it wasn't actually showing the rounds sequentially,

1174
00:49:21,552 --> 00:49:24,314
it was showing how much money you had to buy a weapon

1175
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:25,295
at the start of a round.

1176
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:27,257
So it's not exactly what I said it was,

1177
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:28,958
but I didn't want to explain the mechanic.

1178
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:34,561
I meant the certain, the special game mode where you like start with a pistol and then you perform one kill.

1179
00:49:34,741 --> 00:49:36,942
Oh, you're talking about the arms race?

1180
00:49:37,042 --> 00:49:47,767
Yeah. Did you like look at stats of players that like only play this particular game mode and how the like purchase of weapons differs for those players in comparison to like Deathmatch players or something?

1181
00:49:48,227 --> 00:49:51,688
Um, so there aren't actually a lot of players that play exclusively arms race.

1182
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:55,190
Um, in fact our players, here I totally have a slide for this.

1183
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:59,505
If I can get my cursor back from the other screen.

1184
00:50:03,648 --> 00:50:05,949
So we actually have different populations of players.

1185
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,851
Let me see if I can find the slide,

1186
00:50:09,111 --> 00:50:10,212
it's way at the end here.

1187
00:50:12,654 --> 00:50:13,995
So we have players who,

1188
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:16,236
mainly break down into three categories.

1189
00:50:16,296 --> 00:50:20,179
They break down into players who play on casual.

1190
00:50:20,865 --> 00:50:22,267
players who play on competitive

1191
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:24,829
and players who play on community servers.

1192
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,972
And so Arms Race is going to fit

1193
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:30,234
into the casual section of our players.

1194
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:32,856
And we didn't really break it down a lot further from there

1195
00:50:32,936 --> 00:50:34,858
because the populations got really, really small.

1196
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:38,401
Okay, thank you.

1197
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:38,521
Okay.

1198
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:50,123
Thanks Bronwyn. I wanted to ask now that CSGO is kind of in a different place than when you decided to start doing

1199
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:56,270
Weapon skin as items if you've got if you guys have considered any of the other

1200
00:50:57,612 --> 00:50:59,794
kind of more resource intensive

1201
00:51:00,715 --> 00:51:01,556
expansions to it

1202
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:04,280
That stuff is always on the table.

1203
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,161
It's just a matter of making sure that we have a goal for it.

1204
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:10,342
We don't want to ship something just for the sake of it.

1205
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:12,363
We want to work towards actually improving

1206
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,424
the customer experience.

1207
00:51:14,064 --> 00:51:16,725
And I mean, you might be thinking of things

1208
00:51:16,765 --> 00:51:18,446
like the character customization.

1209
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,427
Until we can solve the team ID problem,

1210
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:23,768
that wouldn't be something that we would want to ship.

1211
00:51:23,968 --> 00:51:26,449
So there's a lot of work to do there.

1212
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:28,810
That doesn't mean that we won't consider it.

1213
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,711
Okay, cool.

1214
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:38,713
Hi, on your graph there for the DreamHack, you notice a spike in players staying online.

1215
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:47,203
Now, did you guys have the eSports line of your economy planned before you noticed that spike or after?

1216
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:49,766
Oh, absolutely before. Yeah, absolutely before.

1217
00:51:51,379 --> 00:51:55,561
For those in the audience that don't know, we sold a special key for a special case.

1218
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:56,822
It was called the eSports case.

1219
00:51:57,202 --> 00:51:59,223
We've actually had a couple in that series so far.

1220
00:51:59,704 --> 00:52:02,726
And what that case does is we take a portion of the proceeds from that case

1221
00:52:02,806 --> 00:52:04,747
and we use it to fund community tournaments.

1222
00:52:05,287 --> 00:52:07,108
DreamHack was actually the first recipient,

1223
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:08,829
and they had a $250,000 prize pool that was funded by our community.

1224
00:52:11,411 --> 00:52:13,713
And so the community was actually heavily invested in it

1225
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:16,654
in order to go watch it and see the results

1226
00:52:16,694 --> 00:52:18,736
of something that they've been caring about all this time.

1227
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,437
And actually we just had the second one,

1228
00:52:20,497 --> 00:52:22,398
which was EMS1 in Katowice.

1229
00:52:23,138 --> 00:52:24,419
That was just last week.

1230
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,221
Our peak concurrent player numbers during that event

1231
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:30,223
went up to 165,000.

1232
00:52:30,323 --> 00:52:31,704
So, and we were also on sale.

1233
00:52:31,724 --> 00:52:33,365
So we'll see how many of those players come back

1234
00:52:33,425 --> 00:52:34,425
over the next couple of weeks.

1235
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:35,826
I'm actually kind of excited

1236
00:52:35,846 --> 00:52:37,487
because I think we're gonna reach a new plateau.

1237
00:52:37,507 --> 00:52:38,688
Okay, thank you.

1238
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:46,205
Hi, I know in the past few months you've also shipped an update that allows players to apply stickers to their guns.

1239
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:46,665
Yes.

1240
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:50,067
And one, I'm a big Counter-Strike player myself.

1241
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:50,728
Awesome.

1242
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:54,511
So are a lot of my friends, but I found that they're a lot more polarizing than the skins.

1243
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:58,714
And I was wondering if that was something you guys knew going into shipping that update.

1244
00:52:58,914 --> 00:52:59,034
No.

1245
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:01,536
We had no idea they'd be polarizing.

1246
00:53:01,556 --> 00:53:02,917
We thought people would think they were really cool.

1247
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:04,938
Um, there's...

1248
00:53:06,521 --> 00:53:08,142
You have to be careful when you're talking about things

1249
00:53:08,182 --> 00:53:09,943
being polarizing because there's some data

1250
00:53:09,963 --> 00:53:11,824
that you can get anecdotally that isn't actually

1251
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:14,066
represented in players' purchasing behavior.

1252
00:53:14,466 --> 00:53:15,827
And so there's a large community,

1253
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:17,948
or actually a large community of players

1254
00:53:17,968 --> 00:53:20,470
that never speak up, right?

1255
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,551
That are perfectly happy with the things that they get.

1256
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:26,574
And so when we're looking at things to add to the game,

1257
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:29,155
or assessing whether something was valuable

1258
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:31,237
and whether it's working, we can't just look at

1259
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:32,718
what people are talking about in the forums,

1260
00:53:32,778 --> 00:53:35,119
although we obviously do read that stuff all the time

1261
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:36,020
and take it into account.

1262
00:53:36,477 --> 00:53:39,161
We also have to look at how our players' behaviors

1263
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:40,663
are changing and whether they're actually

1264
00:53:40,743 --> 00:53:42,425
consuming the content and enjoying it.

1265
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,148
And it turns out that people actually love stickers.

1266
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,451
Yeah, for the most part anyway.

1267
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:48,533
Cool, thank you.

1268
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,942
In CS 1.6, you guys had spray paint on the world, right?

1269
00:53:56,302 --> 00:53:56,522
Yes.

1270
00:53:56,582 --> 00:54:00,264
Have you guys considered adding user-customized spray paints,

1271
00:54:00,364 --> 00:54:03,486
which obviously you guys will have to monitor what goes in

1272
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:04,727
and what goes out?

1273
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:08,369
And the ability to maybe, like, if I didn't like a spray paint

1274
00:54:08,429 --> 00:54:10,850
and I was playing the game, I could actually

1275
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,991
spray something on top of that and kind of hide it and so on.

1276
00:54:13,772 --> 00:54:14,872
Did you guys consider something like that?

1277
00:54:15,423 --> 00:54:18,004
So there were a lot of abuses of the original system

1278
00:54:18,064 --> 00:54:20,124
because there wasn't any sort of gating system.

1279
00:54:20,164 --> 00:54:22,005
You could just put in whatever you wanted.

1280
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:24,205
And so there were a lot of obscene images

1281
00:54:24,245 --> 00:54:25,325
to spray it around the world.

1282
00:54:25,425 --> 00:54:28,026
And actually, my favorite and the worst

1283
00:54:28,106 --> 00:54:30,726
is that people would take a picture of themselves

1284
00:54:30,946 --> 00:54:33,327
there in weapon pose standing against a wall,

1285
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:34,987
and then they would spray it on the wall,

1286
00:54:35,247 --> 00:54:36,507
and then other players would come by

1287
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:38,267
and start targeting to shoot there.

1288
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:40,928
And so it was like this weird strategic

1289
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:42,748
kind of emergent gameplay sort of thing.

1290
00:54:44,706 --> 00:54:49,269
We're not sure how much value sprays have relative to some of the other things that we could do.

1291
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:53,432
I know that people do want them back because they're, well again, it's kind of a heritage

1292
00:54:53,492 --> 00:54:57,955
thing. People are used to having them, but we haven't made any decision one way or the other.

1293
00:54:57,975 --> 00:55:05,360
Hello, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how knives factored in.

1294
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:11,365
Were they always supposed to be the ultra rare kind of item from these cases and obviously

1295
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:13,106
their effects are just aesthetic?

1296
00:55:14,888 --> 00:55:18,428
So knives, yes, we always plan to make them

1297
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:20,849
the most rare items, and the reason is that

1298
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:23,129
these are weapons with an extremely high utility.

1299
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,190
You use them in every single round of the game,

1300
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,350
you whip them out all the time,

1301
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,990
because whipping them out makes you run faster

1302
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,310
relative to carrying a heavy weapon right in front of you.

1303
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:36,272
We thought that just giving them out

1304
00:55:36,512 --> 00:55:37,372
would be kind of a waste,

1305
00:55:37,472 --> 00:55:39,972
because there was such an opportunity to drive value

1306
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:42,233
by making them rare and desirable.

1307
00:55:44,106 --> 00:55:48,048
We even see within these guys that there's a value spread, like all the different finishes.

1308
00:55:48,508 --> 00:55:52,209
The Fade is the most popular, and then the Slaughter, and then the Karambit is the most

1309
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:52,970
popular knife.

1310
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,071
And so there's a good range of value here, too.

1311
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,993
It's a little bit worrisome because the value of these items is so high.

1312
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:04,755
Actually, for a long time, we were watching the price of them just keep rising on the

1313
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:09,057
marketplace, which is really scary, because we have a calf on the marketplace of $400.

1314
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,982
And so if you have an item that's worth more than $400,

1315
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:16,345
you can actually get the value of it from the marketplace.

1316
00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:18,927
And so people end up doing things like taking their knives

1317
00:56:18,987 --> 00:56:20,128
and trying to sell them on eBay

1318
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,569
and they get scammed all the time.

1319
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,031
And it's not really all that positive for players.

1320
00:56:26,013 --> 00:56:27,494
Finally, the price has stabilized.

1321
00:56:27,534 --> 00:56:29,496
So now they're around like 200 bucks.

1322
00:56:30,617 --> 00:56:31,598
So we feel a little safer.

1323
00:56:32,797 --> 00:56:35,797
Yeah, we always plan to make those the highest tier items.

1324
00:56:36,057 --> 00:56:37,398
And I didn't talk about them very much

1325
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,698
because they don't really fit into any of the collections

1326
00:56:39,758 --> 00:56:41,318
or any of the other things that we talked about.

1327
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,939
And they have such a high scarcity and such a high utility

1328
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:46,860
that they're just off the charts on pretty much all of our other ranges.

1329
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,601
Thank you.

1330
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:51,881
Hi.

1331
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:53,241
I was curious about,

1332
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:56,782
so you have some weapon skins that are tracking in terms of kills.

1333
00:56:57,282 --> 00:56:57,602
Oh, yeah.

1334
00:56:57,662 --> 00:57:01,143
How does that play into, I guess, like the aesthetics of the weapon and everything?

1335
00:57:01,447 --> 00:57:04,849
Yeah, yeah, nothing.

1336
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,911
Well, so we call these items stat track items.

1337
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:10,752
They're kind of like the strangers from TF.

1338
00:57:10,813 --> 00:57:12,073
It tracks how many kills you get.

1339
00:57:12,674 --> 00:57:15,395
So I think in TF, your strange weapon

1340
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,716
just tracks it as part of the name or description

1341
00:57:18,077 --> 00:57:19,557
and you don't actually see it as,

1342
00:57:19,878 --> 00:57:21,098
like it's not on your weapon.

1343
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,000
We created modules or like, especially on the knives,

1344
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,661
they have these little scratched off bits

1345
00:57:26,061 --> 00:57:27,682
where you can actually see it on the weapon

1346
00:57:27,702 --> 00:57:29,063
and people really seem to like that.

1347
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:35,043
We have found that the value of these things,

1348
00:57:36,403 --> 00:57:38,443
there is some value there just for intrinsically,

1349
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:39,484
they're fun to have,

1350
00:57:39,644 --> 00:57:41,404
but most of the value of them on the marketplace

1351
00:57:41,464 --> 00:57:43,985
comes from their scarcity, which is sort of interesting.

1352
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:47,105
So it's another way that we can generate a range of value.

1353
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:49,726
Does that answer your question, or was there?

1354
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:51,146
Thank you. Cool.

1355
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:58,707
So you have Dota 2 and TF2 that are both free-to-play games.

1356
00:57:59,147 --> 00:57:59,367
Yes.

1357
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:00,968
As you guys develop the economy.

1358
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:08,090
Are you able to say what some of the tension that you're running into maybe making CS go free to play or not?

1359
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:11,232
That's a question that we get a lot.

1360
00:58:12,914 --> 00:58:17,497
The one thing that we're concerned about that's stopping us from going free to play is cheating.

1361
00:58:18,057 --> 00:58:20,679
Right now there's a friction if someone gets caught cheating,

1362
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:24,803
they have to rebuy the game in order to come in and keep ruining other people's experiences.

1363
00:58:25,643 --> 00:58:27,344
If the game is free to play, there's no friction at all.

1364
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:29,006
They can just keep rolling over accounts.

1365
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:31,247
And so until we solve that problem.

1366
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,247
we probably wouldn't go free to play,

1367
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:36,350
but it's something that we talk about all the time.

1368
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,472
Thanks.

1369
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:43,238
Do you make the same kind of assessments

1370
00:58:43,278 --> 00:58:46,503
when choosing map workshop levels?

1371
00:58:47,944 --> 00:58:48,886
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1372
00:58:48,906 --> 00:58:49,567
Yeah.

1373
00:58:51,905 --> 00:58:54,566
There are different things that the different maps bring.

1374
00:58:54,586 --> 00:58:56,868
There are some maps that are just absolutely gorgeous

1375
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,689
and they draw people into those worlds.

1376
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:01,791
And there are some maps that are slightly less gorgeous

1377
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,612
but they play really fantastically.

1378
00:59:03,912 --> 00:59:07,074
What we do find is that the value of the maps

1379
00:59:07,174 --> 00:59:10,757
to the community is almost all about play.

1380
00:59:11,197 --> 00:59:12,558
It's like if they play really well.

1381
00:59:12,638 --> 00:59:15,640
So you guys, if you're Counter-Strike players,

1382
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,661
have probably heard of Cache.

1383
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:19,022
It's a really popular map.

1384
00:59:19,082 --> 00:59:20,803
It's a community created map that has,

1385
00:59:22,181 --> 00:59:23,622
a really good play style to it.

1386
00:59:23,742 --> 00:59:26,023
So that one's really popular compared to some of the other maps

1387
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,164
that might be visually more attractive,

1388
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:32,947
but they aren't as popular because the gameplay isn't quite as strong.

1389
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:38,409
All right, I think we're out of time.

1390
00:59:38,429 --> 00:59:40,050
So thanks.
