1
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:06,734
As you all probably come back from lunch and have a little

2
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:09,996
bit of a food coma, I wanted to reengage your brains a little

3
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:14,158
bit with some highly complicated math. So as soon as you know

4
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:16,800
the answer to the following problem, please feel free to

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,241
yell it out as loud as you like. I want the people next door to

6
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:25,964
hear. This is hard. 12 minus 5. That's kind of pitiful, but a

7
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:29,346
few people got 7. All right. So that's good. So we'll step it up

8
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:31,607
a little bit. Feel free to jump in here.

9
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:35,934
And this one, I need you to answer in the proper format.

10
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:41,418
So we have three dots minus one dot equals two dots.

11
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:41,978
Very good.

12
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:43,219
So people are awake.

13
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:43,759
I like this.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,460
So bonus round.

15
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:48,182
Answer in the correct format.

16
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,624
We have Roman numeral four minus Roman numeral four

17
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:52,244
equals.

18
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:59,047
Zero, not, null, nothing.

19
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:00,648
This seems like a simple concept, right?

20
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:02,389
You either have something or you don't.

21
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,290
Something is there or it's not.

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,511
But obviously I've misled you a bit here

23
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:09,093
because there is no Roman numeral for zero.

24
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,114
At a purely philosophical level,

25
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:13,175
this is an unsolvable problem.

26
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:14,956
And the greatest minds in history

27
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:16,417
have been unable to resolve it

28
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:19,699
because they couldn't agree on what nothing actually was.

29
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:23,391
If you take everything out of a box, you're left with a void.

30
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,972
And that void is theoretically something.

31
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:27,253
It has a name.

32
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:29,135
It conceptually exists.

33
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:33,118
And in this way, nothing has become a thing.

34
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:39,225
And this idea of nothing as something is exactly what the Greek and Roman philosophers debated

35
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:40,326
about endlessly.

36
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:45,851
Because if nothing is something, then it can be used as a tool.

37
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:48,273
And that's exactly what we do.

38
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,575
Design is about simplicity.

39
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:53,237
It's about reduction and clarity.

40
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:55,879
It's about the importance of nothing.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,282
So nothing is a tool that we use perhaps unconsciously all the time,

42
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:02,583
but if we could apply it purposefully,

43
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,525
then it stands to reason that we could make our maps and our games better.

44
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:11,849
And as technology improves, we have the ability to add more and more to our games,

45
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,611
to make them indistinguishable from reality by highlighting every crack,

46
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:20,013
every pore on the face, every strand of hair, every piece of geometry.

47
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:25,879
but we often forget to pause and consider the advantages inherent to the simplicity

48
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:27,140
and clarity of nothing.

49
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:31,845
And a few months ago, as we were sitting around the office, we had this discussion about level

50
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:36,650
clarity and it kind of inspired me to go back and revisit some of the basic design principles

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,115
to take some lessons from the past and see how we might carry them forward into the future.

52
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:46,005
Now, at Epic, we've been fortunate enough to have had

53
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,326
some successful games.

54
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,768
And within those games, there's one map that really

55
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:53,831
stands out as what is quite possibly our most popular map

56
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:56,354
of all time, and that is Facing Worlds.

57
00:02:57,455 --> 00:03:01,198
Facing Worlds, or just CTF Face as it's commonly known, was a

58
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:02,839
masterpiece of simplicity.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,143
Stands out to me as representative of a generation

60
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:09,625
of design techniques that we're kind of

61
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:10,626
starting to stray from.

62
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:15,751
It has a really clean use of space, visual clarity, and flow.

63
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:22,577
And it's all due in large part to its great use of applied nothingness by way of negative space.

64
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:28,122
Now, the popularity of Facing Worlds is impressive and humbling, really.

65
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:31,245
It's... If you Google Facing Worlds, you'll get over 37 million hits.

66
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:38,621
and I've seen copies, remakes, refactors, maps inspired by Face by the hundreds if not

67
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:45,366
the thousands. You'll see homebrew versions popping up in Worms of all places, Halo, StarCraft,

68
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:51,571
Castle Wolfenstein, TF2, Minecraft, any number of games that allow their players to mod and

69
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:57,015
create. As recently as last year, PC Gamer did a feature on the map calling it one of

70
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:59,157
the best multiplayer maps ever.

71
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:03,739
Just this one fan page that I found randomly on the internet

72
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,542
has over two dozen versions available for download.

73
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,285
I wonder how many of them were able to recapture

74
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,067
that same simplicity and beauty.

75
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,249
How many of them tried to update the map

76
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,512
without really realizing what made it work in the first place?

77
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:21,674
Because this is something that even we have struggled with

78
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,957
in our own internal versions and official updates.

79
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:31,559
Face has been represented in multiple generations of Epyx games across multiple versions of the Unreal Engine.

80
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:39,941
So we can track how those techniques changed and get a clear understanding of the impact that that had on the history of the map as it evolved.

81
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,301
So, what did make it work?

82
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:47,262
To a large degree, I'm saying it was negative space.

83
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:52,863
Now technically speaking, negative space is the space where things aren't present.

84
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:55,243
Or the space between objects.

85
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:59,173
And negative space has been used for millennia.

86
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:02,815
It's found both in aboriginal and paleolithic cave art.

87
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:07,437
In the modern sense, you see it being used

88
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:09,919
as a means of intentionally focusing the eye

89
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,960
and achieving compositional balance.

90
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,041
You see it everywhere, even today,

91
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:15,982
although you may not realize what you're seeing,

92
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,303
and quite honestly, that's kind of the point.

93
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,504
Have you ever noticed that there's a delivery arrow

94
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:24,186
between the E and the X in the middle of the FedEx logo?

95
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:30,255
or NBC's Peacock. That the World Wildlife Federation's panda is actually just a collection

96
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:36,759
of shapes, it's not actually an animal. That there's no S in the USA Network's logo. Disney

97
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:41,101
has even come out with kid-friendly pirate skull t-shirts that don't have scary skulls

98
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:46,285
on them. In all of these cases, your brain fills in the missing details for you.

99
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:52,019
Now another common definition of negative space is just removing miscellaneous detail

100
00:05:52,379 --> 00:06:00,285
to achieve a natural balance that allows your eye to understand and appreciate the focus

101
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:01,105
of what it's looking at.

102
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:06,889
So combining these various techniques, we see negative space being used in game marketing

103
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:07,790
all the time.

104
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:11,493
Battlefield, League of Legends, Halo.

105
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:18,088
Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, we used it to give Marcus his flaming phoenix wings in

106
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:24,590
Gears of War. It was the basis for our entire launch campaign in Gears of War 2, and it

107
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:31,651
serves as the foundation for each and every one of our iconic Crimson Omen logos. So it's

108
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:39,173
used somewhat ubiquitous in 2D space, but what about 3D? Well, design can be defined

109
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,653
as a noun. It's a plan or a draft.

110
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:47,042
but it's also a verb, to plan, to project, or to intend.

111
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:49,144
And I love that intent definition

112
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:52,688
because it really helps capture how much of design

113
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:54,629
is about emotion and empathy.

114
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,052
And to me, this is one of the core concepts

115
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:59,674
of what I'm calling negative space design

116
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:03,417
and using these techniques to achieve the more commonly

117
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:07,521
discussed principles of design, which are balance, contrast,

118
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:08,342
and emphasis.

119
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,518
Now, these are all concepts that we used to keep in mind whenever we built anything.

120
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:19,121
We started with a void of nothing that ironically was actually conceptually something because

121
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:23,504
the Unreal Engine was subtractive, and we had to carve out space into the world from

122
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:23,965
this void.

123
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,772
And as we subtracted space into this void, every polygon was significant.

124
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:35,236
You had to balance every cut, every shape, and purposefully create architecture that

125
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:41,620
emphasized our designs in as simple a manner as possible, because technology at the time

126
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,121
wasn't really capable of more.

127
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:48,183
And getting this right was as much of an art as it was a science, and the best designers

128
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:51,044
understood this, and you could clearly see it in their work.

129
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,566
This is one of the reasons that I fell in love with CTF Face, and why I've always respected

130
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,747
Cedric, who I don't know if he's here, that would be awesome if he was.

131
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,408
Sadly not.

132
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:05,850
He is the map's original designer, and I've always thought he was one of the industry's

133
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,651
best, a real master at his craft.

134
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:14,527
Masters have always been those people who understand the relationship between art and science.

135
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:19,013
Look at Leonardo da Vinci, considered to be one of the greatest minds in history.

136
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:25,181
Painter, sculptor, mathematician, engineer, politician, anatomist, geologist, botanist.

137
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:27,624
True crossover between art and science.

138
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:31,603
Now, Da Vinci expanded on the concept of negative space

139
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,744
with something that he called sfumato.

140
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:36,425
It was a technique which includes the concept

141
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:40,067
of using the surrounding space to imply meaning.

142
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,628
Now, there's more to sfumato than just this basic concept,

143
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:45,849
but Mona Lisa is a great example

144
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:46,929
of what I'm talking about here.

145
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,671
Focus on her head for a minute.

146
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:52,592
It wasn't stenciled out with hard lines

147
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,133
and then colored in like you would a coloring book.

148
00:08:56,042 --> 00:09:02,395
Instead, the shape of her features are actually defined by the dark spaces of hair and shadow,

149
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:06,443
which also serves to highlight her face as a focal point in the image.

150
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:11,540
Now, this is the opposite of a silhouette.

151
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,461
And it's a common technique we use in video games

152
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,943
to lure players toward an exit or an important item.

153
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:20,144
So in a broader sense, using negative space

154
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:22,726
can be defined as using what isn't there.

155
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:25,967
And this is a definition which has wide application

156
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:29,789
to 3D space and by extension to both game design and level

157
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:30,110
design.

158
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,992
If you look at famous structures like the Pantheon or the Eiffel Tower, their use of

159
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:40,654
shapes and negative space imparts a visual clarity that gives the eye a focal point and

160
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:44,916
a really easy way to understand the space around them, the space that surrounds and

161
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:45,656
defines them.

162
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:51,138
And it's no coincidence that if you take these two images and stack them, you begin to see

163
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:53,759
the basic framework for the towers and facing worlds.

164
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:58,829
The use of negative space in the original Facing Worlds map intentionally gave the player

165
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:04,330
that visual clarity that meant more focus on the gameplay, and less focus on trying

166
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,350
to figure out the scene.

167
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:10,491
The simple, well-defined shapes stand out from the background, and the tall, narrowing

168
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:16,232
towers anchor the eye to the important gameplay spaces, and the players in those spaces can

169
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:20,773
be picked out against their dark backgrounds, highlighted through motto, like Mona Lisa's

170
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,073
face.

171
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:25,378
Now, of course, this is by no means unique to Facing Worlds.

172
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:30,945
I would actually argue that all of the most popular maps across a wide spectrum of games

173
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,429
represent prime examples of good negative space use.

174
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,174
You can see those same principles at work in Call of Duty on Crossfire.

175
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:43,560
Counter-Strike and Dust, Halo and Blood Gulch, Quake 3's Longest Yard, League of Legends

176
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,543
Summoner's Rift, the list goes on and on.

177
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:51,749
Each of these maps is arguably the most popular map in their respective game.

178
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:57,175
And subconsciously or otherwise, each of them is enhanced by the use of negative space to

179
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:59,738
define their visuals and their gameplay.

180
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:08,262
So before I get too deep on the use of negative space, I think it's important to understand

181
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,062
why it works.

182
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:12,603
And the easiest explanation is just biology.

183
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:16,044
Our brains are hardwired to understand these kind of concepts.

184
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:21,166
There are some cultures in the Amazon today who really only use three numbers.

185
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:24,207
A few, a few more, and many.

186
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:28,707
Anything beyond that is considered just to be too troublesome.

187
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,308
It's not worth the complication.

188
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,570
Now that's not to say that they don't understand what nothing is.

189
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,852
It's actually quite the contrary.

190
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:40,975
They think that the concept of nothing is so simple and so universal, it's just not

191
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,096
even worth talking about.

192
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:47,359
They would consider the debates of the Greek and Roman philosophers as just wasting time

193
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,060
on the obvious.

194
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:53,856
Alex was a famous African gray parrot, and he was known for his cognitive abilities.

195
00:11:54,476 --> 00:12:00,239
He could communicate shapes, sizes, materials, colors, any number of concepts, and not just

196
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,239
rote memorization.

197
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:05,381
He understood that six things was more than three things.

198
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:10,084
He could even combine concepts to create words for things that he hadn't been taught.

199
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:14,011
And so when the researchers started teaching him to count,

200
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,814
he astounded the staff by not only understanding,

201
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,936
but being able, or not only communicating,

202
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:23,338
but being able to understand the concept of nothing

203
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,480
without anyone ever teaching it to him.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,861
This is part of our biology.

205
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,421
This is the way your brain works.

206
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:31,922
And this inherent understanding of nothing

207
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:34,382
is one of the most powerful tools that we can use

208
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:37,623
to improve the overall experience of our players.

209
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,984
You can even see how the opposite of negative space

210
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:43,284
has a dramatic effect on level clarity.

211
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,745
If you look at Call of Duty's favela maps,

212
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,445
there's so many paths, so much detail,

213
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:52,206
so much going on that it's just visually overwhelming.

214
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:54,726
There's nowhere for your eye to stop and make sense of the scene.

215
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:59,359
Now, Gestalt theory tells us how the brain processes information

216
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,921
by breaking it down or combining groups of details

217
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:05,582
into larger chunks that are easier to process.

218
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,203
Visual information, in particular,

219
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:11,385
is processed all at once, compared

220
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:14,647
to words and numbers, which are processed sequentially.

221
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:19,146
Now, artists take advantage of this technique all the time.

222
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,848
Look up just about any speed painting video,

223
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,869
and you'll notice that the artists flip their images

224
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,171
back and forth, and then they'll suddenly zoom in and zoom out.

225
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:31,193
And they do this so that they don't get lost in the details.

226
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:34,415
They do it so they can take in the entire image all at once

227
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:37,657
and see how the piece reads or communicates as a whole.

228
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:39,458
And the video I'm referencing here

229
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:41,319
is just a random one I pulled off the internet.

230
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,001
And you can see that just in the space of a second or two,

231
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,121
The artist moves from painting the fine details in a large image

232
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:52,362
to glancing at the entire image all at once and zooming in and out.

233
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:55,323
It's just a blip, but that's all it takes

234
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:58,424
because of the way our brains process visual information

235
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,425
in a quick flash all at once.

236
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,146
Now, of course, this isn't a new technique.

237
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,986
It wasn't invented by Photoshop users.

238
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,647
And the lo-fi version, which has been used for centuries,

239
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:08,848
is the squint test.

240
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,940
Here's a famous negative space image of a dog.

241
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,340
If you have trouble seeing, squint,

242
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,401
and the dog will probably come into focus.

243
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,202
Squinting gives you the broad sense of a scene

244
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:25,203
while minimizing the impact of the finer details.

245
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:28,223
This is kind of like an auto gestalt simulator.

246
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,704
Now to account for this, we actually

247
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,025
implemented a squint tool in Unreal Engine 3.

248
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:38,376
I don't know exactly who did it, I tried to figure it out and I couldn't, it got wild goose chase.

249
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:42,919
But I had this image in my head of a programmer walking into a room full of artists

250
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:46,201
and they're all squinting at their scenes and complaining of headaches.

251
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:48,803
So essentially, with a click of this button,

252
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:51,524
you could blur the frame buffer, making

253
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:53,504
the scene in your editor viewport

254
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:56,005
look just as it would as if you were squinting,

255
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,046
but with less eye strain.

256
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:00,127
And since I didn't have everything

257
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,848
I wanted to show you today running in Unreal Engine 3,

258
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:06,449
I tried to recreate that same squint effect using

259
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:08,209
Photoshop's built-in blur filter.

260
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,211
So here's face and favela side by side.

261
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:14,814
And here they are with Photoshop's default blur filter

262
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,656
to show you what each scene might look like if you were

263
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:20,398
using that squint tool.

264
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,021
Now if you can imagine yourself moving through these maps in

265
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,403
real time, your eyes quickly scanning for enemies, these

266
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:30,605
blurry images are similar to what your brain would process

267
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:31,586
in a split second.

268
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:38,040
And even without stopping to focus on any particular detail, you can see that face is

269
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,760
still almost completely readable.

270
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,920
The paths are there, the doors, the architecture, the shapes.

271
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:47,621
It would be really simple for your brain to take this entire scene in quickly and make

272
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:50,042
decisions quickly in game.

273
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:54,703
Now, by contrast, favela has just become a jumble of bleeding colors.

274
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,903
And the only real distinct feature there is the sky.

275
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:01,264
Your brain has to struggle a little bit to interpret.

276
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:03,405
the individual details.

277
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:08,288
And even though that might happen in a split second, that's all it takes to affect your

278
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:09,869
reaction time in combat.

279
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:16,452
It slows down that decision-making process because you have to mentally focus and process

280
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:20,655
each detail sequentially rather than taking in the scene as a whole.

281
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:26,198
So squinting, shrinking, blurring, these are all really simple techniques that you can

282
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:30,940
use almost at any time to ensure that your foreground and your background work together.

283
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:35,120
The foreground and the background, if the foreground and the background are fighting for attention,

284
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,482
then neither is going to win.

285
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,005
Good use of negative space, however,

286
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:44,252
can focus the player's attention on what you think are the important elements of your scene,

287
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:47,636
meaning that you take an active part in the design process,

288
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,880
that you can actually influence the experience of your players.

289
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:58,125
Another way the brain works through a complicated scene is to break it down into what cognitive

290
00:16:58,145 --> 00:17:01,289
scientists call small, meaningful patterns.

291
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,854
We take groups of objects that are similar and we quickly combine them into a single

292
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,536
chunk that's easy to process.

293
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:13,259
I wanted to visualize this process too, so leaning on Photoshop one more time, I used

294
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,320
the palette knife filter.

295
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,083
The palette knife processes an image, taking areas of similar color and combining them

296
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:24,304
into one of the same color, just like our brains might do with visual information.

297
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:29,327
So again, here's face and favela, and here they are processed with Photoshop's default

298
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,508
settings on the palette knife filter.

299
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:35,304
You can see that all the main features of FACE are still there.

300
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:39,767
The paths, the doors, the assault points, everything comes through clearly, but by contrast,

301
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:42,990
Favela becomes an obscure collection of blotches.

302
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,093
You can't even distinguish the gameplay space from the architecture anymore.

303
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:53,417
Now, this is significant because it says how we...

304
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:54,018
we...

305
00:17:55,413 --> 00:18:01,394
affects perception in our maps. An image of well-defined borders is really easy for our brains to process.

306
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:08,916
The first two circles here have nice clean borders, while the last circle is fuzzy, and it's more difficult to find the edges.

307
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:16,438
When you look at an image, the main focal point is called the figure, and it's processed very quickly and easily

308
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:22,139
when it's well differentiated from the background or negative space of the scene known as the ground.

309
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:26,398
If your players can't discern a figure from ground,

310
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,980
they'll have difficulty understanding how to navigate,

311
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,282
and they'll struggle with target identification.

312
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:34,264
And that's the basis for the classic image you see here,

313
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:36,826
where ambiguity causes the brain to question

314
00:18:36,886 --> 00:18:39,528
whether it's looking at a candlestick or two faces.

315
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:43,191
Each of you will make that decision very quickly,

316
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:45,833
and somewhat ambiguously, because there is no right answer.

317
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:47,854
In a split second, you'll decide

318
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:50,216
whether you're looking at a candlestick or faces.

319
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,722
But in a video game, that same split second can be an eternity.

320
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,844
It can cost you life, it can throw an important play that ends the match.

321
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:07,348
And the ambiguity of that decision means that your player isn't necessarily experiencing the design that you intended.

322
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:11,991
Communicating clarity is a fundamental part of your role as a level designer.

323
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:18,655
Now I've heard, I don't know for sure, but I have heard that Favela was the number one drop point in Call of Duty's campaign.

324
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,770
and that their multiplayer version was actually one of their least popular maps.

325
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,171
Now obviously, that feeling of overwhelming oppression and the frantic nature of combat

326
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:32,672
was the whole point of that mission, but, and given the source material that they had

327
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:37,453
to work with, they actually did a pretty fantastic job of distilling it down to a gameplay experience.

328
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:43,014
I'm simply pointing out that there's a stark contrast that can be achieved if you focus

329
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:46,755
on the use of negative space as a tool while you're designing.

330
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:51,149
Nor am I claiming that I myself have been immune to these problems.

331
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:55,116
We all struggle with it, and that's exactly why I wanted to talk about it today.

332
00:19:55,876 --> 00:20:00,277
In Gears of War, we had a map called Gridlock that was probably our most popular map in

333
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:00,957
the franchise.

334
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:05,198
And not surprisingly, the map has a pretty good use of negative space, with the shapes

335
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:10,259
in the buildings contrasting with the different colors in the stone and against the background

336
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:10,820
of the sky.

337
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,421
Now, applying those same filters as before, the blur and the palette, you can see how

338
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:18,901
the map's features still hold up.

339
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:22,443
The cars are still distinct from the ground that they're sitting on.

340
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:27,125
That gameplay space stands out from the buildings and there's a nice contrast against the background

341
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:27,765
of the sky.

342
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:34,188
Now, with Gears of War 2, we wanted to bring Gridlock back with an updated version that

343
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:37,509
aged the environment to match the progression of the game's story.

344
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,591
So we set out to do a theme that was overgrown.

345
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:42,951
And in so doing...

346
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:47,058
I think we actually lost a lot of that great contrast.

347
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:52,222
So here's side by side of the same exact position in Gears 1 and Gears 2.

348
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:59,588
And applying those same filters, you can see that even though Gears 2 has a high contrast sky to outline the shapes on the horizon,

349
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:03,611
the overall sense of negative space is completely lost along the floor.

350
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,993
There's no figure ground distinction.

351
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:11,757
And important areas, like, hey, where the gameplay takes place, are just visually muddy.

352
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:16,245
And while admittedly there are any number of other factors

353
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:19,988
going on here, here's a chart that shows map popularity in

354
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:22,791
Gears of War 2 as a factor of time played.

355
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:25,713
And you'll notice that the new version of Gridlock is at the

356
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,135
very bottom of the list.

357
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,881
So, with Gears of War 3, we made this awesome decision to age the map even further.

358
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:38,922
And this time the gameplay space became so overgrown that the gameplay completely fell apart.

359
00:21:39,642 --> 00:21:45,043
What was once the most popular map in the game became that one map that our testers hated playing.

360
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:49,584
We hadn't changed the physical play space, the weapon loadout, or even the collision.

361
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:52,625
But just that shift in tone and color...

362
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:57,187
meant to a change in perception, a perception of negative space

363
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:01,369
that took away the clarity that we had gotten from that original version of the map.

364
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,692
So, we saw that this just wasn't working, and near the end of the project,

365
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:07,132
we threw everything away.

366
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:11,795
And we went back to a cleaner style that brought back the contrast we were aiming for,

367
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:15,157
and highlighted the negative space aspects of the map.

368
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,278
Not to belabor the point, but here's a screenshot of the map.

369
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:23,148
blur and again with the other filter, the cars stand out from the ground, the gameplay

370
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:27,098
spaces differentiated from the buildings, the whole scene has a nice contrast against

371
00:22:27,118 --> 00:22:27,640
the background.

372
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:32,016
Sure enough, here's a chart showing this version of Gridlock

373
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:37,158
back in the top three most played maps of Gears of War 3's lifetime.

374
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:40,540
Application of negative space design techniques

375
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,961
led to an increase in map readability,

376
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:47,044
and by extension, playability and enjoyability.

377
00:22:47,744 --> 00:22:49,545
So even though it was difficult to do at the time,

378
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:52,967
I'm really glad that we made that call to throw everything away and change the map.

379
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,728
And that chart tells me that the payoff was worth the effort.

380
00:22:56,276 --> 00:23:00,719
And we might not have actually been brave enough to do that had we not already struggled

381
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,360
with this problem in another map.

382
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:05,723
And ironically, that map was CTF Face.

383
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:12,627
With the sequel to UT and Unreal Tournament 2003, we transitioned to a new version of

384
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:17,071
the Unreal Engine, and we decided to update Facing Worlds along with it and take advantage

385
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:18,471
of our new Egyptian setting.

386
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:22,035
Now the Egyptian concept for zero is the nefer.

387
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:26,099
It's a hieroglyph which roughly translates to the beginning of everything.

388
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,941
It's a visual representation of the heart.

389
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:34,645
Now to the ancient Egyptians then, you could say that the zero, or nothing, is the heart

390
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:35,446
of everything.

391
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:40,890
Now mark it as no coincidence that this same hieroglyph is also used to mean beautiful.

392
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:45,434
Design is about beauty and simplicity and the importance of nothing.

393
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:51,589
Sadly, I don't think any of that actually translated into UT2003's version of Facing Worlds.

394
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,531
If you look at side-by-side comparisons of the two versions of the map,

395
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:57,572
you can definitely see the similarities in the shape.

396
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:00,514
But there are big differences in clarity.

397
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:05,838
The original Facing Worlds map had 540 actors in the entirety of the map.

398
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:07,679
The new version had over 4,000.

399
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:13,280
The original Facing Worlds had 130 polygons in view from the sniping towers.

400
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:19,143
This new Egyptian version had over 60,000 triangles in view from that same position.

401
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:22,405
It's a 280 times increase in detail,

402
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:27,128
which is quite significant, even broken down into meaningful patterns.

403
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:29,489
So whenever you're building something,

404
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,192
it's important to note how your layout will affect the player's gameplay experience.

405
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:39,696
You may have heard of the principle of least effort, which tells us to minimize cognitive

406
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:40,076
load.

407
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:44,759
If you overwhelm your players with too much information, they're likely to struggle with

408
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:45,459
processing it.

409
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:48,507
And note that I'm talking about layout here.

410
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:52,949
I'm not saying that the original Facing Worlds was a better map because it had less detail.

411
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,073
You can and absolutely should add more detail to your maps as technology goes on, and I'll

412
00:24:58,093 --> 00:24:59,133
speak more on that in a bit.

413
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:04,556
But in this particular instance, I'm specifically referencing the way that those details were

414
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:05,157
implemented.

415
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,639
the pyramid blocked lines of sight.

416
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,581
The trees pulled our eyes away from the gameplay space,

417
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:13,503
and the rolling terrain was dotted with these pools of water

418
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:15,004
that got in the way of navigation,

419
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:16,946
both visually as well as physically.

420
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:21,209
Decorative pieces were used to separate combat areas,

421
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,792
and it transferred these open spaces

422
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,674
into really small combat closets.

423
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,019
And because of the way our brains process visual information,

424
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,640
all of these separate elements actually combine

425
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,480
to break up the level in undesirable ways.

426
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:41,022
At Epic, we often talk about removing clutter from our maps.

427
00:25:41,402 --> 00:25:42,662
And what we're really trying to say

428
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,883
is that we need a better use of negative space.

429
00:25:45,783 --> 00:25:47,823
Ask, where are your players' eyes going?

430
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:53,762
Not always, but generally speaking, you want their eyes focused on the gameplay rather

431
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:54,684
than the architecture.

432
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:59,710
So rather than adding detail to an area to make it more beautiful, ask what you can remove.

433
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:03,135
Is the extra geometry actually visually distracting?

434
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:06,837
Are those new pools of water impeding navigation?

435
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:12,639
Can you remove lights or highlight key areas with a sfumato-like effect?

436
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,822
Maybe you can replace additional detail with just a simple shift in light or color.

437
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:23,724
As a level designer, your goal should be to simplify and clarify.

438
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:29,507
Streamline the experience and distill it down to those core important elements of gameplay.

439
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:32,600
And remember my favela example from earlier.

440
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,482
Geometric color, excessive polygons,

441
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:38,404
can be just as troublesome as visual clutter,

442
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:40,685
distracting shapes and rainbow colors.

443
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,688
These two images each have a color histogram

444
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:44,628
in the top right corner.

445
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:47,110
And in the original face, you can

446
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,071
see that color is distributed all

447
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:52,254
across the histogram in high, mid, and low range values.

448
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:56,456
And note that there's a single color spike on the low end.

449
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:04,280
And that's indicative of one area filled with a large... of one color, which is the dark skybox.

450
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,884
And that's important, because it means there's a large area filled by a single color

451
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:12,246
that's going to give you good figure-ground contrast.

452
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:18,600
Now by comparison, look at the UT2003 version, and there's just a massive bulge along the

453
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,562
center of the histogram with no representation in the higher low ranges.

454
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:28,204
And this indicates high midtone values, meaning that the color is going to be fairly uniform

455
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:29,285
across the board.

456
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:32,567
You're not going to get any great visual contrast.

457
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:38,509
And we need that contrast because when objects look similar, our brains will process them

458
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,290
as a single related group.

459
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:46,138
And you can simulate that contrast by actually compressing the color and the histograms.

460
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:52,240
And if you do that, the Egyptian version becomes, not surprisingly, this flat white sheet.

461
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,942
While the original Facing Worlds becomes this really great example of figure-ground reversal,

462
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,683
with all the negative spaces of the gameplay areas clearly delineated from the rest of the map.

463
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:05,604
And I'm being generous here by including the moon in the background.

464
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:10,806
That moon actually rotates out of view naturally as the skybox moves during gameplay.

465
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:13,227
And if you remove that moon from the image,

466
00:28:13,547 --> 00:28:17,609
you get this perfect negative space outline of the level geometry.

467
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:22,510
The clarity in this view is something that you would never get in that Egyptian version,

468
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:27,792
where everything is just a wash of sameness that causes our brains to spend that extra time

469
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:31,434
processing everything sequentially, detail by detail.

470
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:36,537
And a simple chick as easy as squinting could have identified this problem quickly.

471
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:42,000
Now that pyramid contributes to the problems because of its color similar to the rocks

472
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,662
and the sand and the towers and it's all the same.

473
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:48,945
But it also blocks the dark balconies and doorways of the tower.

474
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:53,208
All of the contrast in this scene is actually hidden behind the pyramid.

475
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,970
And what's worse, this scene is full of all these upward pointing shapes that drag your

476
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,871
eye up into the sky instead of down to where the gameplay is taking place.

477
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:07,512
And this is exactly the opposite of the favela problem, which had too many competing shapes

478
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:12,933
and colors, where faces lack a variation still has a similar outcome for the player.

479
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:14,934
There's nowhere for your brain to focus.

480
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,234
There's no balance to this scene.

481
00:29:18,795 --> 00:29:23,176
Without anywhere to focus, your brain either takes too much time trying to discern detail

482
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:27,191
Or it tries to take everything all at once,

483
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:31,136
and it skips over details and possibly throwing away

484
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:32,478
important gameplay elements.

485
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,081
Take, for example, this shot of an enemy

486
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:36,243
sitting in the sniping perch.

487
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,721
Now, that first image on the left, if you'll recall, was the original face where I mentioned

488
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:43,261
this Fumato character outline.

489
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:48,283
Compare it against that same location in the new Egyptian version, and you might not even

490
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:49,463
see the character there at all.

491
00:29:50,063 --> 00:29:54,785
Even zoomed in and centered and focused with the sniper scope, that character is barely

492
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:55,225
visible.

493
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:57,666
If you squint, he disappears.

494
00:29:57,686 --> 00:30:03,747
There's no contrast, there's no front ground differential, there's no negative space to

495
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:05,188
help define his shape.

496
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:10,192
or establish a focal point for your eyes. And that same problem is evident all over

497
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:17,298
the map, not just in the main towers. This is the flag room. Squint and look at it. Can

498
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:22,662
you tell me where the flag is in this scene? It's not too hard, but how about the enemy

499
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:30,008
who's guarding it? Neither stands out from their background. Both are nearly invisible.

500
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:33,951
And keep in mind that from a gameplay perspective, these are the two most important things your

501
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,192
player should be able to see right now.

502
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,863
Can I get a show of hands for anybody who can see both?

503
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:42,424
Ah, there's actually a few people.

504
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:42,984
I'm impressed.

505
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:46,526
Try to imagine locating these two things in the heat

506
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:50,648
of the moment while you have this guy aiming and sniping

507
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:51,388
straight at your head.

508
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:54,870
Can anybody not see them even when they're circled?

509
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,710
Yeah, that's what I thought.

510
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:01,973
So now do the same thing in this shot from the original map.

511
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:07,097
This one I've intentionally blurred, and you can almost instantly pick out all the important

512
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:07,998
aspects of the scene.

513
00:31:08,438 --> 00:31:13,021
You can see the flag, you can see the enemy, you can even see the rocket launcher sitting

514
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:14,322
there on the left-hand side.

515
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:21,327
The original face had a great use of shape, contrast, light, color, and space.

516
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:28,472
E2-2003's version of face had no negative space, no sfumato, and really poor gameplay

517
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:28,992
as a result.

518
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,992
And again, these are really simple issues to address if you make the conscious decision

519
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:34,613
to look for them.

520
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:37,795
Look at the Egyptian version of face one last time.

521
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:41,611
With one minute of effort, by lowering those clouds a bit,

522
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,893
slightly reducing the scale of the central pyramid,

523
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:46,315
you can enhance the readability of the map.

524
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:49,798
There's a nice shadow there now where the pyramid breaks up

525
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:51,959
that central space to add some contrast.

526
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,001
The shapes of the tower stand out a bit more

527
00:31:54,402 --> 00:31:56,303
because you can see some definition

528
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:58,665
from the structures and the architecture.

529
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:01,467
The dark sky contrasts much better

530
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:02,648
with the paths on the ground.

531
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,870
I could have gone on further by actually

532
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:11,594
darkening the tower entrances and removing some of those trees, but this was literally less than one minute worth of effort.

533
00:32:13,134 --> 00:32:20,158
As it shipped, however, poor use of negative space led to difficulties with navigation and object identification,

534
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:24,040
ensuring that this was never a popular map for us online.

535
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:32,204
So from Egypt, we move forward into Babylonia at a time when the zero was first introduced as a placeholder.

536
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:37,938
And this was utterly confusing because the Babylonian zero was contextual.

537
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:39,839
It could either be 60 or 160.

538
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,862
Context, as they say, is everything.

539
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:50,185
So when Unreal Tournament 2004 included a map called Facing Worlds Classic, it stripped

540
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:56,449
away all that unnecessary Egyptian detail, but it was still only a partial success because

541
00:32:56,489 --> 00:32:59,531
it was built in the context of the same UT2003 game systems.

542
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:07,039
This was a more popular version of the map, and there was kind of this collective sigh of relief from the community,

543
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:10,900
and quite honestly, from the people internally at Epic, when it was released,

544
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,181
because it looked like Face Again. It had the same architecture, it had that same setting,

545
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:21,523
but the gameplay was always just slightly off, and it never really captured that feel of the original.

546
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:26,926
is an example of why I want to go back again to the original Facing Worlds map.

547
00:33:26,986 --> 00:33:31,967
And this top-down view highlights the path network that was used by the AI.

548
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:35,328
If you start at the center of the map and work your way toward a tower,

549
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:38,029
you can get there in as little as four branch points.

550
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:42,030
And there's only 59 navigation points in the entirety of the map.

551
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,531
Now compare that against the Egyptian version,

552
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:49,552
where the navigation network is suddenly highly complicated.

553
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,574
To get from the center to a tower here,

554
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:57,295
the minimum number of branch points I could find

555
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:58,295
is over a dozen.

556
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:02,657
And there's 806 navigation points, more than 13 times

557
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:03,338
in the original.

558
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:05,819
Now, I don't want to get too abstract

559
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:07,520
on the theory of negative space and how

560
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,421
that translates to simplicity in larger game systems.

561
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,642
But you can certainly see the impact

562
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:15,763
that a complicated navigation network would have on AI.

563
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:21,959
And the point that I'm trying to get across is that an AI network serves as an indicator

564
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,001
of potential player behaviors.

565
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:30,206
Clearly, a player trying to cross the same map has more choices to make, more obstacles,

566
00:34:30,566 --> 00:34:33,769
and more potential points for contention or confusion.

567
00:34:34,517 --> 00:34:40,422
the open negative spaces of the gameplay area have been broken up into these smaller collections

568
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:47,248
of small areas. And just as our brain can get overloaded with visual information, it

569
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:52,272
also gets bogged down while attempting to evaluate the differences between too many

570
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:57,156
similar choices. Now, obviously we want to give our players

571
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:58,076
interesting choices.

572
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:01,062
and encourage emerging gameplay.

573
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:03,964
But simply adding more isn't better.

574
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:09,608
Gestalt research tells us that too much choice can actually lead to sensory overload.

575
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:15,671
And this is a hot-button issue in autism research, where the belief is currently that autistic

576
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:18,113
patients are unable to filter stimuli.

577
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:23,456
They take in every detail of the world, every little bit, all around them, all the time.

578
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,698
And the constant flow of information overwhelms them.

579
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:29,440
What does this have to do with face and level design?

580
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,984
Well, because our brains naturally combine details and establish patterns, more information

581
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:40,206
means more detail that's potentially lost when things get combined.

582
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:45,689
And the results from this perception study describe how much information was lost at

583
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:47,330
different levels of visual threshold.

584
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:53,462
Now it's important my point, the slide itself is visually overwhelming and difficult to

585
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:58,825
read, but the quick takeaway here is that as you increase visual information, your brain

586
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:04,289
will actually comprehend less, despite taking longer trying to process it.

587
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:09,912
This is why balance and simplicity and flow are the founding principles of design.

588
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:13,795
So back to Facing Worlds Classic and UT2004.

589
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:20,349
Geometric shapes have been simplified, contrast has been enhanced, and the distracting visual

590
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:21,613
elements have been stripped away.

591
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:22,656
But...

592
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:28,015
it inherited that same complex navigation network from the Egyptian version.

593
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:33,877
This means Face Classic also inherited the same imbalances and poor flow

594
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:35,538
as seen in the Egyptian version.

595
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:39,159
Unreal Tournament 2004 was an update to the engine

596
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,820
rather than a whole new engine,

597
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,002
so the Egyptian and Classic versions were built in the context of the same game systems.

598
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:52,622
To complicate things even further, here's the original Facing Worlds map in 1-to-1 scale

599
00:36:52,682 --> 00:36:54,444
relation to the classic version.

600
00:36:55,405 --> 00:37:00,231
The new version is actually three times the size of the original version, another problem

601
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,873
it inherited from the previous game.

602
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:07,212
Because when we moved into transition into the new Unreal Engine 2, we had all these

603
00:37:07,252 --> 00:37:10,475
powerful shaders that we could do flashing lights and cracks in walls.

604
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:11,436
So sure, why not?

605
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:11,936
We did it.

606
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:15,919
And we had the ability to add all these new geometry and add these new polygons.

607
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,080
So hey, we did that too.

608
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,705
And since we needed more room to fit in all this new stuff, we just made our environments

609
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:22,985
bigger.

610
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,621
note that we didn't necessarily increase the size of our players,

611
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:30,042
only the scale of the environments.

612
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:32,704
And the obvious result of that decision

613
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:35,705
was that individual players and important gameplay elements

614
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,606
became more difficult to identify.

615
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:42,268
So, how many of you can find a player in this screenshot

616
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:43,349
and get a show of hands?

617
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,410
Almost everyone, that's awesome.

618
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,911
How many people can see two, if you can keep your hands up?

619
00:37:51,112 --> 00:37:51,353
Three?

620
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:53,153
Four?

621
00:37:55,248 --> 00:38:05,660
5, 6, 7, all 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, there are 13 different players on screen in this version.

622
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:20,836
Seeing those teeny tiny players dwarfed in this massive environment is completely overwhelming.

623
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:27,562
The scale of the environment means an increase in visual stimuli, and that perceived increase

624
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:31,205
in complexity can overwhelm the brain as much as actual choice.

625
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:37,671
In fact, perceived complexity has been shown to be more significant than actual complexity.

626
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:43,036
It's that old adage of seeing is believing, and in this case, it is very, very true.

627
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:49,816
So, what the brain perceives is largely based on the amount of stuff or noise that's in

628
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,476
the periphery.

629
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:55,060
And more stuff means more time to process and more distraction.

630
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,863
In these images here, you'll notice the long bar, the red line, and the shaded box almost

631
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,645
instantly because they stand out.

632
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:05,948
You can focus on them easily because there's less complexity around them.

633
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:08,169
There's more negative space.

634
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,823
Now the same holds true for these two rows of red dots,

635
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:13,825
and the two rows of blue squares,

636
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:17,069
and even the separated colors of mixed dots and squares.

637
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,233
But in this last image, despite being the same shapes

638
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:22,655
and the very same colors,

639
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:25,178
it has this chaotic disorganized mix

640
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:27,360
that's harder to focus on and interpret quickly.

641
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:32,231
So even though UT 2004's version of Face had simplified shapes

642
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,972
and good front gown contrast, it still

643
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:37,673
had 30,000 triangles in view from the towers,

644
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:40,154
more than 200 times the amount of visual information

645
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:43,916
from the original, but no way to focus on any of it.

646
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,877
There's a minimum of a dozen branch points

647
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:48,978
between the center of the map and the tower entrances,

648
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,579
three times the number of navigation touch points,

649
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:54,661
and that doesn't count pickups, of which there are twice

650
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:56,301
as many compared to the original.

651
00:39:57,165 --> 00:40:01,910
Design principles tell us that in order to increase your players' capability for decision-making

652
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:06,716
and problem-solving, to improve gameplay in your maps, you need to minimize memory load

653
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:09,058
so your players can comprehend their environment.

654
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:12,381
You need to reduce attention-switching to keep them focused.

655
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:17,367
And you need to minimize the number of inferences that they need to make by making the scene

656
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,029
quickly and easily understandable.

657
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:24,519
The massive amount of information and overwhelming scale of Face Classic

658
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,041
led players to perceive the environment as a complicated web,

659
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:32,262
exactly mirroring the visualization of that AI network.

660
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:36,783
And important details, like players, tended to be lost and overlooked.

661
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:40,565
Interestingly, Face Classic was also the first time

662
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:44,846
that we had ever incorporated ambient audio into one of our face maps.

663
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,687
And I have no idea why, but we also made this...

664
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:53,150
awesome decision to add a driving rock guitar soundtrack.

665
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,312
This is huge departure from the ambient void that was in all

666
00:40:58,332 --> 00:40:59,152
the previous versions.

667
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:01,593
And again, I don't want to get too abstract on the meanings

668
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:05,214
of negative space, but obviously you can see how heavy guitar

669
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,095
music and crackling flames and all this ambient stuff would

670
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:12,237
compare to the void of negative ambient space in all the other

671
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:12,677
versions.

672
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:17,253
Simply stripping away detail wasn't enough.

673
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:18,734
There was no summato here.

674
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:21,314
You can't create the outline of a level

675
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,014
and then fill it in like a coloring book.

676
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:25,475
These design choices need to be made

677
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:27,015
in the context of the game

678
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:31,116
with an understanding that the systems define the level.

679
00:41:33,136 --> 00:41:34,957
So even though it was labeled as classic,

680
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:38,777
it was mired in the problems of complicated game systems.

681
00:41:39,258 --> 00:41:41,358
Facing World's Classic was unable

682
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,538
to escape the effects of context.

683
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:47,223
Now finally, we have nothing.

684
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:54,029
Zero moved from Egypt to India, and it was the first time that zero actually meant nothing.

685
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:58,292
And that concept was so revolutionary that it spread across the world, through Arabia,

686
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,533
Europe, and into China.

687
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:06,298
And in Asia, we see the first representation of zero as a circle, that now familiar zero

688
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:06,599
shape.

689
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:12,944
So, with our last and latest version of Facing Worlds, we too went full circle, back to the

690
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:17,769
very roots of the map's design, while also making a generational leap forward into Unreal

691
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:17,989
Engine 3.

692
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:21,498
We adopted a very distinct Asian theme,

693
00:42:21,898 --> 00:42:25,459
and we were very careful not to lose those important aspects of gameplay

694
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:30,281
and negative space that helped make the original Facing Worlds map so popular.

695
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:34,743
We started with the context of the original tournament gameplay's map,

696
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,924
their systems and geometry,

697
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:43,426
and we used that as a framework upon which we would build the new map's shape, scale, and structure.

698
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:47,648
And this is where I get back to our earlier discussion of what I called clutter.

699
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:49,958
The original Facing Worlds had 130 polygons.

700
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:51,039
The UT2003 version had over 60,000,

701
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:53,401
which I said was a 280 times increase in detail.

702
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:55,022
This new version of UT2003 has over 610,000 polygons

703
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:56,143
in view from the towers.

704
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:57,024
That's 4,700 times the original map.

705
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:15,083
As technology improves, we absolutely can add more detail to our maps, as long as it's

706
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:16,585
done in the right way.

707
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:21,830
You have to embrace that underlying principle of Gestalt that tells us that the whole is

708
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,571
different from the sum of its parts.

709
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:36,696
With blur in place, you can see how the extra geometry of the UT3 map still provides a readable contrast of playable versus non-playable space, meaning less information is lost.

710
00:43:37,496 --> 00:43:49,368
If we use the palette filter, you can see how important pieces of gameplay still stand out, with the sniper perches, the central paths, and the tower entrances nicely visible, just as in the original version of the map.

711
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,683
Histogram values show a nice distribution in the RGB curves,

712
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:55,825
aligned with spikes on either end,

713
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:57,406
just like the original version.

714
00:43:57,827 --> 00:44:00,629
And compressing the histogram highlights

715
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:04,693
good front ground delineation we need for the negative space

716
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:08,376
areas of gameplay to be immediately readable by players,

717
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,418
just as in the original version.

718
00:44:12,252 --> 00:44:16,035
If you highlight the path network, you can see the simplicity in the system that highlights

719
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:22,821
the clarity of routes and options, only 144 nav points, 5 branches between tower and center

720
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:23,242
of map.

721
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:29,968
And we even went so far as to recreate the original, kind of soothing drum and bass music

722
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:36,073
of the original face, removing all those distracting guitars and highlighting the negative aural

723
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:36,473
space.

724
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:41,514
Now, while I don't have any nicely defined metrics to show map popularity,

725
00:44:41,614 --> 00:44:43,035
sadly we didn't have them at the time,

726
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:46,998
I can generate some anecdotal evidence to show that this map was a success.

727
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,641
It was well accepted with several servers popping up

728
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:54,144
that just ran this map 24 hours a day over and over,

729
00:44:54,584 --> 00:45:00,008
and even six years later, it's not uncommon to see those face-only servers still in heavy rotation.

730
00:45:00,939 --> 00:45:05,843
I can't find a single negative thread in the game's official forums, and if you're at all

731
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,486
familiar with forums, that in itself is a complete miracle.

732
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:15,192
In fact, I actually see a bunch of messages like these, praising it as the best version

733
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:15,573
ever.

734
00:45:17,254 --> 00:45:23,318
So, UT3's version had a clear, front-ground delineation that made gameplay spaces defined

735
00:45:23,758 --> 00:45:24,218
and readable.

736
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:29,762
High levels of detail were well-organized instead of distracting, and the balance of

737
00:45:29,842 --> 00:45:34,145
light, color, and shape left the map understandable even in the heat of combat.

738
00:45:34,605 --> 00:45:40,429
The oral and visual aspects of UT3's Facing Worlds embraced all the concepts of negative

739
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:41,149
space design.

740
00:45:42,077 --> 00:45:48,299
As a designer, your job is to focus on subtracting the obvious and only adding the meaningful.

741
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:54,641
I could never say definitively which version of Face was the best, but I feel very confident

742
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:59,102
in saying that with the UT3 version, we were finally able to bring the essence of that

743
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:04,204
original map forward in a meaningful way, and that we had the forethought to capture

744
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:08,725
those aspects of negative space design that helped make the original map such a success.

745
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:13,789
As an industry, we're often just kind of stumbling ahead.

746
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:17,392
And there's this arms race to continually improve graphics

747
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:18,793
and raise visual fidelity.

748
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:22,536
And all too often, this simply means we're adding more stuff

749
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:23,297
to our games.

750
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:29,002
Open vistas have suddenly given way to these dense forests

751
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:30,123
filled with foliage.

752
00:46:30,763 --> 00:46:32,765
Clear pathways have been replaced

753
00:46:32,785 --> 00:46:35,207
with these kind of techno-paneled and pipe-filled

754
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:35,767
corridors.

755
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:43,153
every bolt and every blade of grass rendered in startling detail. But do those details

756
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:48,679
actually add to the gameplay experience? Or can they actually be detracting from the quality

757
00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:50,160
and enjoyability of our games?

758
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,943
We didn't intend for the new versions of Face to be less popular.

759
00:46:53,963 --> 00:46:56,025
We didn't just randomly throw a map together.

760
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:59,609
But we didn't think specifically about negative space.

761
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,273
We didn't account for the way that the brain takes in information.

762
00:47:03,894 --> 00:47:09,520
We didn't distill our presentation to look at contrast or analyze the complexity of information

763
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,401
being presented.

764
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:14,685
Good design is about removing, not adding.

765
00:47:15,345 --> 00:47:17,607
And negative space is a very valuable tool

766
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:18,608
in our design arsenal,

767
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:20,529
certainly one that we tend to overlook.

768
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:22,410
So, in the future,

769
00:47:22,911 --> 00:47:25,212
don't forget to look at what's not there.

770
00:47:25,753 --> 00:47:28,575
It can be so much more important than what actually is.

771
00:47:29,936 --> 00:47:30,176
Thank you.

772
00:47:41,262 --> 00:47:44,402
Looks like we have about 10 minutes if anybody has questions.

773
00:47:44,422 --> 00:47:46,363
I don't know if anybody does.

774
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:47,603
I just want to run off.

775
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,443
Can I start?

776
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:50,824
Hello.

777
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:52,704
Hey, go ahead.

778
00:47:52,764 --> 00:47:53,424
Hey, it's on.

779
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:54,704
I 1,000% agree with everything you said.

780
00:47:55,504 --> 00:47:57,945
Where I work, our bread and butter is multiplayer maps.

781
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:00,826
There's, I think, two additional points that could be made.

782
00:48:01,186 --> 00:48:04,366
One is keeping simplicity means that the callouts

783
00:48:04,406 --> 00:48:05,326
are that much more important.

784
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:09,556
If you have detail everywhere, then you just don't know what to call out in the heat of

785
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:09,836
battle.

786
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:10,536
Where are you?

787
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:12,757
I'm in the blue room, I'm in the red room, I'm in whatever.

788
00:48:13,097 --> 00:48:14,658
And the other one is effects.

789
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:18,379
That's one of my pet peeves sometimes is when you have effects of papers blowing on the

790
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,240
ground or sand going across the ground.

791
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,122
In that split second, is it an enemy, is it a threat, or is it just pretty?

792
00:48:24,462 --> 00:48:29,264
That was a huge problem with that original Egyptian version of Face.

793
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:32,439
there was these pools of water on the ground that you would

794
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:34,620
stumble in and then it would splash and you couldn't get out

795
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,283
and you're trying to swim and, you know, dust blowing and

796
00:48:38,363 --> 00:48:41,284
obscuring the grass. Yeah, it just absolutely could be a big

797
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:41,585
mess.

798
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:44,586
I totally agree. And I am an artist, by the way. So I still

799
00:48:44,606 --> 00:48:46,267
agree. 100% about it.

800
00:48:46,668 --> 00:48:47,348
Awesome. Thank you.

801
00:48:47,368 --> 00:48:49,609
Hi.

802
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,510
Hi.

803
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:57,114
I also spent a lot of time as an artist. And my question is,

804
00:48:57,814 --> 00:49:00,236
have you spent any time figuring out

805
00:49:01,457 --> 00:49:06,859
how to create a rule set for this that could be applied to procedural generation of levels?

806
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:10,381
That is an area that we're just starting to get into at Epic.

807
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:15,723
We are kind of transitioning away from traditional level design in terms of

808
00:49:16,443 --> 00:49:20,225
building blocks and pieces and leading more into procedural stuff.

809
00:49:20,645 --> 00:49:22,366
Sadly, I can't really talk about that yet.

810
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,468
But I can say that in the past we...

811
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:29,992
This isn't, it's not like we walked around the office saying,

812
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:32,014
you need better negative design in your maps.

813
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:34,395
But we do actually use those terms.

814
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:37,237
We do talk about the way that shapes are organized.

815
00:49:37,297 --> 00:49:40,198
We do talk about contrast and balance and all those things.

816
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:43,661
And like I said, we did have that squint tool that we used.

817
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:47,523
So we do use those terms just in our day-to-day work.

818
00:49:49,044 --> 00:49:50,485
And how we've carried those forward

819
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:52,946
into new design techniques, maybe I'll

820
00:49:52,966 --> 00:49:53,847
be able to talk about next year.

821
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:14,840
You touched on the fact that in Black Ops, he said Favela in the single player was one of the most popular maps, and in multiplayer it was the least popular, or one of the least popular. Do you have some insight on why that might be?

822
00:50:18,594 --> 00:50:22,937
I mean that was the whole point, like I can't say definitively, I don't have their analytics,

823
00:50:23,597 --> 00:50:28,761
but I would guess that it was so overwhelming that it was much more difficult to play, that

824
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:32,023
there was enemies coming from everywhere, you couldn't pick them out, you didn't know

825
00:50:32,103 --> 00:50:35,646
which paths you should take, there was multiple options, it was just like every single bit

826
00:50:35,706 --> 00:50:42,851
of it was visually, orally, mentally stimulating, overstimulating, and I think a lot of people

827
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:43,372
just gave up.

828
00:50:43,512 --> 00:50:45,013
and out of sheer confusion.

829
00:50:45,473 --> 00:50:46,274
That would be my guess.

830
00:50:46,954 --> 00:50:49,897
And based on the guys that I've talked to from that team,

831
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:53,479
they kind of indicated that that was the case.

832
00:50:53,499 --> 00:51:00,345
Awesome.

833
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:02,486
All right, thank you guys for your time and attention.

834
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:02,947
Appreciate it.
