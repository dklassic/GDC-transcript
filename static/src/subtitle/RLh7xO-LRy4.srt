1
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:07,613
I'm Mason Smith, I'm an indie game developer.

2
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,894
By day I'm an animator, but by night

3
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:14,955
and from the hours of 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. occasionally,

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,136
I'm known as Airdorf, indie game developer.

5
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:20,397
So I made a game called Faith.

6
00:00:20,877 --> 00:00:23,178
Faith is about fighting demons who possess

7
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,918
the body of a 17-year-old girl

8
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,279
and then erupt violently out of her face.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,580
By show of hands, how many people have actually played Faith?

10
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:33,381
I've played a little bit.

11
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:35,347
Great.

12
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:38,570
Who here is interested in horror games, indie horror games?

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,311
All right.

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,392
My kind of people.

15
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,873
For those of you who haven't seen Faith or played it,

16
00:00:41,893 --> 00:00:42,894
I'm going to show you all the trailer.

17
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:44,315
Have you heard of it before?

18
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,316
Can you give us a definite title for the game?

19
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:45,716
Faith or Faith Idea.

20
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:51,661
We need to dance.

21
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:56,645
We're going to dance with you.

22
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:56,986
We need to dance.

23
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:57,346
We are our action.

24
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:57,786
We are going to dance.

25
00:00:57,806 --> 00:00:58,387
We are Mercer and AuntieJean.

26
00:00:58,407 --> 00:00:58,887
We're going to dance.

27
00:00:58,907 --> 00:00:59,287
We are our action.

28
00:00:59,307 --> 00:00:59,908
We are Mercer and AuntieJean.

29
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:00,488
We are Mercer and AuntieJean.

30
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,383
This false demon died

31
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:13,088
The darkness descends

32
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:17,451
Lord, wake me up, I

33
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:22,555
Where are the papers?

34
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,777
They're all gone

35
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:30,502
Help of the helpless, Lord of the

36
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:45,411
All right, so Faith is the story of an exorcism gone wrong

37
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:46,951
during the late 1980s.

38
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,892
You play as a young priest who returns to the house

39
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:53,454
where it all began a year later to finish what they started.

40
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:59,476
So I released Faith in October 2017 on Itch and Game Jolt.

41
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:02,837
In December of that year, Faith appeared on IGN's listicle

42
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:04,297
of the best horror games of 2017.

43
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,339
So I don't mention this to brag,

44
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,439
but rather to illustrate what my talk

45
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:10,340
is going to be about today.

46
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:14,567
Here's a character from one of the other games

47
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:15,608
that made it onto the list.

48
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,051
And here's a character from my game.

49
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:24,419
Sorry, I'll only keep it on screen for a while for you.

50
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:25,179
There you go.

51
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,920
It's gone.

52
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:30,886
Today I want to tell the story of how a retro-inspired.

53
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:35,186
a chunkily pixelated nightmare came to coexist

54
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:37,747
in the same space as AAA horror titles

55
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:40,068
that feature next-gen graphics.

56
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:43,449
First, I'm going to cover the inspirations and research

57
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:44,890
behind Faith's visual design.

58
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,591
Then I will review key design principles and processes

59
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:49,531
that guided my work.

60
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,712
And finally, I will share the results

61
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,073
of Faith's visual design

62
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:55,193
and what I've taken away from my experiences.

63
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:02,537
So Faith began with a single question that kind of drove my design process, and that

64
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:07,723
was could I make an effective horror game using just the most basic graphics that I

65
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:08,324
could think of?

66
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:12,889
Could a game that looked like the Oregon Trail feel like PT?

67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,821
Holy Grail of horror games, in my opinion.

68
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:19,403
I gave myself this challenge right after the cancellation

69
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:21,684
of the ill-fated Silent Hills project,

70
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:25,967
Lord Bless and Keep It, that was helmed by Hideo Kojima

71
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:27,808
and in collaboration with Guillermo del Toro.

72
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,049
And yes, I'm still bitter about that.

73
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,390
Everyone should be bitter about that.

74
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:33,811
Raise your hand if you're bitter

75
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:34,892
about Silent Hills being canceled.

76
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:35,492
Okay.

77
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:40,372
So I was and I still am mildly obsessed with PT.

78
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,172
It is my absolute favorite horror game.

79
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:44,793
And I wanted to join the ranks of indie devs

80
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:47,093
who were creating what I call PT-ware

81
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:49,894
or spiritual successors for PT.

82
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,955
So Visage or Visage and Alice in the Road.

83
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:56,775
But I didn't have the funds or the time or the know-how

84
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:59,576
to work with high-fidelity graphics

85
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,776
like in the Fox Engine or in Unreal.

86
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:06,180
So I decided to make a horror game that looked like it could

87
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,023
have existed in the age of the Apple II computer, the Commodore

88
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:14,828
64, or ZX Spectrum, like it was a forbidden game that you

89
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,870
loaded off of a worn out floppy disk

90
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,751
that you had to ask around for.

91
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:24,036
So in order to set the stage for Faith's visual design,

92
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:26,238
I need to take you all back to the first time I ever got

93
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,359
scared playing a video game.

94
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:32,227
I was really young. I was at my friend's house and we were playing Doom. I don't know if you all have heard of it.

95
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:37,010
It was my first time playing Doom and I was having a lot of fun actually,

96
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:40,713
carrying my shotgun around, blowing away zombified soldiers,

97
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:43,475
when suddenly this fireball zooms past me.

98
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:49,799
And I turn around and far away, down this long stretch of hallway,

99
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,100
I saw this.

100
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:53,201
I was horrified.

101
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:57,065
And I didn't fully understand what was happening.

102
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:57,886
I had to stop playing.

103
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,807
I told him to take the controllers.

104
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,150
I didn't fully understand what was happening to me

105
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,031
until years later.

106
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:07,333
I heard this quote from the movie The Blair Witch Project.

107
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:12,177
Oh my gosh, what the F is that?

108
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,139
How many of y'all know what scene I'm talking about?

109
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:17,321
A few of y'all?

110
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:17,541
OK.

111
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,803
Do y'all know that they don't actually

112
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:22,485
show what the character's reacting to?

113
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:27,839
what they were actually reacting to was a member of the cast

114
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,363
draped in a white sheet and wearing a Halloween mask.

115
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:32,727
So I'm really glad they didn't show that.

116
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,195
But we were more scared by what we couldn't see than what

117
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,176
was actually on screen.

118
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:44,196
And this quote became the golden standard, and it's my favorite quote from any horror movie.

119
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:48,320
It became the golden standard by which Faith's visual elements were compared,

120
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,205
and the most important reaction I wanted to get from players, I wanted them to scream this line.

121
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:57,749
Because fear of the unknown, it creates feelings of dread,

122
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:01,152
and dread is the golden nugget of horror game design.

123
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:06,448
And it just so happens that pixel art, especially from the second generation of game consoles

124
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:10,009
and game computers, has a high level of abstraction.

125
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:14,470
And that abstraction makes for a great medium for creating fear of the unknown.

126
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:18,591
So let's talk about face inspirations.

127
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,512
The story of face visual design is a story of constraints.

128
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,224
I chose visual design constraints that were inspired by second-gen hardware.

129
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:32,347
I wasn't making a homebrew game, so I was only approximating retro hardware limitations.

130
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:35,829
I was trying to nail a feeling rather than achieve technical accuracy.

131
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:41,040
So I chose a canvas resolution of 192 by 160 pixels

132
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,441
because I read somewhere on Reddit

133
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:45,362
that that was the approximate resolution of the Atari 2600.

134
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:47,462
And it's probably not true.

135
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:48,683
But I just ran with it.

136
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,744
And to me, it was more important to pick something and stick

137
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:56,086
with it than to be completely technically

138
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,967
accurate with the retro aesthetic

139
00:06:58,987 --> 00:06:59,807
that I was trying to achieve.

140
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,820
So I throttled the game's FPS to 15.

141
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,660
That helped me in the animation process,

142
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,301
and it made for an overall clunkier experience.

143
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:09,921
I worked with a limited palette,

144
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,502
probably no more than six or eight colors

145
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,582
on screen at a time,

146
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:16,483
and I used a limited number of objects on screen.

147
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,963
And that was completely arbitrary.

148
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:20,544
It was more getting the feeling down

149
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,744
than an actual hard number.

150
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:23,465
So to give you all an idea,

151
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,065
this is a visual representation

152
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:26,966
of the pixel real estate I gave myself

153
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:29,666
for Faith versus a game running at 4K.

154
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:30,226
Can you all see that?

155
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,092
There should be like a on this side.

156
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,535
Yeah, that little orange square.

157
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,839
That's what I had to work with versus 4K.

158
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:39,405
I just want y'all to appreciate

159
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:42,010
how much pixel artists can achieve with so little.

160
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,850
192 pixels by 160 is a six by five aspect ratio,

161
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,631
which afforded me more vertical space

162
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,311
than four by three or 16 by nine.

163
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,372
And that's something that I kind of gripe about

164
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:54,272
with modern game monitors.

165
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,132
It's so horizontal and stretched out.

166
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:57,933
And I get like field of view and all that,

167
00:07:57,993 --> 00:07:59,853
but I kind of miss verticality

168
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,454
in our sprite design and environment design.

169
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:05,094
So I really enjoy designing environments

170
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:07,975
with a little more verticality in the scenes.

171
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:12,738
So fine art wise, Faith has a few big inspirations.

172
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:14,639
So my background is in animation,

173
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:18,261
so naturally I've studied a little bit of fine art.

174
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,943
This was a big inspiration, Christina's World

175
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:21,923
by Andrew Wyeth.

176
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:26,266
I really like how the visual elements in this painting

177
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:28,447
are minimally arranged.

178
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:31,634
And not that it's a minimalist painting,

179
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:35,017
but its elements are arranged in kind of a sparse fashion.

180
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:37,039
There's lots of visual tension here.

181
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,341
And to me, there's a sense of foreboding.

182
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:42,243
And it really gives me feelings of isolation.

183
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:46,107
Francisco de Goya happens to be my favorite painter.

184
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:48,905
And I really like his black painting series.

185
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,746
They're very macabre, and these scenes

186
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:54,587
are pulled out of darkness to me.

187
00:08:56,488 --> 00:09:00,270
The predominant color is this black, mysterious field.

188
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,531
And that's why Faith has a permanent black background

189
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:04,452
for the same reason.

190
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,513
And of course, no good piece of horror

191
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:10,215
wouldn't take inspiration from the art of manga artist Junji

192
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:10,555
Ito.

193
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:12,456
Hope I didn't butcher that name.

194
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:12,936
I probably did.

195
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:14,057
Let's move on.

196
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:15,037
So.

197
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,834
From a research standpoint, faith

198
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,435
takes place during the satanic scare of the 1980s.

199
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:22,155
Who did time in the 80s?

200
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:23,535
They did two years in the 80s.

201
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:24,816
OK.

202
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,716
The rest of you all, listen up.

203
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,177
So the satanic scare of the 1980s

204
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:32,138
was a period of widespread paranoia

205
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:35,238
about Satanism, devil worship, and occult practices

206
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,960
like the band Kiss and Dungeons and Dragons.

207
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,340
I wonder how Harry Potter would have done in.

208
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:50,061
in the 1980s. I wanted to recreate the world of the unassuming bourgeois middle class that

209
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:54,704
was in the height of the decade of excess. In order to do that, I had to reject some

210
00:09:54,744 --> 00:10:00,708
visual stereotypes that we game developers have created about the 1980s. First, no blue

211
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,729
and pink neon cyberpunk cityscapes.

212
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,410
Like, that wasn't the 80s.

213
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,711
That wasn't an actual thing.

214
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,052
Instead, I researched, so no.

215
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:12,554
So I researched floor plans and architectural drawings

216
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:16,196
of big suburban homes with interconnecting rooms.

217
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:19,037
No DeLoreans.

218
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:23,339
Who declared the DeLorean the car ambassador of the 1980s?

219
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
Like, how did that happen?

220
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,001
Get out of here.

221
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:27,461
Just give me a four-door sedan.

222
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:32,690
And I said no to the 80s punk aesthetic just for this game.

223
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:38,658
I wanted boring, working-class adults who still dressed like it was the 1970s and then

224
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:40,221
forced their kids to dress the same way.

225
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:44,179
It's not the idealistic, nostalgic vision of the 1980s

226
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:46,300
that we've created, but I think it's something

227
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,240
a little more authentic.

228
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,861
Because there's a dark side of the 1980s.

229
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:51,423
There's these things called payphones.

230
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:54,124
And if you didn't have money, then you couldn't call home.

231
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:58,907
And there's no GPS or way to put yourself on Google Maps

232
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,928
if you got lost or something.

233
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:11,186
So looking at my process, the process of representing objects and characters from this era as pixel

234
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,910
art, it was more of an additive.

235
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,302
than reductive process.

236
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:21,105
So rather than take my reference images or an image

237
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:23,467
and reduce it to my canvas resolution,

238
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:24,627
I would just start from nothing,

239
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:28,129
and I would pull that object out of the black background

240
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,032
until it was just enough detail to be recognizable

241
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:34,273
rather than taking away detail.

242
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:38,109
But with images so minimalist, it was a challenge

243
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,610
to not, what I call, overproduce certain objects

244
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,330
and environments.

245
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:45,291
Oftentimes, I would go back and actually take pixels out

246
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:49,993
and take details out of a sprite or a scene that I had created.

247
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:53,674
And I really had to just trust the charming, nostalgic appeal

248
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:56,815
of these old, chunky pixels and simply walk away

249
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,056
from working on a sprite once it was there,

250
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:00,897
once the representation was there.

251
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:04,142
And then for the demon design, these are just a couple.

252
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:07,568
Besides keeping it ambiguous and creating

253
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,371
that fear of the unknown, just pulling off

254
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,395
of really common things like spiders and blood

255
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:14,059
were naturally disturbed by those things.

256
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:21,829
So adherence to gestalt principles helps tighten the composition of even the most minimalistic

257
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:22,190
scenes.

258
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,112
Here in these images I'm using the principle of negative space to imply paths in the woods

259
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,572
that are meant to mislead the player.

260
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:33,415
Without giving anything away, you can actually get lost by following these paths, so you

261
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:34,055
can't trust them.

262
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,797
Some more examples of negative space.

263
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:45,263
On the left, I created a cramped space that is also isolated from the outside, thanks

264
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:49,486
to this large field of black, this large amount of negative space around the environment.

265
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,910
The player wonders what is lurking around outside of that little window.

266
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:57,353
And the use of negative space on the right,

267
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:59,514
it creates anticipation and unease

268
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,614
with the placement of those sewing mannequins.

269
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:04,735
The player knows that something is going to happen with them

270
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,536
because of how they are positioned relative to the player.

271
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:09,996
Negative space is a great little technique

272
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,437
to harness that feeling of unease and anticipation.

273
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:19,819
So arguably the most distinguishing visual elements of faith

274
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,659
and the most popular are these rotoscoped animations

275
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:23,680
that play throughout the game.

276
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:29,999
My inspiration was this critics accolade that I saw in the trailer for The Witch in 2015.

277
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:33,162
It feels like we're watching something we should not be seeing.

278
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:36,186
There he goes.

279
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,743
And that became my rationale for subjecting the player

280
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:44,905
to these animated sequences.

281
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,846
I wanted to shatter the expectations of players

282
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,528
who were probably expecting something

283
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:52,349
like the mini games from Five Nights at Freddy's.

284
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:55,831
So they were getting used to the chunky pixels

285
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:58,473
and getting used to how things moved and how things worked.

286
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:00,894
There's something very unsettling

287
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:03,355
about suddenly switching visual styles on the viewer,

288
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,797
much like these uncomfortably detailed.

289
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:09,542
close-up drawings from Spongebob and other cartoons.

290
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:12,685
When I saw that, I knew that I loved Spongebob.

291
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:13,766
That was the moment.

292
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,608
It catches the viewer or the player off guard.

293
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,992
So these rotoscoped animations also had the effect

294
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:21,433
of reaching out to the player.

295
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:24,036
Again, I wanted this to feel like a cursed game

296
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:28,700
that was sentient and knew what, knew about the player,

297
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,803
knew their fears, like the game itself wanted to scare them.

298
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:35,008
And at the very least, we humans are disturbed by images

299
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,129
that fall into the uncanny valley.

300
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,510
We naturally get uncomfortable watching

301
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,670
things that move like us.

302
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:43,231
And the animated monstrosities in Faith

303
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,812
have this uncanny quality because they're

304
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:47,393
based on real human performances.

305
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:58,477
It me.

306
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,001
So there I am shooting reference for the stabby scene.

307
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:06,922
That's enough of that.

308
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,203
So having a little bit of stage acting experience

309
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,223
from high school and knowing that no good animator

310
00:15:12,283 --> 00:15:14,364
starts an animation without shooting reference first,

311
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,885
I performed all the rotoscoped scenes myself.

312
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:19,105
So here you can see me editing,

313
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:21,846
when I, after I edited the original footage,

314
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,787
I edited it to take out frames and mess with the timing

315
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:26,407
to make it a little more unsettling.

316
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,793
So my process was pretty straightforward.

317
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,294
First, I would wait till my wife was at work.

318
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,155
And then I would scale, then I would get in costume.

319
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:47,337
Then I would film what I wanted to do.

320
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,758
And it's kind of therapeutic.

321
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:53,119
So after I was done filming the footage,

322
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,400
I would scale the original footage to my working resolution

323
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,741
and import the frames into Photoshop

324
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:01,582
and convert it to 15 frames per second.

325
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:06,171
Then I would hand trace the outline of the character

326
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:10,156
for the cut scene and fill in things

327
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,499
like the face or any colored fields

328
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,383
that I wanted to have or any solid fields of color

329
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,185
on another video layer.

330
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:20,835
And then finally, I would add things like facial features

331
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,577
and other elements specifically to the character

332
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:25,659
on another video layer.

333
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,602
And most of that was, it was a little bit

334
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,144
of key frame animation and then filling in the in-betweens,

335
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,826
but mostly it was just straight ahead animation

336
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,448
where I was just trying to make something grow

337
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:40,472
out of a face or have blood drip down from a mouth.

338
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:42,834
It was mostly just straight ahead stuff.

339
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,203
So using Photoshop's video layers,

340
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:48,063
it was a very non-destructive workflow,

341
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:49,883
which I really appreciated as an animator.

342
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:53,284
I probably wouldn't have gotten these done without it.

343
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,505
On average, each rotoscope scene

344
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,445
would involve 75 to 120 drawings.

345
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:06,487
So the result was a disturbingly lifelike animation

346
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,547
that brought the chunky pixels to life.

347
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:11,388
This is all me.

348
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:12,908
There's me in my Texas apron.

349
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:15,595
It actually required two shots.

350
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:18,537
There's me in a mirror.

351
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,700
So animating at 15 frames per second

352
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,481
was a smart move, really smart, considering

353
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:25,682
the amount of drawings I had to do.

354
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:29,004
Our eyes have kind of our own kind

355
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:32,547
of natural frame interpolation when we look at moving images

356
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:33,587
or changing images.

357
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:37,150
This is something that Richard Williams, a famous animator,

358
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,651
called the persistence of vision.

359
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,281
So we produce an ocular after image

360
00:17:42,301 --> 00:17:45,462
when we look at a changing image,

361
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:48,402
and basically one frame bleeds into the next frame

362
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:50,483
and effectively fills in the gaps for us.

363
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:53,984
A lot of players remark on the smoothness of the animations

364
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,324
when in reality they're running at a very low frame rate.

365
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,725
So talking about the results,

366
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:04,226
these are chat messages from a streamer,

367
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:07,307
from a Twitch stream, someone who played Faith.

368
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,422
So there are many ways to define success

369
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:11,764
in indie game development.

370
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,086
For us horror game designers,

371
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,567
we actually have the added pressure

372
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,030
of scaring the player on top of entertaining them.

373
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,572
So based on player reaction,

374
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:22,714
I think Face Unsettling visual design

375
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:26,197
contributed to its effectiveness as a horror game.

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,762
So here's why I want y'all to take away from this talk.

377
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,164
Basic graphics can be scary.

378
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:39,705
Of course, a good horror game combines not only the visual elements but the audio, and

379
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:43,367
it needs good scare design, it needs good scenario and level design, just like any game.

380
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:48,570
But if you don't have the means to work with cutting-edge graphics or the time or the patience,

381
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:52,453
your visual design can still contribute to a feeling of horror.

382
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:56,775
I just stuck to one aesthetic and working within my constraints.

383
00:18:57,496 --> 00:19:00,238
I had a lot of fun with it, and I think it turned out pretty compelling.

384
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,041
I should probably change the first point to basic graphics can still support your game's

385
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:12,242
vision because the research and design techniques and the processes that I've spoken about can

386
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:14,482
apply to non-horror games as well.

387
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:23,644
So the tech for video game graphics has gone so far into the future, and I hope some consideration,

388
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:28,285
if possible, can still be made for those of us who are stuck in the retro era.

389
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:32,064
Second, constraints can set you free,

390
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:34,486
free from creative block,

391
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:37,448
free from stylistic inconsistency,

392
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:41,192
and free from the expertise or time or funds needed

393
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:43,474
to develop cutting-edge graphics.

394
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:47,397
And I, for one, I'm an evangelist

395
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:49,839
for these retro-inspired horror games,

396
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:53,342
but I still enjoy modern graphics and games myself,

397
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,784
and there's definitely value in them.

398
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:57,932
But if you want to make horror games,

399
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:01,614
but are daunted by the skills gap of creating good graphics,

400
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:02,695
then join us.

401
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:03,895
There's a lot of us.

402
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:05,096
We're growing.

403
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:07,057
We have scanlines, we have dithering,

404
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:09,638
we have affine polygon transforms.

405
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:12,479
Retro-inspired horror is a thing,

406
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,561
and lots of indie horror devs are combining

407
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,743
their design skills with the nostalgia aesthetic

408
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:20,243
with terrifying results.

409
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:23,730
Y'all should probably know this by now, this is FNAF.

410
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:26,993
Nun Massacre by Puppet Combo.

411
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:31,718
He's kind of the king of PlayStation era throwback games.

412
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,461
Paratopic, which just won an award last night.

413
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,283
And this one's called World of Horror.

414
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,425
I really like this aesthetic.

415
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,390
So you can find me on Twitter, there's my email.

416
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:46,131
And if you wanna support my work,

417
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:47,831
you can find my games on Itch and Game Jolt.

418
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:50,893
I released Faith Chapter Two in February,

419
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:53,674
and I released my most recent game called The Wind

420
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:55,334
yesterday morning.

421
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,315
And it was actually, I was on a deadline,

422
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,196
I was actually commissioned by IFC Films

423
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,597
who released the Babadook, Human Centipede,

424
00:21:04,757 --> 00:21:05,658
Autopsy of Jane Doe.

425
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:10,839
They asked me for an Oregon Trail style horror game.

426
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:14,398
So there is a demand for retrograde horror.

427
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:17,379
And I hope this talk was encouraging.

428
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,519
I hope this talk kind of illuminated

429
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:25,500
the visual considerations that went into a retro horror game

430
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,041
that could stand its own against AAA horror titles

431
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,561
in some aspects.

432
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,101
Thank you.

433
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:30,381
Thank you.

434
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,841
Thank you.

435
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:32,501
Thank you.

436
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:38,922
Thank you.

437
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:39,122
Thank you.

438
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:39,322
Thank you.

439
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:39,543
Thank you.

440
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:39,803
Thank you.

441
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:40,103
Thank you.

442
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:40,303
Thank you.

443
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:40,583
Thank you.

444
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:40,903
Thank you.

445
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:41,203
Thank you.

446
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:44,027
Oh, don't leave me hanging.

447
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:51,453
Exhilarating.

448
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:55,777
So now that Faith and The Wind, I guess, are out,

449
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,418
where do you plan to go from here?

450
00:21:57,438 --> 00:22:00,140
Are you going to work on something in the same style

451
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,941
or branch out from what you're currently doing?

452
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:07,518
That's a good question. So you're asking what my future plans are with kind of my retrograde horror

453
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,129
style that I'm in. Phase chapter three is eventually going to happen. I wanted it to be a trilogy.

454
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:17,245
But I would actually like to branch out of the Atari era

455
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:18,766
or the second generation at some point.

456
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:22,487
Maybe go into this newfangled thing called the Famicom

457
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:26,369
or maybe this 3D graphics stuff with the PlayStation era.

458
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:31,971
I really enjoy PlayStation 2 survival horror titles.

459
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,512
I think they have a charm on their own

460
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:35,113
and I don't know how this happened,

461
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,433
but that's apparently retro now.

462
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:40,095
I wanna get into that eventually.

463
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:43,036
Thank you.

464
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:50,751
Hey, I love the series. It seems like because they're lo-fi, you could probably like produce these pretty quickly, right?

465
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:51,572
I'm sorry?

466
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:56,136
You can, since they're kind of like lo-fi, you can kind of work on these and produce them pretty fast.

467
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:57,918
How long does it usually take you to make one of these?

468
00:22:58,198 --> 00:23:01,321
Okay, so you're asking my production cycle. So Faith...

469
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:07,354
I was working a day job and I had other commitments like grad school and so faith was just something

470
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:10,475
I worked on here and there and it took about two and a half years to finish.

471
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:15,456
Faith chapter two I was a lot more serious about and I finished it and the standalone

472
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,876
demo in 13 months.

473
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:22,218
But it was not before I established a pipeline and kind of a discipline for how I wanted

474
00:23:22,258 --> 00:23:26,779
to constrain myself, when enough was enough for certain sprites and environments.

475
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,700
IFC Films gave me a turnaround of 10 days for The Wind.

476
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:36,912
It's about a five minute game, but still, 10 days.

477
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:37,953
Thanks.

478
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:39,933
Thank you.

479
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:42,034
Hello.

480
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:42,674
Howdy.

481
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:45,755
Do you continue to, at this point,

482
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:50,316
maintain your day job and do the five to 9 a.m.

483
00:23:51,117 --> 00:23:54,037
production cycle, or is it that you've moved this

484
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,058
to your primary focus?

485
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:58,600
OK, so you're asking if I want to eventually move

486
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,982
into primarily working on Airdorf games,

487
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,223
as opposed to my day job and other activities.

488
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:07,086
Well, I'm kind of a family man, so family always comes first.

489
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:10,749
And this might be for another discussion,

490
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,752
but the work I do, I've gotten some notoriety,

491
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:16,134
but so far it pays for a little bit of travel

492
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,476
and a nice date night every week.

493
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:20,697
But it's not something I can hang my life on at this moment.

494
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,319
And taking the risk to do that full time

495
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,739
is up to each individual.

496
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:27,940
Right now I'm still doing my day job

497
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,820
and then working on Erdorf games when I can.

498
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,460
Thanks.

499
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,181
Hi, thank you for the talk.

500
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:34,621
Howdy.

501
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:36,462
So you mentioned you're an animator.

502
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,442
What was your level design pipeline like?

503
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,223
Since it seems like you didn't have a background in that.

504
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:41,843
How did you know you were doing it effectively

505
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:42,743
to scare your players?

506
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,331
So specifically, what were my considerations

507
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,052
with level design?

508
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:47,352
Yeah.

509
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:48,052
OK.

510
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:49,352
That's a great question.

511
00:24:49,992 --> 00:24:51,633
So I, there's my timer.

512
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:55,414
That's a good question.

513
00:24:55,654 --> 00:24:57,515
I've played, I watch a lot of horror movies.

514
00:24:57,535 --> 00:25:00,656
I'm kind of scared easily in some aspects.

515
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:04,577
And I play a lot of horror games.

516
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:11,410
Basically, when I first saw my first horror movie when I was in sixth grade, or when I

517
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,154
played my first horror game, which I think was Resident Evil 2 for the N64, I knew I

518
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:16,654
wanted to do this.

519
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:16,915
And so...

520
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,341
What I do is I think of things that would scare me.

521
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:26,265
I personally am terrified of supernatural horror

522
00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:28,908
and kind of this religious horror, not just Christian,

523
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:31,791
but there's exorcism stories from other religions

524
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:32,832
that would blow your mind.

525
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:33,393
They're insane.

526
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:35,375
I wish we would make more multimedia about it.

527
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:36,356
So.

528
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:41,696
My person, a lot of my personal tastes come into play.

529
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:43,037
I prefer a sense of dread.

530
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:45,397
If I watch a movie or play a game and then I drive home

531
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:48,478
and I'm scared to look behind me in the back seat at night,

532
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:50,939
then I kind of log that away in the back of my mind.

533
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:52,580
I'm like, I want to do something like that.

534
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,601
And sometimes it's hard not to copy directly

535
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,502
from a movie or a game.

536
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:00,942
Sometimes you can do it for homage's sake.

537
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:03,723
Like there's a lot of The Exorcist in Faith chapter one.

538
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:06,884
I tend to drift away from jump scares.

539
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:11,365
So my pipeline is I plan everything out on paper,

540
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:16,066
and then I do my beauty pass, which is just graphics.

541
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:18,127
And then I do my overlay wall pass

542
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:21,827
for things that are layered up on top of the player.

543
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,128
And then I do my collision pass, where I kind of paint in

544
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:26,268
where you're not supposed to walk.

545
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:28,629
And then that gets thrown into GameMaker.

546
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:29,429
I use GameMaker.

547
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:32,470
And the scares are a lot of iteration.

548
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:35,703
Thank you so much.

549
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:35,986
Yeah, sure.

550
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:36,208
Thank you.

551
00:26:40,193 --> 00:26:41,013
Hi.

552
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:42,554
Just had a quick question.

553
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:45,915
So usually in games, they're higher fidelity.

554
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:48,977
You go in and you do the block out with very simple meshes

555
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:49,517
and shapes.

556
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:52,999
Did you do that with Faith, or did you kind of just

557
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,600
draw a thing and know you wanted it to be that way,

558
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,900
like from the get go?

559
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,001
That's a great question.

560
00:26:58,021 --> 00:27:00,022
And it just so happens when working in pixel art,

561
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:03,743
you're already blocking things out, because pixels are blocks.

562
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,184
But you bring up a great point.

563
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,686
I do have to do a lot of pen and paper stuff.

564
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:13,364
And oftentimes, especially with Chapter 2,

565
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:16,865
I was very not sure of myself because it was a sequel.

566
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:19,205
I didn't want to suffer from sequelitis or turn it

567
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:21,526
into a Disney sequel where it was too much of the wrong thing.

568
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:25,486
And so I'll often plan it out on paper.

569
00:27:25,587 --> 00:27:26,587
I'll write stuff out.

570
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,747
I'll write down dialogue.

571
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:29,847
And I'll let it incubate for a while,

572
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:30,828
move on to something else.

573
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:34,028
And I have a small inner circle of friends

574
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:36,629
who are both good designers and easily scared.

575
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:37,969
And I'll run things by them.

576
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:44,098
And when it's just artistically, it's just something that feels right and then I implement

577
00:27:44,118 --> 00:27:44,158
it.

578
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:45,681
Thank you.

579
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:46,122
Thank you.

580
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:51,631
Okay, thanks everybody.
