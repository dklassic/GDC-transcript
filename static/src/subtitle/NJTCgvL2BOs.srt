1
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:09,189
Our business is joy.

2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:15,371
The hard work we do goes into building tiny machines of joy.

3
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,871
We build, package, and ship joy.

4
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:25,352
Our ultimate goal, regardless of how much we argue, stress,

5
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:27,533
and struggle, and God knows we do,

6
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:29,993
is to bring joy into the world.

7
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:35,474
We are all part of the joy industrial complex.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,522
As game developers, the fruit of our labor is joy.

9
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:47,405
If an industry can have a soul, ours is joy.

10
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,407
So how can it be so hard?

11
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:55,889
How can it be so hard sometimes to get up in the morning?

12
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,571
How can it be so hard to keep a studio running,

13
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:03,393
to find job security, personal health, or even a decent wage?

14
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:06,795
How can it be so hard?

15
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:11,614
And how can we make the struggle easier?

16
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:14,196
We are fragile and frail people.

17
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:17,258
Sometimes we fall, sometimes we fail.

18
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,641
But we are also capable of deep compassion

19
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,322
and sublime empathy.

20
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:25,204
And we always aim for joy.

21
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:28,687
My name is Henrik Jansson,

22
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,468
and I will be your moderator today.

23
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,751
The questions asked here are what we will discuss

24
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:34,631
during the panel.

25
00:01:35,392 --> 00:01:36,893
But first I need to address why the panel

26
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,494
looks very different than planned.

27
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:42,884
Tom Hall, the co-founder of id Software, and Nicole Lewis,

28
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:44,465
head of publishing for League of Legends,

29
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,267
were supposed to be here.

30
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:51,889
They both had to cancel suddenly yesterday.

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,971
Life comes at us hard.

32
00:01:57,572 --> 00:02:00,394
Thankfully, through friends and friends of friends,

33
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:03,215
we have lined up a new set of panelists.

34
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:06,877
And I would now like the panel to introduce themselves.

35
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:15,596
I'm Brie Code. I'm the CEO and creative director of a tiny studio based in Toronto called True Love.

36
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:22,239
Before that I was a lead programmer at Ubisoft Montreal on Child of Light and three Assassin's Creed projects.

37
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,640
And before that I wrote AI for a company of heroes at Relic.

38
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:30,053
Hi, I'm Dr. JC Lau.

39
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:33,114
I'm currently a tech producer at Harebrained Schemes

40
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,075
working on Battletech.

41
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:36,996
Before that, I was at Bungie as a test engineer

42
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,117
working on Destiny 2 and its DLCs.

43
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:44,318
And before I entered games, I was a professor

44
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,299
in the philosophy of race and gender at Virginia Tech.

45
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:49,729
Hello, my name is Osama Darius.

46
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,190
I'm a game designer at Warner Brothers Games in Montreal.

47
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,632
I'm also the coordinator of the video game programs

48
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:56,273
at Dawson College, and I'm the co-founder

49
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,714
of the Montreal Independent Game Awards.

50
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:03,097
Hi, I'm Raf Koster, and I'm a game designer

51
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,158
best known for MMOs, Ultima Online,

52
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:07,339
Star Wars Galaxies, MetaPlace,

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,042
and I think this might be my 20th or 21st consecutive GDC.

54
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:15,264
It's a long run.

55
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:21,267
So the first topic I'd like to bring up is my first job in games.

56
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:25,529
Finding a job in games can be hard,

57
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,590
but I also like to talk about how do we leave a job.

58
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,892
I've seen too many developers leave a trail of burned bridges behind them.

59
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,713
And I would like us to talk a little bit of how to leave.

60
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:40,195
Could the panel please talk a little bit about how you got in,

61
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:42,456
but also how you got out.

62
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:45,557
If you have switched jobs since then, how did you leave?

63
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:47,098
Any advice at all?

64
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,621
Reverse the order perhaps?

65
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:52,521
Sure.

66
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:55,623
So I got in through friends.

67
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,564
And I think that's not unusual.

68
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:02,446
A friend of mine got lucky and landed a contracting job

69
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:03,467
doing video games.

70
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:06,648
And from there, ended up hired full time.

71
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,570
And when they needed designers on Ultima Online,

72
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,410
he recommended me.

73
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:16,977
And there I ended up just ridiculously lucky and on the right project at the right time

74
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:21,959
I think a lot of what I'd say about that is

75
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,482
That luck needs preparation, right? If if I hadn't been doing the right kind of thing beforehand

76
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:32,203
I probably couldn't have gotten the job as

77
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:33,624
far as leaving

78
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:39,266
Gosh most of the times I've left have been very very stressful and unpleasant

79
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,637
I once left a job over the fact that I was asked to fire a group of people that I had

80
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,881
been mentoring for two years, for example.

81
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,466
And I wasn't allowed to tell them that's why.

82
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,690
That was not fun.

83
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,715
So I actually had a completely different career path. I studied political science and I worked as a shipping agent

84
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:09,561
And I had a love-hate relationship with the job. Meeting people was fun, the captains and the crew and doing the paperwork is boring

85
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:13,785
So I went to another love that I had before which was graphic and web design and I just

86
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:16,286
Completely self-taught, I became a freelancer,

87
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,867
I did all the wrong things, didn't make a lot of money,

88
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,428
but at least that allowed me to learn Flash,

89
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,689
and Flash allowed me to make games,

90
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:25,289
and my games were terrible,

91
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,990
but they were good enough for a portfolio.

92
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,391
That's how I landed my first job in the industry.

93
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,726
I left that job because basically I was too nice, and I don't mean that in a good way.

94
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:42,473
I didn't fight for my rights, I didn't fight for a salary, and I realized after years and

95
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:47,819
years of just waiting patiently for people to acknowledge what I deserved and to give

96
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:52,444
it to me, that people that were much more junior than me were actually making higher

97
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:52,864
salaries.

98
00:05:53,725 --> 00:06:01,128
And when I asked to fix that, to mend that, I was given answers and excuses.

99
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:04,190
So after six years at the same company, finally enough was enough.

100
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,931
And by leaving, I almost made double what I made before.

101
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:08,692
So it's basically that.

102
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:16,036
The games industry is my third industry, I would say.

103
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:19,979
So I'm Australian, and in Australia,

104
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,761
you can do a law degree as an undergrad.

105
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:28,265
So I actually started my college with an arts law degree,

106
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:30,427
and I went on to become a lawyer.

107
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:32,229
I worked in family law for several years,

108
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,530
working on child representation.

109
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:36,912
in divorce cases, which is, as you can imagine,

110
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:39,953
not a super fun place to be when you're 22 years old.

111
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:42,274
Yeah, and then after that,

112
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,295
I decided I wanted to be an academic.

113
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:46,996
So then I did a dissertation

114
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:48,997
in moral and political philosophy.

115
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:52,758
So I ended up with a PhD in philosophy,

116
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:53,619
and what do you do with that?

117
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:56,860
You become a philosophy professor,

118
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,401
because either that or there's that joke

119
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,662
about going to McDonald's and asking people

120
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:03,343
if they think they want fries with something.

121
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:11,826
So, when I was an academic, I was like, well, I have these skills, but I want to make games.

122
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:16,947
How do I leverage my background into a games job?

123
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:23,970
And so I actually applied at Bungie as a tester, and I'm like, I have a PhD, I would like to

124
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,630
be a tester.

125
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:32,653
And so that was a really interesting conversation, but I guess they gave me the job, so that's

126
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:32,873
cool.

127
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:37,074
And so a lot of it was talking about how those skills transferred.

128
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:40,197
So I talked a lot about like how I have particular communication skills and

129
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:43,440
organizational skills and how I could apply them to a particular role.

130
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:50,948
And I can't say I've left a lot of game shows because I'm the baby on this panel.

131
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,870
I've been in the industry for about four years.

132
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,673
But although statistically, I'm one year away from.

133
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,802
the average career length for a woman in games,

134
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,183
so let that sink in.

135
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:05,166
But yeah, so one of the reasons I did leave

136
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:09,649
was it was a combination of studio culture

137
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,350
and also wanting to make an impact.

138
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,612
And depending on your studio size and its composition,

139
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:16,353
it can feel hard to make an impact.

140
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:20,756
And so I wanted to go somewhere where I could

141
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:23,658
feel like I was making a difference and being effective

142
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,060
and seeing change that I wanted.

143
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,120
So.

144
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:28,966
Yeah, that's pretty much my story.

145
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:33,791
I got into the games industry by accident.

146
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:35,573
I wanna go all the way back to high school.

147
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:39,837
I grew up in the country and I hated living in the country.

148
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:44,361
And I figured out by looking at what's possible

149
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:46,784
in my high school that I could finish high school

150
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:49,967
in four years instead of five if I moved some classes around

151
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:51,849
in a way that my teachers didn't approve of.

152
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:53,990
and took summer school,

153
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,650
and the courses that's supposed to be remedial,

154
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,911
but just take it, and they couldn't stop me.

155
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,852
And so I finished high school when I was 16

156
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,213
and went to university with absolutely no savings

157
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,433
because I never had a summer job

158
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,113
and hadn't thought that far ahead.

159
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,974
So I had to put myself through university

160
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:12,155
by working two jobs and keeping my scholarship.

161
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:15,956
And again, I kind of like figured out how to make it work.

162
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,737
And I thought if I do computer science,

163
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:18,937
I can get a degree.

164
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,001
and know I can keep my scholarship because it's not subjective.

165
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,985
Like you just stay in the lab until your program works and you know you have an A

166
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:29,487
and then you know you have your scholarship and you know you have a degree.

167
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:35,093
I graduated when I was 20 and the dot-com crash just happened and there were no jobs.

168
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:39,425
and I realized I didn't want to be a programmer and I hadn't thought that far ahead either.

169
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:49,388
I kept my student job for a while and then I got a credit card and I went to Europe.

170
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:54,309
I thought that moving from the country to Vancouver had been so expansive and interesting

171
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:56,929
that going to another continent would be interesting too.

172
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:04,636
And I thought I would figure out what I wanted from life and what should I go back to school

173
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:06,998
and study because I felt like I wanted to do a do-over.

174
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:13,524
And then what I discovered was that I ran out of money and went back to Vancouver with

175
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:17,948
eight dollars left and needed a job and started applying for every programming job I could

176
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:23,293
find and I was very, very, very, very, very, very, very lucky.

177
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:26,097
to get a job at Relic Entertainment in Vancouver,

178
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:29,341
which was an amazing experience.

179
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,423
I loved it from the first few weeks,

180
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,846
and I knew that I would stay in the games industry forever.

181
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,932
So I wrote AI Code there.

182
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:39,433
I worked there for a while, but then I was like.

183
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:45,120
I did want to try to live overseas for a while, so I went to Australia for a bit.

184
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,301
I came back to Canada

185
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,226
and then I started my own studio.

186
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:55,492
And a couple of the times that I left studios, not all of them,

187
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:57,795
one of those jobs was really amazing.

188
00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:58,796
All those jobs were amazing.

189
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:05,888
Being a woman in a workplace dominated by men is not easy.

190
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:10,191
And research shows if there's less than 30%, I think, of women,

191
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:15,275
then women get sidelined and stereotyped and talked over in meetings

192
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,037
and men attribute the women's ideas to themselves.

193
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:20,059
And these kind of things really happen.

194
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:27,166
eventually you kind of reach a point where you are just not able to develop

195
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:31,911
your talents and your aptitudes at the speed that the men around you are and it

196
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:35,995
makes more sense to go somewhere new. So that's why I left a couple of mine.

197
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:41,714
I'm coming at you from extreme privilege.

198
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:46,677
As a programmer, I've never been afraid to leave the game

199
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:52,281
industry, which is a blessing for that not many others

200
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,602
and specialists in the gaming field have.

201
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:58,905
My first job in games was my first real job,

202
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,886
if you did not count summer jobs.

203
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:06,569
And it was as a programmer for games to be broadcast on TV.

204
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:13,586
I failed my college, I did not know C++, and I lied to get in.

205
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:21,671
I was asked to start in three weeks, and that's when I got my first book on C++.

206
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:28,176
It worked out.

207
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:29,117
It worked out.

208
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:33,039
It was a different time.

209
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:39,220
So if we talk about this first topic, and then if we try to

210
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,902
think of one time where we realized that this is so bad

211
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:50,903
or so good, an opportunity on the outside.

212
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:53,084
Sorry for making that sentence a complete mess.

213
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:57,385
Have we ever had such a good situation and good offer from

214
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:58,566
the outside that you need to leave?

215
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,847
Or was there ever a situation so bad?

216
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,189
that you felt you had to leave.

217
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:08,250
And I can, when my boss was screaming at me

218
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,570
that she would kill me,

219
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,992
that's when I left my first job.

220
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:19,393
So, who would wanna go first on that?

221
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:25,335
So, let's see, my first job in games that I left,

222
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,876
that would have been when I left Origin

223
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:30,897
after making Ultima Online.

224
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:36,217
I'd come on board on Ultima Online when I was 23, 24.

225
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,662
And after only a couple of years,

226
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,384
I was actually the lead designer of it

227
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:48,886
by the time I was 25 when it shipped.

228
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:52,589
And I knew nothing about the wider industry at all.

229
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:55,131
I didn't know anybody.

230
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,052
I just didn't know anyone.

231
00:13:57,072 --> 00:14:00,135
I didn't know what I had actually accomplished.

232
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:01,929
like I was oblivious to it.

233
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,294
And I was highly opinionated,

234
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,057
highly, highly opinionated,

235
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:12,520
very sure of myself in terms of what we were doing.

236
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:18,006
But that meant that despite having just shipped this game

237
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,829
that was a really big deal,

238
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:27,708
Some of you are young enough to not even know how big a deal it was at the time.

239
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,810
It was a really big deal, but I didn't realize how big a deal it was.

240
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,532
EA actually put me on the list of people to be laid off

241
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:39,974
because I was opinionated and thought that they were idiots

242
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,295
in terms of what they were doing with online games.

243
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:46,277
I got rescued by managers who...

244
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:50,899
I owe an enormous debt to people like Gordon Walton and Rich Vogel

245
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,380
who mentored me through this period.

246
00:14:54,996 --> 00:15:01,999
But they launched an Ultima Online 2 project and I was very carefully left out of the team

247
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:05,860
for that, so they wouldn't let me lead a new project.

248
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,281
They tucked me away on the live team, which turned out to be a blessing because the live

249
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,722
team made the money and the sequels all got cancelled.

250
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,715
And eventually part of the reason we left is that the follow-on project that I was working on

251
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:23,437
also got cancelled because they just didn't know what to do.

252
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:30,045
So that ended up being good. We all left and landed a new one called Star Wars Galaxies.

253
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:36,487
But it basically was a case of, wow, here's an org that is so dysfunctional

254
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:42,149
that they don't understand where the money is coming from, where the value is coming from.

255
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:46,630
They don't even understand this whole new category that they just opened up

256
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,131
and is theirs for the taking. So they just let it wither on the vine.

257
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,380
EA did go on to lose about a billion dollars in online games in the space of the next four

258
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,502
years, so leaving turned out to be the right thing to do.

259
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:06,905
But it was a really strange experience to not be aware that I'd done something great.

260
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:14,788
gradually become aware and then be ignored for it by that company.

261
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:21,470
You know, it's a good reminder that companies, even though they're often made of very smart people,

262
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:28,853
companies can be really, really stupid things. Like really, really stupid. So don't trust companies.

263
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:38,680
So I made the mistake at one point in my career where I started highlighting my soft skills as my strongest skills.

264
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,681
This is actually true.

265
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:42,302
They still are my strongest skills.

266
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:43,723
I work really well with people.

267
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,824
I even earned the reputation that I could work with anyone.

268
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:51,407
For the record, I don't want to work with anyone, but I can if I had to.

269
00:16:54,962 --> 00:17:00,204
So I was hired in this one particular company that will go unnamed for that, for the soft skills.

270
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:07,067
I have hard skills as well, many of them. I have 12 years in the industry, I've shipped different sized games, over 20 of them.

271
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:09,468
I have a track record for delivering.

272
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:14,451
However, I focused on soft skills because I felt that this was something that was not

273
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:15,612
favoured in the industry.

274
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:18,193
We don't look at it, we don't ask about it, and this is a mistake.

275
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:23,557
People are promoted to positions of leadership based on their hard skills instead of being

276
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:27,019
given other promotions that doesn't put them interfacing with people.

277
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:32,103
So, you know, like telling someone that you're working with you're going to kill them, things

278
00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:32,423
like that.

279
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,626
So what happened is, at this one particular company,

280
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:40,730
I worked for a person who was a little bit manipulative,

281
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,371
and by a little bit I mean completely.

282
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:46,814
He realized really quickly that I knew how,

283
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,936
that my team liked me, they trusted me.

284
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,779
So for the year or so that I was there,

285
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:54,721
and don't go on my LinkedIn to find out which company I'm talking about,

286
00:17:54,741 --> 00:18:01,486
I was not able to change this person's mind once about anything.

287
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:05,102
to the point that everyone has imposter syndrome,

288
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,245
mine went through the roof.

289
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:14,700
It was gradual. At first it was like, okay, he's more experienced than me and he's worked on more

290
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,982
games and he's dealt with more people and I started listening and then at other points when

291
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:24,405
his, whatever he suggested would have a 50-50 track record of working, um, I started making

292
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:29,768
excuses for it while we tried it out and eventually near the end I realized I'm just a mouthpiece

293
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:35,412
for my team. I'm a lead designer by name only. I'm not doing anything except translating.

294
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:36,712
Because he had lost.

295
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,755
all trust, or rather, the team had lost all trust in him.

296
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:43,097
So I was being used as a figurehead.

297
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:45,539
And that's when I decided to leave the company.

298
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,902
That's not, my job title is not figurehead,

299
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:49,702
it's game designer.

300
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:53,245
Okay, I'm gonna preface this with also,

301
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:54,686
please don't go on my LinkedIn,

302
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:58,269
because my time in games has been relatively short,

303
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,190
so it'll be really easy to pinpoint

304
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,672
where things are happening.

305
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:04,374
So I'm gonna kind of couch this in very general terms.

306
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:09,723
There was a point before I started in games proper,

307
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:13,106
when I was leaving academia, where I did some work

308
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:17,829
in both games journalism and also in working on consoles.

309
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,470
So kind of games adjacent, not really in games.

310
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:24,753
And one of the things that I discovered quite quickly,

311
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:30,416
like Asama, is I had a particular set of skills that were,

312
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:33,727
easily transferable but were considered soft skills.

313
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:37,790
So given my background, I've done a lot of advocacy work.

314
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,774
I do a lot of speaking about diversity and inclusion.

315
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:45,136
I have written and published on these areas.

316
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:49,059
And very quickly on these teams that I was on,

317
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,462
I became the person that was the one

318
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:54,043
that would take things up to the manager

319
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:55,524
on behalf of the team.

320
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,526
So I was, at one point, I was the...

321
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:05,908
coordinator for a team of 24 people and they were all people that, and we were based in Seattle but

322
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:11,489
none of them were actually from Seattle and some of them, for some of them English was not their

323
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:15,670
first language so then I kind of ended up being like a sound of the mouthpiece for this team

324
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,531
and I would bring things up to the manager and it got to the point also for me where

325
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:27,612
I was in this weird role where I had this particular set of coordination and like management skills

326
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:31,557
So I wasn't expendable in that way,

327
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,881
but it was apparent that I was not included

328
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:37,604
in a lot of the conversations at that leadership level.

329
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,669
So it came to this point where they kind of just,

330
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,952
I was getting siloed in a way that was not

331
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,274
kind of making me effective for my team.

332
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:52,906
And I like to say most people don't leave companies, they leave managers.

333
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,767
And I think that is true in some of these cases.

334
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:58,247
It's about those interpersonal relationships and

335
00:20:58,887 --> 00:21:02,408
whether or not you can sustain them will also determine what your day-to-day is like.

336
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:07,210
And I think that is one of the key things about how you can,

337
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,750
like, why people leave is just...

338
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,674
you know, sometimes it gets too hard to try to maintain that relationship.

339
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:17,077
Sometimes there's a lot of labor that you have to do in addition to your day job

340
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:20,120
to maintain that relationship. And sometimes it's just not worth it.

341
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:26,227
So if you get to that point where it's just basically your daily death by a

342
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:32,693
thousand cuts, it's probably time to leave. Yeah.

343
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:32,773
Um,

344
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,332
I was an AI programmer at Relic and was a really technical programmer.

345
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,833
If someone can't figure out how to do something, they can give it to me and I'll figure it

346
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:46,213
out.

347
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:51,555
When I started at Ubisoft, in Quebec there is a stereotype that women make very good

348
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:52,135
managers.

349
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:56,357
So shortly after I started, my boss asked me to manage the team.

350
00:21:56,797 --> 00:22:00,558
And I had applied for a lead programmer position because it had been the only one that was

351
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:01,278
on the website.

352
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:05,943
And I was an intermediate programmer when I did that, so it was pretty cool.

353
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:10,504
So I said yes, because of course I'm going to take a promotion.

354
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:13,524
And I was, I'm not a good manager.

355
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:19,266
Like I, it's not what my, maybe I'm an okay manager, but I'm a better systems programmer.

356
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:20,866
But I said yes.

357
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:23,547
And for the first two years, it was really hard.

358
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:27,828
Every time I had to speak in front of my team of like eight friends of mine, I would get

359
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:30,769
the shakes and the stomachache, which I did every morning.

360
00:22:31,926 --> 00:22:37,591
And I managed that team and then I managed a team that was twice that size and then I

361
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:40,154
managed a team that was three or four times that size.

362
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:42,917
And then I became a lead programmer on Child of Light.

363
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:47,141
And near the end of Child of Light...

364
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:49,897
Two things happened on that project.

365
00:22:50,517 --> 00:22:52,898
One was that I had a really incredible boss

366
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,499
who knew that I wanted to be a producer

367
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:57,401
because I was so happy with getting the promotion

368
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,442
and with feeling useful that I wasn't thinking

369
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:01,203
about what I was actually good at

370
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:02,284
or what I should be doing.

371
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:03,965
I was doing what I was asked to do

372
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:05,926
and I really liked doing what I was asked to do.

373
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:10,288
So he knew I wanted to be a producer

374
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:11,869
and so he showed me his entire job.

375
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:12,810
Like he would be like,

376
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,131
oh Bree, come over here and see the resource management tool.

377
00:23:16,232 --> 00:23:19,333
And I was kind of horrified at what a producer's job was.

378
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:23,294
And I realized I definitely, like, I can't do, that's not my path.

379
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:28,916
And what path have I been on for five years, seven years, seven years?

380
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,557
And near the end of that project, I also, like, well, we were shipping,

381
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:38,118
like, we were crunching, and I discovered I had a life-threatening illness.

382
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,040
And I couldn't tell them because...

383
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,701
they needed to stay focused. I blurted it out to my boss as he was putting a lot

384
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:51,582
of pressure on me one day and his eyes almost fell out of his head. I learned

385
00:23:51,622 --> 00:24:01,684
not to tell people that way. And then I went into surgery the day that we put

386
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:04,844
the thing in the box and that it was out and the reviews came out that day. When I

387
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:07,125
came out of surgery the reviews were starting to appear on the internet.

388
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:10,386
And it turned out that I was absolutely fine.

389
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:13,347
The surgery worked and I'm fine and I'm completely fine.

390
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:18,389
But my life sure came into crystal clear focus

391
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,430
and I experienced something called post-traumatic growth.

392
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,131
Because I didn't know I was gonna be fine.

393
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:22,991
We were shipping that game,

394
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:24,332
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

395
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,834
And so suddenly everything became really clear

396
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:31,935
and I knew where I wanted the industry to go

397
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:35,757
and I knew what was missing and what I wanted to do.

398
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:43,520
And so, and I started doing it and I realized that that organization wasn't

399
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,841
the right place to be doing what I wanted to do, that innovation happens

400
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:52,123
outside of established structures and that it happens in a startup and

401
00:24:52,143 --> 00:24:57,385
that I have to do a startup to be able to be doing what I want to do. So that's why I left.

402
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:12,572
We are talking about a little bit on skillset and finding out who we are as people when we grow into the industry.

403
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:24,699
And I just met a game student at a university who was having issues with, or a bit of a problem with choosing if you wanted to go into 3D modeling or 3D animation.

404
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:32,403
I couldn't help her with that because, you know, I'm a programmer. I'm so bad at drawing that I'm banned from using the whiteboard in many of our offices.

405
00:25:34,273 --> 00:25:41,655
But I was able to tell her that the choice we're making

406
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:45,496
are very rarely career defining.

407
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:51,138
It may influence her first job, but it will not necessarily

408
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:53,519
influence her full career.

409
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:59,020
And I wanted to tell her that you are not your career.

410
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,101
You are not your job description.

411
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:06,698
But, you know, I just don't think that quick on my feet.

412
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:07,840
So I didn't.

413
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:09,242
I wish I could.

414
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:15,750
But I would like a little bit if we can talk about how we change roles over time.

415
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:23,414
Bree mentioned kind of sliding into something because it's expected of you to be good at

416
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:32,860
that because of different reasons, or how we move and change because we are curious

417
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,181
and want to investigate things.

418
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:41,917
So, practical ways to broaden our horizons, basically.

419
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:45,219
If anyone wants to take a stab at that, Bree?

420
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,741
So, my boss on Child of Light taught me

421
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:52,843
that in most setbacks there are opportunities.

422
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:55,345
And it doesn't mean that the setback is fair.

423
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,306
It doesn't mean it's how it should work.

424
00:26:58,146 --> 00:26:59,767
But it means that the game has changed

425
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:03,009
and you can sometimes find new ways to play from that.

426
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:16,823
And I think that, you know, every time that something's gone wrong in my career,

427
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:20,484
maybe I haven't known at that moment that it's actually a push forward,

428
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:27,626
and it hasn't felt good in the moment, but it's always worked out to be a giant leap forward.

429
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:38,700
When I was doing AI programming at the beginning,

430
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,261
it was because that's what the team needed

431
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:41,321
and then I really liked it.

432
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:42,702
And then when I became a manager,

433
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:44,222
it was because it was what the team needed.

434
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:48,824
And even if it wasn't the best long-term career path for me,

435
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:51,625
it taught me how to be able to do stuff like this,

436
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,106
speak in front of people,

437
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:56,667
and even just speak to people at all

438
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:58,167
because I was never very social.

439
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:05,813
And then when I, you know, got sick and figured out what I wanted to do,

440
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:11,076
I discovered a theory in the field of stress psychology,

441
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:14,299
which kind of explains why about half of people find video games boring

442
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,661
and also suggests a framework for how to engage and retain those other half of people,

443
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,622
which is the basis of my studio now.

444
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:26,247
The thing about not being your job, though,

445
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:28,749
it doesn't work for me.

446
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:31,499
We're all different people and we all have different needs.

447
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,762
And work-life balance has never been something I've needed.

448
00:28:36,123 --> 00:28:37,544
So I'll throw that out there.

449
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:39,706
And it's not popular, and don't follow my example,

450
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,467
because you probably have to work life balance.

451
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:48,373
So I think the thing about not being your job

452
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:49,814
or not being your job description is

453
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,386
kind of apt.

454
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:55,808
Okay, so given my background,

455
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,170
and I like to joke about this because my,

456
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,972
it was just a little bit of background.

457
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:01,914
I come from a really kind of traditional

458
00:29:01,954 --> 00:29:04,216
like Asian parenting stereotype thing.

459
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:09,913
And I meet that trifecta because I'm a doctor, a lawyer, and an engineer.

460
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:13,095
And my parents love that.

461
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:14,596
And then I'm like, I'm a game producer.

462
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:16,117
And they're like, what is that?

463
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:23,243
So one of the things is while I am all those things, I also am more things than that.

464
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,665
But I also, I'm not, so I'm not just those things.

465
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:31,389
But there are skill sets that overlap for all those things.

466
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,775
I like to talk about skill sets more than job descriptions for two reasons.

467
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:39,400
One is, job descriptions vary wildly between studios.

468
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,128
This is also true of titles.

469
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:46,229
This is true of what your day-to-day looks like.

470
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:49,370
And the other thing is skill sets are pliable,

471
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,670
and you can leverage those for a lot of jobs.

472
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,971
So when we were talking about soft skills,

473
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,232
those are necessary for any kind of,

474
00:29:58,092 --> 00:29:59,392
like there's a set of soft skills,

475
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:01,293
including communication and organization,

476
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:03,233
and being able to work in a team,

477
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,594
and having some sort of initiative that are relevant for.

478
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,677
basically all game jobs where you work in a collaborative environment.

479
00:30:09,817 --> 00:30:17,683
So talking about those is I think a more kind of vague but useful way of describing yourself.

480
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:24,288
And the other thing about what you, so this is going back to what Herrick was saying about

481
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:26,270
how you change those roles over time.

482
00:30:27,915 --> 00:30:32,337
There are things that you can care deeply about that don't fall within a job description.

483
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:37,499
For me, I care really deeply about diversity and inclusion issues.

484
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,262
I can't go to a studio and be like, hey, I care deeply about diversity and inclusion,

485
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:45,663
give me a games job.

486
00:30:46,364 --> 00:30:51,326
That's changing now because studios are getting D&I managers, but that's not really super

487
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:51,926
common right now.

488
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,891
I can't just be like, hey, I care about this stuff, get me a job.

489
00:30:55,552 --> 00:31:01,195
So a lot of it is making spaces and carving out those careers for yourself, I think.

490
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:05,897
So one of the things I did was I have this particular interest, and when I was at Bungie,

491
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:12,541
I found a way to have conversations about diversity and inclusion with initially my

492
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:17,423
manager and then the head of my discipline, and then it went all the way up to the studio

493
00:31:17,463 --> 00:31:20,285
leadership, and this is how we founded the Bungie Diversity Committee in 2017.

494
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:26,646
Our studio at the time was having these conversations,

495
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,367
so it was also lucky that I could just segue into that.

496
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:32,788
But there are ways to have these conversations

497
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:33,708
about what you care about,

498
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:35,208
and to carve out those spaces for yourself.

499
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,289
I think one of the things that also helps

500
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,069
is because our industry is young,

501
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:42,890
and we still have a lot of technology that's developing,

502
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,990
there are spaces to find,

503
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,873
Nothing's being done in this particular area. Like how can I get into that space or you know?

504
00:31:50,913 --> 00:31:52,893
There's like this new tech that we haven't really explored

505
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:59,637
How can I leverage my expertise to kind of develop that and we have these opportunities. So yeah, we should take those

506
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:08,601
So professionally speaking who you are it's what you do

507
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:11,633
and you're able to do whatever you want.

508
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:17,115
I proved that myself because I didn't study anything related to game design at all.

509
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,996
So who I was professionally again was a shipping agent,

510
00:32:21,436 --> 00:32:25,758
but I was only a shipping agent for a year until I decided to explore other things.

511
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,438
And then I picked up other skills.

512
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:30,079
Your skills are malleable and intangible, but you can pick them up.

513
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:34,755
And then I became a freelance graphic and web designer, and that became who I was.

514
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,598
And that's what I thought, at least.

515
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:41,121
But that wasn't what was important. The title wasn't what was important.

516
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:43,002
It was the skills that I carried over.

517
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:45,544
However, people only interface with...

518
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,222
titles. So when I became a game designer, it's because I transitioned from the graphic

519
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:55,464
and web design skills, added a few other skills that were unrelated, and now all of a sudden

520
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:59,726
I have new skills. I mentioned before I was a coordinator of the video game programs at

521
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:05,549
Dawson College. Before I was a coordinator, I was a teacher. I became a teacher of level

522
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:08,171
in video game design when I only had three years of experience.

523
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:10,072
How did that happen?

524
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:12,993
I was interested in becoming a teacher,

525
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,614
but I knew it was probably gonna be along a faraway road.

526
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:18,694
Like, I was still very new to the industry,

527
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:20,855
but some people saw that I had some potential.

528
00:33:20,975 --> 00:33:24,336
I don't have stage fright, that's one thing.

529
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:26,536
I like spending time with people,

530
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:27,776
even if I'm not paid for it,

531
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:29,417
so I could spend more time with the students

532
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:30,677
and get them to the level that they are.

533
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:32,878
I'm naturally, I have these skills that I learned

534
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:34,178
when I was a shipping agent before

535
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:35,218
that I carried over again.

536
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:37,779
So, all I had to do was leverage that

537
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,759
when an opportunity came.

538
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,121
and the opportunity came in the form of a teacher that cancelled three weeks

539
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:49,964
before a class was supposed to start. So I had to teach, or rather they were

540
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:54,146
looking for someone to teach narrative, nonlinear narrative design in the

541
00:33:54,186 --> 00:33:59,088
Dragon Age engine, three weeks away when nobody in Montreal knew that engine.

542
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:06,471
And so I had three weeks to apply and potentially possibly get the job.

543
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,111
But I couldn't wait to get the job to learn the engine,

544
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,092
so I had to start learning the engine beforehand.

545
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:15,954
And I didn't have time off to take from work,

546
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,034
so this was part-time.

547
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:18,775
So I had a full-time job in the day.

548
00:34:19,575 --> 00:34:21,156
But I did it because this was an opportunity

549
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:22,036
and I really wanted it.

550
00:34:22,517 --> 00:34:25,518
And also, I don't need work-life balance

551
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:26,698
and don't follow my example.

552
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,039
I don't sleep much.

553
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:32,214
So I did it and I got that job and I performed fairly well.

554
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:33,635
I had pretty good evaluations.

555
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:36,937
So when the time came for the coordinator of the level design program,

556
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:38,978
because this was a level design program to step down,

557
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:43,081
they looked at who had really good evaluations and they offered it to two of us.

558
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:48,184
The first person declined and I accepted, except with an asterisk.

559
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:52,067
I love level design. I was a game designer when projects were really small.

560
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,208
So when you did everything, you weren't specialized at all.

561
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:57,491
I did AI and UI and level design and mission design and name it, I did it.

562
00:34:57,571 --> 00:35:01,494
Economy design, things that narrative, things that on the chart now people are

563
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:04,516
surprised that the same person can do them.

564
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,199
This is just that's another problem of the industry that I won't go into.

565
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,161
But you can do that and you can do all these things.

566
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:13,243
Basically, for me, I approach game design no matter what, like telling a story,

567
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:14,925
whether it's economy design or narrative design.

568
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:15,945
So I just leverage skills.

569
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:20,649
So what happened is I wanted to teach, I wanted to have a game design program.

570
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:21,550
They didn't have one.

571
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,033
And they said that they were not willing to hire someone to create the curriculum.

572
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:25,913
So I said, okay, I will.

573
00:35:27,114 --> 00:35:28,395
But I didn't study education.

574
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:30,417
I didn't even know what a curriculum looked like.

575
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:33,019
And they said, how are you going to do this?

576
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,002
And I said, well, I'm going to approach it the same way I approach game design.

577
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,946
I look at games, I reverse engineer, I write my documents, I proceed,

578
00:35:41,126 --> 00:35:43,768
we make mistakes, we iterate, and then we'll have something that works.

579
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,170
It's easy, right?

580
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:45,951
No, it's not.

581
00:35:46,031 --> 00:35:48,852
It's hard, but the thought process behind it is easy.

582
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:54,576
So the director said, fine, we'll give you an example curriculum.

583
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:55,496
This is what it looks like.

584
00:35:56,317 --> 00:35:56,597
See ya.

585
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:02,221
Six months later, I booked a meeting, and he was surprised to see me.

586
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,543
I had a curriculum for a game design program.

587
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:08,051
because I spent the time to do it.

588
00:36:08,692 --> 00:36:10,652
He was surprised, he thought he would never see me again.

589
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,573
That was the end of that.

590
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:14,854
But what happened is he looked at it,

591
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:17,035
I actually put effort, I didn't, I'm not,

592
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:19,576
at this point I think I had five years of experience

593
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:21,256
in the industry, so I didn't take it upon myself.

594
00:36:21,777 --> 00:36:26,359
I got a lot of people to come and consult, and we worked on it together, and I credited them for it.

595
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:30,520
And technically I had all the language wrong, but the work was there.

596
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,762
He assigned me a technical writer for a week, she helped me fix it, and we had a program.

597
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:39,784
I pitched it to the Ministry of Education, I prepared for weeks, I was sweating bullets.

598
00:36:40,084 --> 00:36:43,045
They asked me the most basic questions you could imagine, like, what is game?

599
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:50,086
So they accepted it because, you know, this is my expertise,

600
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,568
and the part that they see as the needed skills,

601
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:55,709
they don't know if I have it or not, they see end results.

602
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:59,171
And all of a sudden, I became a coordinator,

603
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,072
in addition to becoming a designer,

604
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,492
in addition to becoming a teacher,

605
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:04,353
in addition to becoming a shipping agent,

606
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,094
in addition of becoming a graphic web designer.

607
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:10,775
And now, tomorrow, if I want it to be something else,

608
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:13,356
all I have to do is look at the skills that I already have.

609
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:16,977
Oh, did I mention I was also the co-founder

610
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:18,457
of the Montreal Independent Game Awards,

611
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:20,638
which is a festival, so I'm also an event planner.

612
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:23,899
And the skills that I needed to learn

613
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:25,319
that I didn't have as a game designer

614
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:27,780
to become an event planner were actually really small,

615
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,020
because planning events is very similar

616
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,381
to planning a game or, you know, leading a team.

617
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:35,622
So who you are is really who you want to be.

618
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:37,142
Don't let titles stop you.

619
00:37:41,332 --> 00:37:42,852
I'm not sure what to say after that.

620
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:51,795
When Henrik wanted titles for the slide for, you know,

621
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:55,936
Say What You Do, a few years ago I just started saying,

622
00:37:55,996 --> 00:37:57,196
just put down Game Designer.

623
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:59,017
Just put that down.

624
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:03,018
Because, you know, I've been a CEO.

625
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:05,579
I was a vice president of Disney.

626
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:11,414
whatever. There's like a hundred of them, so it's not as big a deal as it seems.

627
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:21,343
I've done art. You can actually go on Spotify right now and stream my folk music album I put

628
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:31,512
out in 1999. Like, for real, it's out there. You know, when I was a kid, my parents and my family

629
00:38:31,912 --> 00:38:34,235
used to say, oh, you'll grow up and be a writer and a teacher.

630
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:38,204
I think I actually did end up doing both those things.

631
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:45,930
The reason why I make games is because it lets me do everything.

632
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:54,364
I make games because it lets me do art, it lets me play with math, I can do some programming,

633
00:38:54,925 --> 00:39:00,907
I can sometimes write the soundtrack music, I get to read about and then talk about ethics

634
00:39:00,987 --> 00:39:06,550
and philosophy and try to persuade people in the industry to pay attention to ethics.

635
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:10,052
Not being so successful on that front, but I keep trying.

636
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:18,660
I get to work and help manage communities.

637
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,363
The list goes on and on and on.

638
00:39:22,384 --> 00:39:27,328
And in the end, to me, it all ends up being wrapped up in Game Designer,

639
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:32,814
because it's just aspects of the job, one way or another.

640
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:41,535
I probably, you know, if I made a large enough pile of money, I have to admit, I'd probably

641
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:44,277
get in a van and go tour the country with an acoustic guitar.

642
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:54,645
But I mean, literally, my degree, the thing that I left behind to go make Ultima Online

643
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:57,046
was actually a Master of Fine Arts in writing poetry.

644
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:05,330
I think, you know, the who are you thing is really that all of us are many people.

645
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:10,233
We're different people depending on who we're talking to, we're different people depending

646
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:11,894
on the situations we're put in.

647
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:22,440
And the key to it is really to not stand still, to keep looking for new ways to dig into yourself

648
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,622
and new ways to dig into the world around you.

649
00:40:26,611 --> 00:40:29,772
and find fresh new combinations.

650
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:33,352
Oh my God, I guess people are match three puzzles.

651
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:36,553
Yeah, I mean, see?

652
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:38,913
So that's, yeah, game designer, yeah.

653
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:46,255
The path we travel is very weird.

654
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:52,296
And what I meant with you are not your job description

655
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,396
is your job description is.

656
00:40:54,989 --> 00:41:00,652
or your career is that I'm still the little fat kid, or rather tall fat kid, who just

657
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:08,176
got out of that jock hole I was living in and making something a lot different than

658
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:09,837
what they could even imagine.

659
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:15,160
So you know, we're different things, we're amazing beings.

660
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,604
But we also have friends, local and international friends, and we meet through a multitude of

661
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:21,984
channels.

662
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:28,064
And, you know, we hang out on Twitter and we meet on, we like each other's posts on Instagram and

663
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:36,208
put bunny ears on each other on different types of snap chattery apps.

664
00:41:36,988 --> 00:41:42,090
And many times we prefer the company of others who are not game developers, but we all

665
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:46,972
build our own networks to get by and...

666
00:41:49,346 --> 00:41:53,828
feel safe, feel strong, and grow as people.

667
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:57,049
And I think Rafe, Raph, I'm sorry.

668
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:01,130
I take Rafe particularly from non-Americans.

669
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,611
It is a common nickname, actually.

670
00:42:04,712 --> 00:42:06,312
But I'll try with Raph.

671
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:09,813
You'll see why in just a second.

672
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,235
So and of course, we meet at GDC,

673
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:15,816
and we listen to colleagues, friends, or total strangers

674
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:16,596
opening their hearts.

675
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:19,574
to share hard-earned experiences.

676
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:22,916
Most of us have support networks like this.

677
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:26,277
And I know that Raf had input.

678
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,258
Do any of you know my name?

679
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:29,939
Like my actual name?

680
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:33,221
No?

681
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:41,065
Rafael Ricardo Coster Villanueva.

682
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:43,366
Soy Latino.

683
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:52,103
The familia puertorriqueña, my family is Puerto Rican on my mom's side, nobody has a clue.

684
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:53,724
Nobody knows that.

685
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:59,490
Raff Coster sounds like some kind of, you know, some Dutch-German, which is in there,

686
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,973
and like I'm an 8th Irish too and whatever.

687
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:04,876
I grew up.

688
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:11,432
in New York, Massachusetts, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee,

689
00:43:11,812 --> 00:43:17,676
Peru, Barbados, Haiti, and Maryland before the age of 18.

690
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:22,760
So I really hate it when somebody says,

691
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,720
where are you from?

692
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:31,205
I, there's this thing called third culture kid,

693
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:34,868
which is people like me, and there's probably a bunch of you

694
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:35,608
here, actually.

695
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:46,916
We are the people who grow up without living in any one culture long enough to feel as it is your own.

696
00:43:48,357 --> 00:44:00,880
Like, yes, I have an American passport, but I had lived, like, in raw time, before I was 18, I did not grow up American.

697
00:44:02,258 --> 00:44:03,979
I went to a British school system.

698
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,461
I grew up speaking other languages.

699
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:10,544
I completely missed the Ness.

700
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:12,946
Like just skipped it.

701
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:15,088
It wasn't a thing, right?

702
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:21,873
And you know, that can leave you feeling anchor-less sometimes, right?

703
00:44:23,178 --> 00:44:26,719
on the negative side. On the positive side, it can make you feel like you live everywhere

704
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:33,401
and like all cultures are wine in different bottles, right? It can leave you feeling like

705
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:38,662
there's profound similarities and that the similarities are far bigger than the differences.

706
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:50,225
When I got into games, it was, and specifically when I got into games, it was online games and

707
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:50,825
back then,

708
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,162
Not that many people were online, and it was a crazy kind of a melting pot.

709
00:44:56,783 --> 00:44:58,223
There were all sorts of people.

710
00:44:58,924 --> 00:45:03,586
One of my friends on one of the early text mods was one of the world's top experts in

711
00:45:03,626 --> 00:45:04,246
grasshoppers.

712
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:12,590
You'd meet people, because it was a text mod, another player was blind, but he could play

713
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,112
a game with a screen reader, even back then in the early 90s.

714
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:26,325
When I got into the game industry, that sense of shared experience of this games and game

715
00:45:26,345 --> 00:45:29,586
playing being a common culture was important.

716
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:40,689
But not just the larger game, the game playing culture, but the game making culture turned

717
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:43,350
out to be a family for me.

718
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:49,342
The most impactful thing probably in my whole career

719
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:54,405
was not a job, it was not a game title.

720
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:59,528
It was when one of my bosses at the time, Gordon Walton,

721
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:01,409
he called me into his office to do a one-on-one

722
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:03,631
because he'd just become the manager of the team

723
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:06,052
and he said, hey, so how are things going?

724
00:46:06,092 --> 00:46:06,932
What are you up to?

725
00:46:06,952 --> 00:46:09,154
I said, I'm working, you should know that, you're my boss.

726
00:46:10,054 --> 00:46:13,716
And he said, oh, well, are you happy here?

727
00:46:15,018 --> 00:46:17,639
I was like, there are other places?

728
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:21,020
Yeah, no, there's this whole industry out there.

729
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,120
Oh, they don't know who I am.

730
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,900
That's ridiculous.

731
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,701
He said, what are you talking about?

732
00:46:25,361 --> 00:46:26,381
Of course they know who you are.

733
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:29,822
No, nobody's ever tried to recruit me.

734
00:46:30,343 --> 00:46:31,963
People here won't promote me.

735
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,244
I don't think anybody cares about anything I say or do,

736
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:36,485
honestly, you know?

737
00:46:37,205 --> 00:46:39,085
And he said, wow, what are you doing next week?

738
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:42,587
And I said, working.

739
00:46:42,747 --> 00:46:43,487
You should know this.

740
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:44,347
You're my boss.

741
00:46:45,919 --> 00:46:46,840
And he said, no, you're not.

742
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,301
And he bought me a plane ticket.

743
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:54,063
And he flew the two of us to Oregon,

744
00:46:55,204 --> 00:46:57,285
where Chris Crawford was holding a game design

745
00:46:57,325 --> 00:46:58,365
retreat at his house.

746
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:02,287
And he sat me down in front of this house,

747
00:47:02,507 --> 00:47:06,610
next to Steve Moretzky, Noah Falstein, Bob Bates,

748
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:14,233
Brian Moriarty, and said, this is your group.

749
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:18,482
These are your peers, these are the people

750
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:23,803
that think the way you do, that love games the way you do.

751
00:47:25,044 --> 00:47:31,006
And that's why this is my 20th or whatever consecutive GDC.

752
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:37,127
Because frankly, those, the execs at whatever,

753
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,748
they come and go, right?

754
00:47:40,728 --> 00:47:42,829
But I still have dinner with those guys every year.

755
00:47:43,418 --> 00:47:46,241
Right? Because yeah, the business people, they make their pile of money,

756
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:51,586
they leave and it's just as well. Right?

757
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:54,749
But these people, right,

758
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,453
that's, you know, that's the family.

759
00:47:59,513 --> 00:48:02,175
That's what actually makes the difference through all the shit.

760
00:48:03,356 --> 00:48:04,638
Cause there's plenty of shit.

761
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:15,039
I'm going to have to cut it a little bit short.

762
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:16,761
I'm sorry for cutting in now.

763
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:20,645
We're just running a little bit short on time.

764
00:48:21,686 --> 00:48:24,649
I'd like to mention that yesterday I had a dinner with

765
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:32,554
my peers, my friends from Iron Storm in Dallas, where we made an Akronox, and it was a beautiful,

766
00:48:32,654 --> 00:48:39,679
beautiful thing to get five people together after 20, almost 20 years, together every year at GDC.

767
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:48,965
Those are my people. That's why I wasn't at the Nordic party. Suck it. I want to touch on

768
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:54,748
organization a little bit, because I think it's very important.

769
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,501
For the long-term health and sanity of our industry,

770
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:02,663
I firmly believe we game developers need to make deeper efforts

771
00:49:02,743 --> 00:49:04,404
in order to improve our working conditions.

772
00:49:05,424 --> 00:49:07,065
We have seen a terrible year of layoffs.

773
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:09,986
We have seen studios shut down or decimated by forces

774
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:11,727
seemingly beyond our control.

775
00:49:12,928 --> 00:49:15,049
Our business is very cyclical.

776
00:49:16,129 --> 00:49:19,791
Companies might need to adjust to handle shifting circumstances,

777
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:23,873
but the effect of those adjustments, that are often called layoffs,

778
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:28,026
end up on the shoulders of game workers and their families.

779
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:34,491
So can we just do a real quick, and this seems severely disrespectful,

780
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:40,576
but a quick panel thought on the recent year, what it means for the future

781
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:42,378
and how it can be combated.

782
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:43,899
That was hard to say.

783
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:44,740
That was easy to write.

784
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,582
Combated. How we can fight it.

785
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:50,504
Anyone?

786
00:49:52,006 --> 00:49:52,426
I can start.

787
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,084
Okay, so like I said, I'm the baby on this panel.

788
00:49:57,324 --> 00:49:59,386
I have not been in the industry for that long.

789
00:49:59,607 --> 00:50:06,494
But I entered the industry after, I'm not even going to say, but the thing about ethics

790
00:50:06,534 --> 00:50:11,259
in game journalism, I entered the industry like knowing that there

791
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:16,440
happy in series of layoffs, I entered the industry after knowing that this place is

792
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:22,902
unstable and basically just bananas. How does anything ever even get made in games?

793
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:32,384
And so I know that there is this anxiety that comes with making games and I think the thing that

794
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:38,125
keeps us going is that element of solidarity. We plan, we know that these things are going to

795
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:38,725
happen and we

796
00:50:39,305 --> 00:50:41,886
plan for them, we try to make contingencies.

797
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:45,447
And I'm, okay, I'm gonna keep this short.

798
00:50:45,787 --> 00:50:49,167
I'm also an elder millennial, so I love social media.

799
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:53,868
And I think that being able to hear these stories

800
00:50:53,908 --> 00:50:56,289
and speak to the people who are directly experienced,

801
00:50:56,869 --> 00:50:59,489
experiencing these things is really important

802
00:50:59,529 --> 00:51:02,550
for us being aware of what's going on in our industry

803
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,270
and being able to connect to groups that can.

804
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:09,046
help us support each other is really, really important.

805
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:12,529
So I guess for the future,

806
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,991
I want to see more of those connections being made.

807
00:51:15,091 --> 00:51:19,175
I want to see us be able to connect

808
00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:22,517
and strengthen those connections as we make them.

809
00:51:22,778 --> 00:51:23,999
Because I think ultimately,

810
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,320
it's one of those situations where

811
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,242
a rising tide lifts all boats.

812
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:30,284
We need to be able to support each other

813
00:51:30,344 --> 00:51:32,766
and know that when other people are suffering

814
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:34,367
and be able to help them alleviate that.

815
00:51:35,107 --> 00:51:37,309
and that's what's going to keep us all together.

816
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:41,791
Can I add something?

817
00:51:43,212 --> 00:51:46,434
Really quickly, most of us are good people

818
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:47,674
who care about others.

819
00:51:47,915 --> 00:51:49,275
That's been my experience, every company.

820
00:51:49,295 --> 00:51:50,576
I've worked at five different companies,

821
00:51:51,036 --> 00:51:51,797
most of us are good.

822
00:51:52,797 --> 00:51:55,659
Make a concerted effort to identify the people

823
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,340
who care about others, who are not here

824
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,821
only for the paycheck or the bonus,

825
00:52:00,642 --> 00:52:03,463
and help them in any way that you can.

826
00:52:04,352 --> 00:52:06,433
and build trust between each other,

827
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:09,214
and identify the people who are not that.

828
00:52:10,155 --> 00:52:11,435
Our industry is very finite.

829
00:52:11,655 --> 00:52:13,316
We cannot have infinite jobs.

830
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,817
So why are we accommodating people

831
00:52:15,857 --> 00:52:17,258
who only care about themselves?

832
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:21,579
We have a problem with who we promote

833
00:52:21,779 --> 00:52:22,800
to leadership positions.

834
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,541
Most of our directors are actually dictators.

835
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:27,642
And we need to stop that.

836
00:52:28,302 --> 00:52:29,363
Who is more powerful?

837
00:52:29,943 --> 00:52:32,764
One director, or everyone under him combined?

838
00:52:33,661 --> 00:52:35,942
I said him, I meant them, sorry.

839
00:52:36,842 --> 00:52:37,022
Who?

840
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,723
A director cannot do anything if we're united.

841
00:52:41,964 --> 00:52:43,704
So identify the good people, please.

842
00:52:44,624 --> 00:52:47,965
Form a strong partnership, and then we have power.

843
00:52:48,946 --> 00:52:50,786
Otherwise, we're complicit.

844
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:52,467
Thank you.

845
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:01,210
So the path forward.

846
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:05,243
In our industry of joy, it's crooked and winding,

847
00:53:05,523 --> 00:53:08,604
and we frequently find ourselves in forks in the path.

848
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:13,206
Our choices matter, and our landscape is ever shifting.

849
00:53:14,387 --> 00:53:18,449
From my view, the business of joy is a magical place,

850
00:53:19,689 --> 00:53:21,270
but not all magic is good for us.

851
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,271
Empathy, curiosity, and compassion

852
00:53:24,811 --> 00:53:28,033
are our most transferable skills, so please let's use them.

853
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:32,469
We will close this panel now with a few choice words from our panelists.

854
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:34,191
Thank you so much.

855
00:53:36,692 --> 00:53:38,013
Those were my choice words.

856
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:50,701
Innovation happens outside of what we already know.

857
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:56,265
And new audiences and new technology are the two kind of places we can look to innovate.

858
00:53:59,899 --> 00:54:04,483
Underrepresented people have a hard time in our industry.

859
00:54:06,985 --> 00:54:09,868
There are real problems that we can all work together to solve

860
00:54:09,908 --> 00:54:13,451
and be curious about why they're happening and have clear eyes

861
00:54:14,572 --> 00:54:17,915
and look at how they happen and fix them together.

862
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,597
But there is something else that is true,

863
00:54:20,637 --> 00:54:24,761
and I'm sorry to everyone who's not underrepresented to break this news to you.

864
00:54:28,114 --> 00:54:31,656
If you have a unique perspective that has not been explored by the industry yet,

865
00:54:31,696 --> 00:54:37,279
and if you manage to build a degree of expertise by going through a lot of shit,

866
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,062
your ideas are probably more valuable than those of your peers.

867
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:49,386
Because you are the one who's going to do something that is new and opening up a new audience.

868
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:53,428
It's not fair. It's true though.

869
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:01,311
Okay, so as probably one of those people,

870
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,652
like I've, there's been so many times

871
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:06,014
where I've been the one, like fill in the blank

872
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:08,376
whatever you want to say in the meeting room

873
00:55:08,476 --> 00:55:09,957
or in the studio or in my team.

874
00:55:10,537 --> 00:55:15,561
So, and I think that one thing

875
00:55:15,581 --> 00:55:17,402
that we're starting to realize now

876
00:55:17,562 --> 00:55:20,064
is that those people have always been there

877
00:55:20,724 --> 00:55:22,846
and the face of the industry is not your.

878
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,293
Sorry, cis-haired white dudes, but it's not just you.

879
00:55:27,614 --> 00:55:32,337
And so I think it's important to recognise that and to lift those people

880
00:55:32,438 --> 00:55:34,439
up because we've always been here.

881
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:39,203
And sometimes doing that will mean, actually not sometimes, basically every time you do that,

882
00:55:39,223 --> 00:55:41,605
that means you're challenging an existing norm.

883
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:47,330
And it can be scary to challenge an existing norm.

884
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,494
So be brave, do those things, like, you know, amplify those people and.

885
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:58,574
That's, I think, what we need to do to make us all collectively better.

886
00:55:58,594 --> 00:56:01,675
So, yeah, that's what I got.

887
00:56:05,016 --> 00:56:07,757
For me, games have always been about connecting.

888
00:56:08,938 --> 00:56:10,998
Connecting people, connecting ideas.

889
00:56:12,379 --> 00:56:16,120
They're the things that I would hand out to my classmates at recess

890
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,220
because I didn't speak their language well enough,

891
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,741
but we could do that together.

892
00:56:21,483 --> 00:56:26,727
And to me, the industry and then the colleagues and the rest are about connecting.

893
00:56:27,728 --> 00:56:33,072
I think we're always just stronger when we come to understand one another

894
00:56:33,112 --> 00:56:35,193
and understand our similarities and differences.

895
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:38,616
So that to me is at the heart of this.

896
00:56:38,716 --> 00:56:39,957
It's at the heart of what we do.

897
00:56:41,638 --> 00:56:46,441
So, you know, I guess I'd just say go out there and go do that.

898
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:50,970
Another point?

899
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:51,811
Yeah, if you...

900
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:52,852
We've got time.

901
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:53,753
Oh, we've got...

902
00:56:54,253 --> 00:56:54,513
Okay.

903
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:55,534
Three more minutes.

904
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:58,317
I did want to mention something, a thought that I had before.

905
00:56:59,078 --> 00:57:01,179
Not an ending statement, but as a clarification.

906
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,703
I was very privileged throughout my career.

907
00:57:04,903 --> 00:57:09,487
I was given a lot of opportunities and I was able to fill them and get these jobs.

908
00:57:09,747 --> 00:57:12,970
I wasn't implying that all you have to do is work hard and things will be showered your

909
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,170
way.

910
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,731
Everyone's situation is different.

911
00:57:15,872 --> 00:57:19,313
What I was implying is that nothing is stopping you from acquiring skills.

912
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:20,974
You don't need to have that.

913
00:57:21,374 --> 00:57:26,576
If, sorry, you don't need, there are no barriers to acquiring the skills if you know where

914
00:57:26,596 --> 00:57:26,876
to look.

915
00:57:26,936 --> 00:57:32,418
So reach out if you're, damn, that is a terrible thing to say because it's absolutely not true.

916
00:57:33,898 --> 00:57:36,739
Can I reset and start over?

917
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:37,560
Got it.

918
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:42,721
You're not what you studied.

919
00:57:43,523 --> 00:57:45,304
assuming that you even had the privilege to study.

920
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:48,226
You have a lot of potential.

921
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:51,328
However, not everyone's privilege is equal.

922
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:54,490
So be mindful of that and keep just trying

923
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,491
to push a little bit more.

924
00:57:56,352 --> 00:57:57,292
That's it, thank you.

925
00:57:58,073 --> 00:57:59,394
Can I add one more thing to that?

926
00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:02,135
The most inspiring advice anyone ever gave me

927
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:06,358
in my career was when I said that because,

928
00:58:06,378 --> 00:58:08,360
like I was complaining to a friend that,

929
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:16,534
someone was getting ahead who didn't deserve it and I saw someone else who really deserved it

930
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:20,916
but who was a woman not getting ahead and I said that she will get ahead in the end,

931
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:26,359
like in the end it will catch up to him and my friend said to me like no it won't, he will fail

932
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:32,983
up and he will fail up and up and up and you need to set different targets to compare and like.

933
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:42,988
My life is really easy. My life has been really easy. My career in the games industry has been pretty easy compared to everyone else who I graduated with.

934
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:52,972
So when I compare my opportunities to the guys that I work with, I get frustrated. But when I compare my opportunities to like many other people I know, I realize how easy it has been.

935
00:58:52,992 --> 00:59:01,657
And it has to be about something like it's about can I achieve what I want to achieve and what I'm capable of in a realistic framework of what's possible.

936
00:59:06,397 --> 00:59:13,484
Okay, we're coming up on 59.8 on my clock here, so I guess we don't have time for questions

937
00:59:13,524 --> 00:59:15,526
from the audience, even though we would love them.

938
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:21,653
I'm trying to see any time if there's any police here.

939
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:24,379
Oh no.

940
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,040
OK, so let's wrap this up.

941
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,380
Thank you so much for coming.

942
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:31,662
If you do want to grade this or give us some kind of

943
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:35,043
feedback on the website, I'm not fully sure how that works.

944
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:39,745
Please remember that Tom Hall and Nicole Lewis, who had to

945
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:43,326
be yanked out of here on very short notice, will get tagged

946
00:59:43,526 --> 00:59:44,166
if you do that.

947
00:59:46,447 --> 00:59:46,907
Give us any.

948
00:59:49,772 --> 00:59:57,584
bad feedback. So please give feedback, but be mindful so we don't splash our stuff on

949
00:59:57,684 --> 01:00:00,989
other people. Thank you so much.
