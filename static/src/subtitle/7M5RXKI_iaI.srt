1
00:00:03,383 --> 00:00:06,225
I'm also very glad to be moderating this panel on the

2
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:08,285
legends of computer gaming.

3
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:10,646
Because the great thing about being a moderator is that you

4
00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:12,807
can get fame by association.

5
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:16,789
And it's a real privilege to be with these giants in

6
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,070
computer game history and computer game future.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,991
And I'm really excited about the chance to interview these

8
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:24,712
gentlemen in front of you.

9
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:27,193
But I have to start off with some ground rules and just

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:31,275
point out that very obviously, no list of computer game

11
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,035
legends can ever be exhaustive.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,272
And if you know, we wanted to talk about people who possibly had done some of the most thought-provoking

13
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:42,854
games, if not most commercially successful, we would have to talk about Chris Crawford

14
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:46,316
and the contribution that he made to computer gaming.

15
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:49,698
And if we're going to talk about multiplayer gaming, we'd have to talk about Danielle

16
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:55,301
Berry and the push that she had from the very beginning, whether it was in Cartels and Cutthroats

17
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:59,723
or Mule or the Robot Rascals game or whatever.

18
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:03,385
There was always a concern with multiplayer gaming, way anticipating.

19
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:05,706
the idea of online gaming.

20
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:11,567
And if we were to talk about role-playing games, I think we'd have to insist that Lord

21
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,168
British would be a part of this picture.

22
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:17,569
So if we were to talk about strategy games in specific, we'd have to make Sid Meier a

23
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:18,929
part of this picture.

24
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:23,990
And I'm sure that each and every one of you could think of about three or four people

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,391
that you would like to have on this panel.

26
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:31,392
But if you have to start somewhere, this Hall of Fame starts way up here.

27
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:35,116
And I'm very pleased to be on here with Nolan Bushnell,

28
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,879
the video game pioneer.

29
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,740
Yes, very good.

30
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:51,303
Chris Roberts who most of you know because of the phenomenal success of the Wing Commander

31
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:57,748
series but a lot of people don't realize that even some of his games that get less attention

32
00:01:57,748 --> 00:02:03,293
like Times of Lore that pushed us towards some iconic interfaces and like Bad Blood

33
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:03,574
that

34
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:10,359
that was even pushing Richard in some of the areas of object-oriented programming and Strike

35
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:18,526
Commander that caused many people to upgrade to a 486 even if they eventually didn't like it.

36
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:29,735
And of course later on we'll talk about the wing commander syndrome and how it's killing the

37
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:30,636
industry.

38
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:40,812
And then, without a doubt, you know, the person who proved to us that shareware was viable

39
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:46,014
and wasn't second-tier minor league anymore, the person who proved to us that first-person

40
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:51,896
perspective was the real, logical way to immerse people as quickly as possible into games,

41
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:57,218
the person who is probably most responsible for giving us the id interface that gamers

42
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:01,059
complain about if it's not in everybody's first-person game.

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,292
without a doubt, and proven many times over again,

44
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:08,894
the world's foremost doom and quake player, John Romero.

45
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:20,440
So the ground rules are, no softball questions.

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,001
I'm going to try to ask some tough ones.

47
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:25,383
I'm going to try to bait some of these guys here.

48
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:37,149
And then later on we're going to go out Phil Donahue style into the audience of those few of you who got in the multimedia theater and we're going to give you a chance to ask questions and see if you can stump the panel.

49
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:44,378
So I'm looking forward to this time together and so without any further ado, let's move right along.

50
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:45,219
Nolan Bushnell.

51
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,013
A lot of people think of you as the founder of the video game industry, but basically

52
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:55,856
you really started making your bones in the coin-op industry, where you were substituting

53
00:03:55,856 --> 00:04:00,018
Space War and then Pong for pinball machines.

54
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:06,442
In fact, they say that not only was Atari Games really successful, but that you owned

55
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:11,305
your closest competitor, something called Key Games, and that sometimes those games

56
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:14,027
were delivered in the same truck with just the sign change.

57
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:14,567
Is that true?

58
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,409
It's absolutely true.

59
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:21,237
There were two major distributors in each town.

60
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:23,160
And we found that when we sold to one guy,

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,883
they wanted an exclusive.

62
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:27,907
And so I really didn't want the other guy selling

63
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:28,929
somebody else's game.

64
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:30,431
So I felt that I should have that, too.

65
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:38,846
I bet there's a lot of people here that wish they could own their top competitor.

66
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,546
So it was Atari games and Key games.

67
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:47,829
And then all of a sudden the console revolution came across and you let out in that with the 2600.

68
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,992
But the scuttlebutt is that there was a time where you were about to pull the plug on the

69
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,833
project and that Al Alcorn came in and talked you into going ahead.

70
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,214
And the rest was history.

71
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,415
It was actually before that.

72
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:04,917
The Pong was originally a dedicated chip.

73
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:08,763
It was an N-channel MOS chip.

74
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:13,865
And it just had all kinds of bugs in it and various things.

75
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,507
And that was when I almost pulled the plug.

76
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:21,870
And then, you know, it's funny that people think that

77
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,550
pioneering is easy.

78
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,993
But in fact, we couldn't sell the pawn game.

79
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:31,855
We went to all the toy companies, or the toy

80
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:33,696
distributors, retailers.

81
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:36,305
They said, no, it's too expensive,

82
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:38,667
because we were going to sell it at $99.

83
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,989
And then later on, we said, OK, we'll

84
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:44,151
go to the TV distribution.

85
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:46,773
And they didn't want it, because they said, gee,

86
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:48,574
we'll have to finance, and it looks like a fad.

87
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:52,097
And literally, we tried to market it

88
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:54,338
for almost three months.

89
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:55,439
Not a taker.

90
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,079
Not a taker.

91
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:02,224
And it wasn't until we happened to call the buyer, the sporting

92
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:03,985
goods buyer, at Sears and Roebuck.

93
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:10,784
And we called him, told him what he had.

94
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:11,465
He says, OK.

95
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:14,567
In the next morning, at 8 o'clock, he was on our

96
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:18,209
doorstep, said, how many can you build?

97
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:21,391
We thought, 25,000, maybe, standing on our head.

98
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:22,151
So we told him 75.

99
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:27,075
And he came back with an order for 150,000.

100
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:32,998
And as we say, the rest is history, except for one thing.

101
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:42,115
We had to price it before we had the foggiest clue about how much it cost to manufacture.

102
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:45,836
We also didn't have enough money to build it.

103
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:50,137
Other than that, there was no problem.

104
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:57,560
We just said, hey, in order to do this, we're going to need to get a line of credit.

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,000
He says, not to worry, Sears Bank.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,161
It was a partnership made in heaven.

107
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:06,966
So we pushed it through.

108
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:17,369
See, a lot of people don't realize that games on a TV is a really stupid idea.

109
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,749
And that the company started with $250,

110
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,370
not because I wanted it that way,

111
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,470
because nobody would invest.

112
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,891
They thought it was a stupid idea.

113
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,352
They confused the frivolity of

114
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:32,792
the activity with the frivolity.

115
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:39,293
of a business. They said, you know, how can you make money on fun? And this was a long

116
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:39,514
time ago.

117
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:44,221
Well, they're still asking that question today.

118
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,904
Exactly. Different reasons, Flo.

119
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:48,938
So since somebody took a chance on you, you took a chance on a

120
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:49,838
whole lot of people.

121
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:53,559
A lot of folks think that after you left Atari that Chuck E.

122
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,379
Cheese was your primary interest.

123
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,300
But you had like a half dozen high tech companies that you

124
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,480
lumped under the Catalyst Industries mark.

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,201
Actually, there were 17 in the Catalyst umbrella.

126
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,661
That's good.

127
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:07,461
Did any of them make money?

128
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:10,642
The one I watched, AndroBots, I don't think did.

129
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,982
AndroBot was a sore disappointment.

130
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:16,003
That was probably.

131
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:20,759
But you might not have explained to some of the younger folks what Anderbrotts did.

132
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,222
Anderbrott was a little guy that ran around and, you know, got you a beer and sang songs

133
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,122
and told jokes.

134
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:30,163
It was the idea of a personal robot.

135
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:37,946
And it was one of those things that I just, you know, you can't read Isaac Asimov without

136
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:41,828
thinking that there's going to be a robot in the future.

137
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:45,049
So I decided to build one.

138
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:50,468
the neat thing about it is we got going we got some of the

139
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:51,889
working

140
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:54,532
but the damn thing

141
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:54,652
uh...

142
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:56,153
was a mobile computer

143
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,335
and mobile computer but that time

144
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:00,137
in spin static electricity

145
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,018
environments

146
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,199
was not a pretty sight

147
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:08,344
because it's not the thing about it

148
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:09,985
syntax error or

149
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:10,846
a frozen

150
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:11,186
cursor

151
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:11,967
is one thing

152
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:21,053
that if you get frozen in a robot with FFFF, all of a sudden you're full speed right into

153
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:21,993
the wall.

154
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:28,436
In fact, in a robot lab that I was playing around with at Stanford, I actually saw an

155
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:34,999
end effector on a program bug thrown right through a cinder block wall.

156
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:35,739
You know, FFF, boom.

157
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:40,821
So robots were kind of an interesting thing.

158
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:45,888
It was one of those areas where we were trying to solve too many things,

159
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,749
power problems, static.

160
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:49,031
I mean, this was 1983, 84.

161
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:56,497
But more than that, we really got screwed by one of the big investment houses,

162
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:59,879
in which they agreed to raise all kinds of money for us.

163
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,023
Two days, the thing was totally oversold, totally oversold.

164
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:07,606
People were calling saying,

165
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,088
Nolan, can you get me stock? Can you get me stock?

166
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:14,840
And some executive at that unnamed jerky company

167
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,781
rolled over one day in the morning and said,

168
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:21,242
we don't want to do development stage companies anymore

169
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,602
and pulled the plug on it.

170
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:25,803
Not because of the sales thing, not because of the company,

171
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:28,063
because of the women fancy of an elephant.

172
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:30,424
So if you ever get in the stall with an elephant,

173
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:33,805
you've got to be careful because it can get rolled over on.

174
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:36,005
So what happened in that case is that

175
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:41,932
since everyone knew the company was oversold except must be something wrong

176
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,193
and it's sort of painted it

177
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,833
dried up the source of capital on the thing to him

178
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,733
had to sell it for

179
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,073
i had about

180
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:49,614
seventeen million dollars in the thing

181
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:50,134
sold for two

182
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:51,554
not a big deal

183
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:52,494
uh...

184
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:56,515
magna microwave uh... student

185
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:57,855
couple million now

186
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:58,155
uh...

187
00:10:58,155 --> 00:11:04,416
e-tech you guys all know that automobile navigation just sold to sony

188
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,737
for a couple hundred million i sold it to news corp

189
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:08,557
for 50, too soon, too fast.

190
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:12,518
That was when John Evans was there.

191
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:12,678
Pardon?

192
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:15,539
That was when John Evans was there.

193
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:15,639
Yeah.

194
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,900
E-Tech, there was quite a few of them.

195
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,941
Closed several real turkeys down though.

196
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:25,562
You know, certain things that look like they're a good idea.

197
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:30,124
We had an automatic color shade matcher called Iroh

198
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,725
in the cosmetics business, never go to there.

199
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,925
Technologists in the cosmetics business,

200
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:36,366
fish out of water, you don't want to do that.

201
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:40,468
It was some good fun.

202
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:44,993
Okay, well I've got to hit you with one embarrassing question before we move on to one of the others

203
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:47,896
and then we'll come back and let you talk about the exciting thing that you're doing

204
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:48,977
now in the games area.

205
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:55,925
But you know, I happened to be at the LA press conference that was part of the CDTV launch

206
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:56,425
and...

207
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,160
And basically, you made a very interesting statement there,

208
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,181
that I thought you might want to clarify before all these game

209
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:03,681
developers.

210
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,923
And that was that the educational potential

211
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:11,445
of the CDTV was sort of to make up to the world what you had

212
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:13,866
inflicted upon them with video games.

213
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,608
Well, CDTV was one of those things

214
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:22,390
where I consider it, on one way, a huge success.

215
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:31,436
Not in what you sold, but basically, I like to say that I proved for $8 million and in

216
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:41,379
eight months what it took Trip Hawkins $200 million in three years to sell.

217
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,420
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist that.

218
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:52,343
I actually still believe that if we look at

219
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,163
the future, that we control a lot of power in video games.

220
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:02,105
We control power to communicate.

221
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:06,267
We can focus attention.

222
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:09,569
We can do things dynamically and excitingly.

223
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:18,073
And I think that we, somewhere along the line, do always need

224
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:19,934
to give back.

225
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:24,319
to society, things that we have prospered by.

226
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:33,005
And I think that truly, we can and will solve the educational

227
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:34,526
crisis in the world.

228
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:39,250
And that in some ways, if we call it ET, not

229
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,792
extraterrestrial, but educational technology,

230
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:46,535
I really believe it's going to have more power in the world

231
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,575
than biotechnology.

232
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:58,460
And I believe that the people sitting in this room have a lot of that power.

233
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,102
And that if we can train people 100, 200, 300 times faster and more efficiently through

234
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:09,665
using the tools that we take for granted, I think we're going to really change the nature

235
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:11,526
of the world.

236
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:14,527
And because right now we are

237
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,820
seeing people holding on to the future by the tips of their fingers.

238
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:26,883
And that's because the technology we have is so powerful, so wonderful, such an enabler

239
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:28,824
for a great life.

240
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:34,186
And yet it's held by the priesthood and not by the congregation.

241
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:41,468
And I think that it's our goal, or it should be, to steel ourselves for creating the tools

242
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:45,150
by which we permeate technology into the masses.

243
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:48,934
And if we do that, then we've really accomplished something.

244
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:49,055
Anyway.

245
00:14:49,055 --> 00:15:00,522
Well, at this point I want to move to Chris Roberts.

246
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:03,764
And if we had the slide from my computer up,

247
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:06,306
it would be a quote from my favorite review

248
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,508
of one of Chris's products.

249
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,650
I don't think that would be a quote for one of John's products.

250
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,371
Normally you would think of it as a quote for one of John's products.

251
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:21,273
But long, long ago in the bad blood days,

252
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:25,415
one of our reviewers took exception of one of those skinks-like puzzles

253
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:30,157
where in this case you had to kill this little turtle-like creature

254
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:33,839
and get the blood out of it vampirically in order to survive.

255
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,821
And I guess this was the nascent animal activist in Charles

256
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:40,122
and he thought it was morally reprehensible.

257
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:45,574
And I know the folks at Origin were quite upset at us for a long time over that review.

258
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:50,002
But I want to talk to you about some of the more exciting things.

259
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:50,723
For example...

260
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:57,000
I remember when you first came over from England and you were working on Times of Lore and

261
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,904
Richard was trying to describe the Times of Lore interface to us and he was all excited

262
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:07,109
and he made the mistake of calling it a Nintendo-like interface and saying that we're changing everything

263
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:12,534
to that, you know, and it just, you know, panicked those of us who equated the Nintendo

264
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:16,457
style game with being shallower than the PC game.

265
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:21,576
And yet, when we saw the game, it was extremely deep,

266
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:22,497
and it surprised us.

267
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:26,018
And we did notice that the influence went

268
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,019
on toward iconic interfaces.

269
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,740
What do you think the most important contribution,

270
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,021
whether it was in interface, or whether it

271
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:37,882
was an interactive sound, or whether it was in object

272
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:41,364
definition in games, what is the most important contribution

273
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:42,964
in all your tenure at Origin, do you think?

274
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:45,445
Well, I mean, I

275
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:50,874
The biggest thing I always try and do in everything I do is I want to immerse the player in the

276
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:56,975
environment and so I think that what I'm proudest of with Wing Commander, what I've done in

277
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,656
the past, is any time that I sort of remove the feeling of interface.

278
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:05,258
So, you know, like when it's in Wing Commander instead of, you know, you going over and going

279
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:10,179
on file and save, you click on a bunk bed to save or you, you know, click on the airlock

280
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:11,979
door to exit the game.

281
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:15,340
And I mean I guess the coolest thing from my standpoint is...

282
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,326
from putting it into something like Wing Commander and then

283
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:23,650
seeing that sort of graphical immersive interface sort of

284
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,994
permutate other people's games, which is kind of cool.

285
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:28,836
But I mean, that's for me.

286
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,898
All I want to do is I want to build an experience that I get

287
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:33,861
lost in the world for two hours, 20 hours, 40 hours, and

288
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:35,823
have a good time.

289
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,845
And so I guess that's what I like the most.

290
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:46,908
I think your contributions to interface have been very important because I've seen it across, you know, lots of different game companies.

291
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:51,412
Just like John's contributions to interface have been very, very important at a later period.

292
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:57,036
There was one thing that you tried in Wing Commander, the first Wing Commander, I thought was extremely important.

293
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,913
and extremely significant.

294
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,234
And yet it turned out that when the gamers got hold of it,

295
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:05,736
it was something of a failure.

296
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,916
What were some of the reactions that you got from people

297
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,137
about the losing track in Wing Commander?

298
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:15,299
Well, I mean, the funny thing with interactive fiction

299
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,921
is that you have to give everybody choices

300
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:22,462
so they don't feel like they're constrained to any one path.

301
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:26,384
But the problem is that you spend, say, 50% of your time

302
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,522
on the paths that aren't the optimum paths in the game.

303
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,582
And then at the end of the day, you're there going, hey, did

304
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:32,582
you play down this track?

305
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:33,422
Did you do this?

306
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:34,203
Did you do this?

307
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:35,823
And everyone's like, no, I didn't.

308
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,424
And you're like, I just spent a year on that.

309
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:38,924
What's the deal?

310
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:42,725
And I think that it really came home to me when I was

311
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:45,425
sitting and I was talking to one of the dynamics guys about

312
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,385
The Rise of the Dragon.

313
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:47,886
And I was saying, yeah, I really loved it.

314
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,466
I played it all the way through.

315
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:50,867
And I did this, and I did this.

316
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,487
And he's like, oh, did you go to this level?

317
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:53,167
And did you do this?

318
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,507
And did you meet this character?

319
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:55,708
And I was like, no.

320
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,368
And he's like.

321
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:58,015
And he was heartbroken.

322
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:01,638
So I guess it's one of those necessary evils, because you

323
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:04,520
have to do it so you feel like you have a choice, and you

324
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,304
feel like the world reacts to what you do.

325
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:11,966
But you're also sitting there working on it, going, well, I

326
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:14,628
know about 50% or 60% of people aren't actually ever

327
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:17,811
going to experience this.

328
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:18,191
And I don't know.

329
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,233
I guess you need to do it so everyone feels happy about

330
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,794
they've gone the losing track.

331
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,516
They haven't gone the losing track, that is.

332
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:25,337
So necessary evil.

333
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,500
right but it seems like you shortened the losing track in

334
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,801
progressively aggressively

335
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:34,243
and of course with uh... filming that made it uh... very necessary

336
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:39,927
the great thing about the wing commander series uh... i thought was that it it

337
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:42,069
pushed upgrades at every new release of uh... you know

338
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:48,433
that is good uh... you know when you're in a magazine that's advertising driven

339
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:48,973
you know

340
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,243
But it's also good for the whole industry as a whole because people have a tendency

341
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:59,967
to buy more games when they buy new equipment because they want to find stuff that shows

342
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:06,912
it off. And certainly in the era of the Wing Commanders, the Wing Commanders showed off

343
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:13,897
new sound cards with Wing Commander 2. They certainly showed off new graphics cards with

344
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:18,961
Wing Commander 3, which is one of the few FMV games that's ever spoken well of.

345
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,876
And they showed Electronic Arts how to spend lots of money

346
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:23,516
in Wink-Man 4.

347
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:23,856
Oh, wow.

348
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:33,199
I mean, I will say that the process that got me there

349
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,219
is a long time ago.

350
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:36,820
You mentioned Bad Blood and Times of the Law.

351
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,141
So I came from England, and I was

352
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:40,481
used to programming on Commodore 64.

353
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:43,242
And back in those days in England, it was tape drive.

354
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,362
There was no disk drive.

355
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:46,603
So I was really proud about Times of the Law

356
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:47,823
because everything fit in 64K.

357
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,330
And there was this huge world and you ventured around.

358
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,731
And the game came out, and it came out over here.

359
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:57,793
And people didn't go, oh, well, it's really great because it

360
00:20:57,793 --> 00:20:58,633
can fit in 64K.

361
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:02,115
They went, well, it's cool and everything, but I'm playing

362
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:03,716
this other game, and it comes on four disks.

363
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:05,577
And it doesn't have as much of it.

364
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:08,778
And I was sitting there going, hmm, I don't know about that.

365
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:10,459
And about the same time, MicroProse came out with F19.

366
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:12,260
I remember going up to MicroProse because they

367
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,741
distributed our stuff over in Europe.

368
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,531
And they were showing me F19.

369
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:19,093
And I was like, man, this is the most incredible 3D

370
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:21,074
simulation I've ever seen.

371
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,976
Too bad it only runs at four frames a second on a 38625,

372
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:26,557
which back then was like a $10,000 machine.

373
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:29,079
No one's ever going to be impressed or like this, because

374
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,540
no one's got this machine.

375
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,621
And it comes out, and it's absolutely huge here.

376
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:36,884
And I'm sitting there, and I'm going, hmm, well, I guess

377
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:39,125
there's a reason not to compromise and everything.

378
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,367
So that's really what happened with Wing Commander.

379
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,108
I said, OK, well, screw it.

380
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:49,190
I'm going to use every single opportunity and tool I can get on the maximum available

381
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:56,073
hardware right now to make the gaming experience as good as possible because my personal belief

382
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:58,895
is that people aren't very objective about it.

383
00:21:58,895 --> 00:21:59,776
They're subjective.

384
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,657
They go, is this the best game I've seen?

385
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:04,898
And they don't go, oh, is this the best game I've seen that runs in 128K?

386
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:06,759
Or is this the best game I've seen in CGA?

387
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,161
They just go, is this the best game I've seen?

388
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:13,023
So after I sort of made that decision point in Wing Commander onwards was...

389
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,082
very much driven by, OK, let's make the best game possible,

390
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:19,583
no holds barred from there on.

391
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,784
Luckily, it seemed to work out.

392
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:25,886
In the creative process, as you were going from Times of War,

393
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,369
which you basically wrote virtually all yourself,

394
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:32,471
to Bad Blood, which you must have split off

395
00:22:32,471 --> 00:22:35,154
some of the programming on to the Wing Commander series,

396
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:38,156
where more and more things were being done by other people.

397
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:43,161
Can you describe for a little bit how your role changed

398
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,582
from game to game?

399
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:47,224
And is starting your own company some desire

400
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,346
to get back more hands on yourself?

401
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:52,571
Well, I mean, I think it is a design.

402
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:57,033
I mean, actually, the one sad thing about game development

403
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:59,214
nowadays is that in the old days, you could do everything

404
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:02,915
yourself, and you could totally control the look, the

405
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:03,295
feel, the sound.

406
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:05,135
You do the writing, you do the programming, you do the

407
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,236
artwork, you do the sound.

408
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:09,117
And it could be a one-man affair, and it could be an

409
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,957
absolute single vision.

410
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:14,018
And now, because of what everybody expects in terms of

411
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,479
the quality of the product, you just can't afford to do

412
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,539
that, I mean, it would take you.

413
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:20,578
20 years and by the time it came out it would be old technology.

414
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:25,722
And so, you know, the sad thing is that you don't get to have that 100% level of control

415
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:26,302
over the product.

416
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:30,685
I mean, the good thing is that you get to work with a lot of other really talented people

417
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:34,488
and they, you know, in a lot of ways make your work better.

418
00:23:34,488 --> 00:23:39,871
So I mean, I guess at the end of the day my role sort of moves more to being creative

419
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:44,214
shepherd and sort of evangelist of exactly how it's going to work and, you know, more

420
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,557
away from the actual technician that's building all the building blocks of it.

421
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:52,849
And I guess what I tried doing with Digital Anvil is I have

422
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,250
felt a little bit recently that in the huge industry

423
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,031
expansion that it's kind of gotten away from a little bit

424
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:01,832
of that sort of core vision on how products are built.

425
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:05,773
And so what I'm trying to do with Digital Anvil is have a

426
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:08,654
company that focuses on building great products, has

427
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:12,655
less people on the teams, and allows the team the time they

428
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,656
need to do the product and gives them the support they

429
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,316
need to do it.

430
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:17,677
So we'll see if it works.

431
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:17,797
But.

432
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:19,187
I mean, it's a good theory.

433
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:21,388
It's something that me and a bunch of my peer group

434
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:23,730
have been talking about for a long time.

435
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,111
And we figured, OK, time to put a push it up.

436
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:27,713
Well, I'm pretty excited about what you told me

437
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,254
about the new project.

438
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:30,895
And we're going to come back to it later

439
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:34,418
and let you talk as much as you feel like you can about that.

440
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:37,100
We want to move on to John here.

441
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:45,106
I don't know how many people know, but John was at origin

442
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:47,908
and worked with Chuck on 2400 AD.

443
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:48,228
And

444
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,802
and moved over. And actually, you know, Chris Roberts stole the idea of Wing Commander from

445
00:24:54,802 --> 00:24:59,504
Paul Neurath and John when they did Space Rogue, which was sort of, you know, Wing Commander

446
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:07,307
with tunnels. But anyway, then John moved from there to Softdisk Corporation where he

447
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:13,030
was virtually doing a product, like a product of the month, weren't you, with Softdisk?

448
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,312
Every month. We had to, well, I started out...

449
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:28,469
After I left Origin, which was in June of 88, I got there to work on the, was it, Apple II to Commodore 64 port of 2400 AD.

450
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:32,411
And while I was working on that, Paul Neuron...

451
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:39,096
So you reviewed the Apple II version and that one was cancelled, right?

452
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:43,018
No, well, no, the Apple II version came out. I don't know how many copies it sold.

453
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:45,860
It was a, I liked it, it was a fun game.

454
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:49,663
So I was doing my very first Commodore programming,

455
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:52,965
converting the Apple II version of 2400 AD

456
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:56,527
to the Commodore 64, which I had to learn pretty quickly.

457
00:25:56,527 --> 00:26:01,590
And it was probably three months through the conversion

458
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,871
when Paul Neroff really needed some help on Space Road.

459
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:08,253
And because he had to get the game done,

460
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:09,594
it had been going on too long.

461
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:13,196
So I was there to do the NPC code for him.

462
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,216
It ended up that.

463
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:23,503
He actually didn't use my code in the game because I left pretty soon after that to kind of co-found another company.

464
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:27,704
And he ended up getting someone else to program the NPC stuff.

465
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:37,008
But when I went on to the next company, it was a conversion house called Inside Out Software just down the road from Origin in New Hampshire.

466
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:44,230
And I worked on the Might and Magic 2 conversion of the Commodore 64, and I worked on various other ports.

467
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,530
And...

468
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:51,536
And I finally decided to leave Inside Out to go to Softdisk because it was an Apple II.

469
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:55,318
It was an Apple II magazine, but it also did PC work.

470
00:26:55,318 --> 00:27:00,541
And this was in 1988 where the Apple II market was really dying hard.

471
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:05,824
And I needed to actually learn the PC because it was the market.

472
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,045
So I just called up the president of the company.

473
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:12,227
I told him who I was and what I had worked on and stuff.

474
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:14,875
I told him I didn't know anything about the PC at all,

475
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,496
but I really want to learn how to program it.

476
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:18,456
And he's like, come on down.

477
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:21,277
So that was really cool that he let me come down

478
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:23,898
and just learn how to program the PC,

479
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:25,919
knowing nothing about it.

480
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,779
And while I was at Softdisk,

481
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,720
I was doing utility work

482
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,841
and some of my games I was porting to the PC,

483
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:37,562
and I had to get something done every single month.

484
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:41,523
And about a year and three months after...

485
00:27:42,221 --> 00:27:48,683
going to work at Softdisk, I was really tired of not actually making real commercial games.

486
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:54,185
I was doing these little month-long things. And I told them that I was going to leave

487
00:27:54,185 --> 00:28:00,147
and I was going to like apply at LucasArts and like actually get into making real games.

488
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:06,730
And so they said, okay, we'll start a monthly game disk.

489
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:11,039
We needed some people, we got a few people in there.

490
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
John Carmack was one of the guys that we got,

491
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,621
he had submitted some Apple II stuff.

492
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:18,182
And so we got him as a programmer,

493
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:20,763
we got Lane Roth, who was an Apple II guy

494
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:23,104
and I've worked with for a long time.

495
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:27,326
And Adrian Carmack was an intern, an art intern.

496
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:29,847
And so he got on the team.

497
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:32,869
And so we started doing games every single month.

498
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:37,271
And Tom Hall, who was a co-founder of Vid Software

499
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:37,931
and I and Storm.

500
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:46,339
He was in the Apple II department, and he wasn't having as much fun in there as he was coming in at night, helping design all of our games.

501
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:53,762
And we could use all the help that we could handle because we had to get these things done every single month, which is pretty hardcore.

502
00:28:53,762 --> 00:29:02,384
And so we made games every single month for about a year, and they're on the Hit Anthology on the vintage CD.

503
00:29:02,384 --> 00:29:06,885
Anyway, we were at Soft—we started this Gamers Edge thing.

504
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,103
and did some games for probably a few months when

505
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:16,545
Carmack did this really awesome technology demo thing

506
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:19,006
and left it on my uh... Tom and Carmack

507
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:21,988
stayed up really late at night and uh... did this

508
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:23,428
you know duplicate Super Mario 3

509
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,709
but on the PC

510
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:29,572
and they uh... put it on my desk and I came in and I saw it and I was just shocked and I

511
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:34,335
couldn't work for at least three hours because I've never seen anything like that on a PC before

512
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:36,636
and I knew that that was it we're out of here

513
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:41,481
and this is, we could, it was, it was pretty funny. You see

514
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:46,284
something like that and you just, you know, nothing like

515
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,085
this has been done before on a PC.

516
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:52,548
So wait a minute, before you were out of there, you know,

517
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:55,971
didn't you have sort of a fan club?

518
00:29:55,971 --> 00:30:00,614
Yes. There was a lot of things happening at the same time. You

519
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:02,515
know, he did the tech demo.

520
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:09,375
And at the same time, I had done some games that I had ported from the Apple II to the PC and it got published.

521
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:15,401
And I was getting these letters, you know, handwritten back then before email.

522
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:22,688
And I was getting these letters from, you know, supposedly a lot of people that liked this one game that I did.

523
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,711
And they're like, oh, I think I found a bug in your game.

524
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:26,492
Write me in my...

525
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,752
here's my address, my phone number, you know, please write.

526
00:30:29,752 --> 00:30:32,774
I'm 67 years old and, you know, all these different letters.

527
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:37,438
And, and, uh, I was reading a PC games article and it was

528
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:39,980
talking about cross, which was a shareware game that Scott

529
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,683
Miller did, and, uh, he had started Apogee and, um.

530
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:50,488
I was reading all about it and I got to the end of the article and I saw the address and

531
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:52,830
stuff and I was like, no, I know that address.

532
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:59,916
And I'm sitting there and I just like look up on the wall right next to me and I'm like,

533
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:00,136
no way.

534
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:06,502
And all the letters, like about eight of them, they're all different names but the address

535
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:08,323
was the same.

536
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:08,824
And I was like, no.

537
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:11,246
I thought I had a lot of fans.

538
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:13,613
So, I was, I was, oh I was, I went next.

539
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:21,942
Carmack said you were upset because you found out that it was one guy and it was a guy.

540
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:27,408
Yep, I know I couldn't believe it. I, anyway, I wrote this really evil letter back to him

541
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:31,953
and, and I calmed down like the next day or two. I calmed down. I kept that letter.

542
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:37,972
And so I wrote him back another letter saying how pissed I was when I found out that he did this.

543
00:31:37,972 --> 00:31:42,754
And I sent him the original one just so he could see how mad I was.

544
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:47,295
And he didn't even care. It's like, whatever, you know.

545
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:50,656
So he calls up and he gets me on the phone and was just like,

546
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:54,217
Oh, you know, this game was so great. I really want to,

547
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:57,418
I really want you to do a game just like that for me and put it in the shareware market.

548
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:59,719
And I had never even heard of shareware, but I was like...

549
00:32:00,382 --> 00:32:07,888
sounds great, I could spend time actually more than a month and make a game.

550
00:32:07,888 --> 00:32:08,208
And so

551
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:11,110
I said, but you know that game I did, that's

552
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,693
crap, you know, check this out. And I showed him a demo of

553
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:18,156
something we're doing and he totally went nuts.

554
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:20,938
You know, he's just, if you do a game for me and

555
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:25,181
we'll publish it and all this stuff. And I was like, well you know if you're

556
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:29,124
serious about it, you know, you'll have to advance us two thousand dollars.

557
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:30,322
and uh... well

558
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:36,324
so uh... well he had five thousand his bank account

559
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:40,966
so that was uh... and he sent it to us so that was uh... that was a

560
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:42,607
pretty huge commitment

561
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:47,369
on scott miller's part and uh... we got the two thousand dollar check and we're like wow this guy's

562
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:47,569
hardcore

563
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:56,846
So what we did was we started taking the computers home from Softdisk at night and especially

564
00:32:56,846 --> 00:32:59,207
on the weekends.

565
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:02,207
You better be careful, the litigation may yet occur.

566
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:04,628
Yeah, well that's another part of the story.

567
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:13,510
So we take the computers home on the weekends and everything and we're writing our first

568
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,590
Commander Keen trilogy.

569
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:20,296
when we when we told me to a game for me he wanted no the game was about like

570
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:21,356
did we'll just do a cool game

571
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:25,997
it's like a so i see your design documents haven't changed

572
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:28,417
is because

573
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:33,238
you know i want to give you two thousand bucks i want to know what i'm paying for

574
00:33:33,238 --> 00:33:33,298
so

575
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:38,819
so tom hall was in charge of the creative design of the game so tom wrote

576
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:41,420
like one paragraph that described commander king

577
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,180
and uh...

578
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,080
we just sent it to him fax it to him and he's like okay good go

579
00:33:46,685 --> 00:33:48,106
He just wanted something.

580
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:49,787
It was the high concept thing.

581
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:51,768
Yeah, he just wanted something.

582
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:57,671
So anyway, we worked for three months after working on Weekends and we did the first trilogy

583
00:33:57,671 --> 00:34:07,136
and we had to make it fit on a 360K PC disk and so we had to link stuff into the executable

584
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:11,798
and do the LZEXE on it and just compress the hell out of the game.

585
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:18,024
on December 14th of 1990 we released the very first episode of Commander Keen

586
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:21,106
ruined on Mars into the inter- on the

587
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:22,007
BBC's back then

588
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,127
and uh...

589
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:28,171
and then the next very next month you know we continued working at Softdisk

590
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:32,754
you know we're doing our game a month and we're working on this thing at night so

591
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:34,375
that was our life

592
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,155
and uh...

593
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:38,457
anyway one month right after we got done with the game in

594
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:41,119
the very first month's profits came in

595
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:41,159
uh...

596
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:45,532
we got a check for $10,000 and we're just like, this is enough

597
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:51,556
for all of us to live on. We figured we're going to get it

598
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:58,461
every month too. So, so we, we just told Softdisk, look, you

599
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:01,503
know, we're sorry, we started this product, this product line

600
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:04,225
six months earlier, and we're like, we got to go. This is too

601
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:07,427
cool. And, and so they, you know, they threatened to sue us

602
00:35:07,427 --> 00:35:10,109
and everything. And we worked out a deal where we would

603
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:20,079
continue to make games for them while they got an in-house team up to speed.

604
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:27,901
And so the first, in February 1st of 91 is when we formed id Software, the four of us.

605
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:33,982
And until about August or September, that's what we did at id Software,

606
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:35,042
was we're getting money for...

607
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,262
our first game and we weren't even working on our next product, we were having to fulfill

608
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,264
the softest thing.

609
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:45,867
And so we did a whole bunch of games which was every month again, you know.

610
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:49,050
But we learned a lot from all that.

611
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:54,354
We actually did the very first, our first 3D engine which was Hover Tank 3D.

612
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:58,137
We did lots of cool side-scrolling games, we experimented with some different, with

613
00:35:58,137 --> 00:36:00,759
puzzle games and a lot of stuff.

614
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:05,222
And we did a prototype of the Commander Keen, the next Commander Keen Trilogy's game engine.

615
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:12,612
forum. And then we did the second Commander Keen trilogy in six months, which was three

616
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:18,977
months for Keen 4, two months for Keen 6, which we did right after 4 because it was

617
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:27,303
a retail product we had to get out real quick. And then Keen 5 took one month and got that

618
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:31,626
out December 15th of 1991. And then we started working on Wolfenstein right after that.

619
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:35,237
And Wolfenstein took six months.

620
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:38,939
We told our distributor, we told them what we were doing,

621
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:41,821
and they were like, don't stir up that World War II thing, you know.

622
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:47,104
They were just like, you know, you're mowing down Nazis with a chain gun and stuff.

623
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:47,665
It's really cool.

624
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:53,028
And they were just, you know, they went and they couldn't believe, you know,

625
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,809
it was made major controversial.

626
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:58,884
you know they're really scared but they we did really good with our other games

627
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,747
so they're like okay you know so we did Wolfenstein

628
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:07,030
in six months and then immediately worked on Spear of Destiny which took us

629
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,752
two months

630
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:13,995
and Wolfenstein was released on May 5th of 1992 which was actually one

631
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:14,796
week

632
00:37:14,796 --> 00:37:16,818
after Ultima Underworld 2 which was

633
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,699
you know they

634
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:24,119
Paul Neeroth likes to talk about that because he wants to make sure that he released the

635
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,361
first texture map game out there.

636
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:29,764
And, you know, and I tell everybody, yes, he totally did, you know, one week before

637
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:30,044
we did.

638
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:36,290
And actually, and actually, the only reason that Wolfenstein 3D is texture mapped is because

639
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,431
of Paul Neeroth.

640
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:42,575
I had kept in touch with him since he had started Blue Sky and I called him up while

641
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:47,299
we were at Softdisk and he told me he was working on this new game that he couldn't

642
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,360
tell me the name of it.

643
00:37:48,794 --> 00:37:53,578
But they're using this really neat new technology called texture mapping.

644
00:37:53,578 --> 00:37:57,100
And after the phone conversation I told Carmack, hey,

645
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,982
they're doing this texture mapping thing.

646
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:03,265
And he looks up in the air for about three seconds and he goes, I can do that.

647
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:04,085
So.

648
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:11,671
But that was, you know, we had done, after that we did a texture map game called Catacombs 3D,

649
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:13,653
but it was an EGA, so it wasn't real popular.

650
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:14,573
You know, VJ.

651
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,093
Wolfenstein was in VGA so it got really popular and that's where everyone goes,

652
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:25,218
oh yeah, you guys did this first action game in VGA and everything,

653
00:38:25,218 --> 00:38:27,940
which was pretty, it was where the market was going.

654
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:35,247
So right after we finished Spirit of Destiny, we started working on Doom in December of 92

655
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:40,271
and you know, during the entire year we did, we finished it and it was,

656
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:42,953
that was a lot of work actually, it took us a whole year for that game.

657
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,725
But we released that on December 10th of 1993.

658
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:51,647
And Doom II took eight months.

659
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:53,448
That was released on October 10th of 94.

660
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:57,791
And at the same time, I was working with Raven on Heretic.

661
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,412
And that got released December 23rd of 94.

662
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:06,215
And then worked on Hexen and Quake at the same time.

663
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:08,496
It took about a year and a half for Quake.

664
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:12,172
Do you remember the year that Wolfenstein 3D won the best

665
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,774
action game award at the Software

666
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:16,915
Publishers Association?

667
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:20,618
And when Jay and you got up to accept it, and you said, thank

668
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:23,640
you, this proves that shareware is high quality.

669
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,622
And all of a sudden, everybody looked shocked because they

670
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,984
didn't realize at that point they had voted for a

671
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:29,965
shareware product.

672
00:39:30,813 --> 00:39:33,234
And we also said, hey, we'll be back next year.

673
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:33,994
And we weren't anyway.

674
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:36,935
But we were working on Doom.

675
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:38,776
We thought we'd be there next year.

676
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,277
That was also where Jay told me, he says,

677
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:43,598
we've got it, you know, we took a lot of heat for killing

678
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,458
all those Nazis in the game.

679
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,359
But this time, we've got it licked.

680
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,479
You're killing demons.

681
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:51,020
Nobody can complain about that.

682
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,841
Yeah, we actually got a lot of comments

683
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,442
about killing dogs, which was pretty funny.

684
00:39:55,442 --> 00:39:56,682
You can kill people, but not dogs.

685
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:57,603
So that was.

686
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,751
And I think Quake bothers some people that there's

687
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:02,772
Rottweilers in there.

688
00:40:02,772 --> 00:40:05,813
And you can kill the dogs and you feel sorry for them.

689
00:40:05,813 --> 00:40:06,814
Anyway.

690
00:40:06,814 --> 00:40:07,274
OK.

691
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:11,175
So Nolan, it seems like things have come

692
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,016
full circle with PlayNet.

693
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:16,958
You started out by putting machines in bars and

694
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:17,838
restaurants.

695
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:21,118
You know, people would pay as they play, and now it seems

696
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,260
like you're putting machines in bars and restaurants, and

697
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,722
people are going to pay to play.

698
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:29,805
Why are you going the route of the discrete

699
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:30,945
hardware, that route?

700
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:35,028
I mean, isn't that a pretty expensive way to go when

701
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:38,031
everybody's saying just web, web, web?

702
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:44,996
Well, I believe that whenever you pioneer, you want to find

703
00:40:44,996 --> 00:40:45,756
low-hanging fruit.

704
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:46,877
That is, how do you?

705
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:51,803
get into a marketplace in positive cash flow, or as

706
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:53,504
close to positive cash flow as you can.

707
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,746
And when you push on technology, what you really

708
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:01,427
want to be able to do is control things as

709
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:03,328
much as possible.

710
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:06,649
And right now, if you really look at the web and latency,

711
00:41:06,649 --> 00:41:08,250
it's really horrible.

712
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:13,612
And everyone who says that they've got some kind of a

713
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:14,592
silver bullet.

714
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:19,131
you know it's it's still the LA freeway at rush hour and

715
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:24,374
even though you can create some passing lanes and things like that

716
00:41:24,374 --> 00:41:28,197
there's a lot of problems with games over the net particularly when you want

717
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:32,360
to do massively parallel things.

718
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,862
So I felt that the coin op world

719
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:42,512
gives, has a lot of advantages. One, you can have a target hardware. Two, you can choose

720
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:47,856
an intranet solution if you want to, since you have total control of the whole structure.

721
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:58,484
The next area is that when you move into a new area, you want to be able to merchandise

722
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:03,108
and make changes. I mean, it really started.

723
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:07,124
from a decision I made when I turned 50 to get back

724
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,685
into the game business.

725
00:42:08,685 --> 00:42:10,807
I'd been fooling around with a lot of other areas,

726
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:13,708
sort of going on the five year and out theory,

727
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:16,470
that do something for five years and then do something

728
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,111
completely different for five years,

729
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:22,134
and that way you have a very interesting life.

730
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:26,216
And I did venture capital in restaurants

731
00:42:26,216 --> 00:42:29,378
and telecommunications and microwaves and mapping

732
00:42:29,378 --> 00:42:30,519
and all that sort of stuff.

733
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,980
And each one of them was interesting.

734
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,885
But I decided that games were really a heck of a lot more fun.

735
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:41,869
And so when you turn 50, you say, OK, I can reevaluate

736
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:45,811
what's going on in my life and go back and do something that

737
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:46,592
I've already done before.

738
00:42:46,592 --> 00:42:50,875
And so the fact that Nolan Bushnell was going to get back

739
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:54,537
in the game business, I didn't think that anybody was going

740
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:57,138
to be on bended knee welcoming me in my return.

741
00:42:57,138 --> 00:43:00,801
So I felt that there probably would be a, that I had to come

742
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:01,982
in, create a nice.

743
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:06,346
place and then move out from there.

744
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:07,726
Turns out there's never been

745
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:11,168
a failed consumer game that was successful in the coin-op side.

746
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:16,550
I felt that the coin-op business was just horribly managed

747
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,532
because it was becoming very, very insular.

748
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:26,555
The business was collapsing in on itself because the gains were

749
00:43:26,555 --> 00:43:29,657
getting to have such a high threshold.

750
00:43:30,263 --> 00:43:36,404
of such a difficult learning threshold that people were leaving.

751
00:43:36,404 --> 00:43:43,726
I mean, one year it was six percent of the market was giving you 90 percent of the revenue,

752
00:43:43,726 --> 00:43:47,186
then four, then three, then two.

753
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:50,547
1983, the coin op business was $18 billion at CoinDrop.

754
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:51,307
Last year it was six.

755
00:43:51,307 --> 00:43:53,428
That's a huge collapse.

756
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:59,269
It was really because people were getting life and the games were getting so complex.

757
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:06,112
that unless you had a PhD in Mortal Kombatness, a typical person going into an arcade had

758
00:44:06,112 --> 00:44:07,593
no chance.

759
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:09,814
So I felt the business had to have a big reset.

760
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:19,181
The big reset, I decided, couldn't be in an arcade, because the arcade, getting a person

761
00:44:19,181 --> 00:44:24,904
from their home into an arcade was a lot different than getting them off a bar stool to another

762
00:44:24,904 --> 00:44:26,525
bar stool.

763
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:27,446
And so I felt that...

764
00:44:29,956 --> 00:44:33,058
So I felt that the right place was in bars and restaurants.

765
00:44:33,058 --> 00:44:35,639
So I created a countertop game, PlayNet.

766
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:41,502
This runs on a Pentium, graphics-assisted, 1.2

767
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:46,345
gigabyte hard drive, touchscreen interface, modem,

768
00:44:46,345 --> 00:44:53,388
two telephone handsets, and 32 megs of RAM running on NT.

769
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:55,630
And we're off and locked and loaded.

770
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,011
The basic strategy is this.

771
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:02,569
download a game, you're talking about a game a month, we're downloading a game a week.

772
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:08,954
So constantly renewable content, you don't have to blow up the theater every time you

773
00:45:08,954 --> 00:45:12,176
change the movie, which is sort of the point out model right now.

774
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:16,359
That it's not, that it's connected to the net.

775
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:22,763
We're also doing tournaments, because it turns out that there are a lot of states that allow

776
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,204
games of skill to be prized.

777
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,766
So we can now have prizes and cash and what have you.

778
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:32,559
We have chat, but not chat with typing because Bubba don't type.

779
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:40,506
But Bubba does spill beer all over the touch screen.

780
00:45:40,506 --> 00:45:41,247
That's OK.

781
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:45,250
As long as he's put a quarter in first,

782
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,813
he can spill it wherever he wants.

783
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:52,236
But quarters, that's one thing.

784
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:53,497
Credit cards are another.

785
00:45:53,497 --> 00:45:56,000
Because since we're on the Met, now we can do credit cards.

786
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:59,653
and cash. Our machine takes ones and fives.

787
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:03,696
And so the objective is to

788
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:06,098
have games, multiplayer games,

789
00:46:06,098 --> 00:46:09,921
tournaments, chat with handsets.

790
00:46:09,921 --> 00:46:12,183
Now we use the protocol of

791
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:16,467
a chat room but with voice files. So now

792
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:20,490
one jerk can't dominate that sort of thing. Plus

793
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,793
we can now have audio chat on top of games

794
00:46:23,793 --> 00:46:24,613
over the network.

795
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:28,818
Now, this is where I do my imitation of the Statue of

796
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:34,021
Liberty, because give me your tired, your worn, your humbled,

797
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:38,124
huddled programs longing to be free, because we're going to

798
00:46:38,124 --> 00:46:39,845
have an open platform.

799
00:46:39,845 --> 00:46:42,387
And anybody who wants to publish, just write it to NT.

800
00:46:42,387 --> 00:46:43,528
We'll give you an API.

801
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:47,471
And we'll give you a percentage of the coin drop.

802
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,633
And it's real easy.

803
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:52,394
It'll be real fun.

804
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,195
Brings a whole new idea to shareware.

805
00:46:54,822 --> 00:46:58,063
And then, of course, if people are playing it and having fun

806
00:46:58,063 --> 00:47:01,804
in bars and restaurants all over the world, clearly,

807
00:47:01,804 --> 00:47:03,985
there are going to be people that are going to want to do

808
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:04,606
it at home.

809
00:47:04,606 --> 00:47:10,608
So we see it as a good way to merchandise games, to get in

810
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:15,050
trial, and also to be in this wonderful network.

811
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,331
We've got this thing called CollegeNet going, in which

812
00:47:17,331 --> 00:47:21,052
we'll have all the colleges all over the nation, all over

813
00:47:21,052 --> 00:47:22,813
the world, linked up for massively

814
00:47:22,813 --> 00:47:24,013
multiple-player games.

815
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:30,979
And I mean just think of having a doom engine, okay?

816
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:31,079
with a

817
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:41,682
Sphere of influence so that you can only see a few people around you. We're going to want to have 10,000 in the same game

818
00:47:41,682 --> 00:47:45,823
Big arena, it's collapsing cost you five dollars to enter

819
00:47:45,823 --> 00:47:52,524
Three shots you can take three hits, but then three hits and you're out

820
00:47:52,524 --> 00:47:54,105
Last guy standing gets ten grand

821
00:47:57,736 --> 00:47:59,297
That sound fun? Boy, I want to do that.

822
00:47:59,297 --> 00:48:02,638
Then we'll add one other little thing.

823
00:48:02,638 --> 00:48:06,539
So have you done the research? How many states allow skill-based contests like that?

824
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:09,141
How many states allow skill-based contests like that?

825
00:48:09,141 --> 00:48:13,882
There's about 23 that allow it, for sure.

826
00:48:13,882 --> 00:48:19,645
There's another 15 that we're going to try, you know.

827
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:23,686
It's better to ask forgiveness often than permission.

828
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:29,615
And then there's several that, you know, you just go to hard jail.

829
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:34,816
And, but, you know, there's all kinds of fun sociology.

830
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:39,998
Imagine if you could now choose your jersey colors.

831
00:48:39,998 --> 00:48:47,399
Now that says that now friends can locate other friends in cyberspace.

832
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:51,200
And so they say, okay, you wear the green and the blue and we'll have a good time.

833
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:54,709
because you figure out I'll watch your back, you watch my back.

834
00:48:54,709 --> 00:48:57,730
So what we've introduced is cyberspace gang warfare.

835
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:03,371
And so the sociology of the thing could get really fascinating.

836
00:49:03,371 --> 00:49:07,052
Well, I think it will, but I don't know if you could take credit for introducing it

837
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:13,913
because there's a lot of quake clans out there that are pretty well beating people up.

838
00:49:13,913 --> 00:49:15,253
But you can't do 10,000, right?

839
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:16,374
Not yet.

840
00:49:16,374 --> 00:49:17,174
But we can work on that.

841
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:20,755
I've got the platform, you write the code.

842
00:49:21,445 --> 00:49:26,971
So what do you think, John? Do you think Daikatana death matches are going to be possible over this system?

843
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:30,395
Or are you going totally a different direction?

844
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:34,119
Well, Daikatana is using the Quake technology, so...

845
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:36,482
You know, it'll probably go up to 32 players.

846
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,203
Okay, we'll do 32 and then 32 and then 32.

847
00:49:40,203 --> 00:49:41,143
We'll partition.

848
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:44,907
We'll put doors between them, you know, partition on servers.

849
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:45,547
That'd work.

850
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:50,292
Yeah, you could like have like small groups of games and then whoever wins there can go

851
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:53,815
on to the next phase and just kind of get everybody together.

852
00:49:53,815 --> 00:49:55,176
You do that.

853
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:56,797
That's got to be fun, isn't it?

854
00:49:56,797 --> 00:49:57,538
Oh yeah.

855
00:49:57,538 --> 00:49:59,520
Well, we had talked about the possibility of

856
00:50:00,215 --> 00:50:06,539
when we were doing Quake we would have New York versus LA and we'd have these gangs.

857
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:07,800
Yeah.

858
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,341
Which is what clans kind of turned out to be.

859
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,083
We were envisioning some huge numbers of players.

860
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:17,626
And that's kind of what it's...

861
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:22,449
Our original idea was we'd have some New York...

862
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:25,151
There'd be all these clans in New York or groups of players

863
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:29,454
and the best would form a team and they'd have their own little competitions.

864
00:50:30,029 --> 00:50:33,652
finally create this core team of like six players or something

865
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:36,554
and uh... then we have l a do the same thing they have their own little sort of

866
00:50:36,554 --> 00:50:37,755
tournaments

867
00:50:37,755 --> 00:50:42,619
get down to a core group that that's their killer group and then you have

868
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:43,059
you know towns

869
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:46,402
you know big cities major cities fighting each other

870
00:50:46,402 --> 00:50:48,324
to the best city in the u s is

871
00:50:48,324 --> 00:50:51,647
stuff like that and they're just they're doing that uh...

872
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:58,948
They're starting to organize clan warfare stuff, the clan war council, North American war council and stuff like that.

873
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:02,191
It's happening by itself.

874
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:03,952
That's for sure.

875
00:51:03,952 --> 00:51:08,396
Chris, what model do you see in the future for multiplayer play?

876
00:51:08,396 --> 00:51:15,623
Do you think this collapsing arena idea is the approach you'd be interested in or a persistent universe or what?

877
00:51:15,912 --> 00:51:20,813
Well, I guess considering one of the projects we're working

878
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:25,494
on is hoping to have the ability to have 10,000 people

879
00:51:25,494 --> 00:51:29,455
online at the same time, then I would definitely say yes.

880
00:51:29,455 --> 00:51:34,456
I mean, there's a lot of technical issues with getting

881
00:51:34,456 --> 00:51:38,037
enough people at one time in the same space and action.

882
00:51:38,037 --> 00:51:42,038
So I mean, I guess the way that we're looking at handling

883
00:51:42,038 --> 00:51:42,738
it is very much.

884
00:51:43,192 --> 00:51:47,613
you know, let's get 16 or 32 people in one space and action and, but everyone's sort

885
00:51:47,613 --> 00:51:56,175
of on the equivalent of this huge virtual chat server that's dressed up to feel like

886
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:58,235
the world and universe that we put you in.

887
00:51:58,235 --> 00:52:03,476
So everyone has a reputation, everyone has an affinity with a house that we're calling

888
00:52:03,476 --> 00:52:05,217
in this game that we're working on.

889
00:52:05,217 --> 00:52:10,318
So it has some similarities to what they've done with Quake World, although.

890
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:14,016
We're trying to do something that's a much more

891
00:52:14,016 --> 00:52:18,897
persistent universe that just exists for a year or two

892
00:52:18,897 --> 00:52:21,578
years and is modeled.

893
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:23,918
What I've noticed is that there seem to be a lot of

894
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:27,159
different tiers of customers with regard to latency.

895
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:30,400
There are those who only play games where latency doesn't

896
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,900
really affect much.

897
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,261
There are those who will play Quake free and put up with the

898
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:37,482
latency as long as it's free.

899
00:52:37,928 --> 00:52:40,669
There are those who pay a little bit more for Duango or 10

900
00:52:40,669 --> 00:52:43,090
with a low latency solution.

901
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,452
And there are those who just are somewhere in between.

902
00:52:46,452 --> 00:52:49,593
What are you planning on doing with this project?

903
00:52:49,593 --> 00:52:52,354
Are you going to design so that latency doesn't matter?

904
00:52:52,354 --> 00:52:53,954
Or do you have a latency solution?

905
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:57,175
Well, I mean, I think we have as much of a latency solution

906
00:52:57,175 --> 00:53:01,737
as everyone else does, which means you do as good as you

907
00:53:01,737 --> 00:53:01,957
can.

908
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:04,978
And you do things like predictive intelligence

909
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:05,638
on motion and stuff.

910
00:53:06,254 --> 00:53:08,736
I mean, I will say that the one thing I have noticed with

911
00:53:08,736 --> 00:53:12,958
online is that, and it's the problem that we wrestle with,

912
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:16,800
and I'm sure everyone else wrestles with, is that if you

913
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,622
want to hit a mass audience, it has to be free online.

914
00:53:19,622 --> 00:53:23,124
So you have to figure out how you can afford to do that for

915
00:53:23,124 --> 00:53:28,067
free, but I mean, I know for me, when we were like, for

916
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:31,929
instance, Dablow's a great example with Battle.net, right?

917
00:53:31,929 --> 00:53:33,950
We all got Dablow in the office, and we spent.

918
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:38,616
two, three weeks killing Dabble about three or four times until we killed them on every

919
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:40,236
difficulty level with all our buddies.

920
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:46,598
And that was just very cool because the first time it felt like the multiplayer experience

921
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:50,480
that I get at the office because we've all got high speed Pentiums and we've got a very

922
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,281
fast network and it's cool to play games at work which everyone in this room is okay for

923
00:53:55,281 --> 00:53:58,682
but the rest of the world doesn't get that experience.

924
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:01,763
It's like I go visit Ion Storm and they're all like quake matching.

925
00:54:01,763 --> 00:54:03,604
I phone them up and all I can hear is...

926
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:07,525
God damn it.

927
00:54:07,525 --> 00:54:08,286
All right, OK.

928
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:14,049
And so actually for me, the coolest thing is seeing games

929
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:17,811
come along now where finally that experience that's so cool

930
00:54:17,811 --> 00:54:19,171
for everyone in the industry that's been playing

931
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:23,053
multiplayer games for years is becoming available at home.

932
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:26,455
And whether or not the internet is perfect, I know it

933
00:54:26,455 --> 00:54:29,937
isn't, but it's the best way to get that experience at

934
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:33,139
home, which is cool because I just want people to have the

935
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:34,900
same, I guess, sense of satisfaction.

936
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:39,635
that I do when I blow someone away, or I take their base out

937
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:42,216
at C&C, or whatever.

938
00:54:42,216 --> 00:54:46,997
Besides the intranet, which gets around the problem in

939
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:50,679
the small group, with your collapsing arena idea, are

940
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:53,920
you going to design around latency?

941
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,741
Or are you just going to put up with it?

942
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,402
We have a whole bunch of projects that we call them

943
00:54:58,402 --> 00:55:02,063
latency-averse, which we really don't care that much about.

944
00:55:02,063 --> 00:55:02,743
We're actually.

945
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,789
targeting a market which doesn't care about that as much,

946
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:12,411
because most of it are people that are pretty well lubricated with alcohol anyway.

947
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:14,772
So you want latency basically.

948
00:55:14,772 --> 00:55:20,955
So latency helps. Latency is our friend.

949
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:27,017
Really adults. One of the things that I want to point out is that,

950
00:55:27,017 --> 00:55:30,418
don't forget that demographically right now,

951
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:35,846
teenagers are the smallest group that's been in years.

952
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:37,447
It's called the baby bust.

953
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:46,070
So, if you want testosterone to fundamentally lubricate your business plan,

954
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:50,571
it's not a good idea right now because everybody's getting older.

955
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:57,794
So, the real area that you want to focus on is how can I get women to play?

956
00:55:57,794 --> 00:56:00,355
How can I get older business people to play?

957
00:56:00,823 --> 00:56:06,204
How can I enfranchise kids who are under 10?

958
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:12,066
And the other markets are fun, and they're really exciting.

959
00:56:12,066 --> 00:56:17,648
And the 8 to 18-year-old male, 8 to 35-year-old computer jock,

960
00:56:17,648 --> 00:56:19,509
that's one thing.

961
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,450
But we really want to focus and try

962
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:26,731
to broaden our demographics to people that maybe

963
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:35,615
have CPU processing times that are equivalent to old 386s instead of Super Pentiums.

964
00:56:35,615 --> 00:56:41,840
If we talk about us as being a 60 hertz massively parallel computer,

965
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,023
some of us I think have dropped down to about 40 now.

966
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:48,868
Well, I have one last generic question

967
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:49,868
that I want to ask you.

968
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:52,589
And then I want to make sure that if we have some questions,

969
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:56,690
at least here in the audience, that we get a couple of them

970
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:56,870
out.

971
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,750
So I'm going to ask each one of you in turn,

972
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,031
what is the biggest mistake you ever made in game design?

973
00:57:03,031 --> 00:57:05,312
And since I started before one way,

974
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:06,272
I'm going to start the other way.

975
00:57:06,272 --> 00:57:08,133
John, what was the biggest mistake

976
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,973
that you can think you ever made in game design?

977
00:57:09,973 --> 00:57:14,874
She's probably not spending enough time

978
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:16,455
on Quake's single-player game.

979
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:19,586
That's probably it

980
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:24,849
My current game is you know I spent a lot of time on my current games game design

981
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:25,109
in

982
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,791
Quake is a really great multiplayer game

983
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:34,215
But I really like to play single-player stuff, and I really wish that I had spent more time doing doing

984
00:57:34,215 --> 00:57:39,598
Better design on the single-player game, but it was there was you know the situation and everything

985
00:57:39,598 --> 00:57:42,500
That was probably the biggest mistake

986
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:42,600
Chris

987
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:50,970
I think it was Times of Law and I built this sort of Gauntlet style top down view game

988
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:55,034
and I was real, because I loved Gauntlet when I was playing in the arcades and so I wanted

989
00:57:55,034 --> 00:57:58,617
to do something that had more depth and you know you can go around and you can talk to

990
00:57:58,617 --> 00:58:02,740
people and you know so I was really in love with this sort of mono scale but you know

991
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,925
instead of just being Gauntlet on these contained maps I wanted this huge world and so I built

992
00:58:07,925 --> 00:58:09,246
this huge world and then.

993
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:13,981
you know, I would leave a town and I'd walk for about 20 minutes and nothing would happen.

994
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:19,045
Finally I'd get to the other town and, you know, I'd be going, hmm, you know, that's

995
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:20,085
not so much fun.

996
00:58:20,085 --> 00:58:24,448
So at that point I started, okay, well I'm going to sort of invent random monsters here

997
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:27,210
so as I'm walking from the towns I've got something to do.

998
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:31,513
And about that point I said, hey, you know, look, next time I'm doing something like this,

999
00:58:31,513 --> 00:58:35,636
if there's ever a point where I'm making a game and I'm putting stuff in the game to

1000
00:58:35,636 --> 00:58:39,078
get around something that isn't fun, maybe that shouldn't be there in the first place.

1001
00:58:39,078 --> 00:58:39,118
So...

1002
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:43,041
you know, interestingly enough, I was like, okay, well, I think at that point, I, you

1003
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:46,023
know, I was spending a lot of time to make it fun between the cities.

1004
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:49,686
And so I was like, well, you know, next time I should probably have like an overall map

1005
00:58:49,686 --> 00:58:53,989
and then I say I'm going to go from this city to this city and sort of scope the action

1006
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,230
to, you know, where I had the areas of interest in the game.

1007
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:01,734
So it was pretty funny because that's the way Richard had with his Ultima design originally

1008
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:06,317
and then he moved to mono-scale with Ultimas later on, you know.

1009
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:12,311
I'd be there on like Ultima 7 and I'd be spending two years with level designers making sure

1010
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:18,175
every little single part of the map is interesting because even though that wasn't part of the

1011
00:59:18,175 --> 00:59:21,117
main story you could wander off over there.

1012
00:59:21,117 --> 00:59:25,280
So I guess for me I just felt like it was very important to focus on what the fun aspects

1013
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,603
of the game were and then sort of exclude the rest of them.

1014
00:59:28,603 --> 00:59:31,865
And that sort of actually drove Wing Commander because Wing Commander was just very much

1015
00:59:31,865 --> 00:59:35,428
focused on okay I want to do space dog fighting and that's it.

1016
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:35,948
And...

1017
00:59:36,863 --> 00:59:38,264
So I guess you learn from your mistakes.

1018
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:38,964
Well, smart people do.

1019
00:59:38,964 --> 00:59:42,266
Nolan, what do you think your biggest mistake

1020
00:59:42,266 --> 00:59:43,186
was in the game biz?

1021
00:59:43,186 --> 00:59:43,466
Oh boy.

1022
00:59:43,466 --> 00:59:45,247
I got so many of them.

1023
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:51,391
I don't think I can limit it to just one.

1024
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:58,174
Probably the one, technically, that was the biggest blunder

1025
00:59:58,174 --> 01:00:04,978
was deciding to save the cost of a connector that had a

1026
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:06,378
couple of extra pins.

1027
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:15,018
in the Atari 2600 cartridge slot and not having a read-write line that really cut, I mean,

1028
01:00:15,018 --> 01:00:23,364
this will sound funny, but we really thought that the 2600 was going to play about 16 games

1029
01:00:23,364 --> 01:00:29,209
and that that was all, you know, I mean, because we thought it was really clunky. I mean, we

1030
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:35,994
only have 128 bits of RAM, you know, so that's not bytes, those are bits.

1031
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:39,139
And so by not having a read-write line,

1032
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:43,603
it really said that the ROM cartridges couldn't be

1033
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:47,385
augmented with that real bad thing.

1034
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:54,931
The other part was a product called VideoMusic.

1035
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:56,592
We built 150,000 chips.

1036
01:00:56,592 --> 01:01:00,154
We built 75,000 units, and we sold six.

1037
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:05,940
And that was really a little more than that, but at full price.

1038
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:06,200
You know.

1039
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:13,024
If only there'd been infomercials then, you could have done the miracle thing.

1040
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:16,906
But the real thing in the game business that I regret is selling Atari.

1041
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:20,548
I think, you know, it was a thing where I was young.

1042
01:01:20,548 --> 01:01:22,470
To Warner or selling it period?

1043
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,730
Selling it to Warner.

1044
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:27,379
You know, I mean, boy, nobody could have screwed it up as bad as they did.

1045
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:28,260
It's maybe the tramels.

1046
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,661
No comment.

1047
01:01:30,661 --> 01:01:39,005
Well, you know, when you start a company, it's sort of like your baby.

1048
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:46,669
And even though you've sold it, you kind of watch it and you hope it doesn't go to

1049
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:51,532
prison and various things.

1050
01:01:51,532 --> 01:01:52,492
And, uh,

1051
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:57,995
And it's been really disappointing to see my baby

1052
01:01:57,995 --> 01:02:03,497
hacked to death through just blunders.

1053
01:02:03,497 --> 01:02:07,819
And I kind of feel like, I mean, there's one of the

1054
01:02:07,819 --> 01:02:11,360
things that people don't realize.

1055
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:18,183
Imagine the Atari 800, which was technically superior in a

1056
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:19,843
lot of ways, a lot of things.

1057
01:02:19,843 --> 01:02:22,825
But remember and.

1058
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:26,913
Some of you young guys won't even know this happened,

1059
01:02:26,913 --> 01:02:30,255
but can you imagine a company that actually said,

1060
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:33,798
if you write software for our platform, we'll sue you?

1061
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:39,002
How to gain influence and win people.

1062
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:41,263
But essentially, in the Atari 800,

1063
01:02:41,263 --> 01:02:43,045
after I sold the company, I mean,

1064
01:02:43,045 --> 01:02:46,928
we had all this stuff designed and created

1065
01:02:46,928 --> 01:02:48,949
pretty much before I left.

1066
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:52,392
But then the Warner Marketing got a hold of it.

1067
01:02:53,157 --> 01:02:55,738
and said, well, this is clearly a closed platform.

1068
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:57,679
It's working the video game business.

1069
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:02,521
So not only do they not release the specs or any

1070
01:03:02,521 --> 01:03:05,342
authoring tools or anything like that, they said, hey,

1071
01:03:05,342 --> 01:03:09,363
we're not going to let you distribute, and we're going to

1072
01:03:09,363 --> 01:03:11,084
take you to court.

1073
01:03:11,084 --> 01:03:14,505
So while Jobs was out evangelizing, Atari was saying

1074
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:15,985
thou shalt not.

1075
01:03:15,985 --> 01:03:19,026
And of course, the history is history.

1076
01:03:19,026 --> 01:03:22,188
But Atari could have had it all with just a little bit of

1077
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:22,808
intelligence.

1078
01:03:23,532 --> 01:03:24,072
That's your guess.

1079
01:03:24,072 --> 01:03:28,694
My biggest mistake tonight was not watching the clock, so

1080
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:30,714
we're probably only going to have room for like two

1081
01:03:30,714 --> 01:03:32,095
questions from the audience.

1082
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,795
So let's see.

1083
01:03:32,795 --> 01:03:35,896
Just if you can, a question right here.

1084
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,537
The products of these three gentlemen, I'm sure, have

1085
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:38,757
greatly influenced everybody in this room.

1086
01:03:38,757 --> 01:03:46,219
I'd be very interested to know which products have greatly

1087
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:50,781
influenced them.

1088
01:03:50,781 --> 01:03:51,721
Oh, excellent question.

1089
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:57,786
Since your products have influenced so many people in the room, which products have influenced you?

1090
01:03:57,786 --> 01:04:01,429
So, you've been in the middle all the time, Chris, so you start off this time.

1091
01:04:01,429 --> 01:04:09,494
Okay. Well, I would say that the very, very early days when I was programming over in England,

1092
01:04:09,494 --> 01:04:13,877
a game called Elite, which came out on a machine called the BBC Micro.

1093
01:04:13,877 --> 01:04:22,203
When I came over here, there was a game Larry Holland did, which was Battle Hawks 42.

1094
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:25,705
which was fantastic.

1095
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:28,205
Most of the, you know, all the Infocom

1096
01:04:28,205 --> 01:04:31,066
early adventure games I used to play like crazy.

1097
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,366
I still play adventure games. I love them.

1098
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:36,287
I love the LucasArts games.

1099
01:04:36,287 --> 01:04:39,308
Recently, I would say I kind of split my time

1100
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,889
between playing a lot of multiplayer

1101
01:04:42,889 --> 01:04:46,090
strategy games. C&C is the one I still play now

1102
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,310
even though I was playing it two years ago.

1103
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,851
Mainly because I think it's for multiplayer.

1104
01:04:51,198 --> 01:04:53,859
game when you're a good player at it, it's the best.

1105
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:56,640
And it's actually better balanced than even Red Alert

1106
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,801
was, and I think it's better for fast-paced multiplayer

1107
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:05,783
action than some of the other stuff, even though they're all

1108
01:05:05,783 --> 01:05:06,963
great games.

1109
01:05:06,963 --> 01:05:08,944
I was very impressed by iDabble recently.

1110
01:05:08,944 --> 01:05:14,185
I thought that that was the best application I'd seen with

1111
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:17,106
integrating multiplayer over the internet in a product.

1112
01:05:17,106 --> 01:05:18,327
It was just incredibly slick.

1113
01:05:18,936 --> 01:05:23,939
So, I guess that's kind of my playlist.

1114
01:05:23,939 --> 01:05:25,140
John?

1115
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:32,005
Well, the very first game that really impressed me a lot was Pac-Man.

1116
01:05:32,005 --> 01:05:36,508
Back in, geez, I think it was 82 or something.

1117
01:05:36,508 --> 01:05:40,831
Because it had color and it had a very different game design.

1118
01:05:40,831 --> 01:05:44,834
It was not shooting things. It was, you know, staying away from things.

1119
01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:46,275
Which was very, very interesting.

1120
01:05:46,898 --> 01:05:49,778
And that really got me interested in designing games,

1121
01:05:49,778 --> 01:05:54,219
because I could actually, from watching that game,

1122
01:05:54,219 --> 01:05:56,980
it really looked like there was endless possibilities

1123
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,580
to game design, because they weren't following the trend,

1124
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,221
which was just shooting things, shooting aliens.

1125
01:06:03,221 --> 01:06:08,642
After that, I was a real big Apple II guy.

1126
01:06:08,642 --> 01:06:14,543
And probably Castle Wolfenstein was a really interesting game,

1127
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:15,803
because it was very different.

1128
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:24,605
Played a lot of Infocom stuff and those guys were great.

1129
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:29,149
LucasArts was also a really big influence.

1130
01:06:29,149 --> 01:06:35,613
Maniac Mansion and some of their adventure stuff.

1131
01:06:35,613 --> 01:06:39,936
And definitely Diablo was a big influence.

1132
01:06:39,936 --> 01:06:42,598
It was very different.

1133
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,140
I didn't get into the real time strategy stuff as much.

1134
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,022
I mean it was fun and everything but I really...

1135
01:06:47,557 --> 01:06:52,479
I like first-person action stuff, so I kind of didn't eat it up as much.

1136
01:06:52,479 --> 01:07:04,644
And I really like the first-person action thing, so I really watch my genre and take notes and try and improve and push it further.

1137
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:11,727
But there really haven't been too many things that have really impressed me a whole lot.

1138
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,167
Just a few different games.

1139
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:20,093
This is a little bit harder, but in terms of sort of standing on shoulders, I think

1140
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:29,495
Steve Russell's programming on a PDP-1 of Space War was a very important game for me.

1141
01:07:29,495 --> 01:07:34,036
You played that a long time ago in the arcades.

1142
01:07:34,036 --> 01:07:37,817
It's not that big though.

1143
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:44,678
And a game called Chicago Coin Speedway, which was a driving game before video games, which

1144
01:07:44,678 --> 01:07:45,898
used, which is a real...

1145
01:07:46,454 --> 01:07:52,202
Rube Goldberg of slide projectors and various things.

1146
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:57,610
But over the years, games that I particularly liked have been,

1147
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:00,914
it's one that you don't hear very much, but Fool's Errand,

1148
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:02,977
I thought was a very interesting.

1149
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,800
collection of little games that were pretty clever.

1150
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,761
Of course, Tetris was something that was

1151
01:08:10,761 --> 01:08:13,122
very important to me.

1152
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:16,622
I've been a big Doom player.

1153
01:08:16,622 --> 01:08:22,664
I currently am playing with my son's a lot of Warcraft II,

1154
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:29,105
which I can say that I have a seven-year-old that is a

1155
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,726
Warcraft II level editor.

1156
01:08:32,887 --> 01:08:39,750
I think that there's a game that is not on anybody's list here,

1157
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:46,173
but it's one called Pajama Sam from Humongous, which I think

1158
01:08:46,173 --> 01:08:49,695
is for my two-year-old, is absolutely a super hit.

1159
01:08:49,695 --> 01:08:53,817
And it's got depth and humor and really some pretty good stuff.

1160
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:57,299
So if any of you have kids, I highly recommend it.

1161
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,080
I thought of some other games.

1162
01:09:01,835 --> 01:09:08,157
The Ultima series, which I really liked a lot.

1163
01:09:08,157 --> 01:09:14,180
And a lot of Squaresoft's games, like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 3.

1164
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:18,021
That stuff is, I love Squaresoft stuff.

1165
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:25,264
I think those, I just want to kind of mention the RPG side of things,

1166
01:09:25,264 --> 01:09:29,806
because I really like that genre and we're planning on hitting it.

1167
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:43,330
Okay, good. One more question. The first real hand I see. If not, thank you very much for

1168
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:48,371
attending and there is one way in the back. Well, there's one right here. Okay, go.

1169
01:09:48,371 --> 01:09:56,373
I'd say the success changed your lives at all.

1170
01:09:56,373 --> 01:09:57,793
Nolan already told you it was five years and out.

1171
01:09:58,787 --> 01:10:02,328
The question was, has success changed your lives at all?

1172
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:03,929
We'll start with Nolan.

1173
01:10:03,929 --> 01:10:04,769
Absolutely.

1174
01:10:04,769 --> 01:10:09,271
I've been rich, I've been poor, rich is best.

1175
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:19,135
The thing that you have to do, though, is there's only so

1176
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:22,496
much eating and drinking and living money that you have.

1177
01:10:22,496 --> 01:10:25,037
The rest of it's sort of poker playing money.

1178
01:10:25,037 --> 01:10:27,378
And it determines how big a game you can get in.

1179
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:33,911
And I think building in the final analysis is the most fun.

1180
01:10:33,911 --> 01:10:39,012
And if you can build better and more efficiently, I think

1181
01:10:39,012 --> 01:10:41,852
you have a good life.

1182
01:10:41,852 --> 01:10:45,693
And I think that there are some times when making a lot

1183
01:10:45,693 --> 01:10:48,794
of money, you can become insufferable for a while.

1184
01:10:48,794 --> 01:10:51,214
But then you have to get whacked in the side of the

1185
01:10:51,214 --> 01:10:54,835
head with a few slings and arrows, and it turns you back

1186
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:56,175
into a real person.

1187
01:10:56,175 --> 01:10:58,135
And I think it helps both ways.

1188
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,686
Okay, Mr. Fly Yellow Ferrari?

1189
01:11:01,686 --> 01:11:02,486
Uh, hello.

1190
01:11:02,486 --> 01:11:02,646
Ha!

1191
01:11:02,646 --> 01:11:02,686
Ha!

1192
01:11:02,686 --> 01:11:02,726
Ha!

1193
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:03,966
Ha!

1194
01:11:03,966 --> 01:11:04,287
Ha!

1195
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:04,707
Ha!

1196
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:07,387
Ha!

1197
01:11:07,387 --> 01:11:08,288
Ha!

1198
01:11:08,288 --> 01:11:08,688
Ha!

1199
01:11:08,688 --> 01:11:08,968
Ha!

1200
01:11:08,968 --> 01:11:18,730
Well, I have some cars.

1201
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:19,491
Ha!

1202
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:19,851
Ha!

1203
01:11:19,851 --> 01:11:20,191
Ha!

1204
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:20,391
Ha!

1205
01:11:20,391 --> 01:11:20,611
Ha!

1206
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:20,891
Ha!

1207
01:11:20,891 --> 01:11:21,111
Ha!

1208
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:21,251
Ha!

1209
01:11:21,251 --> 01:11:21,511
Ha!

1210
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:21,871
Ha!

1211
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:22,812
Ha!

1212
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:22,992
Ha!

1213
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:23,212
Ha!

1214
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:23,572
Ha!

1215
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:23,612
Ha!

1216
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:29,402
And basically, I really spend a lot of time playing games

1217
01:11:29,402 --> 01:11:30,223
and making them.

1218
01:11:30,223 --> 01:11:32,944
I really don't spend too much time doing anything else.

1219
01:11:32,944 --> 01:11:33,865
I don't watch TV.

1220
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:35,125
I rarely go to movies.

1221
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:38,547
So I'm still doing what I want to do, but I can really spend

1222
01:11:38,547 --> 01:11:42,049
time doing it all constantly now, because I'm working and

1223
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:44,750
I'm making money doing what I like to do.

1224
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:49,172
And that's what I do most of the time.

1225
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:52,093
I think it's cool that my parents really get a big kick

1226
01:11:52,093 --> 01:11:55,655
out of it, because they always tell people find out that

1227
01:11:55,655 --> 01:11:55,915
they.

1228
01:11:56,566 --> 01:11:58,227
that are the parents of the guy that wrote Doom.

1229
01:11:58,227 --> 01:12:01,789
And so they talk to a lot of people because of that,

1230
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:04,151
because they got Doom shirts and everything.

1231
01:12:04,151 --> 01:12:13,757
But mostly, I can get involved with a lot more things now,

1232
01:12:13,757 --> 01:12:17,119
just because of the stuff that I've done and everything.

1233
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:20,501
But what I really spend a lot of time doing is still making

1234
01:12:20,501 --> 01:12:22,903
games and playing them.

1235
01:12:22,903 --> 01:12:23,863
And Mr. Michael Ruehrer?

1236
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:27,093
Well, I mean, I definitely think it's cool that I don't

1237
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,735
have to listen to my dad asking me when I'm going to

1238
01:12:29,735 --> 01:12:33,698
go back and finish my degree and get a job that has a

1239
01:12:33,698 --> 01:12:35,019
little longer lifespan.

1240
01:12:35,019 --> 01:12:41,023
But I mean, actually, I've got to say, I mean, success is

1241
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,524
great and everything.

1242
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,286
But the coolest thing, if you really love what you're doing,

1243
01:12:44,286 --> 01:12:47,028
is that it just enables you to do what you want.

1244
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:49,610
And that's the important thing for me.

1245
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:52,832
That's the nice thing that I got from it, is that I can

1246
01:12:52,832 --> 01:12:53,513
pretty much.

1247
01:12:54,592 --> 01:12:59,155
in the software side, making games, get to do the games I want to make. And, you know,

1248
01:12:59,155 --> 01:13:05,620
I wish that upon everyone here because it's cool when you get there and it's really tough

1249
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:09,143
when you don't. And I remember when I wasn't there and I used to have to beg and plead

1250
01:13:09,143 --> 01:13:12,506
and tell them that, you know, yeah, okay, all times didn't sell very well, but come

1251
01:13:12,506 --> 01:13:15,568
on, you really got to go for this week, man, I think it's going to be cool. And you need

1252
01:13:15,568 --> 01:13:19,531
to like give me an artist so I can do that. And, you know, that takes a lot of energy.

1253
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:23,294
So, it's nice not to expend that energy and that's what I like about success.

1254
01:13:25,912 --> 01:13:28,454
But I do understand that I missed somebody in the back.

1255
01:13:28,454 --> 01:13:31,797
So if you'll be honest and jump up and ask that question.

1256
01:13:31,797 --> 01:13:42,986
I have a question about, you talked about a lot of great

1257
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:45,549
solo player games, but you talked about a lot of new

1258
01:13:45,549 --> 01:13:47,270
projects for multiplayer.

1259
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,252
What are the solo player games going to be?

1260
01:13:49,252 --> 01:13:51,153
The question is, you talked a lot about multiplayer projects.

1261
01:13:51,153 --> 01:13:51,794
Where are solo players going?

1262
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:51,894
Chris?

1263
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,275
I think in the future, there's going to be two style of games.

1264
01:13:53,275 --> 01:13:53,976
There's going to be

1265
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:57,674
immersive single player games that are primarily story driven.

1266
01:13:57,674 --> 01:14:01,334
You know, I know I'm still interested in making those.

1267
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:03,795
You know, an adventure game sort of, you know,

1268
01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:05,675
Monkey Island is a good example of that.

1269
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:09,056
A Wing Commander is a good example of that.

1270
01:14:09,056 --> 01:14:12,717
It, they're just, they're different kind of environments.

1271
01:14:12,717 --> 01:14:16,698
I think right now, you know, myself and a lot of, you know,

1272
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:18,078
I know John and a lot, you know.

1273
01:14:18,362 --> 01:14:19,244
Sounds like Nolan.

1274
01:14:19,244 --> 01:14:22,428
Very enamored by the whole social computing aspect of

1275
01:14:22,428 --> 01:14:24,411
being in a world and environment with a bunch of

1276
01:14:24,411 --> 01:14:27,375
other people that are real people, because at the end of

1277
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,177
the day, no matter how great.

1278
01:14:29,564 --> 01:14:32,625
We are programming our artificial intelligence, just

1279
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:34,525
doesn't cut it to the unpredictability and the

1280
01:14:34,525 --> 01:14:37,426
intelligence that a real person has.

1281
01:14:37,426 --> 01:14:40,486
And so you feel a real satisfaction from playing a

1282
01:14:40,486 --> 01:14:42,887
one-on-one game or a one-on-20 game against other people.

1283
01:14:42,887 --> 01:14:46,387
So I think that's very attractive and interesting.

1284
01:14:46,387 --> 01:14:49,948
But I mean, I think at the end of the day, I mean, the solo

1285
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:53,149
game, I mean, I know I just recently played Instinct 76.

1286
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:55,249
Had a cool storyline, had a cool look.

1287
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:58,352
I played it for a week or two. I had fun. I mean, it was worth the $50, $60 it cost.

1288
01:14:58,352 --> 01:15:02,175
And, you know, that's the experience I can do myself and in my own time.

1289
01:15:02,175 --> 01:15:06,599
And I think that's always going to be there.

1290
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:11,924
So, I mean, I think, you know, multiplayer is going to become a much stronger portion of the market.

1291
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,386
It's not going to take away from...

1292
01:15:13,786 --> 01:15:18,127
the solo game, I think multiplayer is really just going to expand the marketplace and give

1293
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:19,668
a new kind of experience there.

1294
01:15:19,668 --> 01:15:23,629
I guess what you're seeing is a lot of sort of heat and passion because it's the new thing

1295
01:15:23,629 --> 01:15:25,050
and we're all sort of enamored of it.

1296
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:28,611
But at the end of the day, you know, I still like stories.

1297
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:33,032
And if you want to be involved and have someone tell you a story,

1298
01:15:33,032 --> 01:15:35,934
it's very difficult to do that on a multiplayer game.

1299
01:15:35,934 --> 01:15:39,135
And I know because I'm going through that whole design problem right now.

1300
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,317
And so, at the end of the day, I still like to play adventure games and,

1301
01:15:43,317 --> 01:15:46,219
you know, I'll play those solo and have a lot of fun.

1302
01:15:46,219 --> 01:15:47,859
I don't know about you, John, but...

1303
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:49,320
I feel the same way.

1304
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,661
I love single player games, of course.

1305
01:15:51,661 --> 01:15:54,583
I love multiplayer games too.

1306
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:57,444
But actually in multiplayer, I don't like so much the whole...

1307
01:15:57,922 --> 01:16:02,265
clan warfare where there's like a million people in one game just destroying each other

1308
01:16:02,265 --> 01:16:02,666
randomly.

1309
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:07,970
I really like the one-on-one game where you have a map that's interesting and you hunt

1310
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:13,434
the other guy down and you really get paid back for your knowledge of that area.

1311
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:14,836
I've seen it first hand.

1312
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:20,860
It's a lot more fun to me than just the random violence that happens in just complete, you

1313
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,122
know, huge multiplayer environments.

1314
01:16:22,818 --> 01:16:25,079
But I really like the single-player game

1315
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:26,599
because it's custom.

1316
01:16:26,599 --> 01:16:29,820
It's created for the player to go through.

1317
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:32,641
And when you're done with that, then you can spend all

1318
01:16:32,641 --> 01:16:34,341
your time in multiplayer.

1319
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:37,942
And nowadays, we have to make these games that have so much

1320
01:16:37,942 --> 01:16:38,542
stuff in them.

1321
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:41,563
We have to have a really great multiplayer segment of the

1322
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:44,204
game, we have to have a really great single-player segment.

1323
01:16:44,204 --> 01:16:48,245
We spend a lot of time and money developing both of these,

1324
01:16:48,245 --> 01:16:50,906
and we really have to look at it and say, well, these are

1325
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,446
really almost two different games.

1326
01:16:52,857 --> 01:16:55,218
We're creating one game for one person to go through,

1327
01:16:55,218 --> 01:16:58,719
to follow a story, and have a certain experience, which

1328
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,100
is very different than a multiplayer game.

1329
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:05,022
And now, it's almost like developing two games nowadays,

1330
01:17:05,022 --> 01:17:08,443
because the expectations are so high for these multimedia

1331
01:17:08,443 --> 01:17:10,944
extravaganzas that we're creating.

1332
01:17:10,944 --> 01:17:13,625
And it costs more money to create them, too.

1333
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:17,087
The multiplayer thing is definitely getting stronger,

1334
01:17:17,087 --> 01:17:18,507
just like Chris said.

1335
01:17:18,507 --> 01:17:21,728
But I can't see it taken away from the single-player game.

1336
01:17:21,965 --> 01:17:25,768
When I got Dark Forces, I played it, I loved it,

1337
01:17:25,768 --> 01:17:27,189
got finished with it, and I did not

1338
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:29,390
feel bad that it didn't have multiplayer because that's not

1339
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,331
what it was all about.

1340
01:17:30,331 --> 01:17:30,751
And it's really-

1341
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,913
It's basically your fault there's

1342
01:17:33,913 --> 01:17:35,614
a multiplayer expectation.

1343
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:35,994
Yeah.

1344
01:17:35,994 --> 01:17:39,276
Well, the thing is, every game doesn't

1345
01:17:39,276 --> 01:17:42,598
have to do the exact same thing as the last game.

1346
01:17:42,598 --> 01:17:45,660
As long as enough games come out and everybody's satisfied,

1347
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,180
that's cool.

1348
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:48,502
You don't have to say that one game comes out

1349
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:50,263
and it is better than everything else before it.

1350
01:17:51,845 --> 01:17:55,086
I agree. I think there's going to be both markets.

1351
01:17:55,086 --> 01:17:59,147
In fact, I think the single-player market will continue to be

1352
01:17:59,147 --> 01:18:01,708
the dominant and actually the bigger for quite some time.

1353
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:04,869
But I always set little bogies for myself.

1354
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:09,450
One of the things that I'm trying to do is I want to displace

1355
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:15,732
every game of solitaire that's being played in the business class on airlines.

1356
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:18,353
If I can do that with one of my games,

1357
01:18:18,353 --> 01:18:21,053
I'll consider that to be a suitable.

1358
01:18:21,537 --> 01:18:22,698
bogey to have achieved.

1359
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:22,918
That's cool.

1360
01:18:22,918 --> 01:18:23,758
Well, it's been a real pleasure for me,

1361
01:18:23,758 --> 01:18:39,247
and I hope it was a real pleasure for you.

1362
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:42,469
And I'm firmly convinced more than ever

1363
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:46,011
that these really are legends of computer gaming.
