00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,492
Hi, welcome to the GDC Summer 2020 session,

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,234
Accessibility Best Practices in Game Communication.

3
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:20,197
I'm Karen Stephens and I'm EA's Sports Accessibility Lead.

4
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:27,261
Now, before I go into detail, general disclaimer. This is purely a best practices presentation

5
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:33,004
based on observations and experiences. It is no way a promise as to how past, present,

6
00:00:33,104 --> 00:00:37,266
or future games may or may not be made. Also, if you have any questions that are

7
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:42,189
legal related, please talk to your local legal counsel. I'm not a lawyer and I'm not authorized

8
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:46,711
to make any sort of recommendations along those lines. So, disclaimer out of the way.

9
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:48,812
What is accessibility?

10
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:54,390
I consider accessibility the correction of a mismatch between a person and their environment.

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,750
This is more than just disability.

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:02,751
This includes things like if a tall person can't fit in an airplane seat, well, they

13
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:04,192
have an accessibility problem.

14
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:09,573
Or if a deaf person needs captions in order to follow something, that's also an accessibility

15
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:09,933
problem.

16
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:13,433
I happen to be deaf, so that one's pretty near and dear to my heart.

17
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:18,174
In general, if settings are not accessible, then they may as well not exist.

18
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:24,243
So for a game such as Madden, we have added in the concept of a welcome screen.

19
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:31,192
This means that as soon as you get into the game, as soon as the game boots, before it's even fully

20
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:36,758
installed, there's a settings screen that lets you turn on all the really important settings.

21
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,540
for people with disabilities.

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,621
This can include volume control,

23
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:42,983
this can include the in-game communication

24
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:44,545
things we'll be talking about today.

25
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,947
And this allows people

26
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:48,568
to turn on the settings they need

27
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:49,969
before the game even begins.

28
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,691
And I can tell you from a captioning perspective

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,933
how important that is, because I have sat

30
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:56,194
through many intros of games

31
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,476
and not have been able to turn on captioning

32
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,658
until well later in the game

33
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:01,559
and by then I'm lost.

34
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,091
This is true of all settings.

35
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:07,394
It's really, really important that they're there from the very beginning.

36
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:11,136
And if you're wondering, why even have an accessibility menu?

37
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:15,820
Well, it's true that technically all user settings are accessibility settings.

38
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,862
However, especially when it comes to early install,

39
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:22,185
not all of those settings will always be available.

40
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:24,266
So for the case of Madden,

41
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:30,869
Every setting we considered super important for that type of scenario, we had gathered up into

42
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:35,331
the accessibility settings screen. Now, some of those settings are actually in other screens as

43
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:40,474
well, such as volume control. But this means we can guarantee that those settings are available

44
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:45,356
in a wide variety of places at any given point in time without having to worry about any other

45
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:49,478
technical complication. So, it greatly simplified the problem formatting in particular.

46
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:55,276
FIFA, this is a screen from FIFA, also has an accessibility screen.

47
00:02:55,817 --> 00:03:00,880
Now, we're going to talk a little bit briefly today about the importance of legibility of

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,642
fonts and other things for in-game communication.

49
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:08,706
I will say that I gave a GDC talk several years ago about Madden accessibility.

50
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,469
that covers this in great detail.

51
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,791
And I strongly recommend going back through

52
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:14,232
and watching those presentations,

53
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:16,634
because it even concludes how to use this

54
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,996
and source code in the actual presentation file.

55
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:21,858
So I recommend looking at those for more information,

56
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:23,639
because we really don't have time to cover it here,

57
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,340
but it is a really important topic.

58
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:30,060
For Madden and many other EA titles,

59
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,761
we believe in putting the accessibility menu

60
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:34,202
in as many places as possible.

61
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:36,944
For here, for example, is a way to get to it

62
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:37,844
from a pause menu.

63
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,387
It's important to be able to, for any setting,

64
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:43,348
including those for in-game communication,

65
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,170
being able to get into those settings.

66
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,811
And as you see here, we actually have icons,

67
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:51,733
and those icons are to help those who have trouble reading

68
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,455
but can follow icons much easier

69
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,696
to be able to easily find those settings.

70
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:01,808
So I've already mentioned in-game communication quite a few times.

71
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:06,013
Also, it's in the presentation title, so you're probably wondering what I mean by that.

72
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:12,200
The goal here is to allow players to communicate with one another in an accessible way.

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,527
This can include voice chat, text chat, canned chat, contextual chat, emotes, and more.

74
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:23,521
Navigation is also important because, again, if you can't get to these settings and use them,

75
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:30,303
they're not very helpful. So menu narration is one way of handling navigation for people who

76
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:35,085
have different types of vision issues. But before I get into any more details, since this will come

77
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:43,868
up and there's always a good time to discuss it, legible font. Legible font is one of the biggest

78
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:47,310
issues we have for accessibility in the game industry at this time.

79
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:51,358
I recommend a minimum of 28 pixel tall,

80
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:53,899
3 pixel wide font on a 1080p screen,

81
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,080
and that comes from a variety of user research.

82
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,341
That may seem rather big,

83
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,882
but if you're talking about the television industry,

84
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,943
their minimum font size recommendations on things like

85
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:09,385
captioning is actually 80 pixels tall in this scenario.

86
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,247
28 pixels really isn't very big.

87
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:14,968
We recommend a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio or better.

88
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:19,408
I actually have a slide at the very end that links to a tool to find this out.

89
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:23,774
But basically this means you have to have enough contrast between your text and your

90
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:27,979
background so it stands out enough so people have the best chance of being able to see

91
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:28,080
it.

92
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:29,601
So keep that in mind.

93
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:35,093
Also recommend for all types of venues, including those relating to game communication,

94
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:41,595
use sans-serif fonts, so things without a lot of flourishes. Examples could be Arial, Helvetica,

95
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:46,216
Verdana, and Comic Sans. This presentation is actually in Verdana, and I can guarantee you

96
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:50,818
that everything on this presentation is 4.5 to 1 contrast or better. I highly recommend

97
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:52,818
using these types of fonts.

98
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,595
Comic Sans tends to get a bad reputation, but really,

99
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:59,938
it's a very, very good font, particularly for dyslexia.

100
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,140
Those with dyslexia have trouble distinguishing different

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,082
characters, and the way Comic Sans is made makes it very easy

102
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:09,585
for them to use, more so than most actual fonts made

103
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:10,246
for dyslexia.

104
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:12,327
So, I highly recommend that.

105
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:14,969
Keep in mind that font is so important in so many places

106
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,691
that like the defense industry, a lot of places insist

107
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:20,653
on using that font for all business documents simply

108
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,135
because it's easy to read.

109
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:23,937
So keep that in mind.

110
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:27,700
It is okay to have alternate fonts.

111
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,722
So if you have a fancy font that fits your game style,

112
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,584
it's okay to do that, but it's highly recommended

113
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:36,946
to have an option to turn that off, which I've seen more

114
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:38,988
and more games, and that's really a great thing.

115
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,531
If nobody can read your text, then again, it's sort of

116
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:43,832
like it may as well not exist.

117
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:46,294
So none of us are sitting down and saying,

118
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,315
let's make games people can't play,

119
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,116
or let's make menus people can't use.

120
00:06:50,517 --> 00:06:52,218
So it's important to keep these things in mind.

121
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:58,073
Resize is recommended, however, that's not a pass to say you should have super tiny font to begin with.

122
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:06,019
I do recommend having larger fonts like these minimum sizes. It's okay to make your resize go smaller.

123
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:10,014
but just keep in mind that that shouldn't necessarily be the default.

124
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:12,215
When it comes to subtitling,

125
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:14,957
you do want to make sure you don't cover the entire screen.

126
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,818
But at the same point in time,

127
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:20,340
for most text, there really is no maximum size.

128
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,422
If you make an okay button that fills the entire screen,

129
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,663
technically speaking, that's perfectly fine.

130
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:30,226
You're probably wondering when I'm going to get to the topic of menu narration.

131
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:35,585
This means, menu narration means providing an audible way

132
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:38,145
of navigating menus and game experiences.

133
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:41,466
The primary audiences are for people who are blind,

134
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,787
low vision, have cognitive issues,

135
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,647
sensory processing issues, or just those

136
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,288
who just in general have issues reading.

137
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:49,468
Maybe they don't know English

138
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,008
or whatever language your game is in.

139
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:52,729
These help all those groups.

140
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:58,090
One thing to keep in mind is that wording matters.

141
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:09,037
Now, when you're doing menu narration, you have to describe everything that's on the screen in some useful way, particularly the areas that involve navigation.

142
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:20,000
This includes things like specifying what the control names are, what they do, what their current setting is, and that's actually the setting current setting is actually really important.

143
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,602
Let's say you're going up to a light switch in a room and that light switch controls the light in a different room.

144
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:28,824
If you're turning it on and off, if you walk up to a switch,

145
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,145
and it's just a button, and it says toggle light switch,

146
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:32,486
is the light on?

147
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:33,627
Is the light off?

148
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:35,109
Are you turning the light on?

149
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:36,430
There's no way to know.

150
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,831
The same problems exist in games.

151
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,073
It's important to say what the current setting is.

152
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,376
But it's also okay, let's say if you have something

153
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,698
like a slider, to shorten it while you're using the thing.

154
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:49,460
So let's say you have, you say at the beginning,

155
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,902
you have a slider and the current value set is 50.

156
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:53,103
That's fine.

157
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:55,195
Let's say you're sliding the slider.

158
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:56,495
You don't have to say that every time.

159
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:57,576
You can say 51, 52.

160
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,557
That's perfectly acceptable.

161
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:02,098
So keep that in mind.

162
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,339
It is also important to narrate items

163
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:07,701
that require user action that are not navigatable.

164
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,502
It is recommended to make everything navigatable,

165
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:13,404
but if that doesn't fit your needs,

166
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:15,645
then it's okay to narrate things

167
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:17,225
when the screen first loads.

168
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:19,447
So, but that's still important to do.

169
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:24,687
If you need more examples or would like more examples beyond what this presentation covers today,

170
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:28,651
I highly recommend trying turning on Windows narrator.

171
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:33,194
If you type in in the start menu narrator, you can find out how to turn it on very easily.

172
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:39,479
And it will narrate your PC the way a blind person would be navigating it.

173
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,986
And I will say that our design teams for everything

174
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,567
I showed you today did that.

175
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:47,968
If you have an Apple, then you can use VoiceOver.

176
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,468
It does the equivalent.

177
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:53,169
And in fact, even mobile apps have the ability

178
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:53,969
to do screen reading.

179
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,550
So I recommend turning on your platform of choice

180
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,791
and using that to determine more examples of how

181
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,451
things should sound.

182
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,812
Because there are many different options.

183
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,033
And the more information you have,

184
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:09,213
the better choices you'll make.

185
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:15,198
So that said, let's listen to what pre-recorded mini narration sounds like in a game.

186
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:31,219
Settings and Accessibility.

187
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,263
Press LBRB to navigate accessibility categories.

188
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,945
Visual accessibility.

189
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,246
Color blindness.

190
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:39,067
Default.

191
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:40,628
Protanopia.

192
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:41,589
Red weak.

193
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,992
Audio accessibility.

194
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,293
Master volume.

195
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:47,214
Nine.

196
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:51,338
One option to quickly turn off all audio on or off.

197
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:52,119
Ten.

198
00:10:55,915 --> 00:11:06,767
Your NHL experience. I am new to sports gaming. This offers controls NHL 94 two button controls. Only basic actions available.

199
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:11,471
Difficulty rookie, you are new to the game.

200
00:11:13,193 --> 00:11:17,438
Gameplay presets preset to traditional four minute periods.

201
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:28,497
NHL 20 settings. Thank you for setting up your hospitality settings. You can make changes to these at a later time by visiting the settings screen. Go back and continue.

202
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:38,880
So in case you're wondering, this is actually the initial experience for NHL, which is why it's called the hospitality screen. The hospitality screen and the welcome screen are essentially the same thing.

203
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:43,834
Now, potential benefits of pre-recording your menu narration.

204
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,617
It's relatively straightforward to add to the game.

205
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:51,181
You can add it roughly the way you would add any other sound effect to an option.

206
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:57,046
It does sound exactly as intended because it's literally a recorded voice.

207
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:01,130
The biggest drawback is that it needs updating

208
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,171
when the menus change.

209
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:04,093
If you don't keep them up to date,

210
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:06,376
then your narration may not match

211
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:09,078
what is actually going on, or you may

212
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,820
have gaps and missing audio.

213
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,524
So it can be a lot of overhead to have

214
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:17,487
to keep on rerecording things as they get updated over time.

215
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:21,764
It also, if your game has a lot of menus and you want to narrate them,

216
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:23,784
it may require a lot of audio files.

217
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,285
And I will say, if you're wondering what to narrate,

218
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,867
it makes a lot of sense to be able to narrate to get into the game

219
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:32,267
and also to be able to get to all the settings.

220
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:37,609
Because those settings do matter for being able to use your game

221
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,171
and also be able to modify the way you communicate with other players.

222
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,912
So keep that in mind that those are both very important.

223
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:49,131
Now, the flip side to pre-recorded menu narration is generated.

224
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:51,373
So, let's listen to what that sounds like.

225
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:57,477
Now, Enlarge on field graphics op, Enlarge on field graphics option is set to off.

226
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:01,400
Enlarge on field graphics option is set to on.

227
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,363
Con, Bright, Voip, Pass, Audio mix option is set to custom.

228
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:09,145
Audio mix option is set to broadcast.

229
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,346
In game commentary set to 100.

230
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:11,527
Set to 99.

231
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:15,896
Set to 98.

232
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:17,557
Depth 1.

233
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:19,477
Name R. Wilson.

234
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:21,438
Position Kugi.

235
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:23,438
Morale modified.

236
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,418
Morale 50.

237
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:26,319
Speed rating 86.

238
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:28,219
Acceleration rating 9.

239
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:29,800
Agility rating 9.

240
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,800
R. Wilson 90.

241
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,720
AHBU have four options.

242
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,460
C. Carson 87.

243
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,061
Overall is selected.

244
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,841
R. Penny 78 overall.

245
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:40,742
Now,

246
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:44,860
The most obvious thing I'm sure you've noticed is it may sound robotic,

247
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,542
because it is literally a robotic voice.

248
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:52,524
On the plus side, this actually lends itself to audio speed adjustments.

249
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:57,347
If hypothetically you ever wanted to make, speed up the audio,

250
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,208
it's actually designed to be sped up.

251
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:08,095
If a blind user is using a PC, for example, they typically have the audio set to many times

252
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:14,962
what standard speech is. So it's like a super fast micro-machines commercial. That's just how

253
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:21,328
blind users are used to using their PCs. So the ability to have that option to put that in your

254
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:22,769
game is really powerful.

255
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:27,257
It also, it may not sound that odd to those who are expecting it.

256
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:30,037
This tool that we use in Madden is called Flight.

257
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,038
And I will have links to it later.

258
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:34,039
Of course, you're welcome to use it in your own games.

259
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,239
It's a third party type tool.

260
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,641
And this tool is used in many different games.

261
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:45,783
So because of that, when they heard it, the gamers heard it, they're like, oh, we do use

262
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,603
Flight, didn't you?

263
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,124
And they totally expected it.

264
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:49,484
They accepted what it sounded like.

265
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,685
It wasn't a problem at all.

266
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,563
So yes, it does sound robotic, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

267
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:00,008
So pluses in general, no audio files are required.

268
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:05,613
This means that we can change the menus as many times as we want,

269
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,316
and it will always be exactly up to date.

270
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:11,238
There are no additional recordings of audio required.

271
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:15,168
Deep UI integration can result in great coverage.

272
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:20,409
In Madden 20, we literally did this at the low of a level as possible.

273
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,610
We narrated a button,

274
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,890
we narrated a slider,

275
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,050
we narrated a table,

276
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,331
and you saw some of those things in the video.

277
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:30,332
This meant that it wasn't just that one slider we did,

278
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,352
which is what it would be if we did prerecorded,

279
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:35,593
it was literally every slider in the entire game.

280
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:39,153
Same thing with button, literally every button in the entire game.

281
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,512
This meant that we have an enormous amount of coverage

282
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:44,614
for this in Madden,

283
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,737
with really not a lot of additional work.

284
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,539
The original work was put in

285
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,502
to be able to get to all the settings

286
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:52,665
for especially accessibility,

287
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,987
but in general, all the settings,

288
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,030
be able to get into the game.

289
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,263
and then we saw where we were at there.

290
00:15:58,363 --> 00:15:59,964
And the answer was very, very far.

291
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:03,905
But then it seemed weird that things like the depth chart

292
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:07,306
you saw earlier, also the one where you were listing

293
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:09,467
what the quarterbacks were, that's a table

294
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,348
and that's not in that critical path.

295
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,228
But the team is like, we've gotten this far,

296
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:14,129
we have to do this too.

297
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:18,630
So that's why so much of Madden is done,

298
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,851
but most of it was not like done as a,

299
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:22,712
we must make sure this entire screen is done.

300
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,432
It was done at the widget level.

301
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:28,158
and just huge amounts of the game turned on all at the same time.

302
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,588
Now, the drawbacks is that it is more technically challenging to integrate it this way.

303
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:41,497
For example, you have to actually take that text, send it to a module,

304
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:46,358
that module translates it into audio, it sends it back, and then you have to play that audio,

305
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:49,279
which is simpler than just pushing a button and playing audio.

306
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,060
I'm sorry, it's more complicated than pushing a button and playing audio.

307
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,440
So that's important to keep in mind.

308
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,621
There is processing power required for doing this.

309
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:03,262
In fact, to the point where if you're wondering why Madden does not have

310
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:09,677
narration, like Madden 20 does not have many narration while the ball is physically in play,

311
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,358
it's because there is just not quite enough processing power to be able to handle that

312
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:20,380
at that time. So there are technical challenges. It is possible to use cloud services, and in that

313
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,961
case, you would actually take the text, send it to the cloud, the cloud translates it, and it

314
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:30,202
sends it back. That does reduce the amount of processing power required. However,

315
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:33,658
it does require transactions, and there's latency.

316
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:36,639
And you don't necessarily have a lot of control

317
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:37,960
of how long that takes.

318
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,961
So it's possible that by the time the audio comes back,

319
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,022
it's not very timely.

320
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,783
If you do use a locally generated tool,

321
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:48,384
it will generally be more timely than a cloud.

322
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,546
Also, clouds have transaction fees.

323
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:54,459
Not all, but most I've seen do.

324
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:56,560
So it's important to keep in mind that

325
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,501
every time something is translated, it may have a cost.

326
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:06,724
There may be a subscription fee or some other types of monetization that you have to take account of.

327
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,685
So that's also important to know.

328
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:11,306
Language support may be limited,

329
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,386
and it varies on tool.

330
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:15,467
Some tools do more than others.

331
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,028
English is the most popular, but

332
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:19,669
just keep that in mind that

333
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,690
which tool you pick may limit the languages you can follow.

334
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,972
Moving on from menu narration,

335
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:34,398
text tab is literally being able to enter text using

336
00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:37,500
a keyboard-style interface or literal keyboard,

337
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,841
and being able to enter it into the screen.

338
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:46,439
Now, the funny thing is I actually had a really hard time getting a picture of a keyboard and text at the same time,

339
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,861
because most games use system-level keyboards.

340
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:56,466
And there are benefits in doing that, but it also means that if you're using a system-level keyboard, it doesn't screen capture very well.

341
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:59,167
So, covering what text chat is.

342
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,472
Avoid holding down multiple buttons.

343
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:04,873
This is actually true of games in general,

344
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:07,974
because you don't know how much dexterity a person has.

345
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:10,635
And when you require them to hold something at an angle,

346
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:13,236
they may not be able to accurately do that.

347
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,657
So it's pushing one button at a time or one direction

348
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:19,918
at a time and confirming works much better

349
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:23,299
than just attempting to say, yeah, hold this over

350
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,480
and angle it and hit A and then angle it again.

351
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,360
It gets harder.

352
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:32,122
Stay in the game. It's important to not require somebody,

353
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:34,443
because this is using a multiplayer scenario,

354
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,764
to pause the game, leave the game,

355
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:39,445
to enter, not necessarily leave,

356
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:41,265
but pause the actual gameplay,

357
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,246
and enter text that way.

358
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,827
It should happen while they can still tell what's going on.

359
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:55,001
Potential window options to make this more friendly may include position, size, transparency, and we will look at that in a minute.

360
00:19:55,702 --> 00:20:00,567
Chat history and scrolling is also important, especially if you have lots of people talking at the same time.

361
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:05,572
You should have some amount of history, maybe 100 lines or so, that people can scroll back to.

362
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,086
Keyboard narration matters.

363
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:10,467
If you're using system-level keyboards,

364
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,029
which is one of the reasons why they're popular,

365
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,330
they come with menu narration.

366
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,631
You don't have to add anything.

367
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,132
It's already directly supported

368
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:18,453
and generally works really well.

369
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:19,974
So keep that in mind.

370
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:22,516
If you do not use a system keyboard,

371
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:24,437
it is important to narrate it yourself.

372
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,479
And also keep in mind that yes,

373
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:33,565
blind people or people who are unable to read may still be using a keyboard. That is still a

374
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:40,028
scenario. You don't necessarily know why people are using a feature. For example, I know that

375
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:45,710
text chat is very popular among women because there is a lot of toxicity in the gaming space still,

376
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:53,073
and it avoids harassment if they do not voice themselves. So that makes synthesized really,

377
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:57,795
really popular. And speaking about it, there's a lot of overlap between text chat and voice chat.

378
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:03,800
Because when you're doing accessible communication and you're doing text chat,

379
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,722
it's important that you narrate the text chat too.

380
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:09,003
We'll talk about how those two overlap.

381
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,005
Here's an example of voice chat.

382
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:17,115
Now, important things are the icons that show who's talking.

383
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:21,316
If somebody is deaf, they may not even realize chat is happening.

384
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:25,357
So it's important to show that this is the person talking and have some sort of thing.

385
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:28,198
Here you see a little headset next to my icon.

386
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm F. And that lets people know that I'm talking.

387
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,941
And that lets people who cannot hear know they have to turn this menu on.

388
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:43,260
Now, for a game such as Madden, voice chat and text chat output to the same screen,

389
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,644
meaning that when you type things in with text in your chat window, it shows up on the screen

390
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:52,826
that shows the text history, and you can scroll through and see everybody who's talking.

391
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:56,328
If I was to talk and somebody had

392
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,951
transcription turned on, so they had speech to text turned on instead of text to speech,

393
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:05,333
it would show all of my text in the exact same window.

394
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:08,915
It's highly recommended to actually combine those all to the same window.

395
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:12,917
So there's only one place someone has to look to see in-game communication.

396
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:16,719
And from their perspective, the perspective of somebody who's deaf,

397
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,581
it is the same information.

398
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:22,283
It really doesn't matter where it came from, if it was spoken or typed,

399
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:23,963
it's the same information.

400
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:24,944
Now...

401
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,925
Vice versa is also important.

402
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,366
So not just the ability to capture text,

403
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,928
but you have to be able to narrate this text too.

404
00:22:34,848 --> 00:22:37,510
Transcribed audio may use text chat for display purposes,

405
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,812
but narrating that is also an important as an option.

406
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:44,294
And you can use cloud software and things

407
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:45,154
to make this happen.

408
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:52,361
So in both ways, and I'll cover that a little bit as to what types of services are available for chat transcription.

409
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:58,186
But it's not just the transcription. It's also the narration of it. And you can go back to using that tool.

410
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:02,690
Let's say it's English for flight that I said. There are other tools out there that support other languages.

411
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:07,568
But I do highly recommend that it goes both ways,

412
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:10,310
that they're options, and they should not be tied to one other.

413
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,291
Anybody should be able to enter text,

414
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:15,813
and anybody should be able to see anything that was entered,

415
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:19,855
and everyone should be able to hear, if they want to,

416
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:23,298
the text chat and the Audible chat.

417
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:27,560
Now, it is perfectly okay to not do all that at the same time

418
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,661
and to make those separate settings.

419
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:35,396
Just the important thing to remember is that both of those are important ways of consuming

420
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:41,563
information and both those are ways of producing information, speech and writing. So keep that in

421
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:48,772
mind. So for an example of what voice chat with transcription sounds like, this video is actually

422
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:49,933
muted so I can speak through it.

423
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:55,548
And what you see here is a menu in this text window in Madden,

424
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:58,470
which could be either text or voice input.

425
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,793
You can't tell because that does not show the screen keyboard.

426
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:06,876
And you can actually change the position and the transparency

427
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,878
of this window anywhere you watch.

428
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:11,100
When you go in game, you can decide

429
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,161
if contrast is more important to you

430
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:15,583
or seeing the game behind it is more important to you.

431
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:18,605
So then it becomes a relatively seamless experience

432
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,226
where somebody is able to.

433
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:26,752
have a chat, follow what's going on, and still be able to play with somebody else with minimal interruption.

434
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:34,839
Now, another thing that's useful is canned chat. This is an example from Anthem of what canned

435
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:42,445
chat may look like. In this case, it's a wheel. It is often the form of a list or a wheel. NHL uses a list.

436
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:46,020
You often have preselected phrases,

437
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,422
and the nice thing about that is that you don't have to type those in.

438
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:54,045
It's still important if you have can chat to also support text chat,

439
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,286
because not everything is covered by can chat.

440
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,068
Phrases can be context-based.

441
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:01,149
For example, in football, it's okay if offense and

442
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:04,431
defense have different canned phrases available, for example.

443
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:08,274
As always, avoid holding down multiple buttons,

444
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:09,975
including sticks and D-pads,

445
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,936
because you don't know what people can do.

446
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:15,736
So here's an example of canned chat in progress.

447
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:18,237
I will say the first half of this video

448
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:23,199
is the ability to see how it looks

449
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:24,519
when somebody else is using it.

450
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,500
Then the second half of the video

451
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,540
is the examples of it being used.

452
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:33,982
Helmet here, level one, cancel that.

453
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:37,923
I think this place could use a looting.

454
00:25:40,627 --> 00:25:41,648
Making contact with enemy.

455
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,230
Promise, let's move this way.

456
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,331
I hope you're with me.

457
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:48,855
I'm gonna raid this area here.

458
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:50,856
Too slow.

459
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:51,797
Gotta hop up here.

460
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:53,239
Nevermind.

461
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:54,960
Gotta hop up here.

462
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,041
Got my eyes on this sector.

463
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:57,102
Let's go over here.

464
00:25:58,503 --> 00:25:59,084
God company.

465
00:25:59,124 --> 00:25:59,244
Yep.

466
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:05,971
The interesting thing about Apex, it actually has a ping system, so it's contextualized.

467
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:10,914
So you may have noticed there that the cursor is over various objects on the screen,

468
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:16,439
and I could say, talk about this, more or less, and it would give information specific to that.

469
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,443
So an example I gave before of the, maybe it's the offense or defense halves of a sports game,

470
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:25,686
it could be, I'm pointing to this object, tell me about it.

471
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:30,940
Another important thing is the ability to customize this chat.

472
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:34,664
So here in Apex, I should say, it

473
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:39,808
is a list of options you can pick from

474
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,209
and a list of what you want to see.

475
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:44,092
It allows you to add some flavor as to what types of things

476
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:45,413
you might want to say quickly.

477
00:26:46,431 --> 00:26:50,875
and that really helps to be even more beneficial if there is a way to actually add to your own text.

478
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:56,140
But considering it's using NPC type voices to voice these things, that's perfectly fine.

479
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:02,866
But it's just a way for people to customize how they want to communicate with others.

480
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:06,665
One last thing to talk about is emotes.

481
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,111
Emotes are basically a way of having a gesture

482
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:14,480
to be able to explain what someone is thinking.

483
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,824
So it may be a way, they may be, come over here.

484
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:21,795
that those can all be in the same type of window

485
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,536
as we saw before for CanChat.

486
00:27:24,137 --> 00:27:26,499
It's also important to narrate all of those as well.

487
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,601
Because if you don't narrate the different options,

488
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:31,142
people aren't going to know they're there

489
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:32,043
and how to use them.

490
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:35,406
And the whole point here is to make communication

491
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:37,027
as accessible as possible.

492
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:40,310
So for an example of what an emote looks like here

493
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,631
is a clip from Anthem.

494
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:59,806
So as you see, it's a quick little emote, but it's really helpful just to give another

495
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,206
way for people to communicate.

496
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,788
Now before we wrap this up, I'm going to push this point again, legible font.

497
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:11,469
None of these menu options matter if people can't see them.

498
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,811
It is really, really important to have legible font throughout your entire game.

499
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:20,552
Ideally on a 1080p screen, at least 28 pixels tall, 3 pixels wide.

500
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,113
It's okay if it's larger.

501
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:26,366
The 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio is also super important,

502
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:30,370
along with having simplified fonts and resize when available.

503
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,574
So just saying that again, if you catch nothing other point,

504
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:36,755
remember that.

505
00:28:38,797 --> 00:28:44,979
So I'm sure you're interested in what tools we're using. For the menu narration that is

506
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:51,902
roboticized, it is flight, which is the cmuflight.org. I recommend pausing this video or going to the

507
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:58,905
slides themselves in order to get this information. Most of EA's games is using IBM Watson for its

508
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:02,386
text-to-speech, speech-to-text. And that means it's using it for the

509
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:09,163
taking and transcribing people's voices into text and also it's using it for

510
00:29:10,264 --> 00:29:16,571
taking that text and then making it audible for specifically in-game communication and

511
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:20,376
having an actual voice conversation. So it uses Watson both ways.

512
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:23,737
I will know that there are other tools out there.

513
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:26,300
I know Xbox One has some good things built in,

514
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,841
as does Windows 10.

515
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:31,104
So keep in mind, there are other tools out there.

516
00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:32,325
Do a little investigation.

517
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:34,186
This is just simply what we're using at EA.

518
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:40,098
For additional tools, I do recommend contrast-ratio.com.

519
00:29:40,418 --> 00:29:41,859
Just use a little eyedropper and paint

520
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:43,200
and find out what your values are.

521
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,802
And this tool takes RGB and it takes hex.

522
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:49,285
And it lets you determine if you're at least 4.5 to 1.

523
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,287
If you're not, I strongly recommend

524
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:54,529
increasing your contrast until you reach it.

525
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,791
I do have, like I said, other presentations

526
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:57,671
that cover these things.

527
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:00,914
So please look in the GDC Vault. For more information

528
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:04,436
on EA's titles, EA.com slash able.

529
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:11,471
has lots of information there. If you're looking to contact me, EA underscore accessible on Twitter

530
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:17,435
is the best way. If you want to give feedback on games, I strongly recommend using the EA.com

531
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:21,517
slash able accessibility portal. We do have more information there.

532
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:24,473
for being able to submit bugs and things.

533
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:25,734
And those get in the database,

534
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,716
and they're extremely hard for us to lose.

535
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:30,499
You can also email me at abel.ea.com,

536
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,102
but keep in mind that as I pass emails along,

537
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:35,464
after a while they kind of get lost in the shuffle.

538
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:38,907
So I strongly recommend using the portal whenever possible.

539
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:41,910
So thank you so much for coming to the presentation.

540
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,332
I hope that you have...

541
00:30:45,572 --> 00:30:47,255
lots of good information you pulled out of it.

542
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:49,919
I do have an Ask Me Anything session

543
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:51,021
scheduled for later in the week.

544
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:53,024
So feel free to join me there

545
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:54,747
if you wish to ask any questions.

546
00:30:54,907 --> 00:30:56,149
And thank you again for your time.

547
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:56,870
Bye.
