1
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:09,120
All right, that thing works, okay.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,522
We'll get started.

3
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:17,071
Hello everyone, welcome to this presentation

4
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:18,894
that is not about Zelda, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:27,159
really. Thank you all guys for being here. I know there's a lot of exciting stuff on the side and

6
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:33,886
I really appreciate that you come to my talk. Before I begin, I was told to remind you to

7
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:40,933
please switch your phones to silent mode and please don't forget to rate the session at the

8
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,735
end. That really helps us a lot.

9
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:49,666
All right, so today I will talk about a small game that I've been making for almost 7 years now

10
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,031
that is called Transformice.

11
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:57,197
Before I begin, let me introduce you to it with this short video for those who don't know it.

12
00:01:57,876 --> 00:02:05,118
here. So that is Transformice. So Transformice is about now 75

13
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:11,839
million icons created. Almost 2 million active players a month.

14
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:16,761
1.5 million Facebook fans. No, we didn't buy any. And the game

15
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:22,862
is now translated into 20 languages. And that is how the

16
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:25,183
team looked like by the end of the last year.

17
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,261
So how did it get there?

18
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:31,782
In 2010, my friend Jean-Baptiste and I

19
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:34,903
were full-time employed at a French video game company.

20
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:39,164
Him as a programmer and me as a graphic designer.

21
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:41,444
We weren't very satisfied with our day jobs

22
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:45,045
and we wanted to make a small game on our free time.

23
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:47,446
Jean-Baptiste had a history of creating

24
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:48,806
small browser games for fun

25
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:53,927
and he asked for my help in order to create a new one

26
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:54,988
with better graphics.

27
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:59,815
It all came from a silly life experience.

28
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:06,497
I was sleeping at a friend's house and some rodents kept scratching against the wall all

29
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:08,057
through the night.

30
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:14,318
And I imagined them climbing on the top of each other in order to get, in order to overcome

31
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,019
obstacles and reach a potential cheese.

32
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,742
I proposed the idea to John Batiste,

33
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:25,126
where the players would be mice that transform themselves

34
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:28,989
into planks and crates in order to help the other players.

35
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,432
And he liked the idea instantly,

36
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:35,895
and that's how the name Transform Mice was born.

37
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:43,846
We realized pretty early on the prototype that when you were too few players, everybody would

38
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:49,428
turn into a plank and nothing really happened. This wasn't very fun, so instead of

39
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:55,931
transforming players, we gave them, we gave the ability to summon physical objects to one

40
00:03:55,931 --> 00:04:02,494
mouse at a time, the almighty shaman mouse, obviously. But the name Transformice stuck

41
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:06,716
because we liked it and it had no results on Google.

42
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:13,119
In about three weeks, we had, thanks to reusing some bricks

43
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,583
of code that Jean-Baptiste made earlier,

44
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:20,487
we had a working prototype, like that.

45
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,930
We launched the game on May the 1st of 2010,

46
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,975
and we posted the link to a small French video game forum.

47
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:30,663
The first week was a great success.

48
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:32,445
We had a couple hundred players

49
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:35,148
and they were completely addicted.

50
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:37,891
We quickly added an account system

51
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:40,574
to keep track of all the cheese you gathered

52
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:46,140
and we started to add hats for your mouse to wear

53
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,343
that you could buy against the cheese you gathered.

54
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:57,178
But then a couple weeks later, a huge forum called Something Awful, they found out about this.

55
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:01,120
And the game wasn't even translated in English, but they didn't care.

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,002
And a massive amount of players, they were yelling,

57
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:08,483
omelette du fromage everywhere in our little server.

58
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:13,706
And it was completely melting, and the game was unreachable for weeks.

59
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:21,781
That was a perfect moment for the press to write about us and make our server die a little more.

60
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:28,945
We got featured by Kotaku, Paper Shroudgun, IndieGames.com, PC Gamer and other websites.

61
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:35,509
The game was completely free at the time and we were paying for the servers out of our own pockets.

62
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,032
This really wasn't a viable solution because we needed to

63
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:44,055
rent a lot more servers to cope with the demand and so we

64
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:48,618
needed to earn money really fast. We didn't have time to

65
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:52,741
set up anything complicated to earn money so we went for the

66
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:56,204
fastest solution. We set up an advertising banner under the

67
00:05:56,204 --> 00:06:00,847
game because this is a browser game and we opened a PayPal

68
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:04,410
account to receive donations from the players.

69
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:12,643
Thankfully it worked. The advertising banner generated approximately $50 a day for

70
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:22,469
about 80,000 unique visitors a day. This made around $11,000 by the end of 2010. The

71
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:31,855
donations were less effective and they only generated about $3,000 in two year stops.

72
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,857
A little spoiler, but this is going to end badly.

73
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,275
and this went on for months where every single minute of our free time was taken by the game.

74
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:48,661
We took days off from our jobs to work on it and sleepless nights to fix the bugs, the

75
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:54,646
crashing servers, deal with community management and add more hats obviously. At this point

76
00:06:54,646 --> 00:07:00,410
we knew we had to make a choice. Resign and create our own company to take care of the game

77
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,994
or kill it entirely because we didn't have enough free time to take care of it.

78
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:11,580
It wasn't an obvious choice because we had comfortable positions at all the jobs and

79
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,444
even if the game started to generate some income, we didn't know if it would be enough

80
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:19,227
to sustain the two of us and the servers.

81
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:25,712
That's how we started to dive into the joys of the French administration.

82
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:30,796
We realized the amount of paperwork and knowledge it took to create a company.

83
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:37,578
And thankfully we benefited from a special program in the north of France that allowed us to

84
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:44,080
get mentoring and cheap offices. Yay! That really saved our lives. That's how one year after the

85
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:52,702
game was released we finally resigned from our jobs to create our own studio. Yay! I

86
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:57,043
initially drew the slide like that but really inside it was more like this.

87
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:02,797
It was a real scary leap of faith,

88
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:07,783
and I was super scared to let go of my day job.

89
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:10,506
But we resigned anyway, and two days later,

90
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:12,047
we were entering our new offices,

91
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:15,231
and we started working on the game full-time immediately.

92
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:18,366
Because we went full time on the game,

93
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,227
we doubled the number of active players

94
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:25,050
in less than six months from 100,000 to 200,000 players a day

95
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,652
because we decided to translate the game in every language.

96
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,913
We saw we had players in.

97
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:35,095
We had a very exotic player distribution.

98
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:38,637
More than 50% of our overall audience came from Brazil,

99
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:41,479
then United States, Turkey, France,

100
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,340
overall Latin America, Russia.

101
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:49,190
Another huge factor of the success then was the seasonal

102
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,871
events that we made in the game where the players could

103
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:56,733
drop some thematic hats and have some gameplay twist

104
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,634
and the players really loved them.

105
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,575
They became a huge part of our strategy

106
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,815
all through the game's life.

107
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,581
The advertising model was performing really great.

108
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:13,706
We jumped to $300 a day, generating more than

109
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:14,067
$100,000 for 2011.

110
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,929
So we made some calculations and we realized

111
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:21,493
we could hire one more person to work on the game.

112
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,734
We didn't hesitate one moment and we recruited

113
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:26,655
our most passionate moderator in-game

114
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:28,116
to be our community manager,

115
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:31,657
so she could answer the thousands of emails

116
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:32,697
we were getting every week

117
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,598
and manage the in-game moderators.

118
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:36,699
Everything was going great,

119
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,620
and we were very happy about it,

120
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,941
but the joy didn't last long.

121
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:47,583
On December of 2011,

122
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,123
we got banned from Google Adsense.

123
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:56,457
We really took a hit at this moment.

124
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:58,797
Since Google pays with a 60 day roll,

125
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,598
the sudden ban of our account meant

126
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:06,399
that more than $14,000 of click never got paid.

127
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,660
We were left with three salaries

128
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,181
and about 30 servers to pay for

129
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:14,541
and our main source of income had simply disappeared.

130
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:18,868
Numbers weren't adding up anymore.

131
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,128
So Jean-Baptiste and I stopped paying ourselves

132
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:23,929
for a few months in order to be able to pay for the servers

133
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,430
and the salary of our community manager

134
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,990
while working to solve this out.

135
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:33,271
Suddenly, our whole domain was blacklisted

136
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,432
without any warning or email

137
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:39,113
and not a single form available to inquire to Google.

138
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:43,374
Literally, there is absolutely no way to get in touch

139
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:45,254
with the Google Adsense staff.

140
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:51,019
your only chance is a user driven forum where people usually don't know much more than you

141
00:10:51,019 --> 00:11:00,167
about what's going on. It's only by tremendous luck that we got out of this. A friend of ours

142
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:05,813
happened to go to the same school as one of the Google employees and a couple of emails

143
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:08,455
later she managed to get us banned.

144
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:14,328
It's only then that we learned why the banning occurred.

145
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:17,288
When you read Google AdSense policies,

146
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:20,669
I mean, we do read them, right?

147
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:24,130
For different clicks and web pages away,

148
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,151
there's a little, little paragraph that says this.

149
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,652
Distance between ads and flash games.

150
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:40,644
The Google bots detected that our banner was less than 150 pixels away from a flash game and

151
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:47,331
they banned us automatically. No warning, no explanation. So small advice, when you sign

152
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:52,916
something, always read the small print and do not underestimate the power of networking.

153
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:58,081
So we re-installed the AdSense banner by February 2012,

154
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,563
but with 150 pixel, most of our audience

155
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:06,988
with low-end computers and small screen resolutions

156
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:09,109
weren't able to see it anymore.

157
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:10,831
So the numbers didn't add up,

158
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,152
and we were still pretty bitter

159
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:16,115
about how it had been handled.

160
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:20,178
So we decided not to rely on advertisement anymore,

161
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:22,479
and we were getting to go free-to-play.

162
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:29,363
We took six months to develop this with extreme caution

163
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:31,664
because it was a real shift for us.

164
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:34,686
We were very afraid, will the players hate us

165
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:35,847
for asking for money?

166
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:38,148
Will they stay in the game?

167
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:41,150
It was really hard for us to come up with price points

168
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,093
because how much were we comfortable letting people

169
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:48,956
pay within our browser-based cute little mice flash game?

170
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,497
We wanted extremely fair and ethic monetization,

171
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:57,339
making only cosmetics available and very low prices.

172
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:03,541
I completely redrew the 200 hats that we had at this moment

173
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,962
so the players could completely customize

174
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:08,123
every color of each item.

175
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:10,924
And the new currency would be strawberries,

176
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,585
opposed to the soft currency that was cheese.

177
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:18,520
At this point, we were still pretty bitter about Google

178
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,526
and we did something very stupid.

179
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:24,831
We decided to remove the ad banners completely

180
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,915
prior to the launch of the free-to-play version.

181
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:33,004
We thought that players would hate us less if we showed them that we removed this source of

182
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:39,968
income and so they wouldn't think we were sellouts. And retrospectively it was a very bad

183
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:50,793
idea. We finally released the free to play version on June 14th of 2012 and it went quite well.

184
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:56,446
The players response was truly astounding.

185
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:59,829
They were so enthusiastic to be able to support

186
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,832
the game they love and have a full color.

187
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:08,176
The first month generated more than $250,000.

188
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:10,658
We were completely astonished.

189
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:13,540
After six months of not paying ourselves,

190
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,262
sleepless nights, thinking how we failed

191
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:18,904
only a few months after founding a company,

192
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:21,846
this was a real emotional rollercoaster.

193
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:27,938
Between June and December of 2012, micro transaction generated $1,070,000 with peaks that

194
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:37,967
you see on every content, every new content, seasonal updates with more hats to buy. It was

195
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:46,635
at the end of this year that we broke our all-time concurrent record with more than

196
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,156
86,000 users online at the same time.

197
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:52,746
And for 2012, it was 1 million euros.

198
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:58,809
We quickly hired eight more people,

199
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,050
developers, community managers,

200
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,712
chief financial officer, interns,

201
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:09,934
and with about three million active players

202
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,235
and 40 servers to handle,

203
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,537
we thought it was a good team scale

204
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,698
and it would allow us to sleep a bit better.

205
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:22,255
We also moved into bigger and more expensive offices by the end of 2012. 2013 started

206
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:30,921
slowly on the money side because we hired so many people we were more often than not

207
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:36,144
close to the break even. This can also be explained by the fact that we ran a huge winter

208
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:43,169
event in December 2012 and we gave away a ton of content like hats, title, cheese, even

209
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:44,410
hot currency for free.

210
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:51,194
This was a huge mistake on our part because players can only wear that many hats at a time

211
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:53,900
and it slowed down our sales for several months.

212
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:57,448
As you can see, it became even more concerning

213
00:15:57,448 --> 00:16:02,189
around November that we decided to reactivate

214
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:03,729
the advertising banner next to the game,

215
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,490
but this time vertical instead of horizontal.

216
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,270
We saw that it wasn't disturbing our players at all,

217
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,911
and it did perform a lot better than before.

218
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:17,572
So looking back, a year and a half of ads

219
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:20,292
even performing badly was still more than $100,000,

220
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:24,453
and we were really, really stupid to get rid of it.

221
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:33,944
2013 was also the first time the number of players

222
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:37,628
was decreasing and we lost roughly 15%

223
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:42,033
of our active user base while our overall income

224
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:42,553
was 920,000 euros.

225
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:53,774
January, February being usually slow month. Then we took one of our biggest decisions, not

226
00:16:53,774 --> 00:17:00,835
to give any free hats during seasonal events anymore and sell them instead against cheese or

227
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:06,257
strawberries. We finally realized that we were basically giving too many things for free

228
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:12,038
during events and while it was very appreciated, it was really dangerous in the long term

229
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:14,138
because we had nothing to sell basically.

230
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:22,484
The decision was quite unpopular. We gave out badges and titles instead of hats but players

231
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:27,047
felt that they didn't have anything worthy to fight for anymore. Some players were happy

232
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:31,309
about it because they didn't want to play all through the evening to get the nice valentine

233
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:36,192
hat but mostly people felt that we had become sellouts.

234
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:39,935
Eventually they calmed down and slowly but surely,

235
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,477
you can see, all sales went up

236
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:45,259
and we were above break even a lot more frequently.

237
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:50,523
And while the number of players decreased again

238
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:54,786
by 15% in 2013, we were monetizing a lot better.

239
00:17:56,042 --> 00:18:01,588
So in the whole, 2014 generated around $1 million

240
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,671
in sales and advertisement, and after paying

241
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,376
for charges and taxes, our benefit was $40,000.

242
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:13,081
In the beginning of 2015, thanks to networking again,

243
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:17,065
we managed to get accepted into Steam directly.

244
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:24,307
We launched the game on January 30 and it was a bit chaotic at launch. We wanted to launch on

245
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:29,371
a Friday afternoon so we could sit on the popular new releases all weekend long. Everybody

246
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:35,657
does that. And we had everything prepared but as we pushed the button at 4 p.m.

247
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:42,482
French time, there was something missing. Like that. This button. It wasn't here. Oops.

248
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:52,807
turns out it was a bug on steam's end because the game was free. It didn't have a set price. So

249
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:59,151
the system didn't display the button that usually says buy this game. Because 4 p.m.

250
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:04,234
french time was 7 a.m. bell time. We didn't get help immediately and the game could not be

251
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:05,916
downloaded for more than two hours.

252
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:12,240
but it got better eventually and since we put some incentive in the steam version for all

253
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,663
players to download it, a little badge so they could download the steam version, we were

254
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:21,586
able to sit in the popular new releases for quite some time.

255
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,014
Launching on Steam also allowed us to get some nice press reviews,

256
00:19:27,014 --> 00:19:30,637
a thing that we didn't get for the previous five years.

257
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:34,260
All the press the game ever got prior to the Steam launch

258
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,022
was the full article that launched in 2010.

259
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:40,265
And releasing on Steam was like a new launch for the game

260
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:43,047
with YouTubers making videos about it

261
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:46,690
and the press writing nice articles.

262
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,652
It brought us a lot of credibility.

263
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:51,454
People acknowledged it as a real...

264
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:59,640
video game, you know, not just a flash toy that you play for five minutes. I'm not allowed to

265
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:07,685
share numbers here, but at the end of 2015, we got a massive amount of charge back through

266
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:14,150
steam. Since we never had any problem with paypal or mobile partner, we weren't prepared

267
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,772
for the amount of fraud the fake credit card can generate.

268
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,092
Suddenly, all players were,

269
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:24,532
they were generating,

270
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:28,154
there's an opportunity to get free strawberries

271
00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:31,655
with a simple method, and it spread like wildfire

272
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:34,076
so, so very quickly.

273
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:37,798
For a moment, we were the single game

274
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:40,859
with the most fraud of all Steam.

275
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,000
This is not a record I'm very proud of.

276
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,402
We had a huge amount of, we had to add a huge amount

277
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:51,223
of rules and checks in order to stop the disease

278
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:55,005
and we banned over 7,000 accounts,

279
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,727
including a lot of almost dedicated players in the process.

280
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:00,387
This was immensely unpopular,

281
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:02,368
but we really had no choice here.

282
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,896
Overall, I can tell you those numbers.

283
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:11,337
We had over 2.5 million icons created through Steam,

284
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,678
and 16% of those played for more than an hour,

285
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:16,098
which is superior to the browser version.

286
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:18,559
So we are very satisfied with Steam,

287
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,760
as today it makes a good part of our revenue.

288
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,241
For 2015, our income was roughly 1.2 million euros

289
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,061
for a benefit of 50,000.

290
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:34,066
For 2016, we decided to go all in in Transformice.

291
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:39,113
We wanted to favor a mechanism that all our players love,

292
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:39,994
the seasonal events.

293
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,381
We wrote and planned 52 events,

294
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:47,502
one for each week of the year

295
00:21:47,502 --> 00:21:50,122
that would cycle the next year round.

296
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,423
And for the good part of the first trimester,

297
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:54,183
it seemed like a great idea.

298
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:57,204
We never had a first three months so good

299
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,645
in all of Transformice's history.

300
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:03,426
Players engagement was high, monetization was good,

301
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:04,426
it's everything we wanted, right?

302
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:08,318
Actually, not really.

303
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:09,799
I'll make a small digression here,

304
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,402
but I think this is a common trap with free-to-play games.

305
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:14,923
We made those little events,

306
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:16,545
and they weren't very complicated to complete

307
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,226
because they were so short.

308
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:22,709
So we gave them some great rewards for them.

309
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:25,391
But if you look back a little,

310
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,553
they were like small Skinner boxes

311
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:29,094
where you did a silly thing

312
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,416
that was hardly related to the game,

313
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,257
and you got a great reward at the end.

314
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:37,801
Of course, such a mechanic makes your stats look good.

315
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,623
You have a great retention rate,

316
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:41,384
good concurrent user picks,

317
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:44,847
but ultimately the players get highly frustrated

318
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:47,749
because if they miss an event because they weren't there,

319
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:51,512
or if the newest event doesn't have as many good rewards

320
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,074
as the previous one,

321
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:56,256
and overall they only do the small, silly thing

322
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,537
in order to get the rewards,

323
00:22:57,537 --> 00:22:59,559
and then they quit the game until the next event.

324
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:06,872
why would they keep playing as the rewards are not so good after you completed the event? It

325
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:13,715
felt like an old cranky deli reward system where you log in only to collect the rewards and you

326
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:21,179
cannot miss a single day because it's going to break your streak and frankly it was shit. That

327
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,882
was not what the players were here for. We had a solid game play and we were driving players

328
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:28,383
out of this game play with that.

329
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:34,739
So by the end of March 2016, we decided to stop making

330
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:36,479
one event per week.

331
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:39,500
We wanted to focus more on the original gameplay.

332
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,981
We did longer events.

333
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:44,222
We added new currencies for other game modes

334
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,122
so the players would get an incentive

335
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,643
to play the actual game in its entirety.

336
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:52,985
We also started refactoring a lot of code

337
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:55,606
so we could focus on more core features

338
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:58,326
like the ability for someone to change their username,

339
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:00,527
opening the authentication system

340
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,668
so we could accept the API from other websites.

341
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:07,930
And the Steam launch convinced us to invest

342
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,431
in order to get the game on as many portal as we can,

343
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:12,851
like Congregate and more games.

344
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:14,454
games of 10, and so on.

345
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:20,102
This will bring us a nice additional stream of users

346
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:24,929
allowing us to reach out, out of the word of mouth

347
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:26,752
strategy that we currently only have.

348
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:33,347
So it's time for the what went right and wrong.

349
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,168
What went right, physics.

350
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:38,470
Back in 2010, there was a thing for physics flash games

351
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,692
like Fantastic Contraption, Quop and stuff.

352
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,333
They were all very fun and solo,

353
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:47,395
but none of them included a multiplayer twist.

354
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:50,377
People love to mess with the physics,

355
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:52,138
but it's becoming hilarious in multiplayer.

356
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:57,656
Real-time multiplayer, of course.

357
00:24:57,656 --> 00:24:59,396
2010 was a great year for Facebook games,

358
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:01,517
but they were all asynchronous,

359
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:04,318
and a real-time multiplayer game

360
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:07,039
that could still be played in your browser

361
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,520
was a great alternative at this time,

362
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,180
and one of the only ones.

363
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:20,719
Accessibility, the game is Flash, the game weighs less than one mega and can be played on all computers thanks to the Flash player.

364
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:30,844
It has a guest mode so you don't have to create an account, the registration doesn't ask you for an email, and all of this make it very frictionless and made it spread like wildfire.

365
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:40,548
And such low specs also allow us to reach more developing countries which leads us to the next point, localization.

366
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:44,610
We translated the game very early to Brazilian, Russian,

367
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,571
Spanish, Polish, Turkish, and so on.

368
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:50,833
And this helped us a lot because some countries

369
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:53,614
don't have as many games as we do.

370
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:58,596
And even if some countries don't monetize as good,

371
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:01,158
it doesn't matter because it only makes more players

372
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:01,658
in your game.

373
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:03,939
And this is the most important parameter

374
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,820
in multiplayer game and free-to-play games.

375
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,082
More the players, the funnier and more competitive

376
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:13,245
your game gets and the further it reaches.

377
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:17,608
We asked all players to help us with the translation

378
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:19,750
and they were more than happy to do it.

379
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,512
Graphics, don't want to be too self-congratulatory here

380
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:24,833
because I made the graphics,

381
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,657
but the shoes of cute little mice getting cruelly killed

382
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:33,460
turned out to be a good part of our success.

383
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,941
Never underestimate cute.

384
00:26:36,443 --> 00:26:42,347
players feedback. Many players kept yelling on your forums that we never listen to them.

385
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:49,151
But we actually do a lot. And we did so very early on the development of the game. We

386
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:54,395
iterate a lot based on the players feedback. And 20% of the workforce is dedicated to

387
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:55,876
community management today.

388
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,573
And two people team, Jean-Baptiste and I

389
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:04,138
are very complimentary and we maxed the different skills

390
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:07,221
while minimizing the number of persons involved

391
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:09,644
and that allowed us to develop and iterate very fast.

392
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:10,845
Now where we're wrong, two people team.

393
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:22,515
Of course there's a downside to being only two people when you have to manage a multi-player,

394
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:28,141
multi-million player MMO. I mean, we missed a lot of opportunities because we weren't able to

395
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:31,425
cope up with the initial rush and the bugs and stuff.

396
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:42,735
Retrospectively, our adsense ban transformed into a good thing. But at the moment it

397
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:49,539
certainly wasn't. And it put a lot of physical stress on us. We have been careless with how we

398
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:56,182
generated money. And when your business model only relies on one single source of income, you

399
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:58,083
better make sure you know exactly what you're doing.

400
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:03,368
Never try anything shady and think you'll get away with it

401
00:28:03,368 --> 00:28:06,853
easier either because this is the best way to screw everything up.

402
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:11,800
Hiring to fast end management.

403
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,102
When the free-to-play took off,

404
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:17,644
we were so relieved that we could finally scale the team

405
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:20,066
up to more reasonable standard

406
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,288
that we didn't pay as much attention

407
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:24,690
to the hiring as we should have.

408
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,373
We grew from three to 10 in less than eight months

409
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,475
and we weren't prepared for it.

410
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:36,117
We made some mistakes and some tensions arose,

411
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:38,898
and suddenly, employee's management had become a thing

412
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:40,338
without us realizing.

413
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:44,419
We always try to provide the best working conditions

414
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:47,800
to our workers, but we shrug it off,

415
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
project management entirely,

416
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,242
relying on everyone to find stuff to do on their own

417
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:55,082
without setting proper goals.

418
00:28:55,837 --> 00:29:00,460
And this is something we're getting better at lately, but it took us a very long time

419
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,622
and very painful experience to realize how important that was.

420
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:09,764
disregard mobile, we were so busy with the PC version,

421
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:12,126
we never took a mobile app seriously,

422
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,387
especially knowing that our game was flash

423
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:16,889
and it was best used with a keyboard and mouse.

424
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:21,171
And so we made a couple tries with Adobe Air on Android,

425
00:29:21,171 --> 00:29:24,693
but we never invested enough for it to be meaningful

426
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:28,276
and that's probably a missed opportunity here.

427
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:32,338
Monetization, we had no idea what we were doing.

428
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:36,674
When we decided to go free to play,

429
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:40,235
we didn't pay much attention to what others did around us.

430
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:43,556
To us, you could only do free to play in two ways,

431
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,077
the fair League of Legend way,

432
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:48,458
and the horrible Farmville way.

433
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,039
And we were so stressed out that the players would hate us

434
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,600
that we went for the most fair we could.

435
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,221
But that also meant underselling our products.

436
00:29:58,221 --> 00:29:59,781
And once they are set,

437
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:02,082
it's always easier to go down on your prices,

438
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:04,283
but you cannot raise them after.

439
00:30:05,498 --> 00:30:09,843
We didn't do homework and we had no idea about RPU,

440
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:15,509
break even, all that kind of jiggly business thing.

441
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:18,272
We are very, very grateful for the free to play model

442
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:21,275
because the game wouldn't exist without it.

443
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:24,358
But it was just a ton of work we weren't prepared for

444
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:26,561
and if you want to do this, get prepared.

445
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:31,593
Now what, very quickly, we've been working for two years now

446
00:30:31,593 --> 00:30:33,674
on our biggest production after Transformers

447
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:34,815
that we called Deniz.

448
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:36,716
It's a massively multiplayer survival game

449
00:30:36,716 --> 00:30:39,198
with zombies, loot, crafting,

450
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:41,940
but everything cooperative and not player versus player.

451
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,122
Think of Project Zomboid meets Don't Starve

452
00:30:45,122 --> 00:30:46,602
in a massively multiplayer setting.

453
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:55,227
The game is currently in a private alpha state and we hope to release an open beta for the first half of 2017.

454
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:58,588
Sorry, the syllabus is here.

455
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:01,049
Believe it or not, but that's Flash too.

456
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:01,289
Now what?

457
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:12,616
Every time I say that all game is Flash, I get the mandatory response like, but Mel,

458
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:20,945
haven't you heard? Flash is dying. And yeah, I'm quite aware of that, trust me. Today, yes,

459
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:26,490
there is a trend in the major web browser companies where they are slowly but surely

460
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,934
removing the user Flash player plug-in into the systems.

461
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:34,115
But the Flash content is still overwhelmingly present

462
00:31:34,115 --> 00:31:36,756
on the web, so most of them are also working

463
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:39,196
on replacement like Google, for example,

464
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:42,137
has an ongoing project integrating Flash directly

465
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:44,677
inside Chrome that is called Paper API.

466
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:46,538
And some Mozilla programmers are trying

467
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,498
to implement Paper API to Firefox.

468
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:50,999
So there are workarounds.

469
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:52,959
We think that for a long period of time,

470
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,779
Flash will be disabled in browser,

471
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,800
but can still be activated manually with a single button,

472
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,260
which is okay for us.

473
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:02,223
Even if there's a total block one day,

474
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:06,829
we developed a standalone version that you can install

475
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:09,513
and we can advertise it on the website.

476
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:12,497
So that would definitely cause a huge drop in acquisition

477
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,061
but the game won't die because of flash obsolescence.

478
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:21,128
About our place in the industry, it's a bit unconventional.

479
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:25,070
We have a project that allows us to live

480
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,032
for more than six years now,

481
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:32,075
but we are still what you can call a one game studio, really,

482
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,777
because all of our other games

483
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:38,219
failed to generate significant revenue,

484
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:41,081
and Transformice is still 99% of our income.

485
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:46,425
Overall, I feel there are more and more triple I studios

486
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:49,046
with very professional production,

487
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:52,027
and also there are more and more of a one man game

488
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:55,167
with hobbyists that already have a day job

489
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,888
and do a game on their free time.

490
00:32:56,888 --> 00:33:00,969
And there's less and less of studios in the middle, I feel.

491
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:05,510
Thanks to Transformice, we are closer to the triple I side

492
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,131
of the spectrum in terms of budget and production,

493
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:09,311
but

494
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,673
That means we are competing with very professional teams

495
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:15,755
and all games need to be quite ambitious

496
00:33:15,755 --> 00:33:18,016
and this is a bit stressful.

497
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:20,857
But whatever happens, we will keep making multiplayer games

498
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:23,119
because we love it and we really believe

499
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,940
that playing together is the funniest thing ever.

500
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,301
Thank you.

501
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:39,295
I was reminded to please rate the session at the end

502
00:33:39,295 --> 00:33:40,236
and I will be in the wrap-up room.

503
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,177
I don't know if we have time for some questions.

504
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:41,257
Do we?

505
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:41,377
We don't?

506
00:33:41,377 --> 00:33:41,417
No?

507
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,638
All right, I will be in the wrap-up room

508
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:43,839
