00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,421
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:13,243
I'm so excited to be at GDC with you today

3
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:15,165
to present Lessons from Duolingo,

4
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:18,166
How to Turn Good Intentions into Good Numbers.

5
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:22,429
This talk will go over how to leverage a data-driven culture

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,851
to further your business metrics while still

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,312
staying true to your values.

8
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,174
I'll start by doing a quick introduction.

9
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:30,615
My name is Karen Tsai.

10
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:34,766
I have a BSc in computer science and a minor in neuroscience

11
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:36,066
from Princeton University.

12
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,908
So I've always been interested in the intersection

13
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:40,449
of education and technology.

14
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,290
Currently, I'm an engineering director

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,511
at Duolingo, the most popular way

16
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,292
to learn a foreign language online.

17
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:50,994
That's Duo, our green owl mascot that you'll see a lot

18
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,255
in this presentation today.

19
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:55,556
I had the privilege of joining Duolingo in 2012,

20
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,658
three months after Duolingo's public launch.

21
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:03,720
And I was able to witness the company grow from about 15 people to over 300.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,882
I currently lead engineering in the learning area, the biggest area at Dolingo.

23
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,364
This area focuses on how to teach our learners better.

24
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:17,566
And of course, I'm particularly excited to be here because I've always loved games.

25
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:20,207
My current obsession is team fight tactics,

26
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:23,989
though I was playing Animal Crossing pretty obsessively earlier this year.

27
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:30,545
I'm excited to share our approach about what we've learned at Duolingo in the past eight years

28
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,627
because it's worked really well for us.

29
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:38,211
We're currently the most downloaded education app with over 30 million monthly active users.

30
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:45,436
We think this popularity is due to Duolingo being free and because it's designed to make language learning feel more like a game.

31
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:49,539
Since I joined, there were two main pillars of company culture.

32
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,740
The first was our mission.

33
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:55,263
Our purpose was to equalize access to quality education.

34
00:01:56,172 --> 00:02:01,555
And our second pillar was that we would rely on data and A-B testing for all of our decisions.

35
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:07,178
When it came time to mature and become a profitable and sustainable company,

36
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:12,361
we had to think a lot about how to do that while still being the company we wanted to be.

37
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:18,244
We also had to figure out how to prioritize things that were hard to measure, like how well we taught.

38
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:23,327
So despite all of the A-B tests we've run, it still wasn't capturing everything we wanted it to.

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,801
Last year, we gave a talk on how to make learning hard things

40
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:32,263
easy, providing a lot of examples of surprising results

41
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:34,624
we found through over 3,000 A-B tests

42
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,445
on how to make an engaging product.

43
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,327
In the Q&A part of that talk, there

44
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:42,829
were a lot of great questions on best practices for using data

45
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,690
and what to do when data wasn't readily available

46
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,891
or didn't quite capture what was desired.

47
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:51,893
So we thought it might be useful to dive a little deeper

48
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:53,414
into those questions this year.

49
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,057
So let's start with some background to frame the problem at hand.

50
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:03,378
The question is this, how can we encode good intentions and values

51
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,559
into day-to-day decision making while still listening

52
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,939
to your metrics and numbers?

53
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,940
How do you make difficult decisions when it comes to trade-offs?

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,381
And there are a lot of trade-offs.

55
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,742
In games, you encounter these decisions pretty frequently.

56
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:21,923
For example, do you want to make a super accessible free game that's

57
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:22,703
widely used?

58
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:26,428
Or do you want to be profitable sooner, but maybe with a paywall

59
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:27,769
and get less usage?

60
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:30,270
Do you want to do constant patches

61
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,710
and ship new features quickly?

62
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,411
Or do you want to have a very high-quality product

63
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:35,012
off the bat?

64
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,253
Do you want to make your game challenging and appealing

65
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,254
to niche users?

66
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,995
Or do you want your game to be accessible enough

67
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:44,576
that it's hyper-casual and appeals to a wider audience?

68
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:47,796
There are a bunch of other sensitive gray zones,

69
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:49,757
like how much moderation you should do,

70
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:52,719
whether or not to take political stances in your product,

71
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,141
how you approach user privacy, representation,

72
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,582
diversity, inclusivity, et cetera.

73
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:02,144
And this talk is not about what to do or what to stand for,

74
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:05,446
but it will be about how to develop a process

75
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,427
and a culture that lets you stay true

76
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:10,329
to the values you choose while maximizing metrics.

77
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,312
At Duolingo, we encounter these sorts of trade-offs every day

78
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:23,406
We constantly have to decide how we can be sustainable and earn revenue while still being accessible to as many users as possible.

79
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:32,291
We also have to balance the trade off between making our app approachable and easy and increasing engagement,

80
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:38,475
but also trying to teach effectively by also teaching harder content as well at the right times.

81
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,270
Also, one thing on my mind constantly

82
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,690
is how we measure learning outcomes, which

83
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,630
is a traditionally slow-moving metric

84
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,071
and difficult to capture in day-to-day metrics.

85
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:52,932
By the end of the talk, I'd like you all

86
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:54,572
to feel confident that you can develop

87
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,833
a process and a culture that will allow

88
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:59,853
you to be both idealistic in staying true to your values,

89
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:03,314
but also pragmatic and intentional in maximizing

90
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:04,154
business metrics.

91
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,715
So we'll go over each of the steps in detail,

92
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,655
but here's a preview of what we'll go over today.

93
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:13,994
First, the first step is to document your operating

94
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:15,235
principles and values.

95
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,476
And I'll explain in the next section what these are.

96
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:20,218
Second is to set up and encourage

97
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,438
a data-driven culture.

98
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,980
Specifically, if you want to have good numbers,

99
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,801
you need to be able to track them.

100
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:28,562
The bulk of the talk will actually

101
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:31,344
be around a concept called guardrail metrics, which allows

102
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:32,905
you to tie these two together.

103
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:35,386
And finally, we'll talk about how

104
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:38,048
to account for things that are a little harder to measure.

105
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:39,889
Our approach is fairly simple.

106
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:41,747
but we found quite effective.

107
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:47,408
So the first step is to establish operating principles.

108
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,949
Operating principles are a way to put culture

109
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,569
and values into practice.

110
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,950
A commonly heard principle in tech

111
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,750
is to move fast and break things.

112
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,751
Amazon has a principle around frugality.

113
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:02,732
Some companies might say company needs

114
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,132
should come before user needs,

115
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:06,172
whereas others might say user needs

116
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:07,593
should come before company needs.

117
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:10,807
What's so interesting about operating principles

118
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,689
is that good operating principles have

119
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,430
very valid counter-arguments.

120
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:17,813
Things that are obvious don't need to be written down.

121
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,015
But when the company makes a choice

122
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,658
on what to prioritize or value that may not

123
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:26,682
be entirely intuitive, operating principles are very helpful.

124
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,866
These are a way to encode your uncompromisables, things

125
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:32,948
that you aren't willing to make exceptions for

126
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:34,349
and that you want to preserve.

127
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,151
Once you've come up with some operating principles,

128
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,452
it's usually a good idea to list out examples

129
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,874
of how your company has demonstrated these in the past

130
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:45,996
or hypothetical or aspirational situations

131
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,177
where you'd want people to make the right decision.

132
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:51,839
So here are a few examples from Duolingo

133
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,280
to illustrate these in practice.

134
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:56,302
One of our first principles is learners first,

135
00:06:56,902 --> 00:06:59,324
and that means we never charge for learning content.

136
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:03,415
As you can imagine, this makes it tricky to monetize efficiently,

137
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:06,777
but since it's encoded in our values, we've been able to preserve it.

138
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:09,979
Another principle is to take the long view,

139
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,321
meaning we'll often turn down short-term significant wins

140
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:16,383
if they have a risk of having long-term detrimental effects.

141
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:20,766
Another example is all for one and one for all,

142
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:23,328
which values cross-team trust and collaboration.

143
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,706
Some companies are very successful by having a more competitive environment,

144
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:32,270
but we encoded here that every team should be working with the consideration of other teams.

145
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:37,374
So let's say you now have this lovely list of operating principles.

146
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:42,559
The first thing to do is to stress test it with past and hypothetical future decisions.

147
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,323
Given these principles, would an average person at your company make the same decision you would?

148
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:53,688
Would they prioritize the right things? And would they feel confident they're making the right decision?

149
00:07:54,965 --> 00:08:00,046
From there, you can begin to evangelize your operating principles and establish a culture around them.

150
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:11,069
And then comes the hard but fun part, figuring out how to align your principles to business objectives by identifying what key metrics will further those business objectives.

151
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:18,250
So having values in a goal without strategy runs a large risk of failure.

152
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:22,816
Being data-driven, even with the simplest of A-B testing tools,

153
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:25,777
allows you to be more confident in the direction you're taking

154
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:28,738
and signals you to course correct when necessary.

155
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,759
By obsessing over our metrics and only launching things

156
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,720
that win, we guarantee that our numbers increase

157
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,761
over the years in all of our key metrics.

158
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:41,622
And since we run thousands of experiments, that adds up.

159
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,363
So I'll quickly go over what A-B testing is here,

160
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:47,324
because a lot of you are probably familiar.

161
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,806
The idea is that you can test the impact of a change

162
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:54,288
by giving it only to a fraction of your learners.

163
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:58,290
So for example here, you could divide your users in half and only give half

164
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,592
the new feature. We generally internally call these two

165
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:04,633
conditions the control condition and the experiment condition,

166
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:08,535
where experiment generally represents the change that you're trying to test.

167
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:12,617
You then look at metrics such as retention or activity

168
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:15,278
for both populations and see how they compare.

169
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:19,317
One tip is that when analyzing these metrics,

170
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:22,398
only look at users who were or would

171
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,298
have been affected by the change,

172
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,239
and don't include those that weren't.

173
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,680
So for example, if you make a change

174
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,521
to level 3 of a dungeon, you should only

175
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:34,462
look at users who reach level 3.

176
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:37,423
Users who are only in levels 1 or 2

177
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,864
don't even see level 3 and wouldn't experience any change,

178
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:42,705
and that also dilutes your data.

179
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:47,616
This simple concept really changed our ability to run experiments quickly.

180
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:51,497
Until we made this change, many experiments would be neutral or take

181
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:55,239
several weeks or months to run. But after this change, most A-B tests

182
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,759
run for only about two weeks with significant results.

183
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,142
As mentioned, Doolinga was run over 3,000 A-B tests with around 150 to 200 running

184
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:09,464
at any given time. This is possible because everyone is bought into the

185
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:10,865
culture of experimentation.

186
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:14,485
Anyone, not just engineers and product managers,

187
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,566
are empowered to create experiments

188
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:19,308
after going through a short training on an online course.

189
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:22,149
There's a quiz at the end to test understanding.

190
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:24,470
And if you pass that quiz, you get the permission

191
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,731
to create experiments.

192
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:29,253
As a result, tons more experiments

193
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:31,134
were created after this training was launched.

194
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:33,815
And this number continues to grow at a rapid rate.

195
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:39,198
We also try to make analysis as accessible as possible.

196
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:44,172
A key part of our experiment framework is an auto-generated report that updates daily,

197
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:48,835
doing all the statistical work necessary to determine if the effects are statistically

198
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:55,599
significant. This means almost anyone in the company is able to provide informed recommendations

199
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,502
on whether to launch or kill experiments based on the metrics provided in the report.

200
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:08,547
And the final step, after experiments are created, run, and analyzed, is to share the findings.

201
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:11,799
This is very common for A-B test results,

202
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,361
whether positive or negative, to be shared

203
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,802
at our weekly all-hands meetings.

204
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,984
Here's a picture of our all-hands meeting

205
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:18,944
before COVID hit.

206
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,146
Hopefully, we'll all be back in person soon.

207
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,629
All experiments are also sent to an open mailing

208
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:26,050
list of experiment write-ups.

209
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,113
Through these two ways of sharing experiment results,

210
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,389
Everyone gets pretty familiar with how we look at metrics,

211
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:36,511
how we make decisions on whether to launch or kill features,

212
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:39,333
and what seems to work or not work when it

213
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:40,834
comes to moving these metrics.

214
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:44,877
If you're just getting started with getting more data driven,

215
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,319
there are plenty of third-party providers

216
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,281
that will provide a solid A-B testing framework for you

217
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:52,522
and tools that will allow you to determine

218
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:55,244
whether or not those results are statistically significant.

219
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,996
It took us many years to build a sophisticated framework.

220
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,296
But even in the very early days, we

221
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:04,477
were able to benefit a lot from very simple testing tools.

222
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:07,838
What's more important than the actual tools you use

223
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:11,099
is fostering a culture that loves experimentation.

224
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:15,440
But at Duolingo, teams are generally

225
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,161
organized around these metrics.

226
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:20,641
We have a retention team, teams that focus on revenue, et

227
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:21,302
cetera.

228
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:23,982
But sometimes that may cause issues

229
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,443
when two metrics collide.

230
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:27,724
What if there's a metric you care about,

231
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:29,525
but no team is in charge of it?

232
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:31,587
That's where guardrail metrics come in.

233
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,829
A guardrail metric is a business-critical metric

234
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,311
displayed on all of our experiment reports

235
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:40,973
that should never go down significantly.

236
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:44,395
Otherwise, the experiment shouldn't launch unless there's

237
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,056
a very good reason to do so.

238
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,099
Remember those cool automated reports

239
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,059
that I showed you earlier?

240
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,482
They contain around 20 key metrics on them.

241
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,952
many of which were created by teams to prevent other teams

242
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,954
from accidentally negatively impacting their metrics.

243
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,235
You can see in this word cloud here,

244
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,337
I've displayed the ones that we tend to display

245
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,778
on our metric reports.

246
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,139
They include things like app crashes,

247
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:09,820
which you may not always think of,

248
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,663
feedback email taps for people asking for help,

249
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:17,405
retention, subscriptions, et cetera.

250
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,022
By having these guardrail metrics on all reports,

251
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:25,344
it aligns everyone on what the company values

252
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,506
and gives a holistic picture of the impact of a feature.

253
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,468
Without them, teams might tunnel vision

254
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,269
on the metric they sought to increase

255
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:35,710
without realizing the effect that it

256
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,632
has on other metrics outside of the team's purview.

257
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:42,614
Teams can also rest easy knowing that generally,

258
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,596
if the analysis report looks good

259
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,537
and no guardrail metrics are negative,

260
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:48,298
they can be confident.

261
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:51,462
in making a decision aligned with company interests.

262
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,363
If something is negative or concerning,

263
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,923
they also know which team to reach out to in order

264
00:13:56,963 --> 00:13:58,984
to come to a conclusion about whether or not

265
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,244
the experiment should launch.

266
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:03,865
So I have three examples for you today

267
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,546
around the usage of guardrails.

268
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,227
The first was a situation where we identified

269
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,688
the need for a new guardrail.

270
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,849
Then I'll share a case where guardrails helped

271
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,189
us make a difficult decision.

272
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:17,717
And finally, I'll share an example

273
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,058
where guardrails revealed something

274
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:21,038
positive and unanticipated.

275
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:25,699
So our first example centers around an experiment

276
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:26,859
around our health mechanic.

277
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,639
Similar to many games, learners would

278
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,940
lose a life or health from mistakes

279
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,960
that they made in the app.

280
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,940
And if they ran out of health, that

281
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,201
was a signal that maybe they were learning a bit too fast

282
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,681
and would need to practice or wait to earn it back.

283
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:45,542
Health refills were an in-app purchase that we added.

284
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:48,278
So this feature actually made us quite a bit of revenue.

285
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:52,540
But it also seemed to help D1 and D7 retention

286
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,901
without hurting daily active users.

287
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,302
However, what we saw in the metrics

288
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:01,524
was not what we saw in the public forums and our channels.

289
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:04,685
Our App Store ratings really suffered a lot

290
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,846
with learners unhappy with this change.

291
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,688
We had to manage a lot of community outrage,

292
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:11,949
and we suffered for a while with a much lower app

293
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:12,769
rating than usual.

294
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,522
We discovered this was mainly impacting existing users,

295
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:19,605
since it's always painful to have something taken away

296
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:21,266
or changed that you're used to.

297
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:24,870
New users who started Duolingo with this feature

298
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,431
didn't seem to mind it.

299
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:30,595
So we let this feature run only for new users for a while

300
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:33,318
and rolled it out to existing users very slowly.

301
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:36,901
But because of this experience, we

302
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:39,123
added a new guardrail, which is App Store Ratings.

303
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:42,710
we can see if a feature significantly changes our apps

304
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,230
for reading.

305
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,471
And this metric allows us to prepare a community response

306
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,991
ahead of time so we can be thoughtful about how

307
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:51,312
we execute it and also stay ahead

308
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,152
of any community concerns.

309
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:57,133
A second example around guardrails

310
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,574
involves an experiment we ran on our subscription purchase page

311
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:03,555
that changed the copy or text of the main button.

312
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:05,675
In the control condition.

313
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:11,098
The one that users already saw, it said, try seven days for free.

314
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,480
We wanted to test a new copy that said, start my free week.

315
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:21,083
It turns out that the experimental copy made us a lot of money.

316
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,806
We saw a $6,000 per day increase in in-app purchase revenue

317
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:28,287
in the experiment condition.

318
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:35,797
However, looking at guardrails, we saw that new user D1 retention dropped by about 1%,

319
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:40,160
which seemed to translate into also a small drop in daily active users.

320
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:47,545
We hypothesized that the new copy may have been misleading. New users might have assumed that

321
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:54,030
after a week Duolingo would cost money, which was not true. Due to these guardrails, we decided to

322
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,591
leave the money on the table, kill the experiment.

323
00:16:57,177 --> 00:17:00,358
and iterate on the copy further to minimize misunderstanding.

324
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:03,879
Our monetization team has long had a stance

325
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:06,820
that we never want to trick people into giving us money.

326
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,481
It's powerful and telling that this decision came

327
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,481
from the monetization team itself

328
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,402
and was not enforced top down.

329
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,242
Because of our operating principles

330
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:20,763
about taking the long view and all for one and one for all,

331
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,884
teams are aligned to make good decisions for the company,

332
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:26,725
even if it requires a sacrifice from the team.

333
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:34,259
Our last example is a serendipitous one.

334
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,921
One of our teams made a change that updated the look and feel

335
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:40,562
of our language courses by replacing a button that

336
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,664
said Test Out of and Skills with what we called Checkpoints,

337
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:47,786
which when clicked on would also allow you to test out of skills

338
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:51,928
but also become milestones and indicators of progress

339
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,429
once a user went past them.

340
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,732
Unintentionally, we discovered that this made the Test Out

341
00:17:58,772 --> 00:17:59,752
feature less prominent.

342
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:06,265
Our hypothesis was that because learners weren't testing out as much, which is a shortcut,

343
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:10,847
they were running out of help faster because they had to learn the material more thoroughly.

344
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:15,949
Free trial starts and subscription revenue increased substantially.

345
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,511
Now at first, we were worried that if learners weren't using TestOut, they might have been

346
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:24,412
seeing content that was too easy and they would be bored and leave.

347
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:28,534
However, since all other guardrails, like retention,

348
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:31,395
DAUs, and time spent learning were neutral,

349
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,096
it implied that the learner experience actually

350
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:36,197
wasn't negatively impacted by this change.

351
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:39,638
And now we know that test out is a lever that

352
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:42,279
does impact revenue, something we would have not

353
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,779
thought of in the first place.

354
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,841
So now that we know what guardrails are about,

355
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:50,241
what do we do next?

356
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:53,137
Well, the first step is to identify

357
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:55,938
the metrics that are most important to the success

358
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:56,838
of your product.

359
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,720
For games, this might look like getting as many users

360
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,080
as possible or to be as profitable as soon

361
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,700
as possible.

362
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:08,261
You could also look at how engaged your users are

363
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,942
by checking things like how long they play your game per day

364
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:11,642
or how often.

365
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,943
You might want to look at latency and crashes

366
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,344
if stability is very important to your game.

367
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:20,025
And if your game relies on network effects,

368
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,676
You may even want to measure more specific things,

369
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:25,117
like the average number of social interactions

370
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:26,317
per unique user.

371
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:30,399
And finally, you can track more subjective but still

372
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:33,780
quantitative metrics, like App Store ratings and social media

373
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,420
engagement.

374
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:40,982
But some things are just really hard to measure and put

375
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:41,402
a number to.

376
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:43,303
And how do you account for those?

377
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,894
For example, it may be that one small bug is insignificant

378
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:53,817
and not very high ROI, as we call it, to fix.

379
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:56,279
But what is the impact on the user

380
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,380
if they see a lot of these small bugs?

381
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:03,604
Similarly, how do you measure the impact on your reputation

382
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,786
when it either comes to bugs or features?

383
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,509
Similarly, how do people perceive

384
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,070
your product and your company?

385
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:14,904
How do you measure creative and design quality?

386
00:20:16,024 --> 00:20:17,504
And one that I think about daily

387
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:20,285
is how do we measure long-term learning outcomes?

388
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:25,487
The hard truth is in a data-driven culture,

389
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:29,148
if it's hard to measure, it's hard to prioritize.

390
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,029
That means that if there are important things

391
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:34,089
that you care about creating guardrails around

392
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,169
that are hard to measure,

393
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,010
you need to find a way to prioritize them anyway.

394
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:40,835
We have four approaches to this that we

395
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,436
use for different situations.

396
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:47,138
The first solution is to simply care about it,

397
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,059
even in the absence of measurement.

398
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,101
Brand design consistency falls into this bucket for us.

399
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:57,403
The approach usually requires an additional process

400
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:59,524
for enforcement, or else people may not

401
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:02,626
be motivated or reminded to care about these principles.

402
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:06,828
We enforce design guidelines during development, design

403
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,569
review, and quality assurance.

404
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:12,535
but otherwise can't easily measure the consistency of our branding.

405
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:16,877
But for example, we updated all of our logos to our new brand logo,

406
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:21,218
even if it didn't impact metrics. Operating principles

407
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:25,260
are also very useful when it comes to encoding that something is important.

408
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:31,682
Another solution is to reframe what success looks like

409
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:35,943
for an experiment. For some objectives in the learning area, for example,

410
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,391
We consider a feature a win if it's entirely neutral for metrics,

411
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:45,433
but research or a learning expert backs up that that feature is better for learning.

412
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,614
Again, guardrails are critical for this.

413
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:53,515
We can be confident that we aren't hurting by launching a feature we believe in.

414
00:21:53,535 --> 00:22:01,918
A third solution is to actually measure slow-moving metrics periodically.

415
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:06,219
Some things are not impossible to measure, but may just take a long time to do so.

416
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:09,897
For example, metrics like brand awareness

417
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:13,279
tend to move relatively slowly, so we do an annual study.

418
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,601
We also do an annual study on employee happiness.

419
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:19,223
And when it comes to learning, we

420
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:21,204
conduct periodic efficacy studies

421
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:24,186
that look at learners who have been around for a long time.

422
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:27,528
It's good to predict things that you'll

423
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,770
want to measure in the future so you can set up

424
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,112
an infrastructure ahead of time before you miss a window

425
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,753
and have to wait a long time before you can do it again.

426
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:42,777
And finally, the solution that's my personal favorite

427
00:22:42,957 --> 00:22:46,680
and generally works the best is to find what we call proxy

428
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,041
or good enough metrics.

429
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:51,144
We realized sometimes it's better

430
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:54,867
to just be able to move forward even if the direction is not

431
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:57,149
perfect, so long as you're generally

432
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:58,670
moving in the right direction.

433
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,854
One example in the learning area is that one of our teams

434
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:05,396
is working on making things harder on Duolingo

435
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:07,658
without decreasing guardrail metrics.

436
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,695
which is actually quite hard because if you were at the talk from last year,

437
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:16,398
you know that any increase in difficulty actually has a huge impact on retention

438
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,098
and DAUs.

439
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,419
In this case,

440
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,902
we're using make stuff harder as a North star.

441
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,163
That's a proxy for if people are doing harder things,

442
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:30,965
they're probably learning more and practicing more of the language they're

443
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:33,587
trying to learn. Even then,

444
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:37,729
we had to have a proxy for what it even means for something to be harder.

445
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:42,016
we looked at the types of exercises users do on Duolingo

446
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:44,598
and had a general sense of which ones are hard

447
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:45,939
versus which ones are easy.

448
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,321
For example, translating something

449
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:49,922
into the language you're learning

450
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,024
is much harder than translating something

451
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:53,706
from the language you're learning

452
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,007
into your native language.

453
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,049
So the team will consider it a win

454
00:23:58,189 --> 00:24:00,872
if they release a change that can increase

455
00:24:00,912 --> 00:24:03,814
the ratio of challenges that make you answer

456
00:24:04,134 --> 00:24:07,297
in the language you're learning without harming guardrails.

457
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,882
This approach also pairs really well with longer term studies

458
00:24:12,523 --> 00:24:15,707
because then you can then check how well your proxy or good

459
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:19,611
enough metrics helped you move the needle on the actual metric

460
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:20,312
you care about.

461
00:24:22,554 --> 00:24:24,116
So to summarize the four approaches

462
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:25,918
to measuring immeasurable things,

463
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:30,323
you can commit to caring anyway and create a process

464
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:31,043
to enforce it.

465
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:41,315
You can declare experiments a success as long as they're neutral but are supported by some other measures such as research or subject matter expert.

466
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:47,798
You can measure slow moving metrics periodically and try to anticipate how to do so.

467
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:55,661
Or you could find proxy or good enough metrics to cure decision paralysis and move forward anyway.

468
00:24:58,156 --> 00:25:01,738
So what has this approach of establishing operating principles,

469
00:25:02,178 --> 00:25:06,981
obsessing over experimentation, and leveraging guardrail metrics gotten us?

470
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:13,985
Well, internally, we've benefited a lot. Teams feel collaborative instead of competitive.

471
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:20,049
Through guardrails and a system of accountability, there's a lot of trust between teams to make good

472
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:25,952
decisions that don't hurt other teams. We also now have minimal debate about whether or not

473
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,053
to launch experiments.

474
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:31,379
This allows teams to make decisions quickly and ship things faster.

475
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,221
It also feels more fair and more consistent.

476
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:41,725
Finally, sharing both wins and failures not only offers a level of transparency

477
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:46,568
and accountability into all teams experiments, but also helps the company

478
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:51,991
get collectively smarter about the product and what works when it comes to moving our metrics.

479
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:57,356
With Gargoyle Metrics, we have a checks and balances system

480
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,719
that allows us to be confident that we're moving forward

481
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:03,000
in increasing all the metrics we care about

482
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:05,502
without taking steps back on any of them.

483
00:26:06,543 --> 00:26:08,925
We went from essentially no revenue

484
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:12,107
to over a hundred million dollars in revenue

485
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:13,728
within 3.5 years.

486
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,191
And best of all, our users are more engaged than ever.

487
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:20,714
We have five extra D1 retention since launch

488
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:23,776
while also working towards becoming a sustainable company.

489
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,183
From a business standpoint, this approach

490
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:29,424
has been really effective.

491
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:33,605
By having a free app, we've been able to attract a huge user

492
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,966
base, meaning we can run experiments and improve

493
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:37,507
our product very quickly.

494
00:26:38,507 --> 00:26:40,928
We've also been able to become profitable,

495
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:43,369
despite not charging for learning content.

496
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,890
Though this was probably the harder path than just starting

497
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,251
to charge for our app, and we had

498
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:52,472
to be more creative and careful on how we generated revenue.

499
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:55,493
It was the path that ended up being the best for business

500
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:55,893
as well.

501
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,526
And finally, preserving our values is observed and felt

502
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:04,247
by both our user base and internally as a company.

503
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:06,548
We tend to get benefit of the doubt,

504
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:08,409
even when we make mistakes.

505
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:11,430
And as you all know, a loyal user base

506
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,171
is absolutely invaluable.

507
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:17,573
So let me summarize quickly what we've gone over today,

508
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:19,114
and then we'll jump into questions.

509
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:23,016
The approach we took started with encoding

510
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:25,877
your core beliefs and values in operating principles.

511
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:29,145
Remember, it's not just useful to list out

512
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:31,766
things that are obvious, but rather things

513
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:34,347
that you want to take a stance on as a company.

514
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:37,789
Then set up a data-driven culture

515
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,589
that loves experimentation.

516
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,571
It's much easier to drive up key metrics

517
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:44,051
when you can measure them and get

518
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,612
a sense of what impacts them.

519
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:49,474
Then identify and enforce some guardrail metrics.

520
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:52,084
You'll likely find more and more over time,

521
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:54,545
but start with the critical ones that

522
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,505
are critical to the success of your product.

523
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,906
And finally, do your best to make

524
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:01,786
immeasurable things measurable.

525
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:05,567
Whether through process, proxy metrics, or longer term

526
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:08,487
studies, being able to capture the things that you care about

527
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:12,268
is really important in being able to encode good intentions

528
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:13,268
into your product.

529
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,949
In summary, with some intentionality,

530
00:28:18,503 --> 00:28:21,885
you can drive a successful business and successful product

531
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:24,246
without compromising your core values.

532
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:28,609
In fact, you'll likely find that you and your fellow employees

533
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:31,590
are more motivated and successful aligning

534
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:35,132
your core business objectives to your core values.

535
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:38,474
Games have been such an important part of my life,

536
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:40,875
and I truly believe that they do change

537
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:41,816
the world for the better.

538
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:46,658
I hope you'll join me in being idealistic and create games

539
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:47,899
that we're proud to be a part of.

540
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:53,419
Thank you for joining me today, and now I'm looking forward to all of your questions.
