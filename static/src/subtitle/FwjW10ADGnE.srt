1
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:09,545
And welcome to this GDC session.

2
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:11,927
I'm going to be talking about the development

3
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:15,109
behind Crash Bandicoot 4, It's About Time.

4
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:19,432
This was a title that was released in the fall of 2020

5
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,114
for all major consoles and PC.

6
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:26,076
And it's a new adventure in the series

7
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:28,398
after a 12 year absence for the franchise.

8
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:34,095
I'm going to be sharing about our approach to developing this new original game

9
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:37,678
for one of the biggest gaming icons of the 90s,

10
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:41,941
and how we took a classic IP that fans have a ton of nostalgia for,

11
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:46,964
made it relevant and fresh while maintaining its authenticity.

12
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,667
I'm going to share about the creative direction that led to how we

13
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,149
uniquely balanced new and nostalgia.

14
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:59,071
And to get started, if we haven't had the pleasure of meeting, my name is Paul.

15
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:01,174
I am the co-studio head at Toys for Bob.

16
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:04,079
I lead the creative art and design teams there.

17
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,106
We are a core crew of 70 developers based out of the Bay Area in California.

18
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:12,149
And this is our extended team.

19
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:15,433
We're really blessed to have support

20
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,635
from incredibly talented teams and individuals

21
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:20,338
from all over the world,

22
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:24,422
from countries like Germany, France, Canada, Israel,

23
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:25,943
and China, just to name a few.

24
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:34,634
Believe it or not, this year marks the 25th anniversary of Crash,

25
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:39,896
and so I think we're going to have some great things to celebrate further on down the year,

26
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:43,998
but it's a timely place to talk about the newest game in the series.

27
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:48,940
So before diving in, I think we should start and rewind all the way to the start,

28
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,341
just to give some context about where this franchise began and where we decide to take it to today.

29
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:58,364
So you're probably familiar with Crash Bandicoot.

30
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:02,846
You probably at least were familiar or engaged with him

31
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:05,328
as he debuted on the PlayStation in 1996.

32
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:08,749
But you may not have known that every single year after that

33
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:11,491
there's been a brand new Crash Bandicoot game, at least one.

34
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:16,055
up until 2008, and that's the point at which

35
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:19,418
the IP went a little bit dormant and quiet.

36
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:24,703
And more recently, Activision has remastered the original games in the series,

37
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:29,968
and in 2017, Vicarious Visions did an amazing job remastering the first three

38
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:34,412
games, which they called the N. Sane Trilogy, and followed in

39
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:36,914
2019 by Beenox remastering Crash Team Racing.

40
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:40,948
Now, us at Toys for Bob, we played a support role

41
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:41,769
in both of these titles.

42
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:44,413
We also remastered another big gaming icon

43
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:45,755
of the 90s in Spyro in 2018.

44
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:49,200
And this is the point in which we start to engage

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,883
Activision in conversation

46
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:53,146
about a potential new title for 2020.

47
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:57,615
Now internally, this was being described as a reboot,

48
00:02:57,615 --> 00:03:00,277
which suggests a really drastic overhaul.

49
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:03,840
And perhaps that was a term

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,962
that was being used prematurely.

51
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:09,964
So one thing that we did in these early conversations

52
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:11,786
was to step back for a second,

53
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:15,128
and we wanted to tease out what the real goals of this

54
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,610
before we started to embark on this development journey.

55
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:24,054
So one thing that I love to do as an exercise to do this and to put a little bit more precision

56
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:29,738
on fuzzy topics or things that might be a little bit subjective, is to use this exercise of

57
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:34,701
spectrums. And spectrums are a great way of putting two extremes on both ends and then

58
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:38,944
lining up ideas and trying to place them physically along those spectrums just to tease out

59
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:43,627
where you might align with other teammates or where you may disagree.

60
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:49,335
So in this case, what we did was we put the term reboot on one end of the spectrum,

61
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:55,638
which suggests reinvention, and then on the other end, we explored this idea of a sequel,

62
00:03:55,638 --> 00:04:00,039
which suggests an evolution of ideas or a continuation.

63
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:07,082
And we looked at a whole slew of games that we felt kind of existed along this spectrum.

64
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:13,500
There's examples of successful titles and not so successful titles on both ends of this spectrum.

65
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,864
There's nothing inherently right or wrong about where these land,

66
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:24,629
but this was a useful exercise for us to compare and contrast in terms of what are the goals that are unique for Crash Bandicoot

67
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,512
and moving that series into the future, into relevancy for today.

68
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:35,718
As an observation of doing this exercise together, we all saw that on the sequel end of things,

69
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:42,326
the opportunity is to be reverent, to really appeal to the core fan base.

70
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:49,735
The risks may be that the titles may not stand out enough or may be perceived to be more of the same.

71
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:55,242
On the reboot side of things, there's this huge opportunity for innovation and just wiping the

72
00:04:55,242 --> 00:05:03,112
canvas clear and starting fresh. The risks there are that you may alienate the core fan base or

73
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:05,355
introduce something that is unrecognizable.

74
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:15,700
Another lens that we applied is how do these extremes on the spectrum approach fans.

75
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:24,184
And where we kind of concluded on this was that sequels are great positioning for titles that have

76
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:30,988
a strong, thriving, and large existing fan base, where reboots might be one where there's a very

77
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:36,150
specific intention to go after a new audience, or maybe the core fan base has grown out.

78
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:39,772
of that and is passing that on to a new generation.

79
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:45,334
So looking at fans for Crash, you know, we had a great benefit of seeing

80
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:49,396
very, very recent results coming out of the recent remasters and

81
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:53,078
it was actually a little bit surprising how many people showed up and how many

82
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:55,499
people were really excited about these remasters.

83
00:05:56,059 --> 00:06:03,267
And the profile of these players are people like myself, mid-20s to early-40s who were probably

84
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:09,214
six to ten years old when the PlayStation debuted. They have a really strong inner

85
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:12,378
child and they look fondly at the experiences from their youth.

86
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:19,511
We also looked at the catalog of the whole history of Crash titles up until this point,

87
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:24,594
and one very striking observation was that both critically and commercially,

88
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:27,895
the high point was at the early part of that series.

89
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:33,018
And so another thing that may come out of this is that the memories and the associations

90
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:37,940
and the fondness for this franchise probably all stack at the very front end of this time.

91
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:45,104
So with all these pieces together, we aligned and held hands to say,

92
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:51,326
what Crash 2020 is going to be is a sequel to the original trilogy.

93
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:55,308
And it's going to be positioned primarily for the core Crash audience.

94
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:00,928
Now, this is the first major guardrail statement.

95
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:04,452
This is a really big stake in the sand for us.

96
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:07,235
And it really crisped up

97
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:10,258
when we started to call this project Crash 4.

98
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,613
So at this point, we were setting up

99
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:18,675
the technical foundations for this new project.

100
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,196
We were starting to prototype.

101
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:21,798
We were starting to do concept art,

102
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:23,939
exploring different environments and characters.

103
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,261
And this is where another spectrum exercise

104
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:29,504
was really useful for many of our different teams

105
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:30,905
as we started to ask ourselves,

106
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:34,848
what are some things that we can presume this game is?

107
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,710
And what are things that we can presume

108
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,992
at this early point, what this game isn't?

109
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:44,736
So as an example, one thing we know is from our guardrail statement is that this game is going to

110
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:48,919
be for 25 to 40 year olds. We know that this is a sequel to the original trilogy and so there's

111
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,522
certain elements like the antagonist, neocortex, and entropy are going to play a major part.

112
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:58,685
The idea of time travel and just time in general is going to be a strong theme that we want to continue.

113
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,102
We also knew on the other side of things, what the game isn't, is it's not going to be open world.

114
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:09,506
It's not going to be a beat-em-up in the way that some of the latter sequels move gameplay and game

115
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:15,150
design towards. We know that it's not going to have MTX. It just does not jive with what we're

116
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,633
trying to do here and what this series has been thus far.

117
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:25,168
And then in the middle, there's a lot of ideas and open questions, personal ambitions that

118
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:28,431
we have for ourselves that we weren't sure.

119
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:30,353
It wasn't as clear in those early days.

120
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:34,637
And so we put them deliberately in the middle and it was really helpful for us to focus

121
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:34,917
on that.

122
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:41,724
As decisions started to solidify, we could reevaluate and move these unknowns further

123
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:44,346
over to the left or further to the right.

124
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:50,500
Now, our creative director took all of these different conversations across all the different teams,

125
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,222
all of these debates, all of these presumptions, and boiled these down into three big statements

126
00:08:57,222 --> 00:09:02,584
that expressed what this game is about its tone, its gameplay, and its world.

127
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:07,125
And I'm going to step through each of these and talk about how these influenced

128
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,327
our ideas and the development and our prototypes.

129
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:19,610
these statements, initially our goal was to try and get crisp on what exactly is the definition

130
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:26,815
of the DNA of this franchise, but it ultimately served as the pillars for what this game is.

131
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:29,888
I'll start with tone.

132
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:32,129
Now, tone is wide-reaching.

133
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,389
It affects how the game looks.

134
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:36,009
It affects how the game sounds.

135
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,750
It affects how the story is told.

136
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,511
But before we go into these wider-reaching aspects

137
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,971
of the game, we had to find the center, the core,

138
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:48,172
the foundation at which we could grow everything out.

139
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,693
And that starts with Crash as a character himself.

140
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:55,420
And the statement that we have for Tone is that it's jackass meets Looney Tunes.

141
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,442
It's a game about just barreling into danger and it's got the silliness and the wackiness

142
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:06,163
of Looney Tunes and this is the original inspiration for the series and going

143
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,684
harking back towards that original DNA.

144
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:17,772
So starting with Crash, we looked at the series and you know, Crash over the years has actually evolved quite a bit.

145
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:23,217
He's retained some core elements about him, like his color and the way he wears pants and his red shoes.

146
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:26,340
But he's actually made some pretty drastic changes over time.

147
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,344
Now, we know that the game is about a continuation of the original's trilogy.

148
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,928
And so we want to focus on the first three expressions.

149
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:36,250
And the N'Sane Trilogy, the remasters,

150
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,994
did an amazing job of going back to that source

151
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:42,357
and bringing it up to modern standards

152
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:44,379
and to a whole new level of fidelity.

153
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:48,263
So it seemed like one thing that we were asking ourselves

154
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:51,006
is, why not just take that look and continue it?

155
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:57,211
Now, the reason why we didn't was because one thing that we agreed on and aligned very early on

156
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:03,414
is that we didn't want this new game to be perceived as a sequel to a remaster or a DLC

157
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:09,597
extension to a remaster. There had to be an immediate, just at a glance, understanding that

158
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:15,899
this is a new expression, set itself apart from the remasters, that this was a game for 2020.

159
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:23,302
And so we were already early on on a path to presenting a new interpretation for crash.

160
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:28,417
And we've got this amazing team of artists.

161
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:31,019
And before we did put any pencil to paper,

162
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,121
we also looked at some of the surrounding media

163
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:36,322
that influenced our impressions and our memories

164
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,363
of who Crash is.

165
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,745
There's obviously Crash, mascot guy in the commercials

166
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:44,267
that we all love.

167
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,188
There's internet memes more recently.

168
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,229
Crash has his own manga.

169
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,392
He's been a guest star on TV shows like Skylanders.

170
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,874
So all of these are different ingredients

171
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:55,716
and we wanna make sure that we incorporate it

172
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,578
because they are a part of the fabric of who we remember

173
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:00,680
and how we remember what crash is.

174
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:07,079
Now our art director tasked our amazing and talented artists

175
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,881
with going really, really wide and pushing the envelope

176
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:12,482
with the interpretation for Crash,

177
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,924
starting from a safe interpretation

178
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:19,207
to really, really pushed and challenging convention.

179
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:21,849
And when we gave them targets,

180
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:25,471
so we were looking for a cute version of Crash Bandicoot,

181
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:29,806
a more edgy version, something that's a little bit more heroic,

182
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:34,750
and we also gave freedom for personal interpretation to just go where your heart

183
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,934
takes you with how you remember Crash. As we got all these drawings together we could see a lot of

184
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:45,619
the commonality of these drawings and that formed the center of who we believed he was.

185
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:51,411
And we selected a handful of drawings and poses

186
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:55,733
that represented the facets of Crash's personality

187
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,694
and ultimately asked a single artist

188
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,755
to interpret this down into a single style.

189
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:03,637
Now these poses and this sheet ultimately served

190
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:05,758
as the model sheet for the 3D sculpt

191
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:06,998
that we see here today.

192
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:15,311
Another thing that we know that this game is, is that it's about, it's a cartoon.

193
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:20,014
And we know from the original developers at Naughty Dog that their ambitions for the title

194
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:24,338
was for it to be a living cartoon and harken back to Looney Tunes.

195
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,080
And so we looked at that source and we made sure that...

196
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,883
as we built out our designs and we built out our models and our rigs

197
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:38,128
that our animators were equipped to really push this level of text every like deformation

198
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:44,333
and to get that extreme movement to simulate that motion blur to get that silkiness

199
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,375
and that clarity of interpolation into our aesthetic.

200
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,831
Now, physical humor is fantastic.

201
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,251
It's great.

202
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,191
It's universal.

203
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:56,893
But we also want to make sure that we are specifically

204
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,954
speaking to our audience of 25 to 40-year-olds.

205
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:01,815
And we do that in a number of ways.

206
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:03,776
In one sense, what we did was in some of the namings

207
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,257
and for the skins or the titles for the levels,

208
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:10,718
we added in some suggestions of innuendo

209
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,919
to make sure that we've got things.

210
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,420
It might sail over a kid's head, but it's

211
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,281
a little wink at our audience for 25 to 40-year-olds.

212
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:24,991
We introduced situations that were a little bit more edgy in nature, but it didn't push it too far.

213
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:34,124
But like the fact that entropy takes his his level of narcissism to a whole new level by with this creepy, incestuous love for his multiverse self.

214
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:42,919
And we also wrote dialogue in the way to make sure that this game was very self-aware

215
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,862
and was making reference to its own past, the fact that it is a game, that it has a history,

216
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:54,305
like this joke that's kind of acknowledging the fact that it's ignoring some of the other sequels

217
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:58,767
that are coming after this in its chronological timeline.

218
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:04,210
Now our statement for gameplay is tense, precise execution.

219
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,536
And just like with Tone, before we built out and made sure

220
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:12,024
that this affected all aspects of game design,

221
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:14,008
we needed to find a home base,

222
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:15,833
and that was in Crash himself.

223
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:24,425
Ultimately with Crash as a game, we want to make sure that the core verbs of jump, spin, slide, slam

224
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:28,487
is really, really satisfying to pull off. It feels familiar.

225
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:33,988
One of the original kills of this set is that it's super, super approachable,

226
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:41,031
and yet the title is very challenging and very demanding, and it really asks a lot of skill.

227
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:44,572
And it really asks you to master the game through skill.

228
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:49,603
At its best, it is hard but fair.

229
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:54,238
And one thing as we started to block out certain levels,

230
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:59,220
we found that it's just inherently difficult to land some,

231
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,421
to just understand depth

232
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:04,082
as you're jumping to and from perspective.

233
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:06,723
And so one thing that we did pretty early on

234
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:08,564
was to try to figure out

235
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:12,326
how can we preserve the level of difficulty,

236
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:15,527
but add, make sure that the player has all the tools

237
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,668
and the information at hand to land.

238
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:21,913
these really very difficult precision asks.

239
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:25,116
And so we actually added a very overt indicator

240
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:26,758
underneath the crash so that at any time,

241
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:29,300
you know precisely where you're going to land.

242
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:35,185
And we had a ton of ideas and prototypes

243
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:38,686
in terms of new mechanics and new abilities for Crash,

244
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:41,927
new vehicles, new playable heroes.

245
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:44,848
And, but there was some blurriness in terms of how

246
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:46,969
an ability, depending on how it's framed,

247
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:48,510
it could easily have been a vehicle,

248
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,091
it could easily have been a new hero.

249
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:54,812
So it was important for our design team to make sure

250
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,733
that there's a separation in function,

251
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,853
not just in theme between all of these different ideas.

252
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:08,459
individual lanes that they occupied. For example, with new abilities, we isolated these to the

253
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,602
new quantum masks. These abilities were always going to be triggered on a button, and they

254
00:17:13,602 --> 00:17:19,586
always added on top of the core verbs of run, jump, spin, slide, slam.

255
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,360
On the other hand of things, there's new vehicles.

256
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,602
It was almost like a subtraction of control.

257
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:29,186
And then you've got new things like wall running and grind

258
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:31,909
railing and completely new heroes

259
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:34,411
like Dingo Dao or Neo Cortex that is just

260
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:35,432
a completely different.

261
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:41,575
approach to interacting with these core elements like Wumpa or crates or even

262
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:46,737
just the feel of how you crash as a character that just barrels through

263
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:50,358
danger but Neocortex is more cerebral and so those levels presented an

264
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:54,480
opportunity to introduce more puzzly elements that you would have to think

265
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,981
through before you execute it on.

266
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,827
So this gave us a, once we understood

267
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:02,668
and identified these individual lanes,

268
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:05,290
we knew what the ingredients were for the game.

269
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,832
And we started to lay them out on this,

270
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:11,394
it was essentially is a roadmap of the entire game,

271
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:12,295
level by level.

272
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:15,837
And we often, we put this giant physical board

273
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,318
in the office, it was very unavoidable

274
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:19,660
on your way to your desk.

275
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,462
Everyone was constantly having conversation around this.

276
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:25,925
And we were playing with the sequencing of levels, how they would flow into each other,

277
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:28,947
it influenced how we told the story, it influenced as well.

278
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:33,751
We did breakdowns of the different sequences and sections within a level as well, so we

279
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:38,855
could see of the ingredients that we're sprinkling in, how we could be strategic and deliberate

280
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:41,577
about inserting novelty and new mechanics.

281
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:48,643
So one thing that was really important is that we're expecting that if you're going to play a game that's called Crash Bandicoot,

282
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:54,208
that the vast majority of the time is going to be about how satisfying it is to play Crash,

283
00:18:54,208 --> 00:19:01,574
and we didn't want this to be over-saturated with new experiences or new heroes that might not be as interesting to you.

284
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:08,522
So this was a really great way as a high level approach to make sure that we could see them very deliberately,

285
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,726
that we built up on the difficulty in a way that stacked on each other,

286
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:17,492
and that just everything fit together in a way that always went back to complementing the core Crash gameplay.

287
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:26,305
This also influenced some ideas that we had, some presumptions that we had about the game.

288
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:30,707
Like, we presumed that there was going to be a warp room structure for the game.

289
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:34,989
And if you're not familiar with warp rooms, warp rooms are essentially little hubs where

290
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:39,111
there are maybe five or six different level nodes that you could approach in any order

291
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,873
that you choose, and once you've completed the majority of those, you could move on to

292
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:43,693
the next warp room.

293
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:49,416
Now, we presumed that we were going to inherit this coming from Crash 3, but as we started to

294
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:55,138
lay out some of our other goals, like wanting this to be very challenging but fair, and we

295
00:19:55,138 --> 00:20:01,241
also wanted to tell a linear story, and as we start to sequence things on our campaign roadmap,

296
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,681
it became very difficult.

297
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:08,144
by allowing the player to access different levels at different times

298
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:12,426
without introducing a lot of complex things that would be tuning the experiences

299
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:13,907
in a variable way on the other levels.

300
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:16,809
So we actually went back on this and said, you know,

301
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:20,671
this game is actually going to go back to a very linear structure,

302
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:23,712
and it benefits us so that we could be tighter,

303
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:27,654
and the experiences that the player just completed could be more reliable,

304
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:28,875
so we could build on those.

305
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:35,617
So that also influenced our approach to difficulty.

306
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,959
Tense, precise execution, it says hard, right?

307
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,159
It says difficult.

308
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,322
And one of our presumptions was that we were going

309
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:44,703
to introduce difficulty selection,

310
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:48,086
that you could start this game and say,

311
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:50,047
if you wanted to play really difficult,

312
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,868
you could choose hard.

313
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,769
If you wanted it easier, you could play that.

314
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:59,132
But it turns out Platformer is a little bit more difficult to tune in that way.

315
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:05,375
Like for an example, as a combat game, you know, you have options, numeric options,

316
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,177
to tune up your hit points or your combat effectiveness.

317
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:11,598
But Platformer, you've got a gap in the ground.

318
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:17,103
and it's the level, it's the world that's built very specifically to specific metrics,

319
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:21,987
tuning the difficulty of that gap in the ground that you will have to fall to death is difficult

320
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:29,073
to do. And we were exploring different ideas of layering on things that would make things easier

321
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:33,376
so that you could undo a death or maybe you could fly over certain things or had some currency that

322
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:38,421
gave you some ability to bypass some of these challenges. But we found that it was going against

323
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:43,344
our original intention of preserving the game's difficulty but being fair.

324
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:48,847
So after lots and lots of exploration and prototyping, we ultimately landed on a place

325
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:55,191
in which we split out the play style into two different things, not difficulty but play style,

326
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:59,353
so that players could choose a modern mode which had unlimited lives,

327
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:02,995
but you could always reset to the last checkpoint.

328
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:06,727
the difficulty and the challenge of the levels were preserved,

329
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:11,050
but you could always try again.

330
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,571
And in retro, we had the classic behavior

331
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:17,393
of introducing limited lives.

332
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:19,574
And if all your lives expired, we

333
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:22,015
would start you as a hard reset at the beginning of the level.

334
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:25,257
So again, challenges preserved across both options,

335
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:28,999
but in this way, the player was able to choose

336
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:33,421
the level of punishment or masochism for this game.

337
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:40,874
respecting both a modern approach to things and what was nostalgic for the experience.

338
00:22:44,316 --> 00:22:52,122
Finally, on World, our statement here is that this game is a colorful, dangerous universe.

339
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:58,807
This is probably the most straightforward of all the pillars, because what Crash and the classic

340
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:04,612
games were already started at such a high point, and we just looked for opportunities in which we

341
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:06,493
could tap into that and dial it to 11.

342
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:14,136
So one of many people's memories, myself included, about the original games was that

343
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:21,443
they were surprisingly lush and detailed and packed with just detail that weren't seen in

344
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:26,048
other platforms of that time. Now obviously we were not constrained by hardware in the same way.

345
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:30,132
We wanted to make sure that we tapped into that same memory and same feeling.

346
00:23:30,552 --> 00:23:38,259
And so we very deliberately built out opportunities that exploited this or highlighted the fact that we had,

347
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:42,223
we built out these new environments that were way more detailed,

348
00:23:42,223 --> 00:23:46,666
had way more storytelling involved that compelled you on this journey towards the very end.

349
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:58,304
The classic games, this is probably one of the most iconic moments of the Crash series,

350
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,285
is this boulder chase that's running towards the camera.

351
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:04,206
And we wanted to make sure that we tapped into that nostalgia.

352
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:06,287
But again, dial it up to 11 on this.

353
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:10,828
So how do you take something that's exciting like this and take it to the next level?

354
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:14,370
Well, you take that ball and you turn it into a live ghost character,

355
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,750
a spirit monster that's chasing after you.

356
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,852
We make sure that every single beat that he's interacting and smashing

357
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:23,793
with the environment, that we're tuning the rubber banding so that it is

358
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:29,334
so precise in such a way that it always guarantees a very, very narrow escape in that experience.

359
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:37,357
In the bosses, what was formerly a hopscotch exercise that was over in a matter of minutes,

360
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:43,218
we dialed this up to be larger than life into a multi-phase escalation of ultimate tests that

361
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:48,100
really asked challenging questions of all the skills that you picked up and mastered along the way.

362
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:54,885
Now, with all of this novelty and these new worlds,

363
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:58,747
we made one thing that we did to ground

364
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,528
these new environments and experiences

365
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:03,629
was to make sure that we sprinkled in

366
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,591
a bunch of Easter eggs throughout the game.

367
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:12,504
made sure that there's enough detailed for eagle-eyed fans, but also to tap into the richness

368
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:18,346
of the IP that didn't get an opportunity in the main storyline or just it would have been

369
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:21,627
too crammed if we tried to pull in all of the interesting characters and then tell a

370
00:25:21,627 --> 00:25:22,808
compelling story of it through there.

371
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:28,183
We even took this to a point of integrating this,

372
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:32,845
the woe meme that's taken over the internet in the past

373
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:35,286
and making a beat out of this to really highlight

374
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:37,907
and again, wink to the core fan base.

375
00:25:44,718 --> 00:25:47,620
So that takes me to the end of this talk.

376
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,744
Out of these three pillars and statements about DNA,

377
00:25:53,744 --> 00:25:57,046
these did not change from the very beginning to the end.

378
00:25:57,046 --> 00:26:00,128
And they were very, very useful for us

379
00:26:00,128 --> 00:26:04,911
to always go back to as a measurement of,

380
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:07,233
are we aligned in the things that we're adding to this game?

381
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:14,215
Underneath all of these statements, though, I would say that it was really, really important for us to listen to the fans.

382
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:24,998
This is ultimately a love letter to the fans, and so it's really important that we spend a lot of time listening in on the community boards, on Reddit, on Discord,

383
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:31,420
just to hear people's nostalgia, their fondness for these classic games, and also their wishes for what a new game was.

384
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:35,833
We also, I think it was really, really important for us

385
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:39,235
and really helpful for us to also hire fans as well.

386
00:26:39,235 --> 00:26:43,718
We had representation of really, really hardcore fans

387
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:45,219
in each of the teams.

388
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,640
And that was incredibly useful to have

389
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,142
as we introduced new ideas to always have a gut check,

390
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,703
someone we could just walk on over to or call up

391
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:55,765
to check and see if we were straying off

392
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:59,247
or being off brand or inauthentic in our decisions.

393
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:08,388
So that takes me to this little plug here is that at Toys for Bob, we are hiring both fans and developers,

394
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:13,572
or if you're a developer and a fan of titles like Crash 4 and Call of Duty Warzone.

395
00:27:13,572 --> 00:27:20,797
If you're looking for more information, please take a look at this website at careers.toysforbob.com,

396
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:28,703
especially as we're looking towards celebrating more in this 25th anniversary of Crash Bandicoot this year.

397
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:32,997
And if you've got any questions about these roles

398
00:27:32,997 --> 00:27:35,578
or about this talk, this is me.

399
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:36,719
Please feel free to contact me.

400
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,519
And thanks, if you made it this far,

401
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,700
thanks for listening in.

402
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,380
And I hope you learned a little bit more

403
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,482
about the development of Crash Bandicoot 4.
