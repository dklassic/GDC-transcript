00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:15,957
Hello, my name is Ian and I am an accessibility specialist and that's what I'm here to talk

2
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:22,982
to you about today. Accessibility and specifically how it relates to smaller studios. I've got

3
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,325
a few different angles on that to cover but first of all I'm going to go over a few of

4
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:29,808
the basics about what accessibility is and how it works just to make sure that we're

5
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:32,730
all on the same page. So fundamentals.

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,060
First up, what even is accessibility?

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,141
So to answer that question, we need to take a step back

8
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:42,841
and look at what disability itself actually is.

9
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,262
And I have this chap here to help me explain.

10
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:47,422
If you're looking at this picture,

11
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:49,182
you might be able to have some kind of a guess

12
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:51,603
at what it is that's making this guy disabled.

13
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:55,644
You might be thinking that he has cerebral palsy,

14
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:59,184
and he does, but cerebral palsy is a medical condition,

15
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:01,145
and that is a very important distinction to make.

16
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,261
So what else? You might be thinking about him being in a wheelchair, but again, that's not a disability.

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,563
That's kind of the opposite of disability, it's what's actually allowing him to go about his day.

18
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:18,608
Which he was doing just fine, until he tried to go into this bar and encountered the steps.

19
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:26,313
And that's what disability is, it's mismatched interactions like this that result in some kind of barrier performing day-to-day tasks.

20
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,947
And those barriers, whether it's steps, small text,

21
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:32,547
inflexible controls, color use, they're usually

22
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:34,628
put there by other people, by us.

23
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,868
And that is a bit of a heavy thing

24
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:40,589
to get your head around, that as designers, developers, content

25
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:43,109
producers, we can actually disable people.

26
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,890
But the flip side is that by being aware of barriers

27
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,810
and working to avoid or remove them,

28
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,511
we can actually prevent disabling situations

29
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,711
from happening and ensure that more players are

30
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,512
having the kind of experience that we intended.

31
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:59,244
And it's that that's known as accessibility.

32
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:03,327
And it matters for all kinds of reasons.

33
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:09,691
For the human benefits of the access that games can give to recreation, to culture, to socialising.

34
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,273
The financial benefit of reaching more players.

35
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:15,175
Disabled people make up at least 20% of your target audience.

36
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:20,279
To keep up with your competitors and also keep up with player expectations.

37
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:25,117
The design inspiration that thinking about different kinds of problems can give you,

38
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:27,177
which is something I'm going to talk about a bit more later.

39
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:32,459
The PR value, extra visibility, word of mouth through new loyal fans.

40
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,940
And also how it can benefit wide swathes of your players,

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,741
as designing for a permanent physical impairment like one arm,

42
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,843
also means you've designed for temporary impairments like a broken arm,

43
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:47,904
situational impairments like holding a baby or holding a beer.

44
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:50,865
And also players, just different.

45
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,351
preferences and levels of experience too.

46
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:58,473
But it can feel intimidating, right?

47
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,494
It's hard enough designing a game that works for you.

48
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,474
So how do you design for something like this?

49
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:05,175
And the good news is that you don't have to.

50
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,337
So if you think back to the guy in the wheelchair earlier,

51
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:11,098
this is a list of medical conditions,

52
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,478
which isn't what's important.

53
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:15,399
If you take, for example, Parkinson's and dyspraxia,

54
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:20,568
Those are two conditions that have absolutely nothing in common with each other medically,

55
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:26,671
but they both come up against the same barrier of small fiddly interface elements. If you address

56
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,773
that barrier, you've addressed both of those conditions and you've also addressed a whole

57
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:36,496
swathe of other motor and vision related conditions too. So it's really not about the

58
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,698
condition and the person, it's about our designs and how those designs can be more successful.

59
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:47,625
So at a high level, it boils down to a few core groups.

60
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:50,086
So barriers relating to people's ability to see,

61
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:55,129
to hear, to take in process and action information,

62
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,170
and also manipulate controls.

63
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:02,833
And speech too, although that doesn't really come up

64
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:03,893
unless you're making something

65
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,474
that has player to player communication.

66
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:09,436
So even if you just spend a few minutes early in development

67
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,757
thinking about what kind of barriers your game presents

68
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:12,598
to each of these groups,

69
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:13,898
you'll be able to make a big difference.

70
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:18,749
Sometimes through the design choices that you make, sometimes through communicating

71
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,530
information in more than one way, like a symbol as well as color or subtitles as well as speech.

72
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,891
And sometimes through flexibility like giving people a choice of controls.

73
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:34,632
Some of the barriers in your game will be intentional and an essential part of what

74
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:40,133
gives the experience value and that's fine. It's figuring out which barriers are unnecessary

75
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:44,174
that is how we make accessible experiences and that's what we're digging into today.

76
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,266
So how does this fit in for you? Where do indies sit in all this?

77
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:58,369
The Last of Us 2 is an example of where the industry is currently at.

78
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:03,591
It has a vast swathe of accommodations, including being the first AAA designed from the ground up

79
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,993
to be completely playable by people who are completely blind.

80
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:14,176
But they are a big AAA with vast resources. How can someone with a tiny budget possibly compete?

81
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,040
It can be pretty tough seeing the industry changing,

82
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,481
feeling those player expectations shifting,

83
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:22,521
but feeling like it's something that just isn't achievable for you.

84
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:32,103
So here are a few other games that are way up there at the top of the industry.

85
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,804
Sequence Storm in particular by far surpasses The Last of Us 2.

86
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:40,765
And Hyperdots accessibility efforts made them a finalist at the Game Awards.

87
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:44,833
I would very strongly recommend checking out these three games.

88
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:48,417
Even if you aren't matching everything that they've achieved, there's still a lot to learn

89
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:53,922
from and be inspired by, and even the smallest tweaks can sometimes make a tremendous difference

90
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:59,066
to your player's experience. These three games are all very different from each other,

91
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:04,091
but they have something in common. They were all developed by solely indie developers,

92
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:06,533
each made by one person.

93
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:11,913
And this isn't unusual either.

94
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:14,294
Indies have always been at the forefront of accessibility

95
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:18,935
with games like Terraformers from 2006, VVVVV from 2010,

96
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:20,895
Sheet One Up also from 2010.

97
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:25,096
And again, these are all made by solo Indies.

98
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,437
Pioneering games like these are still ahead of most AAAs

99
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:31,558
today, and AAAs have only really started

100
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:33,318
getting properly involved in the past few years.

101
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,319
So the idea that it's out of reach for smaller studios

102
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,139
really is a myth.

103
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,259
And being an Indie even actually has

104
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,380
some distinct advantages.

105
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:49,049
There are some common misconceptions around accessibility, usually some combination of these.

106
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,930
And all of this is demonstrably false. They are misconceptions.

107
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,552
So if considered early enough in development, there is a great deal that can be done for relatively little effort.

108
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:04,154
And rather than diluting anything down, it just means ensuring that your vision is kept intact for as many players as possible.

109
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:09,256
Including the over 20% of gamers who experience some kind of disability.

110
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:15,979
And these misconceptions can be a huge barrier at AAAs because there are so many people that

111
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:22,043
need to be convinced in order to do anything. But smaller companies don't have that problem.

112
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:26,206
So the smaller you are, the less people need to be convinced, right? If you want to do something,

113
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:31,730
you can just do it. And you can do it quickly.

114
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:38,331
When Legend of Grimrock was in development, a gamer emailed asking for some on-screen mouse

115
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:43,435
controls because he was physically unable to use a keyboard or a controller. And as you can see on

116
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:49,460
the right, they implemented it. So within hours of this gamer's email, the team had already replied

117
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,743
saying the feature was now in the game. And that kind of responsiveness, that kind of direct

118
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:58,126
personal community engagement, those are things that AAAs can really only dream of.

119
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:07,567
So accessibility is important to you and as a small studio you have some distinct advantages but

120
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:12,933
what about the development itself? How can you fit accessibility into tiny timescales and tiny budgets?

121
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:20,300
The most important technique actually applies equally to AAAs as to Indies so

122
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:22,443
let's go back to Naughty Dog for a second.

123
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:26,294
The Last of Us 2's predecessor was Uncharted 4.

124
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,856
And Uncharted 4 did some cool things.

125
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:31,617
A relatively small number of them and latent development.

126
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:33,178
That's what you're looking at in this slide.

127
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,181
And the reaction from the team was the same as it always

128
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:38,481
is in those situations.

129
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,523
Man, if only we thought about it earlier,

130
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,944
we could have done so much more.

131
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:44,365
We could have done it so much better.

132
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:47,046
So that's what they did with the next game.

133
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:52,198
Naughty Dog had been really open about what their secret sauce was for The Last of Us 2,

134
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:58,742
and it was simply considering accessibility from early in development. There is literally no time

135
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:04,645
at which it is too early to think about it. If thought about early enough, there's a lot that

136
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:09,869
can be really cheap and easy, even free, a simple zero-cost design decision.

137
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,673
Like text size. If you decide up front that you aren't going to use tiny text,

138
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:18,813
That's it. Job done.

139
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,036
Compare that to a game called The Outer Worlds.

140
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,698
Now they launched with very small text,

141
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:27,140
and they actually addressed that in a post-launch patch.

142
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,382
And that work took them three months.

143
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:34,706
And if you're thinking about accessibility early,

144
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:38,589
it can inspire and inform how you design your game.

145
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:44,495
So to explain how, I'm going to jump back in time a little to the dawn of human civilisation.

146
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:48,397
Back to the first time somebody made a finger mark on a cave wall with some mud.

147
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:53,299
And since those days, many people tried to reinvent writing,

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,782
resulting in the stylus, the quill, the pencil, the fountain pen, the biro.

149
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:01,703
All variations on the same theme, right?

150
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:04,865
Because if you try to answer the same kind of question,

151
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,206
you're likely going to come up with the same kind of answer.

152
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:14,953
But I'm pretty sure that none of you use devices like that for most of your writing anymore.

153
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:19,955
I'm guessing most of you are using keyboards, right? And the keyboard comes from the typewriter.

154
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:25,236
And how did the inventor of the typewriter come up with such a wildly different kind of answer?

155
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:30,218
By asking a different kind of question. The inventor of the first working typewriter

156
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:35,060
was trying to figure out a way for someone who was blind to be able to write letters.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,581
And what you're looking at is actually one of that blind woman's letters.

158
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:44,089
So anytime you type anything, you're actually using technology that was invented for blind people.

159
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,872
So that was a little bit of a detour, but it is relevant, I promise, because the same thing

160
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:56,154
happens with games like this game, Puzzle Retreat. In the early stages of development,

161
00:10:56,174 --> 00:11:00,815
they started thinking about accessibility, in particular for motor and cognitive accessibility,

162
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:04,977
and they found inspiration in that. They liked where their thinking was heading with it and

163
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:07,298
just adopted that thinking as the game itself.

164
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:14,343
So they scrapped the idea of timers, scrapped move limits, scrapped retry limits.

165
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:15,844
They even scrapped progression.

166
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:20,408
They made all the stages available from the start to complete in any order.

167
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:26,313
So they went for more of a relaxing, zen-like experience instead of the usual frantic action

168
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,095
puzzler approach they had originally aimed for.

169
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,578
So they had made their game accessible by design.

170
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:36,251
And in doing so, they had actually differentiated themselves from the competition enough that

171
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:40,995
their game was featured on the iTunes front page, with all the commercial implications

172
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:41,595
that that brings.

173
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:48,883
So, what to consider?

174
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:51,104
Well, what's appropriate for your game

175
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:53,165
is something you'll need to figure out for yourself

176
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:56,266
as it's dependent on the kind of barriers that your game includes

177
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,387
and also on what your personal vision is

178
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,168
for the kind of challenge your game should present.

179
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:04,269
But there are a few core basics to try to hit across all games.

180
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,090
And these five you're looking at here

181
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,951
are the most commonly complained about accessibility issues.

182
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:15,363
That's not the same thing as most important for a whole bunch of reasons,

183
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:19,865
but if you can nail these and nail them efficiently, then you'll be getting good

184
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:24,467
bang for your buck, solving issues that have a significant impact on the experience of

185
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:33,271
significant numbers of players. First, text size. This is by far the most common accessibility

186
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:33,671
complaint.

187
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:36,299
there's a pretty wide range of needs.

188
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,561
So ideally, what you want here is scalable UI.

189
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:43,405
But even if you can just decide from the outset that you are not going to go below

190
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:49,830
28 pixels at 1080p, which is roughly the size of the text here in Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime,

191
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,673
you'll be able to make a huge difference for really zero effort.

192
00:12:57,516 --> 00:13:02,861
Next up, remapping. So letting people move actions over to inputs that are more usable for them.

193
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,972
Unity's new input model is supposed to have this covered,

194
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:09,033
but it's currently a bit of a pain to work with.

195
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,535
But there are plugins you can use instead,

196
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:16,098
things like C input, rewired, in control, and S input,

197
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:17,739
but more of those later.

198
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,780
Something that is worth highlighting,

199
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,381
the simpler your controls are,

200
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,462
the more effective remapping becomes.

201
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,024
You know, a controller having 16 buttons

202
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:28,545
doesn't mean that you're required to design controls

203
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:29,306
that use all of them.

204
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:31,067
Always try and keep in mind

205
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:32,748
whether complexity is really necessary.

206
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:37,305
And think about physical strain too, so things like button mashing or holding buttons down.

207
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:40,667
If you can figure out ways around those that can be really quick with too.

208
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,874
Colorblindness. There's a pretty widespread misconception that this means filters,

209
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:54,218
modes and so on. Don't use filters. They aren't what colorblind people ask for and

210
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:59,241
they cause as many problems as they solve. And modes should actually be a last resort too.

211
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:05,096
Because what a mode is, is actually a workaround for inaccessible design choices.

212
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:11,942
So instead, try to make your game accessible by default, like Puzzle Retreat did. So this means

213
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:16,446
not relying on color alone to communicate or differentiate things. So also use something

214
00:14:16,486 --> 00:14:24,874
else like shape, patterns, icons, text. Subtitling. Most games now have subtitles,

215
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:27,136
but they're usually pretty rubbish.

216
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,250
There's a whole bunch of nice stuff you can do to make them better.

217
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,051
Things like toggleable speaker names and speaker direction and scalable text.

218
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:38,292
But if you can just ensure good size and good contrast

219
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,632
without too much text on the screen at the time,

220
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:44,133
you'll be way out there on top of the industry.

221
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,453
What exactly does that mean?

222
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:49,254
It means at least 46 pixels at 1080p,

223
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:52,815
with a solid plain background behind the text, ideally black.

224
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,475
No more than two lines per subtitle.

225
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,125
no more than 40 characters per line.

226
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:00,768
If you want to take things up a notch from there,

227
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,770
a very quick and easy way is to let people change the transparency

228
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,971
of the background behind the text.

229
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,715
And the last is intensity.

230
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:12,617
Firstly, what you're doing with the camera,

231
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:14,578
anything that gives a sense of motion

232
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:17,020
that doesn't match what the player's head is doing in real life

233
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,321
can make people ill.

234
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:23,285
So that means things like screen shake, motion blur, weapon bug.

235
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:28,420
So if you can avoid or minimize these then great, but if not then at least let people turn them off.

236
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:39,127
And secondly, intensity of effects. This is the really important one. Photosensitive epilepsy

237
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:45,051
isn't common but seizures can cause serious injury and they can be induced by flashes,

238
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,055
flickers and patterns. There's actually an internationally agreed standard of what constitutes

239
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:52,956
a reasonably low level of risk.

240
00:15:53,625 --> 00:16:00,887
and you should try to avoid anything ever falling outside that. Giving people a warning or a toggle

241
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,909
doesn't really cut it because the way people find out they are prone to seizures

242
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:12,011
is by having one. Like the time a boy had his first seizure playing Raving Rabbids which

243
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:16,412
resulted in Ubisoft introducing mandatory epilepsy testing across all of its games.

244
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:22,933
What you're looking at here is a setting in a game called Everhunt.

245
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:27,476
The imagery on the right actually sits below that reasonably low level of risk,

246
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:31,278
but they still offer a setting to turn the flashy effects off.

247
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:35,580
And this is a good thing to be able to do because outside of seizure risk itself,

248
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:41,023
there's a whole bunch of other people who intense effects can impact negatively,

249
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:45,086
sometimes even painfully, with conditions ranging from autism to migraines.

250
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:52,410
there's actually paid software called the Harding test that can evaluate footage of your game for

251
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,797
seizure risk and that's what Everhood used and it's what the big publishers use too.

252
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,681
But what if paying isn't feasible?

253
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:06,102
Well that international standard on risk avoidance is publicly available

254
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:09,805
and what you're looking at here is a slightly simplified version of what it

255
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,867
is you need to avoid. So I'm not going to cover all the

256
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,269
details now but it is pretty straightforward stuff.

257
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:17,332
So if you can keep this in mind when you're developing your game you'll be

258
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,273
able to make a big difference without too much effort.

259
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:30,175
So hopefully you can see that nailing the basics isn't too hard and even just covering these will

260
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,657
put you in a really good position because it's still pretty rare for any developer to nail them

261
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:41,660
all. But what about going further? Well, even on the smallest budgets and time scales, there are

262
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:46,843
always low-hanging fruit, things that are quick and easy, especially if you're thinking about

263
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:47,583
accessibility early.

264
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:57,870
What you're looking at here is a bunch of accessibility settings in an indie point and click platformer called Layer of the Clockwork God.

265
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:59,872
And here's what the developer had to say about them.

266
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:06,496
It was astonishingly easy, to be honest. I spent about four to five hours total adding nine core changes.

267
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:11,699
And honestly, it was all pretty straightforward, easy work, which is exactly what I need right now.

268
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:15,822
In the scheme of things, that's probably less time than I spent choosing the color of the options.

269
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,047
And concentrating on the easy things is fine.

270
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,148
It is totally okay not to be able to do everything.

271
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:25,629
I'm going to come back to that idea again at the end.

272
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,751
Another example, this time of a specific feature. This is from

273
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:37,652
the solo indie title Epic Eric. The developer added a high contrast mode

274
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:40,633
which was just a rectangle between the foreground and the background.

275
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:44,275
It's transparent by default and players can tint it all the way to white all the

276
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:44,695
way to black.

277
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,484
This is really valuable, but very rarely seen across the whole industry.

278
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:53,949
And this feature took the developer 15 minutes to implement,

279
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,772
most of which was actually making the Slider UI itself.

280
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:03,119
And a very well-known example, Celeste.

281
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:08,467
So this game has been hugely influential on other indie platforms in particular,

282
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:13,632
with many games copying and building upon Celeste's ideas, which were in turn developed

283
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:17,536
in response to how exclusionary Cuphead's inflexible design was.

284
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:22,741
Celeste's whole feature set took two weeks to implement.

285
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:26,384
And if you look at the kind of accommodations they implemented,

286
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:29,207
that brings me neatly on to the next thing.

287
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,784
So this is another indie platformer from a few years before Celeste called Even the Ocean.

288
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,307
If you have a look at the kinds of options that games like this and Celeste have,

289
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:48,431
quite a few of them look an awful lot like debug options. Options you implement to make your life

290
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:54,134
easier while developing or variables you tinker with balancing that you then turn off and hide

291
00:19:54,195 --> 00:20:00,038
from players when you release the game. So maybe don't hide them, put them in the menu instead.

292
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,870
chances are there'll be a useful accessibility consideration for someone.

293
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,953
So you may even have built a bunch of useful stuff already without even knowing it.

294
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:16,178
But isn't that cheating? Won't that break the game? Pushing people further away from your vision.

295
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,062
With options like these, like invincibility and slow motion, you might think so, and in some cases

296
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:27,666
they may be. But it's always worth thinking about the full breadth of who might want to play your game.

297
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,422
For example, I know someone who is unable to use his hands

298
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:34,044
and interacts with technology, including games,

299
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:35,685
by using voice commands.

300
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:38,246
So for example, he speaks the word jump,

301
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,068
and that triggers pressing the space bar.

302
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:44,731
As you can imagine, that's quite a slow and imprecise way

303
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:45,431
to interact.

304
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:49,854
So as Celeste is a precision platformer,

305
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,915
the default game is unplayable for him.

306
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:59,294
With invincibility and slow motion turned on, he can play, but it still takes a great deal of

307
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:04,939
practice and trial and error for him to get past each screen. And that success through persistence

308
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,324
is exactly the experience that the developers had in mind for their players. So those options

309
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:14,348
are actually letting people get closer to the intended experience rather than further away.

310
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:23,269
And that's something really important to keep in mind, that difficulty is relative,

311
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:26,451
the product of someone's capabilities versus the barriers in the game.

312
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:29,594
So if you have a specific level of challenge in mind for your players,

313
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:33,277
you need to find some kind of a way to accommodate human variance.

314
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:48,971
And learn from other people too. We're in a luxurious position now of the field being mature enough that there are loads of great examples of good practice that you can copy from other games and a ton of great free resources too.

315
00:21:49,671 --> 00:22:03,138
These three are just a few of them. When you look through resources like these, you'll often find things you're already doing that you didn't realize were useful for accessibility because accessible design and good design are often just the same thing.

316
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:09,341
If you want to spend time on R&D and pushing the industry forwards, then that is awesome.

317
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:14,665
But there is absolutely no shame at all in just copying what other people have done.

318
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:20,069
And other developers are always happy to chat with you about their work too. Accessibility is a field

319
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:28,615
that thrives and seems to encourage openness and collaboration. And as John Knowles from Turn 10 says,

320
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:33,447
It's almost as if there's a race among developers

321
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,407
to see who can make the most accessible game.

322
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,128
And I know a little bit about racing.

323
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:39,509
It's honestly a race where everybody wins.

324
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,852
So on that note, here are a bunch of indie accessibility

325
00:22:46,892 --> 00:22:48,152
superstars to check out.

326
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:50,133
I'm not going to list out what they all do,

327
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,673
but they're all great in their own ways.

328
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:54,514
There is a ton of great work out there that you can learn from.

329
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:58,276
That link there is just to a text version of the list.

330
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,037
Or grab a screenshot or whatever as well.

331
00:23:08,918 --> 00:23:11,020
The last three sections are pretty quick fire.

332
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,581
So firstly, tools.

333
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:16,724
By tools, I mean third party and middleware solutions.

334
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:18,806
There are some bits of external software

335
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:21,228
that you can use to help you identify things like contrast

336
00:23:21,288 --> 00:23:22,128
and cold lined issues.

337
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:26,749
And there are a bunch of plugins available to take care of some of the heavy lifting of feature

338
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:31,292
development, predominantly for Unity, but also some for Unreal as well. They cover things like

339
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:36,196
remapping, like I mentioned before, and subtitling, right through to making interfaces and gameplay

340
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:40,359
accessible to blind gamers. So if you scroll down to the bottom of this page, there is a handy list

341
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:45,143
there. And this kind of middleware help is only going to increase in the future. For example,

342
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:48,906
Unity recently hired a dedicated accessibility team with two goals.

343
00:23:49,507 --> 00:23:53,331
Firstly, to improve accessibility of the editor itself for disabled developers.

344
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:57,094
And secondly, to build tools to help developers make their games more accessible.

345
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:58,916
And Unity want your input.

346
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:02,640
So if you have ideas on either of those two things, please, please get in touch with them.

347
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:06,683
And player input.

348
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:13,900
nothing about us without us. This is a very well-known saying in the disability community

349
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,144
and it is very important. It's easy to make incorrect assumptions about what people need

350
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:24,409
or misinterpret guidelines or even just miss niggly little things that actually cancel out your work.

351
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:29,252
So working directly with the audience is invaluable and it's easy to do if you have

352
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:33,516
a dedicated user research team with a decent budget behind them, right? But what if you don't?

353
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,156
There's still a load of easy ways to get player feedback.

354
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,898
So things like asking for input through social media call outs,

355
00:24:42,018 --> 00:24:45,240
beta questionnaires, asking on forums on your Discord,

356
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,202
through engaging with fans during early access and crowdfunding.

357
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,785
Even actually asking in-game like the accessibility feedback battle in Candy Crush here.

358
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:58,047
But make people feel like their feedback is wanted and be

359
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:01,269
respectful of their time too. So don't expect too much more than a

360
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:02,270
quick reply for free.

361
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:07,588
But also, remember that giving people something in exchange for their time doesn't have to mean money.

362
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:11,550
So sometimes a copy of a game or inclusion in the credits can count too.

363
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:20,194
And make use of prominent advocates. Don't feel shy about asking somebody who has lots of disabled

364
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:25,397
followers to signal boost for you. That's exactly how Eagle Islands ended up with its industry

365
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:30,259
leading low vision considerations. So the developer put a call out on Twitter for input.

366
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:34,938
asked for a signal boost and then ended up with a whole bunch of low vision gamers giving him

367
00:25:34,998 --> 00:25:40,626
direct feedback. And reach out to experts and specialists for advice too, but again be respectful

368
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:45,773
of time, don't be too demanding, but still ask. Most of us are happy to give some degree of help for free.

369
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:52,178
So you've recognized the importance of accessibility.

370
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:54,219
You've used techniques, tools, and player input

371
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,680
to ensure as many people as possible

372
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,701
can have a good experience,

373
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:59,262
but there's still one vitally important thing

374
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:01,183
that can undo all of your work.

375
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,446
So let's take a look at two indie puzzlers,

376
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:07,947
Dots and Flowfree, and quite different games,

377
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,348
but both based on the idea

378
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,229
of connecting similarly colored dots.

379
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:13,410
There is a significant barrier here,

380
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,591
and to see what it is, I'd like you to keep your eye

381
00:26:15,691 --> 00:26:17,572
on the orange, red, and green circles on the right.

382
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:25,057
This is what the games look like with one of the common forms of colour blindness. As you can see,

383
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:30,540
not playable. And the social media response was predictable.

384
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:36,703
This game really discriminates against us colour blind people. I won't stand for this hashtag

385
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:42,426
fight for what's right. What these games could have done with was some kind of consideration

386
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:43,287
of colour blindness, right?

387
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,305
And actually both games did.

388
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:49,047
Dots through palette changes and flow free

389
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,008
through the additional labels.

390
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,190
But people just didn't know that was an option.

391
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,372
If the games had been accessible by default,

392
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,333
that wouldn't have been an issue.

393
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:58,175
But if you're implementing any kind of a setting,

394
00:26:58,696 --> 00:27:00,638
you can't just put it in a menu and assume

395
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:02,900
that everyone who needs it will find it and use it.

396
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:07,003
So make sure you tell people about what you've done.

397
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:08,725
This could be part of your trailer,

398
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:10,286
like in Legacy of the Elder Star.

399
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,440
It could be within the game, like the loading screen,

400
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,761
hence here about colorblindness.

401
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:21,324
Or like how the pause screen is used in Layer of the Clockwork

402
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:21,584
God.

403
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:28,888
Or something as simple and cheap as a bullet point

404
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:31,550
in a feature listing in a storefront or in a press kit.

405
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,552
That's what indie platform puzzler Hugh did.

406
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:38,954
And people noticed, not just players, but reviewers too.

407
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,157
All of the top scoring reviews on Metacritic

408
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,598
were reviews that talked about the game's colorblind mode.

409
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:49,719
And the quote on the top review you can see there

410
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:51,200
was about the colorblind mode.

411
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,921
And the game made it into green by one point.

412
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:56,523
The devs are absolutely certain that

413
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:58,984
without that simple bullet point in their press kit,

414
00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:00,865
they would not have made it into green

415
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,467
with all the critical and commercial implications

416
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:04,307
that go along with that.

417
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:09,530
And one last thought to leave you with,

418
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,771
and it's an important one.

419
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:18,887
don't sweat it. There is no fixed bar for you to hit or miss. Instead, look at accessibility

420
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:25,069
as an optimisation process. As with any kind of optimisation, it isn't an all or nothing thing.

421
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,832
There's always more that can be done, but every little bit you're able to do, every low-hanging

422
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:36,794
fruit you're able to reach simply means that more people are able to have the kind of experience

423
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:37,894
that you're hoping for.
