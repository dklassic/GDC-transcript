1
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:13,785
Good morning, my name is Brian Francis. I'm a community manager with GDC and a contributing editor at gamasutra.com.

2
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:21,909
If you need to refer to me in the third person, my pronouns are he him. I am joined today by EA Sports

3
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:28,772
Accessibility Lead Karen Stevens, who spent the last few years giving a number of great GDC talks about accessibility.

4
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,113
Karen, would you please introduce yourself?

5
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:32,867
Hi, I'm Karen Stevens.

6
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:34,568
It's kind of awkward because you just introduced me,

7
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,790
but I am the EA Sports Accessibility Lead.

8
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,812
I've been doing this for several years.

9
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:41,935
I've been at EA for seven and a half years.

10
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:43,876
I was at Microsoft for eight years before that.

11
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:45,758
Did some accessibility there as well.

12
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:47,799
And before that, I was actually in the medical industry.

13
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,523
My pronouns are she, her,

14
00:00:51,563 --> 00:00:53,444
but I'm not super picky on pronouns.

15
00:00:53,464 --> 00:00:54,925
So as long as I know you're referring to me,

16
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:56,887
it does not really strongly matter to me.

17
00:00:58,689 --> 00:00:59,970
So yeah, rolling right in.

18
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:02,945
Just waiting for that.

19
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:03,725
We can keep it going.

20
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,226
Karen, how are you doing?

21
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,167
How's your GDC been?

22
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:08,809
Unfortunately, I've been having trouble

23
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:09,969
with captions in sessions,

24
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,911
so I haven't actually gone to any sessions yet.

25
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,692
I saw part of Cherry's session

26
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:15,313
because it was recorded after the fact,

27
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,675
but I haven't had a chance to, like, see anything else.

28
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:20,236
So I'm really hoping I'm able to participate

29
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:21,517
any more fully in the future.

30
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:25,059
I am deaf, so I am purely lip-reading you,

31
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:27,761
and will probably have to use typed-in questions, too.

32
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:28,902
Of course, yeah.

33
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:36,662
Okay, looks like everyone can hear us. So we're going to go ahead and get started.

34
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:43,366
Though that's interesting because we just talked about accessibility and now the folks who can

35
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:50,411
hear us will be okay, but everyone else will be having some issues. But we're going to get started

36
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,753
with some extra buffer time to get questions in. Okay.

37
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:56,379
I'm going to get started with a little monologue.

38
00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:01,322
We're here to ask questions for Karen, so please go ahead and start typing those in chat.

39
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:09,348
Please use the questions feature in Swapcard, because what you do if you do that is that then everyone can upvote the questions.

40
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:15,052
And then from there, we need everyone to pick the questions they'd like to see answered by upvoting them.

41
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:18,515
I'll be pulling from that section and occasionally glancing into chat.

42
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,576
to make sure we didn't miss anything.

43
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:22,098
If you need some inspiration,

44
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:24,740
I'd like to point out that a big thing at GDC Summer

45
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,462
has been the topic of accessibility in video games.

46
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:30,265
Karen just mentioned Cherry's session from earlier in the week.

47
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:33,728
The GDC Live podcast had Greg from AbleGamers on.

48
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:35,890
We've seen developers like Naughty Dogs

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,532
build incredible tools to help players

50
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:40,714
with different disabilities play their game.

51
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,856
And the work Karen has been here at multiple GDCs

52
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,739
just kicking butt, showing off what can be done.

53
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:53,027
And it's been mind-blowing to see how the EA Sports titles have done all this work to be more and more accessible to players.

54
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,508
Accessibility can take different forms though.

55
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:01,069
Earlier this month Obsidian Entertainment built a feature to help players with arachnophobia

56
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,811
play their game grounded. If you have any questions about building these features for Karen,

57
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:10,532
we can get started on answering those because I see them coming in chat.

58
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:12,513
I'm gonna go ahead and

59
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:16,134
I'm sharing the first question we have with Karen.

60
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:22,040
This comes from Jade Summers.

61
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:24,703
What guidelines do you test against?

62
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:28,866
Microsoft XAGS, accessibility guidelines, et cetera.

63
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:33,430
So we use a combination of guides that come in

64
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,011
from all first party publishers,

65
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,233
because they all have, pretty much all have something,

66
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:38,234
and they're all different.

67
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:41,176
So, which means that if you combine those all together,

68
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:42,918
you have a relatively good cross section.

69
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:44,399
We also have our own.

70
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:44,459
So.

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,461
If you look and see our font guidelines I've had in some of my different presentations,

72
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,981
those are actually in EA as well.

73
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:56,963
We use those for certain critical path type things to try to push things forward.

74
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,843
Now you may notice a lot of things still aren't there.

75
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:04,344
A lot of policies we have is every year must be better than the last, and you should never move backwards.

76
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:07,585
And if you keep doing that, eventually you will reach those guidelines.

77
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:10,526
But we do have our own guidelines that are internal.

78
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:12,386
Certification does manage them.

79
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:15,707
And the accessibility team, because we do actually have a team,

80
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,828
goes in and works with those people.

81
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,829
And we try to come up with guidelines that we all follow.

82
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:23,889
So that's roughly what they come against.

83
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:24,830
Right on.

84
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,210
I just dropped our next question for Karen.

85
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,171
So I'm going to read it for the audience, which is...

86
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:35,998
Jason Doss would like to know, at EA Sports, have the dev teams on NHL, NFL, and FIFA shared

87
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:39,959
their accessibility suite of features? I assume they mean with each other.

88
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,521
Yes. And yes, it depends on which game as to what's shared. FIFA and Madden, for example,

89
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:52,983
share quite a bit. They both are using Flight for their menu narration, for example. All games at EA

90
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:58,244
Sports are all using the same libraries for text-to-speech, speech-to-text, which under the

91
00:04:58,284 --> 00:04:59,845
hood is using IBM Watson.

92
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:04,874
And my talk I gave a couple days ago at GDC covers all of that.

93
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:08,778
So if you want more information and links as to how you can use those features,

94
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,440
then that's a good example.

95
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:14,986
In terms of code bases, the code bases of the game, like FIFA and Madden,

96
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:16,107
have some commonality.

97
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,570
Some games have more commonality than others.

98
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,392
So how much we use depends.

99
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:25,319
The Colorblind module for Madden is being used in a wide variety of games, even outside

100
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:25,739
of sports.

101
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,283
So, same thing with the text-to-speech, speech-to-text, it goes outside of sports, it's not just sports.

102
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,366
So a lot of things may incubate in one team and they get spread across the entire company.

103
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:40,750
Typing our next question in chat, so I'll read it for the audience.

104
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,333
Next question for Christopher Gomez, how do you playtest accessibility features?

105
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:48,497
Really, we play test them like we do anything else.

106
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,837
Honestly, we really need to do more in general.

107
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:56,839
We do ask types of questions with that usability in mind,

108
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:59,219
because really, usability and accessibility are related.

109
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,020
If usability is simply, accessibility

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,181
is usability that's considering a wider audience, more or less.

111
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,201
So we do cover things like that.

112
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:16,349
We do have like my team, for example, it acts as a filter because due to various legal like HIPAA type laws,

113
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:22,634
it's not possible for us to currently ask our employees to give feedback along those lines,

114
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:27,178
but it is legal to ask my team and I'm deaf, I have a co-worker that's totally blind,

115
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,903
multiple issues and so between my actual team, we just so happen to be a good crosscut.

116
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:36,444
And since our job is accessibility, it's okay to ask us.

117
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:40,726
So my team acts as a filter and guide for all that.

118
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,767
But really, we need to do more in this area.

119
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:47,048
Karen, I'm going to ask a follow-up question.

120
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:48,509
I'm typing it in chat for you.

121
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,590
Let's see.

122
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:55,712
I'm sorry for the brief silence.

123
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:56,992
I just need to type this myself.

124
00:06:57,892 --> 00:06:59,033
And I can't copy and paste it.

125
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:22,984
Okay, so the question I just asked Karen for the audience is how should developers prep for the legal requirements around building accessibility features given that Karen just brought up the good point of employers often can't legally ask certain people about that in certain ways.

126
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:26,206
Talk to a lawyer. Seriously.

127
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:31,830
I am, I am not a lawyer I cannot give legal advice, I can't speak at the answer to, you know.

128
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:36,766
Relative things that have happened that I've noticed that there are legal issues to a degree,

129
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:41,808
but I literally cannot give legal advice and I have to ask you to speak to your local legal

130
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:47,810
counsel. And I recommend doing that immediately, honestly, because it does vary on region and

131
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,571
depends on where you are shipping things. What you can or can't ask also varies by region. So

132
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:58,053
what I said is very specific to certain regions. So please ask your local legal counsel for the

133
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,694
regions in which you're working in because it does wildly vary.

134
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,731
That is a great point, and I think just as valid an answer.

135
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,794
We are still waiting for more questions.

136
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,715
I would like to advise folks in chat

137
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:12,797
that if you are still getting the spinning

138
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,978
multicolored, inconsistently colored wheel,

139
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,242
please go ahead and refresh the page.

140
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:22,624
That will bring the video back online.

141
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:27,367
From there, I am going to pull from questions

142
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,409
that I prepared for Karen.

143
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:31,690
However, I was ill.

144
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:38,915
I was overconfident and did not move them to my other machine this morning, so I'm going to type them in right here.

145
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:56,746
Okay, and for the audience, what I just asked Karen is, what does your process for designing in-game communication look like at the start of development?

146
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,363
Okay, so I will say we should ask more generalized questions as opposed to these questions.

147
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:05,864
I will answer this, however.

148
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,767
So forget about in-game communication.

149
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:13,330
What does process for designing accessibility look like?

150
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:19,735
So it really needs to start from the requirements level and go all the way through.

151
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,017
You should be looking at this when you're first designing your game, even before you've

152
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:24,298
actually made any menus and things.

153
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,699
And that's in general good for all features.

154
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,099
It doesn't really matter what the feature is.

155
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,380
The later you do accessibility,

156
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,860
the more expensive it will be

157
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,260
because you'll be finding out that,

158
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,761
oh, wait, you don't meet file requirements.

159
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:40,081
Oh, look, you didn't think about menu narration.

160
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,581
Like it's really, really important

161
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:44,902
to try to think about this as early as possible

162
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,042
and design this in as early as possible

163
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:48,763
because then you're not going back

164
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:50,083
and having to fix things.

165
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,883
And that's more expensive than doing it in the first place.

166
00:09:55,612 --> 00:10:03,023
The question that I prepared was that lots of games have been implementing ping systems

167
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:05,287
to allow for nonverbal communication.

168
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:07,209
Are there ways that these can...

169
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,071
Oh, okay.

170
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:08,471
Never mind.

171
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:10,314
That question has been nixed.

172
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:14,039
So to go over that, just in general,

173
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,400
when you're working on a paying system,

174
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,822
please make sure you're considering all your audiences,

175
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,603
including blind gamers, because they're often missed,

176
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:22,024
and they are just as important as everybody else.

177
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:24,566
Also make sure you're considering your deaf gamers,

178
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,888
so you're not making a paying system that's audio-based,

179
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:27,708
because that's a problem.

180
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:30,250
So largely, just try to consider a full audience

181
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,831
when working on any system.

182
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:37,055
Right on, we're gonna pull Ryan Lippert's question.

183
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,337
Ryan Lippert would like to know, I'm a law student in California.

184
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,218
I anticipate graduating in December,

185
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:48,118
and they're interested in this topic.

186
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,859
What, if anything, would you recommend

187
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,180
they do between now and then to get

188
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,841
some experience in this field and read new recommendations?

189
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:56,782
And for what it's worth, they have ADHD,

190
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:59,143
and they would like to know how the industry is when

191
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:00,784
it comes to employees with ADHD.

192
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:02,365
Sorry for repost.

193
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:03,705
My first attempt, accident.

194
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,086
Oh, OK, yeah, that's not part of the question.

195
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,129
All right, I'm reading the question right now.

196
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,211
Actually, I have ADD.

197
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,973
I've been diagnosed with ADD.

198
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:14,475
So I feel for you.

199
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:21,116
It can be, it really, you need to, what helps me is figuring out what my own accommodations

200
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:25,720
are and for me, I like, I try to streamline things as much as I can.

201
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:31,626
I have my own database that I use for tasking that's called currently JIRA or JAZ and I

202
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:37,151
actually have an internal email address that when I email, it creates tasks for me, which

203
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:40,594
is really helpful because people outside of my team can.

204
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,504
Give me these tasks and we can.

205
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:46,243
Go from there.

206
00:11:46,263 --> 00:11:51,605
So like I can use that to just populate database, but I also use that for my own needs.

207
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:55,587
So every time somebody asks me something, even when I'm in a meeting, I can fire off

208
00:11:55,627 --> 00:12:00,769
a one line email to this thing, even as soon as somebody asks, and it immediately gets

209
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:01,290
sent off.

210
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,851
Another thing I use is there's literally a whiteboard right behind me and the other side's

211
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:05,952
completely covered with scribbles.

212
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:11,814
And if somebody asks me something, I literally always have a pile of whiteboard markers on

213
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:15,116
my desk and I literally just write it immediately behind so I don't lose track.

214
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:20,961
So that's just my own ways of handling this, since like I said, I do have ADD.

215
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:28,927
And yeah, it takes figuring out what works for you, because every single person is different.

216
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:31,990
And even if we're all diagnosed with similar-ish type things,

217
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,151
I'm aware ADD and ADHD are slightly different.

218
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,055
that it's figuring out what works for us.

219
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:39,657
And I will say that this,

220
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,679
sometimes things can be more challenging

221
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,201
in a closed environment,

222
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,042
but honestly, I like working from home

223
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:48,166
and the fact that the total current work from home,

224
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:48,986
everybody doing thing.

225
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:52,118
because it's quiet and that really, really helps me.

226
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:57,640
So, plus I'm deaf, so actually when I'm sitting at my desk at work, I'm not wearing my hearing aids,

227
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:01,762
so I can just turn it off. Now, the opposite would be wearing a noise-canceling headset

228
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:06,745
if you're not deaf. For me, I just basically put my hearing aids in instead of taking a headset off.

229
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:11,667
But that's sort of just trying to stay closed helps.

230
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:16,089
When I am in an office environment, I have used really, really tall boards.

231
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,211
For example, foam boards, even though I'm at a cube,

232
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:21,373
and I actually have made extra walls around me,

233
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:24,895
so I can't see anything, and that's helped me too.

234
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:28,798
So it's a matter of figuring out ways to help yourself focus,

235
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:31,380
because I've had these challenges myself.

236
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,322
Our next question is coming up.

237
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:36,603
Did that go through?

238
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:37,404
Yes, it did.

239
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,685
Next question from Christopher Gomez.

240
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,427
How would you teach accessibility

241
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:42,187
to game designers?

242
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:51,011
Workshops can help having, I have a Confluence site that has information internally for this type of thing.

243
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:59,537
So I can, if someone asks me a question, I can leave them to a link to the answer, assuming it's something I've already answered.

244
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:02,619
If it's not, then I make a new webpage that covers it.

245
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:07,762
And I do have like an eight-hour masterclass I've done before.

246
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:10,884
that I've used, I've drawn information from.

247
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,025
And it's important to work with all game teams individually.

248
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:18,546
So like for EA, a good chunk of our teams

249
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,507
have accessibility like liaison type people.

250
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:25,108
So we have people who have been appointed

251
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:28,409
or have volunteered to be the accessibility contact

252
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:31,890
so I can give information to them to be passed along.

253
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,870
And that helps too.

254
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,711
I will also say that UXR is really important.

255
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:38,012
So if you have a UXR group.

256
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:41,109
Having UXR people work with your designers can help too.

257
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:44,212
And then have them be the ones to evangelize

258
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:46,314
different accessibility practices.

259
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:51,058
So, and also just sending them to things like GDC

260
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,359
and having them cover that sort of things really helps.

261
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:57,062
Our next question comes from Daniel Rupert.

262
00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,865
They work for the Wounded Warrior Project.

263
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,246
Daniel, thank you for joining us.

264
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:03,888
And thank you for your service.

265
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:07,331
Some of our veterans have TBIs, lost limbs, et cetera.

266
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,958
What is a good resource for adaptable controllers?

267
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:15,762
Xbox's accessibility controller would be my first recommendation.

268
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:22,407
It works on most platforms at this point, and it allows attaching many, many different types of devices to it,

269
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:26,309
which gives you a wide variety of options.

270
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,512
Also on the Xbox, there is a concept of copilot.

271
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,753
So you can have multiple input devices

272
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:32,734
working at the same time.

273
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:36,216
This can help you if you want to use a regular controller

274
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:39,018
and also have your feet use some buttons.

275
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:42,060
You can set it up so you can use the accessibility controller

276
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,722
for some inputs and then your regular controller for others.

277
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:46,783
That works well, too.

278
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:49,805
So those are all options I highly recommend.

279
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:52,847
And if you go to Microsoft's website,

280
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:53,568
there is a

281
00:15:54,148 --> 00:16:00,794
large amount of information available for all the different types of inputs that you can use with an accessibility controller.

282
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:06,959
Oh, sweet. I just want to thank chat real quick for bringing in more and more questions. They're coming in really quickly.

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,705
And they're upvoting really quickly. Thank you. From Jason Doss, with EA doing accessibility features built into games,

284
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:19,049
do you also test accessibility features in regards to hardware?

285
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:22,111
Specifically, do you test your game features for say,

286
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:26,371
Xbox Adaptive Controller or any third-party accessibility hardware. Thank you.

287
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:30,215
We do to some degree, not as much as standard controllers.

288
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:33,638
I will say that a lot of our play testing labs now are actually

289
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,942
gaining Xbox accessibility controllers and with a wide variety of adaptions.

290
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:43,187
So people are actually using those in our play testing sessions and things and we also are,

291
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,470
I have several controllers that

292
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:51,632
Especially pre-COVID, people would be continuously borrowing from different teams so they can use those with all the different attachments.

293
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:58,556
Like I have a gooseneck attachment. I have one-handed controller pieces. I have joysticks. I have all sorts of things. Buttons and switches and toggles.

294
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:01,077
So they are being tested.

295
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:07,420
They are not being as regularly tested as standard controllers, and I can see that being an improvement for the future.

296
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,031
I am sending our next question along from Olivia Tandowski.

297
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:16,811
How do you address accessibility for mental health concerns?

298
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:20,732
So this will be more of a general thing than game specific at this point in time.

299
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:27,873
One thing I have had come up because I've had, I do spend a lot of time speaking to

300
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:32,354
people with various types of issues and getting information from firsthand experience.

301
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,075
But I will say that I've noticed.

302
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:39,319
people with PTSD for various reasons have mentioned, especially veterans with PTSD,

303
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:46,685
things like it's important to have audio tracks that will be specifically for things that

304
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:52,109
could be contentious. For example, a gunfire could be an issue. A medic, someone shouting

305
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:56,053
out for a medic or yelling and bleeding out can be an issue. Now, the actual concept of

306
00:17:56,553 --> 00:18:00,756
Gun warfare may not be the problem in itself, it could just be very specific things like that.

307
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:06,280
So, let's go back to things like Gears of War. They had an option for flower blood.

308
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,103
That was pretty awesome. That was a great way of handling it. Or, you know, option of no blood,

309
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:15,626
no gore. No gore is a great option too. So things like that makes a lot of sense,

310
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:20,449
and I highly recommend that. If you can think about the different types of audiences and

311
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:24,592
things people may be afraid of. I know a game recently came out with arachnophobia mode.

312
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,460
I can't remember the name of the game off the top of my head.

313
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,662
Grounded from Obsidian.

314
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:28,562
Thank you.

315
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:30,864
Things like that really help.

316
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:34,988
Now, it could also be that maybe it's stressful

317
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:37,230
and that causes issues for various things.

318
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,191
It's super timing.

319
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,234
So lack of hairline timing could be a good thing.

320
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:44,337
Different difficulty levels can help, too.

321
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:47,199
There's a lot of ways to address different types of mental health

322
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,120
issues in games.

323
00:18:51,712 --> 00:19:06,798
While before the next question goes up, I will just say, wow, I never thought that some of the specific triggers might not be, you know, the gunfire or the violence itself, but specific realistic cues like someone shouting medic.

324
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:14,530
From Dom Harris, I'm making a fast-paced top-down shooter and would love to make it as accessible

325
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,351
as possible.

326
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:20,355
I've got sliders to control game speed for people with slower reaction speeds.

327
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:25,259
I've got made sure it's all color blindness friendly and works with a screen reader, that

328
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:25,840
sort of thing.

329
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,264
Is there anything else for this type of game, a top-down shooter, that you can suggest?

330
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:34,367
Wow, that's a difficult question.

331
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:36,048
It sounds like you covered a lot already.

332
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:37,629
Those are really good starts.

333
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,331
Make sure that when you're doing colorblind friendliness

334
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,953
that you're picking something that will work with most people

335
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:45,334
because human eyes vary a lot.

336
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,896
So if you're using filters, for example,

337
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,157
it may not cover everybody.

338
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:51,118
That's true of almost anything you pick.

339
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:54,260
So having brightness and contrast can help too.

340
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:55,761
Contrast in particular.

341
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,383
High contrast is great for people with low vision.

342
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,305
Low contrast is great for people with photosensitivity.

343
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:02,346
So both matter.

344
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:07,958
That's one thing to keep in mind. I do like the fact you have game speed in particular.

345
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:11,659
Alternate controls and reduced button modes can be helpful, too.

346
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,221
Real quick, I'm just gonna go ahead and catch up with chat for a second while we prep our next question.

347
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:21,863
Thank you all again for participating.

348
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:28,145
I will grab this question. One second.

349
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,118
Aerith Arzola would like to ask,

350
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,263
what has been your worst experience while testing a game?

351
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,102
I'm just going to answer this as which experience playing a game, something without captions.

352
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:46,666
And if it's something without captions or any indication of what things are going, what's

353
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:51,449
going on or what my goal is without only audio, I am deaf and lip reading and I can't lip

354
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:52,130
read a video game.

355
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:58,054
So if a game has like audio only and it's telling me what to do and it's very specific

356
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:01,276
as to what I need to do, I am probably not going to be able to play the game.

357
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:04,018
And there are several games I can think of, but I'm not going to name, I don't want to

358
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:04,798
call anybody out.

359
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:08,279
have been problems for me.

360
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,122
Our next question comes from Jade Summers. Jade would like to ask,

361
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:16,705
what is the hardest thing to try and implement at the last minute when making a game?

362
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:23,630
That is really hard to answer because games vary so very much. It could be that

363
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:30,020
Menu narration could be an issue for you, because maybe you don't have enough disk space, depending on how you chose to do it.

364
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,983
Or you're against the wall with performance, and that could be a problem.

365
00:21:35,364 --> 00:21:41,328
It could be font size is too small, and there's literally not enough room on the screen to fit everything at a font size that's legible.

366
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:44,230
It really varies.

367
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,811
It really depends on your situation.

368
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:52,415
It's just important to try to consider it at the beginning, because pretty much anything can be expensive if added in too late.

369
00:21:54,715 --> 00:22:01,978
While we're waiting, I will also say the custom controls can be difficult to cover at the last minute as well, so please also keep that in mind.

370
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:11,802
Roger that. Oh, that's a good point. Yeah, I'll read the question I just sent to Karen. What is a topic you didn't have time to cover in your talk that you would like developers to hear?

371
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:11,863
Um,

372
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:19,286
So for my talk, one thing I would like to overemphasize is that when you're doing

373
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:27,897
When you're considering what API to use to make a synthetic voice, keep in mind that most platforms have them already.

374
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:34,368
So, like, Apple has voiceover, Windows has narrator. It is possible to use that in your games.

375
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:38,070
Like, I was the tech lead for all the games that came with Windows 7 back from Microsoft,

376
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,351
and all those games had the ability to be menu narrated, even though they were all

377
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:47,913
DirectX-based. And it is possible to do that, and it's not as hard as you think.

378
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,154
So, keep that in mind that you can actually, like, make conceptual overlays.

379
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:58,438
Keep in mind that when you're working with blind accessibility that the way people navigate

380
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:02,060
things can be different than when you don't have the feature turned on.

381
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,063
You'll notice that Windows Narrator itself makes Windows behave differently because it's

382
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:10,705
assuming keyboard-based navigation, not mouse-based navigation.

383
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:16,509
And I really, really strongly recommend turning on narration on your own local platforms that

384
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:17,229
you're implementing on.

385
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,962
especially if it's Windows or a phone or a tablet,

386
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,865
to see how it's navigated and how it works.

387
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:27,347
Because I'll give you a lot more information right there

388
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:28,668
as to how to use your game,

389
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:29,948
or how to implement that in your game.

390
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:35,930
Our next question comes by way of both Pat Diemendahl

391
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,310
and with some clarification from Nicholas George.

392
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,331
Thank you both for asking this.

393
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:44,551
I just want to make sure I asked it as best as I could.

394
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:49,672
How do you get people, whether it's developers or gamers,

395
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:51,673
to buy in on accessibility mattering?

396
00:23:55,273 --> 00:23:57,574
I will point out that there's such a thing as a vocal minority.

397
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:00,254
So keep that in mind when you're.

398
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:05,000
working on feedback because the vocal minority tends to drown out the majority sometimes.

399
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,885
So it may not be as negative as you may think. Generally speaking, especially each following

400
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:16,769
generation is more inclusive than the last. And Gen Z in particular just wants to know,

401
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:23,494
why can't I play with my friends? So keep that in mind that it does often come from the right place

402
00:24:23,654 --> 00:24:27,797
and it's not as contentious as you may think. Now, when it comes to development,

403
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,787
But I will point out the fact that this is using US census numbers.

404
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:34,268
One in five people are disabled.

405
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:36,989
When it comes to 18 plus, it's one in four.

406
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,011
By the time you get to mid-70s, it's one in two.

407
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:43,892
And statistically speaking, most people will be permanently disabled before they die.

408
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:44,813
So.

409
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:48,149
It affects a very, very large number of people,

410
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,731
and gamers are aging.

411
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:51,852
Yes, we have new gamers coming in all the time,

412
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,914
but people, generally speaking, don't stop gaming.

413
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,557
So that's just things to keep in mind when doing this,

414
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,979
and that it is a large audience.

415
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,341
And those numbers don't even count the one in 12 men

416
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,141
who are colorblind.

417
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,003
So when you're talking about these features,

418
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:08,205
using the statistics can really help,

419
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,927
explaining how it helps people can do.

420
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:14,030
And I know that over half a million Madden users

421
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,550
are colorblind.

422
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:17,735
So when you come up with those numbers, and it's like, yeah,

423
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:19,758
half a million people can't play your game adequately,

424
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:21,480
and may not know that some of the UI is there,

425
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:26,545
it becomes a lot easier to try to push things through.

426
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:29,309
So I used a game jam to get started,

427
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:32,312
and that's how I put in these features into Madden.

428
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:33,373
And then I showed.

429
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:40,404
I got a lot of positive feedback and press and things and the things I did do and I used that

430
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:45,487
positive feedback to say look people actually like this it matters people care and that helped me be

431
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:50,889
able to do more. So that all keeps in mind. Use feedback from other games as if you go out there

432
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:56,372
and do search on accessibility into like news articles you'll find a ton. Use that information

433
00:25:56,412 --> 00:26:00,433
to try to help make pitches to put features into your game that really does support.

434
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:08,802
A follow-up from Pat Diemendahl, what negotiation techniques can help convince stakeholders

435
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:10,404
that accessibility is needed?

436
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:12,666
So yeah, like I said again.

437
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:16,850
Showing that other game companies are doing things can help.

438
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,091
So that's why the news articles and feedback

439
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,252
and all that really do matter.

440
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:22,493
Statistics also helps with that.

441
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,275
Pitches, especially like executive level pitches

442
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,175
can be really helpful.

443
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:28,336
You might have to work up your chain for that.

444
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,317
So at that point, start with your producer level

445
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:31,858
and executive producer and work your way up

446
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:33,159
depending on how big your company is.

447
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,221
But yeah, it's challenging.

448
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:40,803
Like, and be aware that small steps matter.

449
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:47,570
So like when I originally put the features into Madden, I did almost everything within a month alone.

450
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:50,794
So it doesn't have to take a lot of people.

451
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:56,388
to start. And if you can show benefit with the little bit you started with,

452
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,491
that'll give you more attraction to do more. So,

453
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:03,974
baby steps do matter. And same thing with like how we're handling increasing font

454
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:07,797
size in games and things. If you if you can get one pixel larger

455
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:09,538
than the previous year, that's still an improvement.

456
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:12,540
And if you do that every year, you will get there. So,

457
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:16,323
it's important to try to do little steps and work incrementally.

458
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:19,325
Big steps would be awesome, but little steps matter too.

459
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:30,354
We are going to do a last call here. We have a couple extra minutes to account after our tech issues from the top of the hour.

460
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:34,301
So if you'd like to get your question in.

461
00:27:34,628 --> 00:27:36,029
Get it in right now and we'll grab it.

462
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:37,810
While we're here, I will ask folks

463
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,431
to please fill out the session evaluation, which

464
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,731
in this case will come by way of a rating that

465
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,192
either pops up in your notifications

466
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:46,873
or will be visible in the session after it's done.

467
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:51,415
And feel free to fill out your session evaluation,

468
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:54,096
your feedback for the end of GDC that will come in your email.

469
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,897
That feedback will help us make the show better next year,

470
00:27:56,937 --> 00:27:58,477
whether it's virtual or in person.

471
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,834
Our next question from Jason Doss,

472
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:04,337
after, could you please explain

473
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:07,500
how much planning goes into directional control patterns?

474
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,122
They have played UFC in the past,

475
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:12,645
and there are so many movement patterns on the analog sticks.

476
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:14,867
Some movements can put stress on the thumb

477
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,188
without needing to press a button.

478
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,570
I will say- With needing, sorry.

479
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,033
I will say this varies incredibly from game to game.

480
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:25,759
And the most important thing you can do is if you do run into issues,

481
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,121
just to make sure you give us feedback.

482
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:30,545
I have a Twitter account of EA underscore accessible.

483
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,547
I recommend tweeting this sort of thing.

484
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:37,593
There is also a forum of EA.com slash able, A-B-L-E.

485
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:44,157
And this is super important to give feedback on so we know that these are issues that need to be worked on.

486
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:47,338
Because all games are wildly different and we are going to miss things.

487
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:52,861
So, yes, feedback matters. Make sure you say things. Make sure if you say you like something too.

488
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:57,123
I know somebody who's using eye gaze technology to play The Sims with their eyes.

489
00:28:57,724 --> 00:29:01,566
And it's really important to tell us that that's currently being used and appreciated

490
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,567
to make sure we don't accidentally break it.

491
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:08,309
Because we may not realize that something is super important to somebody and accidentally

492
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,390
turn it off and then cause problems and not mean to.

493
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,292
So it's important to say what you like and what you don't like so we can work towards

494
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,292
a more accessible future.

495
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:20,695
Real quick, I need to own up to a mistake from a couple of seconds ago.

496
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:26,418
Pat, who asked a couple of great questions, their last name is Dima Andal, not the way

497
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,138
I phrased it before.

498
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:30,846
Our final question will come from Chris Miglio.

499
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:33,751
Don't most text-to-speech solutions

500
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,114
need to be connected to the Internet?

501
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:37,578
What if you want the text-to-speech voice to be

502
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:39,842
on the device without having to be connected to the Internet?

503
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:45,074
So for both Madden and FIFA, you do not need to be connected to the internet for text to speech to work.

504
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:52,838
For menu narration, in particular. You still need to be connected to the internet to do multiplayer because it's multiplayer, you have to be connected to the internet to play multiplayer.

505
00:29:54,239 --> 00:30:07,187
But for just menu narration, we're using a tool called Flight. I have a link to it in my GDC presentation that was presented on Tuesday. So I recommend going there and looking at the last slides and getting that link.

506
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:10,870
And basically it does menu narration on the fly.

507
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,995
So we just pass in text and it gives audio and that works relatively well.

508
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:21,259
NHL actually has pre-recorded menu narration, so we use voice actors to do the recordings.

509
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,561
And so that is also on disk.

510
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:26,564
Menu narration in general, I don't...

511
00:30:26,964 --> 00:30:29,226
I think most of our games support it without the internet.

512
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:35,449
Roger that. This is it. Thank you all so much for asking your questions. They've been wonderful.

513
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:40,291
Thank you for folks who are participating from different parts of the game and game development community.

514
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:45,673
We appreciate you joining us today. Karen, if they have more questions for you, where can they ask them?

515
00:30:46,314 --> 00:30:50,975
I recommend Twitter is probably the best place. So EA underscore accessible.

516
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:55,017
I am happy to answer any questions you have. Roger that.

517
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:59,819
Thank you all so much for joining us today, and I hope you have a wonderful day.

518
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:04,140
final day of GDC summer. Have a good day everyone. Thanks, bye.
