00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,302
Welcome to the second annual Been There, Done That.

2
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:09,844
Industry veterans share their experiences and advice.

3
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:13,686
My name is Kim McAuliffe, and I'm just

4
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:14,786
here to introduce the session.

5
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:17,668
But I'm going to hurry up and hand you off to Lauren.

6
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:24,491
Hey, everybody.

7
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:35,354
Hi. Thanks for coming so early. So, I'm kind of, sort of, probably in almost a similar

8
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:39,821
spot as a lot of you guys. I'm 24. I was just in college like three years ago.

9
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:47,669
And so I have an interesting kind of perspective on academia and the industry

10
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,410
and how they kind of compare and contrast.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,652
So I'm going to share a little bit of that with you because you might be kind

12
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:56,755
of thinking about, oh, you know, which way maybe do I want to go?

13
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:57,896
Do I want to go to school?

14
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:59,557
Do I want to go straight to industry?

15
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:02,419
So hopefully I can shed a bit of light on that.

16
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:09,431
So a bit about me, I work at Hangar 13, we just shipped Mafia 3, I'm a systems designer,

17
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:15,798
designed the economy, did some dialogue systems stuff, and before that I was at Zynga as a

18
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:17,960
designer, that was my first job out of college.

19
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:23,566
And then in college I went to UC Santa Cruz, they have an amazing games program.

20
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:24,696
Woo-hoo!

21
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,536
Yeah, go slugs.

22
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:30,518
Yeah, we have a great games program, very supportive.

23
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,041
And there I worked on such games as IGF Finalist Prom Week

24
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:40,143
and a game called Xylem, which was a weird puzzle game

25
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:43,024
for DARPA for some insidious thing.

26
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:48,627
So academia or industry, what's right for you?

27
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:51,088
What kind of is the deal with these?

28
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:58,938
So for academia, one of the main things is that it's just so much about exploration,

29
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:02,021
about the fringes of our industry and our craft,

30
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,243
and that's one of the most exciting things about it.

31
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:08,528
If you're interested in just going out and, like, you know,

32
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:13,213
exploring and really developing, like, weird shit, like, this is the way to go.

33
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:18,190
But college is also extremely self-guided.

34
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,052
And my experience is like undergrad,

35
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:24,014
I did a lot of research with graduate students.

36
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:27,878
But just anecdotally, the graduate students I've worked

37
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,359
with, it's even more self-guided.

38
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,723
And you can end up staying in a grad program for years and years

39
00:02:33,783 --> 00:02:37,606
and years if you're not extremely focused in on what

40
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:38,106
you want to do.

41
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,030
The game to the bottom left is Xylem.

42
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,991
And the way I found that was just asking professors,

43
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:49,212
hey, what can I do?

44
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,633
I'm interested in doing something interesting.

45
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:54,293
And they were like, oh, yeah, we have this opportunity.

46
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:57,874
So you really have to just go and get it yourself.

47
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:00,975
And you need good discipline to really do

48
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:02,015
anything of substance.

49
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:11,135
One thing about academia is you definitely shouldn't think of it as just a stepping stone in your career.

50
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:17,058
You should think of it as, if you're going to commit to it, really commit as a really important part of your career.

51
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,640
And get the most out of it as you can.

52
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,844
If I just went to school and took my classes, I wouldn't have tried to go above and beyond and do cool shit.

53
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:29,699
No to bad stock photos.

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,541
So yeah, some benefits of academia are

55
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:36,142
you'll learn really cool critical thinking skills

56
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,723
that kind of help you think in a different way

57
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,364
than just industry.

58
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:43,485
I approach problems kind of differently maybe.

59
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:48,087
And you can really push the boundaries of our medium.

60
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,368
And you'll also end up with

61
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,589
just an installed group of people

62
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,350
that you know in the industry right off the bat,

63
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,291
the people that you work with in college.

64
00:03:58,011 --> 00:04:03,994
downsides, because these may not be downsides for you, but projects are really long-term.

65
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:08,357
I've heard from a lot of grad students that they feel siloed from the rest of the industry,

66
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:14,040
kind of over here in this weird corner. Your findings, although they will be cherished by

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,963
academia, they may not make it into the industry at large for a while, because the industry has...

68
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:25,586
Well, I'll get to that. Next is industry.

69
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:31,130
So you're kind of just thrown right into the deep end of the pool on this one.

70
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,293
I just got to Hangar 13 and they threw the engine at me and they were like,

71
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:41,956
all right, learn our scripting shit and you can do it. All right, go.

72
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:46,418
So this is self-guided in kind of a different way.

73
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:49,860
So you kind of have to be confident in, and even if you...

74
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,462
aren't completely confident at the beginning, just know that you can

75
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:58,764
eventually get it and just try.

76
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:05,487
I couldn't find a stock but a diverse group of people working, I wonder why.

77
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:13,711
But it's great for learning how to work in a really diverse, big group,

78
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:15,232
potentially.

79
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:20,058
The industry is extremely fast-paced, as you might have heard.

80
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:22,458
You work under a lot of pressure.

81
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:28,341
You have like deadlines, like academia has deadlines, but like industry has deadlines

82
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:33,243
that are based on, you know, money and other people's jobs and like really high stakes.

83
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,891
And in industry, there's less experimentation.

84
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,312
Sometimes I'll try to propose something

85
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:40,612
that I think is really cool,

86
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:44,134
but it's always, can you prove it out?

87
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,655
Even if it's a new concept,

88
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:49,236
is it kind of rooted in a solid foundation

89
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:52,777
that we know it'll succeed and do well and make us money?

90
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:57,959
So for industry, it's cool to just kind of see,

91
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,160
and really get down and dirty into the,

92
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:05,693
actual work, I don't know. I mean, academia is actual work too, but anyway.

93
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:11,618
And then you can work on really big projects and learn a lot of new tools and stuff.

94
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:19,023
The downsides are that it can be a bit unforgiving. This is going to ring in a second.

95
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,426
So yeah, you kind of just have to...

96
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:34,532
But yeah, and you kind of just have to really throw yourself into it.

97
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:38,376
And you can't really make too many mistakes.

98
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:41,479
Well, you can, but only within reason.

99
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,222
Like, academia, you can really explore who you are as a designer

100
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:46,783
and what you want to do.

101
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:51,347
And school is for making mistakes, but industry, it's less so.

102
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,789
And morale, you know, whatever.

103
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,371
It kind of depends on personality type.

104
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,530
So which is for you?

105
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:01,512
Depends on, you know, kind of just what you want to do

106
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:03,873
and based on kind of both of these analyses,

107
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,834
like what fits your personality, your goals,

108
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:08,595
and the trajectory of your career.

109
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,496
And you can always merge the two if you want.

110
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:13,217
Like I did, you know, you can...

111
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:16,218
Do academia first, then do industry.

112
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:17,899
They both inform each other.

113
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,700
They're not as divorced as you would think.

114
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,361
So that's always something you can do.

115
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:27,103
And shoot for the stars, because you're awesome.

116
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:27,603
Thanks.

117
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:37,387
I think it's movie.

118
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:37,628
Yeah.

119
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,909
Awesome.

120
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:42,190
Hey, friends.

121
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:44,862
Sorry, it's Friday GDC.

122
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,023
I've, of course, lost my voice.

123
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:47,825
My name is Brittany Albert.

124
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:49,787
I've been a professional producer in games

125
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:50,968
for almost nine years now.

126
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:53,910
I started my career at Fitzel,

127
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,452
primarily working on the John Delife

128
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,713
and Scribblenauts franchises.

129
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,696
I briefly flirted with Free to Play Mobile

130
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:00,677
at Drop Forge Games.

131
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,599
And I'm currently at City State Entertainment,

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,262
overseeing the engineering team

133
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:09,505
on a PVP-focused MMO called Camelot Unchained.

134
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,320
I'd always had the plan of becoming a programmer in the game industry.

135
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,161
After high school, I preferred my undergrad in computer science.

136
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:22,623
I was fortunate enough to get an internship one summer where I had an opportunity to work

137
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:23,563
on game pipeline tools.

138
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,564
But not everything was sunshine and rainbows.

139
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,745
The work just wasn't satisfying.

140
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,146
I felt like I was punching a clock in the morning and evening.

141
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:38,307
I got some in-the-moment satisfaction through code, but it turns out that my original career

142
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,968
choice wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

143
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:44,425
In college, I'd work on game projects with other classmates.

144
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,266
In addition to programming, I would

145
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,248
have to wear the producer hat and manage

146
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,228
the scheduling for the team.

147
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,450
And working with my college cohorts

148
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,572
taught me that a producer's job is more than just moving

149
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,473
Post-It notes from left to right on a corkboard.

150
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:57,735
It's making sure that your team has what

151
00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,016
they need to be successful.

152
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:02,138
It's problem solving, where the problems affect

153
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:04,339
the people you care about most and see every day,

154
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,161
and the people who are giving their all

155
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,001
for the sake of the game.

156
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:12,773
So sure, production can be summed up as kind of like cat hurting, but ultimately it's about

157
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,416
being the person who cares most about the well-being of the team.

158
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:19,762
Simply put, the team builds the game, the producer builds the team.

159
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:23,186
So at the conclusion of my internship,

160
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:25,988
I made the realization that while I loved solving programming

161
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:28,909
problems, I got so much more satisfaction out

162
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,770
of helping people make games that they are proud of.

163
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,452
So after lots of school and a pile of debt,

164
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:35,133
I decided I wasn't going to be a programmer.

165
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:37,694
Maybe you've had this thought too

166
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:39,675
about changing the direction of your career,

167
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:42,917
whether it's changing from one discipline to another,

168
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,338
entering the game industry from another industry,

169
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,520
or going into a management role after being

170
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
an individual contributor.

171
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:52,140
Society often sees changing a previously made decision

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,723
as a very negative trait, so we tend to shy away against it.

173
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:57,307
I'm here today to tell you how to do it,

174
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:58,808
so it's far less scary.

175
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,894
First off, prepare yourself to ask a lot of questions,

176
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:05,437
starting with, why are you thinking

177
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:06,358
about changing your career?

178
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:10,786
Maybe your interests have changed and you don't want to do the same thing forever. A

179
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:16,588
change of pace is nice. Uh maybe your current path isn't for you. Whether you just don't

180
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:21,350
see yourself in it long term, uh you don't like where you're at or you just don't have any

181
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,391
future prospects. Maybe your decision is financial. You might want to make more money

182
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,093
than you currently are. Conversely, uh you may be shying away from jumping because you

183
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:35,555
can't necessarily take a pay cut. Before making the switch, I'm going to talk a little bit

184
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:40,053
Ask yourself, do I need a new role or just a new job?

185
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:42,455
Is it the environment that's not working for you

186
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:43,775
or the work itself?

187
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:47,177
Maybe you're just not feeling the game you're working on.

188
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,558
Maybe the game you're working on is awesome,

189
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:51,359
but the team could be more supportive.

190
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,181
Maybe the team is amazing, but your boss is a total asshole.

191
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,263
Changing career path isn't going to fix that.

192
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:02,524
So is there something keeping you from changing your mind?

193
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,526
I resisted becoming a producer for a long time

194
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,488
because a lot of classmates in college would say,

195
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:08,849
oh, of course you're gonna be a producer

196
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,290
because girls aren't very good at programming.

197
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,972
And I wanted to stay in engineering

198
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:14,973
so I could prove them wrong.

199
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,176
But proving someone wrong is great in the moment,

200
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:20,457
but that's not going to provide me long-term satisfaction.

201
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,780
So you've asked yourself all these questions

202
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,921
and you're still like, yeah, I'm gonna take the jump.

203
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:27,242
So how do you do it?

204
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,090
Set goals for yourself.

205
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,973
Define a positive meaning and definition of success.

206
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:37,175
Develop realistic expectations for what

207
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,076
it is you're trying to do.

208
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,337
For me, this was starting out producing

209
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:42,398
a small engineering team.

210
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:44,179
And if I could do that successfully,

211
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,260
I wanted to branch out to disciplines I didn't know

212
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,702
very well, like design and art and audio.

213
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:55,264
Eventually, I ended up leading production on a full title, but that doesn't happen overnight.

214
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,886
Setting an unobtainable goal at the beginning may not give you the positive reinforcement

215
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,547
you need to keep yourself going along.

216
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:08,549
It is critical that you find a mentor in what it is you want to do so you have a person

217
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,710
you can ask for advice as you chart your new territory.

218
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,052
If you can, find a mentor in your gender, race, or sexual orientation because there

219
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:17,612
will be unique challenges that you'll face.

220
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,280
It may not be wise to jump right in.

221
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:24,042
Go on a trial run before you can make the leap.

222
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,283
Verify that your initial interest in a new path

223
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,264
could pan into something,

224
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:29,405
or if you should even go that route at all.

225
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:32,227
One way to do this is to ask your manager

226
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:33,848
to try out some of the responsibilities

227
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,048
your new position would entail.

228
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,190
We once had a programming intern

229
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,510
who had an interest in production,

230
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:41,332
and she had asked if she could spend two weeks

231
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,474
shadowing producers, and those two weeks taught her

232
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:46,275
she in no way wanted to be a producer.

233
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,951
Be flexible, know that you might have to add extra work

234
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,232
to your current responsibilities in order to try this out.

235
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:55,513
Know that it might not be a clean transition

236
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:56,313
into your new role.

237
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:59,475
Be prepared to train your replacement leaving a new role.

238
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:01,636
You are taking on a lot of work in this scenario.

239
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,258
And with all of that, things might still go wrong.

240
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:06,599
You might fail.

241
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,040
But success at anything is really hard

242
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,481
and you can't fail if at first you didn't try something.

243
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:13,827
you will have to pay your dues again.

244
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,809
Regardless of what you did before,

245
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,193
you now have to prove yourself in a new role.

246
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,657
I hadn't shipped a game as a producer

247
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:22,839
before moving into that role.

248
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,561
I had no background.

249
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:27,985
Your relationships will change.

250
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,006
Who you talk to every day will change.

251
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,367
What you can talk to them about,

252
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:33,628
who you hang out with after work may be different.

253
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,390
When I moved into a different position on the org chart,

254
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:38,512
I couldn't always go to the bar with my team

255
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:42,014
because my presence isn't going to let the team fully relax.

256
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:44,775
As a producer, I've been put in positions

257
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:46,096
where I've had to fire my friends.

258
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,579
So even though I feel like I've made the right choice

259
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:52,080
in changing careers, all the sunshine and rainbows

260
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,042
I was looking for aren't really totally there.

261
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:58,369
But maybe your new direction doesn't actually work out.

262
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:00,170
This is just a bump in the road.

263
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:00,851
Don't worry.

264
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:02,853
You can go back where you came from,

265
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,414
or try something new again,

266
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,075
or go a completely different direction.

267
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,978
If making games was easy, everyone would do it.

268
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:10,359
Sometimes it sucks.

269
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,883
But everything that is worth it takes time and work.

270
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:18,346
And with that, I'm going to leave a little motivation.

271
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:19,707
I'll leave you with some wise words

272
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:21,869
from my personal hero, Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

273
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:26,187
If something stands between you and your success, move it.

274
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:27,367
Never be denied.

275
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:28,528
Thank you.

276
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:38,931
Hi, everyone.

277
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:44,033
My name is Nekles, and I'm the UX designer working for Ember Entertainment.

278
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:48,855
Today I'm going to talk about enjoy the challenges which make you stronger.

279
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,997
Let me introduce myself briefly.

280
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:55,300
Before working for Ember, I was the UI artist

281
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,542
working for Fifth Cell, and I got my master's degree

282
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:00,384
in human-computer interaction

283
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,885
and a bachelor's degree in fine arts.

284
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,467
I'm very excited to be here today,

285
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:08,330
sharing my first 18-month experience

286
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,011
in the game industry with you.

287
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:13,534
So, first of all, I want to talk about

288
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,196
why I choose to join the game industry.

289
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:21,394
Like 18 months ago, I was a graduate student.

290
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,996
I regard myself as a user experience designer

291
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:28,418
because that was my major and I really love it.

292
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,300
I've applied hundreds of jobs, went to kinds of meetups,

293
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,641
talking with hundreds of people,

294
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,122
and interviewed with different companies.

295
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,744
But I still have no idea where will be

296
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:43,585
the starting point of my career.

297
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:48,020
But I've never forgot one particular Tuesday.

298
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:52,323
I went to interview at a game studio in Belleville, Washington.

299
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:57,968
After that, I started to realize that the way of designing game experience

300
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:01,190
is so different than designing most softwares.

301
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:03,492
It's more fun and delightful.

302
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:07,215
It also contains so many sparkles and details.

303
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:10,918
So I started to fall in love with games and determined

304
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:13,199
to start my career in game industry.

305
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:19,038
The first challenge I met was lacking of game-related experience.

306
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,583
For me, game industry is like a brand new world.

307
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:26,390
I started to learn game design courses online,

308
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,152
and fortunately got a great mentor.

309
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:31,434
He helped me a lot during the work,

310
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:34,576
and I learned a lot from him as well.

311
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:38,259
The work started getting easier as I learned more

312
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,021
about game and the developing process.

313
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:45,124
But something just happened unexpectedly.

314
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:49,047
I lost my first job after six months.

315
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,749
That's truly a heartbreak hurt.

316
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:54,377
and the company was shut down.

317
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:59,078
So I have to face my second challenge in the career.

318
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:02,559
How can I get another job within 90 days?

319
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,579
So why 90 days?

320
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:08,520
Because some of you may know, as international students,

321
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,561
we have a limitation that we have

322
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,742
to get a job within 90 days after graduation.

323
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,162
Otherwise, we will not be allowed

324
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:20,003
to stay in the US using the current visa.

325
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:29,181
I was panicked and felt helpless, just like many of you may experience the worst moments

326
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:29,981
in your lives.

327
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:38,245
But luckily, I received many help from others in the industry, and that was when I met Brittany.

328
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:45,428
She helped me getting out of this disaster and referred me to this new job.

329
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:51,421
There is one sentence that Britney told me that I will never forget.

330
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:55,082
In the industry, people always help each other.

331
00:17:56,863 --> 00:18:01,324
There are many lifelong challenges that we have to face in our career,

332
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:05,005
but it's the challenges which make us stronger.

333
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:09,867
Please be prepared for the challenges and be ready for the changes.

334
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,860
Here are a few tips I want to share with you

335
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,180
as your career start.

336
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,501
Keep reaching out to people in the industry

337
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,182
and try to learn from them.

338
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,482
Don't be shy.

339
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:24,023
Keep practice your hard skills

340
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,624
and your soft skills as well.

341
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:29,284
So when you're practicing your hard skills,

342
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:32,525
you would be better to go to the meetups,

343
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:36,346
know more people and have coffee talks with them.

344
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:40,488
And keep helping others just like how they help you.

345
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:45,291
Be confident, be curious, be diligent, and be grateful.

346
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:46,752
Thank you.

347
00:18:57,181 --> 00:19:02,945
Hello, I'm Mary Olson, I'm the executive producer of our internal development team at a studio

348
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:03,366
called 343 Industries.

349
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:11,322
I'm going to talk from my part of the panel.

350
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:16,185
I'm going to be sharing my talk on what it means to lead and affect positive change from

351
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,005
anywhere you are on a development team.

352
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:23,208
So I'm going to use my background in audio as an illustration, but really this applies

353
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:23,928
to any area.

354
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:28,799
So here's a quick view of my career path for some context.

355
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,640
So I started playing music as a kid,

356
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,522
which led to an education in sound engineering

357
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:35,723
and experimental music.

358
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:39,125
And then in 1996, I started working on games

359
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,006
as a sound designer, then an audio director,

360
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:45,068
switching to production as an audio producer on Halo 4,

361
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:48,770
a lead producer on Halo 5, and then now today, I'm an EP.

362
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,612
So, there you go.

363
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:52,412
Few of the games I showed.

364
00:19:55,974 --> 00:20:00,927
A common thing that you may experience if you're an audio person or if you hang out

365
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:03,553
with any audio people is the feeling of persecution.

366
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:08,166
Audio is often an afterthought, not always prioritized

367
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,547
on the same level as art, design, and dev.

368
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:13,908
And even if you're in an environment like 343, which

369
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:16,408
actually puts high value and priority on audio,

370
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,009
it's still downstream from everything else,

371
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:22,370
and often up against kind of a brick wall of deadlines,

372
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,251
release dates, or events like E3, and things like that.

373
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:32,639
So, while the audio team is pushing to meet their deadlines in Quality Bar, they're also

374
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,204
impacted by any delays or dysfunction that come earlier in development.

375
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:43,110
So all of this is exacerbated on large teams that ship big games all at once, but the principle

376
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,235
scales to any size of team or release model even as well.

377
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:51,219
So, because of this, team culture, health, and process,

378
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,081
which you see above the dotted line,

379
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:56,184
as well as every aspect of a game, which you see below,

380
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:59,847
all have a direct impact on audio in a game,

381
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,210
and then also, ultimately, the game itself.

382
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,633
So, any area that can be improved

383
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:07,215
throughout the studio and the game

384
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:10,398
also have a direct positive impact on audio,

385
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,920
and therefore, the quality of the game.

386
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,615
So with all those factors affecting audio,

387
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:18,158
let's look at what audio is actually

388
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,339
responsible for in the game.

389
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,702
So here's what you're actually improving

390
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:25,226
when audio is in a healthy position.

391
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:29,370
So the impact is quite big.

392
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,333
So with all that in mind, every audio person

393
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:33,535
has to make a choice.

394
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,313
This was clear to me early on, and I've continued to make this choice over and over.

395
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:42,594
And by the way, this choice is not limited to audio.

396
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:46,356
If you've ever found yourself bitching about another team or disciplines, they screwed

397
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:52,679
you over, the work you're doing, you know, the work you're trying to do, that mentality

398
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,699
kills collaboration.

399
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,941
And sometimes it kills whole games and whole teams.

400
00:21:57,801 --> 00:21:59,602
So we all have this choice to make.

401
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:02,323
Are you going to be a victim or are you going to be an advocate?

402
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:09,055
I am suggesting that we all become advocates and be the change we want to see.

403
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:10,956
Not necessarily with weapons.

404
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:15,018
But what about stepping on toes?

405
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:21,800
On our team, we have an empowerment culture, and making the right kind of changes is encouraged

406
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,621
because we acknowledge that it makes better games.

407
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:26,942
But even if you don't...

408
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,281
there's still hope.

409
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,422
Because I'm not actually suggesting

410
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:33,422
that we all go out and take over

411
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:35,323
and run other departments or areas.

412
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:37,624
That's not actually exactly what I mean.

413
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:40,305
With the wrong approach to change,

414
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:41,466
it can go horribly wrong.

415
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:44,727
If you do feel another part of your team

416
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:45,627
is like screwing you over,

417
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:46,948
go do something about it.

418
00:22:47,348 --> 00:22:48,609
But do it in the right ways.

419
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,890
And here are a few suggestions for how to do that.

420
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,031
Focus on the end result.

421
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,668
So focusing on the end result is critical

422
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:01,469
to moving past personalities, egos, and details

423
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:03,090
that sometimes just get in the way

424
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,711
of trying to solve problems

425
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:06,952
and trying to affect change in the right way.

426
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,073
So anything that gets in the way of the end result

427
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,774
is focusing on the end result rather,

428
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:14,555
can really help clear that stuff away.

429
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,237
Be humble, check your ego at the door.

430
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:19,917
Can't stress this enough.

431
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,419
I know so many extremely talented people.

432
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:26,389
who are limited and sometimes crippled by their ego.

433
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,212
If you approach a situation to improve it,

434
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:31,414
check your ego because if you don't,

435
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:34,518
it will kill any chance at a positive outcome

436
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,261
because it's about you rather than about the end result.

437
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,877
When you do try to go improve something,

438
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:43,758
people are typically way more willing

439
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:46,719
to collaborate with you and listen to you

440
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:49,320
and work with you if you've built up trust over time.

441
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,940
I could give a whole talk about that, so I'm gonna move on.

442
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:53,741
Don't storm the castle.

443
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:58,902
So if you storm in telling people how to fix everything

444
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:00,243
so that you don't get screwed over,

445
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:02,003
you may not get very far.

446
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:04,804
Puts people on the defensive, it's not productive.

447
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:08,714
This leads to listening.

448
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:12,075
So find out why something is the way it is now.

449
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:14,135
Understand the situation fully,

450
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:16,275
and then that's the starting place

451
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:17,276
for trying to make it better.

452
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:19,396
And then how can you help?

453
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,077
Figure out how you can help.

454
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:24,957
A lot of times, things are broken or things can be better

455
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,978
just if people have a little bit of help

456
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:29,018
or have somebody to collaborate with them,

457
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:30,779
which leads me to collaborate.

458
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,100
Don't go into a situation with a preconceived solution.

459
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,472
So making games is all about collaboration.

460
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:40,653
So is solving problems.

461
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:42,794
Be creative.

462
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:46,277
So we all are creative in our craft

463
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:47,177
when we're making games,

464
00:24:47,598 --> 00:24:50,099
but also be creative in how you're approaching problems.

465
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:52,421
Work hard.

466
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:55,463
Doesn't always involve putting on a gas mask and gloves

467
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:56,844
just to get that perfect sound,

468
00:24:56,904 --> 00:24:58,125
but sometimes it does.

469
00:24:58,265 --> 00:24:59,286
I'm not really suggesting that, but.

470
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:02,083
But be perseverant, roll up your sleeves,

471
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:03,704
be willing to do the work.

472
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,646
And if you have ideas and that's it,

473
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,247
then you usually don't get very far.

474
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:12,229
And keep a sense of adventure,

475
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:14,510
so in games and in life.

476
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:18,513
So I hope this has given you some small motivation

477
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:21,634
to lead and affect positive change

478
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:25,016
from wherever you are in your career or on your team.

479
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:25,997
Thank you very much.

480
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,408
Hi everybody.

481
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:37,211
Oh, a little scratchy.

482
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:38,313
I'm going to grab my water real quick.

483
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:39,495
Thank you.

484
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:44,223
It's been a long GDC week for me as well as many others I'm sure.

485
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:48,819
My name is Sela, I worked at Xbox for a long time,

486
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:50,660
then I worked at Dropforge Games with Brittany,

487
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,100
and now I'm working at a company called VReal,

488
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,341
working in the VR space as a programmer.

489
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:58,481
Today I wanted to talk a little bit about saying yes

490
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:01,362
and saying no to things, because those are challenges

491
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:04,543
that I've had in my career that it took me a long time

492
00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:08,023
to learn how to do, because it seems so easy, right?

493
00:26:08,203 --> 00:26:10,764
Yes, no, but it's really not.

494
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,360
So the first thing I can suggest to say yes,

495
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,361
to try something new regularly.

496
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:19,981
Go out there and when opportunities arise,

497
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,642
if you have the time and the chance, say yes.

498
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:26,763
Don't stay inside, go out and have new experiences.

499
00:26:27,123 --> 00:26:29,564
Get a new perspective on life and try things.

500
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:32,164
Even if it's just because you wanna have a new story

501
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:33,804
to tell later the next night.

502
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,745
The best stories kinda come from the best experiences

503
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:40,486
and it's just a really great way to broaden your horizons.

504
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:47,271
Some of these things are going to be really scary and I just have to say get over your fears.

505
00:26:47,992 --> 00:26:52,317
Some of it is related to imposter syndrome which I've had a lot in the past.

506
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:53,979
I've talked about it in the past at GDC.

507
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,141
You are good enough though.

508
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:01,844
Some of these things aren't because like I don't know I don't want to jump out of a plane

509
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:08,965
It's not really my thing. I don't want to go with bungee jumping. That's not really imposter syndrome, but it's something that scares me and by

510
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:16,868
Exploring things that scare me I find that I grow as a person in this case you can also practice a little bit

511
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:16,928
so

512
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:20,691
speaking in front of a giant crowd at GDC, hi everybody.

513
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:24,496
You can go to Toastmasters and you can practice ahead of time

514
00:27:24,836 --> 00:27:26,218
when the stakes aren't quite so high,

515
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:28,480
so that it's more comfortable and more familiar

516
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:30,082
when you finally have the opportunity.

517
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:36,471
There's a saying, give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man a fish and

518
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:37,512
you feed him for a lifetime.

519
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:40,275
And I think that's kind of true across the board.

520
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:46,761
If you say yes to everything, every single time, you become the go-to person for something,

521
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:47,742
which is great for a while.

522
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:53,284
but you also become somebody that is just doing the same thing over and over and over again.

523
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:56,924
So in order to broaden your horizons and free up your time,

524
00:27:57,565 --> 00:28:00,245
make sure that you teach other people how to do things as well.

525
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:04,566
So, great, I'm going to have this new opportunity, if it turns out I'm doing it all the time,

526
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:08,527
I'm going to go and now teach you how to do it so that every time you ask me,

527
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:09,868
I don't have to bother.

528
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,388
Some of this is because I'm a programmer and I just like to automate things,

529
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:14,689
but, you know, that's just how it kind of goes.

530
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:18,699
Also, it's really important to set expectations.

531
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,860
If I want to go and play Overwatch later tonight,

532
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,161
this isn't really acceptable.

533
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,202
I need to have a really low ping,

534
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:26,442
and I can't draw packets.

535
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:30,024
Again, programmer, like these kind of things.

536
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,504
So setting expectations is very important as well,

537
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,045
so that when people come to you with things,

538
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:36,746
they understand your time is valuable,

539
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:38,927
and that when you are saying yes to something,

540
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:42,508
that it's worth your time, it's worth their time,

541
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:43,328
and everything is great.

542
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:45,631
Otherwise, you'll get a little overloaded.

543
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,834
So there's kind of a little bit of a balance there.

544
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:50,678
And that's when you have to start to say no,

545
00:28:51,158 --> 00:28:53,141
because if you said yes to too many things,

546
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:56,285
suddenly you end up in situations that aren't very good.

547
00:28:57,006 --> 00:28:58,869
We like dogs, they're not always allowed.

548
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:04,648
So my favorite example here is I was out at brunch with some friends recently, and one

549
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:08,729
of them suggested I go out and do some aerial silks, because aerial silks is something that

550
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,310
she was doing and is very exciting.

551
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,551
So I almost joined the circus, but I really had to think hard about that.

552
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:18,252
I didn't have the time, and I needed to make the compromise.

553
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:19,633
Maybe after GDC I'll do it.

554
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:20,113
I don't know.

555
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:22,654
But I needed to make sure that...

556
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:24,524
I can limit everything.

557
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:27,146
Because saying no is really, really hard,

558
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,928
and sometimes you just have to let people down,

559
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:32,570
which in a trust fall, maybe you don't want to do.

560
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,613
But 95% of the time, all you're doing

561
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:37,974
is setting acceptable boundaries

562
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,776
and making sure that other people

563
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:42,678
can take care of themselves.

564
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:45,159
I like to think, what's the worst that can happen?

565
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,842
Most of the time, people might get a little bit miffed,

566
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:50,163
they might get a little bit angry at you,

567
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:52,465
but the long-term repercussions aren't there.

568
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:56,058
So, just make sure you don't get flooded,

569
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:58,679
you wanna make sure that you don't get too overloaded,

570
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:00,400
and you wanna make sure you understand

571
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,541
why you are saying no to things when you do.

572
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:04,883
You wanna make sure you own that decision

573
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,484
because you can't let people reverse that

574
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:08,425
and walk all over you.

575
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:11,407
You also want to make sure that you know why.

576
00:30:11,828 --> 00:30:13,369
Is it because you don't want to do it?

577
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:14,950
Is it because you're overloaded?

578
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,872
Is it something you might want to revisit later?

579
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:21,096
Understanding your own self is just very critical here.

580
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:24,098
Because time is money, we only have a limited amount

581
00:30:24,118 --> 00:30:25,880
of time in our lives, and we need to use it

582
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,961
to the best of our ability.

583
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,863
You need to learn how to hand things off to other people

584
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,886
and realize that you don't have to do everything yourself

585
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:34,227
and you can't do everything yourself.

586
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:36,569
And you can't do everything that everybody asks of you.

587
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,973
You want to say yes to things, but you also want to say no to things.

588
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:43,697
So I had a couple of exercises here, and we're running a little low on time, so I'm just

589
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,658
going to skip through them.

590
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:49,904
But what I'd like you to do, if you get a chance, is go grab our slides later, say yes

591
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:53,648
to things, say no to things, and I'm going to leave this up here for just a second if

592
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:56,531
anyone wants to take a picture, move on to the next one, and then go.

593
00:30:58,229 --> 00:31:03,612
It's pretty exciting. I'd like to think these are decent exercises and I hope that they can help you all out in the future.

594
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:07,575
Here's the last one. I'll leave that up while I let... Who's next? Tara.

595
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:09,437
Thank you very much everybody.

596
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:18,844
Applause

597
00:31:18,864 --> 00:31:24,368
Hello everybody. My name is Tara J. Brannigan. I'm the head of community and customer service at Flare Games.

598
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:25,769
I've worked...

599
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:26,770
There we go.

600
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:27,994
There we go.

601
00:31:29,074 --> 00:31:31,575
So brief bio, I've worked at a lot of different companies.

602
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:32,976
I'm not gonna tell you how old I am,

603
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:34,497
but you can probably get a picture there.

604
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:39,159
I started out in QA doing testing at VMC Games

605
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,619
for the original Xbox.

606
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:45,354
It didn't really pay super well, though, so I moved to this high-end travel company,

607
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:50,158
working in the tech department, doing kind of web-based QA.

608
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:53,822
I learned a lot more about the fundamentals of QA in that role.

609
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:57,205
But in the back of my head, it was always, but it's not games.

610
00:31:57,386 --> 00:31:58,787
I need to go back to games.

611
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:00,168
It just kind of ate at me.

612
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,493
So when the opportunity came to go to Halo 2 Vista, I jumped on it.

613
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,241
However, that was a contract role.

614
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:09,601
And I really wanted to be full time.

615
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:12,062
And I was told that if I wanted to be full time,

616
00:32:12,402 --> 00:32:14,762
there was this awesome program management role

617
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:15,902
and I should apply for that.

618
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:17,443
So I said, what the hell?

619
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,323
And I went into production.

620
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:22,664
I worked on 1 versus 100 in a variety of roles.

621
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:26,044
I was a tools PM, I was a prototype PM.

622
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:28,565
If you ever won a prize playing 1 versus 100,

623
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:29,085
you are welcome.

624
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:36,478
And I also worked as an art producer on Project Spark for about, I think it was eight months,

625
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:38,445
but I'll come back to that in just a little bit.

626
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:43,829
So during 1 versus 100, I was given the opportunity to work in community.

627
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:46,970
And at that point in time, I had zero interest in it.

628
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,751
It was not something I wanted to do.

629
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:50,292
I hadn't even considered it.

630
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:52,693
But I had some bandwidth on the team.

631
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,654
My manager thought I'd be really good at it.

632
00:32:54,734 --> 00:32:56,915
And I understood how it made the whole product better.

633
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:58,435
So I said, OK, yeah, I'll do it.

634
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:00,896
But I am going back to production.

635
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:03,117
I am going to be an art producer someday.

636
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:06,056
The thing is, I really fell in love with that.

637
00:33:06,116 --> 00:33:07,997
I saw the power of that role.

638
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:10,519
I got to connect with not just the team,

639
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,460
but the people who played the games,

640
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,401
who really fell in love with what we did.

641
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,563
And I got to bring that back in and share it with everyone.

642
00:33:18,524 --> 00:33:20,845
So that's kind of been the focus of my career

643
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:21,666
for quite a while.

644
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:24,308
I've also worked in on a bunch of other things.

645
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:30,565
I've lived in various countries, the U.S. obviously, New Zealand for about three and

646
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:33,608
a half years, and most recently Germany.

647
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:39,554
In short, staying in one company, role, or even country is great for a lot of people,

648
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:41,716
but I'm not really one of those people.

649
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:43,337
I like to wander.

650
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:46,137
So you're getting started in your career.

651
00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:49,538
My first piece of advice is to have a plan.

652
00:33:50,138 --> 00:33:52,699
You want to set objectives and hold yourself accountable.

653
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,020
Getting from point A to point B is a little hard

654
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,841
if you don't have any idea of where you're going.

655
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:58,582
And if you're anything like me,

656
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:01,323
you want to have other people hold you accountable too.

657
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:03,864
Sometimes having that little outside force that says,

658
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:06,425
hey, you said you were going to get into public speaking.

659
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:07,566
Here's this great event.

660
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:09,026
Why don't you apply for it?

661
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:10,527
Makes a huge difference.

662
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:13,797
But you also want to be open to change.

663
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:16,918
Opportunity rarely presents itself at the right time,

664
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:20,779
because there's not really such a thing as the right time.

665
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,500
I didn't want to go into community.

666
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,240
It wasn't on my agenda.

667
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,221
But this opportunity for me to learn something new

668
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:30,622
about the industry that I loved popped up.

669
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:33,763
And if I hadn't taken that, if I hadn't said yes,

670
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:36,964
I wouldn't have found my passion in the industry.

671
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:41,110
So other people are going to have opinions on what's best for you and your career.

672
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,212
And it's good to remember that this comes from a good place.

673
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:47,979
Like your friends, your family, your managers, they all have a clear image of who you are.

674
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,242
But that's from their own perspective.

675
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:53,506
So they're going to give you advice that's based on their view of you.

676
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,502
But no one cares about your career as much as you do.

677
00:34:57,602 --> 00:35:00,104
And that is a really terrifying thing

678
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:03,407
to realize, that somebody isn't going to plot your career out

679
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:04,047
for you.

680
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:05,969
That is dependent on you.

681
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:07,550
People might give you nudges, and it's

682
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,131
great to get advice from people.

683
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:10,873
But at the end of the day, you're

684
00:35:10,953 --> 00:35:12,734
the one that lives with those decisions.

685
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:17,006
So I said I was going to come back to Project Spark.

686
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:20,110
The first leap is absolutely the hardest.

687
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,753
So in my early 20s, I would have killed somebody

688
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:23,614
to get that job.

689
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:26,157
I was going to be an art producer on a AAA title.

690
00:35:26,297 --> 00:35:27,839
I wanted it so bad.

691
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:32,205
But older 20s didn't actually want that anymore.

692
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:34,407
And it was scary.

693
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:36,868
And I had people telling me, particularly back then,

694
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:39,430
community was not a very well-respected role.

695
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,591
And I was told that it was almost career suicide

696
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:45,753
to go from this role with that credit

697
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:48,895
into just community management.

698
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:51,157
So I had to dwell on that for a long time.

699
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:53,998
And it kind of came down to, if I don't do this,

700
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,459
I am going to regret it.

701
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:59,582
And I got an opportunity to go PopCap Games, and oh my god.

702
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:02,323
That has made all of the difference.

703
00:36:03,132 --> 00:36:04,473
I will say that it gets easier.

704
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:07,795
Taking charge once makes it a lot easier to do so again in the future.

705
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:09,576
That's not to say it's easy.

706
00:36:09,897 --> 00:36:14,980
Every big jump I've ever made has given me that anxiety and stress and, oh my God, am

707
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,900
I doing the right thing?

708
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,462
But you have to think things through.

709
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:21,684
You have to get advice from other people and move forward.

710
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,507
So a little bit more about that dream versus reality.

711
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:28,969
Nineteen-year-old Tara was super in love with Weta Workshop.

712
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:30,970
I've always been a practical effects nerd.

713
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:34,529
And for me, that was just the epitome, like, oh my God, it's so good.

714
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:36,250
I have to work there someday.

715
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:42,331
So 33-year-old Tara last year got an opportunity to work at Weta Workshop.

716
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:47,773
The thing was, my career had changed quite a lot in that time, and taking that role meant,

717
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:52,174
one, contract position could be gotten rid of at any point in time.

718
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,291
working on just one project rather than a larger brand

719
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:56,992
initiative.

720
00:36:57,752 --> 00:36:59,072
And I was no longer a manager.

721
00:36:59,113 --> 00:37:01,253
I wasn't growing in those ways anymore.

722
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:05,275
And it made me realize that those things were actually

723
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:06,516
very important to me.

724
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:10,278
But because I had built up all of these years of, oh my god,

725
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:11,478
I need to work at Weta Workshop.

726
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:12,719
This is the best place ever.

727
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:16,020
And I had told so many other people who told me,

728
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,721
like, oh my god, I'm so happy you're there.

729
00:37:17,741 --> 00:37:20,963
I almost didn't respond to this recruiter.

730
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:24,631
But thankfully, I have a very kind and loving partner

731
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:27,233
who reminded me that you always talk to the recruiter,

732
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:31,797
even if you're not looking, even if it's not the right time.

733
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:34,839
And I fell in love with the company.

734
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,641
They have the values that align with where I want to go.

735
00:37:38,162 --> 00:37:41,604
It was a place for me to learn to manage people

736
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:44,707
with a manager that is going to teach me those skills.

737
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:48,886
So long story short, I worked on an amazing board game,

738
00:37:48,906 --> 00:37:50,688
I met some really cool artists,

739
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:52,690
I learned a lot about Kickstarter,

740
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,273
and then I said goodbye to that project

741
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:57,436
and now I live in Germany working at Flair Games.

742
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:03,144
So in short, don't let the person that you thought that you should be get in the way

743
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:05,266
of the person that you actually want to be.

744
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:10,109
It's really easy to get hung up on this view of yourself that you've had for years and

745
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:12,931
years and all of this investment that other people have put into it.

746
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:16,313
But again, at the end of the day, you're the one that lives with it.

747
00:38:17,354 --> 00:38:18,335
So trust yourself.

748
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,096
You're the hero of your story.

749
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:25,580
Don't let player two or three or the mob of the internet tell you what you should be doing

750
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,260
with your life.

751
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,396
Be selective.

752
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:30,558
Look for workplaces and environments

753
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:32,799
that are going to help you grow in the ways

754
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:34,060
that you want to get to.

755
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:39,023
And remember that there is no one right path.

756
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,064
All experience is valuable, and failure

757
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:42,485
can lead to amazing growth.

758
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:45,367
I still use things that I learned in QA,

759
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:48,289
and in production, and outside of the game industry

760
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:50,110
in my day-to-day work today.

761
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,293
That is all part of the whole of me at this point.

762
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:01,131
So in short, keep calm and go on an adventure.

763
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,692
And P.S. learn how to negotiate like right now.

764
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:08,253
Tara Van Wheeler's got this great piece

765
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:10,774
called Minute Zero and the Gender Pay Gap.

766
00:39:10,954 --> 00:39:11,735
Highly recommend it.

767
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,255
Don't care what gender you are.

768
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:14,436
Absolutely check it out.

769
00:39:14,496 --> 00:39:15,016
Great tips.

770
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:16,837
And that's me.

771
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:18,857
And I gotta say, if you wanna connect,

772
00:39:18,938 --> 00:39:19,618
connect on Twitter,

773
00:39:19,718 --> 00:39:20,878
cause I'm never not on there.

774
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:21,979
And on that note,

775
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:24,320
here's some really awesome other people you can follow.

776
00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:46,572
Hi, it's me again.

777
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:51,594
And we're a little short on time,

778
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:53,674
so we're gonna do the lightning version of my talk.

779
00:39:56,615 --> 00:39:58,976
So my talk is Don't Be a Hero,

780
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:01,177
Team Up for Game Career Victory.

781
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:03,278
And to help me out today,

782
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:07,079
I've enlisted the help of Ms. Marvel, a game developer.

783
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,500
So.

784
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:11,762
Quickly, my backstory.

785
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:13,483
I've worked at some of these companies,

786
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,804
well, all of these companies.

787
00:40:15,724 --> 00:40:16,945
I worked on these products.

788
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:21,768
I currently work for this company that I formed,

789
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,309
and this is my mission statement,

790
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:26,010
to make games that inspire people

791
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,532
to love themselves and each other.

792
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:32,334
And my most recent project is The Mirror,

793
00:40:32,574 --> 00:40:37,417
which is a text-based RPG about mirrors and body image.

794
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:43,845
So real quick, what's a team up?

795
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:47,527
So your career is not a solo journey.

796
00:40:47,627 --> 00:40:49,668
We're all the star of our own stories,

797
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:51,689
but sometimes we make guest appearances.

798
00:40:57,932 --> 00:40:59,753
So team ups are the parts that we play

799
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:00,934
in each other's stories.

800
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:04,055
Sometimes they join our show,

801
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,816
and sometimes we're the guest star.

802
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,939
But usually, they're fun, powerful,

803
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,400
and mutually beneficial.

804
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:17,003
So what's a game industry team up?

805
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:19,484
In the context of the game industry,

806
00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:22,066
team ups go beyond just the teams

807
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:23,607
and the companies that you work with.

808
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,708
These are the deeper relationships

809
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:28,950
that you purposely build during your career journey.

810
00:41:30,892 --> 00:41:32,493
They're the heroes that you admire

811
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:34,134
and the mentors that you work with.

812
00:41:35,622 --> 00:41:38,823
They're the industry peers who become confidants

813
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:42,024
and sounding boards, resources, and friends.

814
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:45,366
They're also the aspiring game makers

815
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:47,807
that you take under your wing and mentor.

816
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:52,649
So why team up?

817
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:53,329
Three reasons.

818
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,531
To develop your personal superpowers

819
00:41:56,851 --> 00:42:00,313
to get better at your job, to be more effective now

820
00:42:00,513 --> 00:42:02,494
to make better games, and then also

821
00:42:02,574 --> 00:42:04,675
to create new opportunities in the future.

822
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,213
All of this can be summed up in make better games.

823
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:13,754
Let's start with developing your personal superpowers

824
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:16,715
by teaming up with mentors and heroes.

825
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:19,636
You won't usually have direct access to your industry heroes,

826
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,197
but you can follow them on social media.

827
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:23,998
Following them on Twitter is a great start.

828
00:42:24,638 --> 00:42:27,660
Learning from their feed and what they talk about

829
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,501
and post and retweet, this keeps you informed.

830
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:34,383
It leaves you an opening for potential meaningful interaction.

831
00:42:36,462 --> 00:42:39,543
And then with mentors, mentors won't usually come looking for you.

832
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:41,424
They have to be found and persuaded.

833
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:45,425
And you have to show yourself worth the time investment

834
00:42:45,545 --> 00:42:47,565
by actually taking the advice that they give you

835
00:42:47,585 --> 00:42:51,867
and setting goals together, doing what they advise you to do.

836
00:42:54,107 --> 00:42:57,388
Mentors can help you set boundaries for work-life balance.

837
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,709
They can help you navigate who you are

838
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:03,030
versus who you want to become professionally.

839
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,991
And they can help you take the initiative to get there.

840
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,572
They can push you to accomplish more than you would

841
00:43:09,592 --> 00:43:10,412
on your own.

842
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:15,274
Okay, so let's talk about peer team ups.

843
00:43:15,574 --> 00:43:17,254
So if you get one thing out of this talk,

844
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:20,976
I want it to be that investing in your peer relationships

845
00:43:21,036 --> 00:43:23,116
will have the biggest impact on your career

846
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:24,117
and your body of work.

847
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:28,358
So,

848
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:30,849
That's my first point.

849
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:34,012
Choose to invest in the people that you work with now

850
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:36,695
and choose to work with the people

851
00:43:36,735 --> 00:43:37,856
that you're already invested in.

852
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,093
Trust is key.

853
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:48,297
Making better games, I think Mary and Tara,

854
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:50,318
a couple people touched on this already.

855
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:56,382
Trust helps you make your games faster and better.

856
00:43:57,422 --> 00:43:59,484
Feeling like other people are invested in you

857
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:01,705
fosters trust on your team,

858
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,007
and then you're able to work more efficiently,

859
00:44:05,427 --> 00:44:06,628
uncover problems faster.

860
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:08,589
Nobody's hiding that they're in trouble.

861
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,070
or that they're behind.

862
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,631
And then as you finish games and career paths diverge,

863
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:16,732
that trust remains.

864
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:23,634
And it's not just about efficiency

865
00:44:23,654 --> 00:44:24,754
and making great products.

866
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:27,455
These peer team ups will also be important support

867
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:28,775
for you during your career.

868
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:32,256
You can't do your best work without a support network.

869
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,572
These people and these relationships will cheer for your triumphs.

870
00:44:37,212 --> 00:44:40,914
They'll pull you through a world-ending layoff or studio closure.

871
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:44,296
They'll let you vent when you really need to blow off steam.

872
00:44:45,437 --> 00:44:48,038
They'll help you figure out how to fix it when you fuck up.

873
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,220
They'll encourage you to take care of yourself when you're burning out.

874
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,181
And they'll remind you that you're awesome.

875
00:44:57,063 --> 00:45:01,265
And if you're lucky, these team-ups can lead to not just industry partners, but also some

876
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:02,025
of your best friends.

877
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,899
So let's go back to that thing about trust.

878
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:09,820
So as your paths diverge, that trust remains.

879
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,400
This is how team ups create new opportunities,

880
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,261
that third point.

881
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:17,022
So new opportunities come from past team ups.

882
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:19,642
At senior levels, most of your new gigs

883
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:20,582
will happen this way.

884
00:45:21,143 --> 00:45:23,143
And this isn't nepotism, it's risk management.

885
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:24,463
It's good hiring practice.

886
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:26,984
Senior developers are expensive,

887
00:45:27,064 --> 00:45:29,705
and a bad hire can torpedo an entire team.

888
00:45:31,782 --> 00:45:35,143
So the best case hiring scenario is when someone comes in

889
00:45:35,163 --> 00:45:37,564
that another person trusts that says,

890
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:39,364
I would definitely work with this person again.

891
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:44,606
So this might be how you break into the AAA space

892
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:48,247
and join your dream team.

893
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:51,988
Or it could be how you all quit your jobs,

894
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:54,269
you and your peers, to launch your own thing.

895
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:58,170
The bottom line is that teaming up, investing in people,

896
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:01,139
And leaving behind teammates who trust you

897
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,420
is always to your benefit.

898
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:07,022
So in conclusion, create epic team ups in your career

899
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:09,664
to develop your superpowers, make better games,

900
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:12,625
and create future opportunities for greatness.

901
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:13,846
Thank you.

902
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:27,253
So we have five minutes for questions, which is awesome.

903
00:46:28,073 --> 00:46:28,353
Somehow.

904
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:31,303
Oh, please come to the mics.

905
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,514
Hi, my question is for Tara.

906
00:46:43,127 --> 00:46:48,171
I've met somebody who's been trying to get into community management.

907
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:56,898
I have some background in social media, but every time I've sent in an application, they've

908
00:46:56,978 --> 00:47:01,882
told me that, sorry, you're not who we're looking for, and we're moving on.

909
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:08,747
Is there any advice you could give or what kind of skills employers are looking for in

910
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:11,389
regards to finding community management?

911
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,632
I think my best advice is to start with actually managing

912
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:19,453
communities, even if they are personal, fan base.

913
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:23,774
Being able to show that you have not only worked with people

914
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:27,235
directly, but helped foster a positive community,

915
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:29,175
even if it's one you're not getting paid for,

916
00:47:29,815 --> 00:47:34,356
is huge, because nothing beats that actual experience

917
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:37,857
of having to tell someone else, you are out of line.

918
00:47:37,937 --> 00:47:39,878
This is the reason you're getting booted.

919
00:47:40,498 --> 00:47:46,603
Being able to talk through the perspectives of kind of the passion behind community management

920
00:47:46,723 --> 00:47:50,966
and the foundations of how to get there goes a really long way.

921
00:47:51,546 --> 00:47:56,510
I will always hire somebody who is very passionate and knows a little bit about the role versus

922
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:00,273
somebody who's been doing it for 10 years and is jaded as hell.

923
00:48:03,495 --> 00:48:03,836
Thank you.

924
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,610
Are there any other questions?

925
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:14,871
Come on, people.

926
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,892
Yay, come on.

927
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:23,758
Hi, many of y'all spoke about obtaining a mentor.

928
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,920
How would you go about doing that,

929
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,622
other than following on social media?

930
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:33,205
Is there another way, a better way, I guess?

931
00:48:33,225 --> 00:48:35,027
So the question is, how do you find a mentor?

932
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:36,808
Ask.

933
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:39,010
Find someone that, at this conference,

934
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,891
that you respect and ask them.

935
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:44,432
And one of the things that I have really started doing

936
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:47,713
is always saying yes, because asking is very, very hard.

937
00:48:48,654 --> 00:48:50,414
Know that mentorship means something different

938
00:48:50,454 --> 00:48:50,994
to everybody.

939
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:53,535
I have a mentor in South Africa,

940
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:56,156
and we just email once every four months.

941
00:48:56,956 --> 00:48:58,597
I have mentors that are much more high maintenance,

942
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:01,437
and I have to have dinner with them once every month.

943
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,598
But figure out what that relationship is for you,

944
00:49:03,618 --> 00:49:06,219
figure out what you want out of it, and then just ask.

945
00:49:06,979 --> 00:49:09,460
It never hurts to ask, and if they are too busy,

946
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,100
they can usually refer you to someone.

947
00:49:12,905 --> 00:49:14,906
I just want to echo really quickly what Brittany said.

948
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:16,767
Ask someone here at GDC.

949
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:19,809
I've been asked at GDC before, and I have also said yes.

950
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,930
And everybody who's been doing this a while

951
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,051
wants to help everybody out.

952
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:26,352
So everybody, ask for mentors.

953
00:49:26,412 --> 00:49:26,852
It's great.

954
00:49:27,072 --> 00:49:28,653
We all want to pay it forward.

955
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:29,793
Thank you.

956
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:33,735
So first, less of a question and more of a compliment

957
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:35,676
on having an all-woman panel for this.

958
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:37,017
I think that's fantastic.

959
00:49:37,037 --> 00:49:38,057
And I think that should be applauded.

960
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:46,416
Second, this is my question,

961
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:49,578
what if you don't think there are any mentors?

962
00:49:49,718 --> 00:49:52,019
Like, I know part of that is humility,

963
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:54,360
but part of that could also be

964
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,102
there's things you wanna do that no one is exactly doing,

965
00:49:58,282 --> 00:50:00,303
or the path you've taken doesn't seem to fit

966
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:01,704
into anyone else's narrative.

967
00:50:05,153 --> 00:50:06,294
I totally relate to that.

968
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:08,894
And I think one thing you can do is pull out,

969
00:50:09,294 --> 00:50:11,235
like set objectives for types of mentorships.

970
00:50:11,255 --> 00:50:12,915
So you don't need the total package,

971
00:50:13,275 --> 00:50:13,755
you know what I mean?

972
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:16,056
So what is it specifically that you're trying to learn?

973
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,096
Maybe you have a bunch at that point.

974
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:21,197
So you find people who you respect for different qualities

975
00:50:21,237 --> 00:50:23,897
that you wanna embrace or improve,

976
00:50:24,777 --> 00:50:25,617
and go after those,

977
00:50:25,697 --> 00:50:27,518
and it just becomes piecemeal at that point.

978
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:29,998
So you take a different approach

979
00:50:30,058 --> 00:50:31,819
than trying to find somebody who really lines up

980
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:32,579
with all of your goals.

981
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:33,579
Thank you.

982
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:35,435
Hi.

983
00:50:36,356 --> 00:50:37,176
I don't have a voice either.

984
00:50:37,196 --> 00:50:41,757
This one's a little bit different on the mentor subject.

985
00:50:42,157 --> 00:50:44,998
What if you have a mentor who isn't quite living up

986
00:50:45,038 --> 00:50:47,358
to your expectations as the mentee?

987
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,238
Ooh.

988
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:50,379
Break up, dump them.

989
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:51,739
Yeah, break up with them.

990
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:52,599
Yeah.

991
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,260
I guess first, make sure your expectations are clear

992
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,820
and that there's no miscommunication

993
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,561
about what the relationship was supposed to be.

994
00:51:00,581 --> 00:51:01,601
But it's a...

995
00:51:04,814 --> 00:51:06,414
at-will partnership.

996
00:51:06,494 --> 00:51:08,974
There's no reason you can't just say

997
00:51:08,994 --> 00:51:10,335
this isn't working out anymore,

998
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:12,275
or have more than one mentor at a time.

999
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:15,175
I've done that before.

1000
00:51:15,515 --> 00:51:17,596
Yeah, highly recommend getting more than one mentor.

1001
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:20,176
Everyone has different experiences,

1002
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:21,376
and you're going to learn from everything.

1003
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:23,537
Thanks.

1004
00:51:25,277 --> 00:51:28,298
Hey, Brittany.

1005
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,378
You brought up mentorship, so I guess I'll ask you,

1006
00:51:30,398 --> 00:51:31,358
but this applies to everyone.

1007
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:45,513
At what point did all of you figure that you might be able to be mentors as opposed to just looking for them?

1008
00:51:45,794 --> 00:51:50,758
Was there a threshold there where you made a decision or did someone approach you and then that was the first time you thought about it?

1009
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:55,136
So the question was, at what point did you realize that you became a mentor?

1010
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:57,698
It happened really organically.

1011
00:51:57,918 --> 00:52:01,039
Like when Kim put this talk together and it's like industry veterans, I'm like, I'm still

1012
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:01,680
a baby.

1013
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,881
What are you talking about?

1014
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:08,083
Like it feels really weird to be a mentor when I have so many mentors myself.

1015
00:52:08,183 --> 00:52:09,664
Like I still have so much to learn.

1016
00:52:10,204 --> 00:52:14,286
But like I have three new mentees this year at GDC and it's been amazing.

1017
00:52:14,766 --> 00:52:17,408
So just know that someone looks up to you,

1018
00:52:17,608 --> 00:52:19,549
and someone finds your opinion valuable.

1019
00:52:20,089 --> 00:52:22,230
Don't say, I want to be a mentor.

1020
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,111
Just let it happen.

1021
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,713
And I feel like that's the best way to build a relationship.

1022
00:52:27,513 --> 00:52:27,853
Awesome.

1023
00:52:30,475 --> 00:52:32,236
My question is, I believe, for Lauren.

1024
00:52:33,436 --> 00:52:35,818
You said that there was a pretty big gap

1025
00:52:35,938 --> 00:52:40,260
between what academia is interested in doing

1026
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,322
versus what the market wants out.

1027
00:52:45,142 --> 00:52:54,309
of academia, have you had any thoughts on better connecting those goals, either one

1028
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:55,029
side or the other?

1029
00:52:57,951 --> 00:53:04,536
Well, I love both sides and I've always tried to make it a point to stay in touch with both

1030
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,778
because I think both have a lot to offer each other.

1031
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:12,642
I just think that industry is really focused on being profitable and making sure that you

1032
00:53:14,283 --> 00:53:19,345
Because it takes so long and so much money to make a big game, even a small game.

1033
00:53:19,785 --> 00:53:20,586
So you have to...

1034
00:53:20,746 --> 00:53:23,227
And software development is already really, really risky.

1035
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:29,530
So to add in, like, hey, I found this really awesome paper that we could incorporate this

1036
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:30,690
into our dialogue system.

1037
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,271
It's like, is there any precedent for this?

1038
00:53:33,371 --> 00:53:33,732
No.

1039
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,912
I don't know.

1040
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:39,454
And then at that point, it's like, do they trust you as a designer to do this?

1041
00:53:41,694 --> 00:53:45,416
Yeah, I think that there's a lot that they can do to cross pollinate each other.

1042
00:53:46,316 --> 00:53:56,380
Industry can maybe help refine academia's focus, deadline issue thing sometimes.

1043
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:03,482
And then academia obviously can introduce really cool, interesting new ideas to the

1044
00:54:03,522 --> 00:54:04,043
industry.

1045
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:05,823
So I definitely think they need each other.

1046
00:54:09,252 --> 00:54:11,353
Unfortunately, we are out of time.

1047
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:13,315
We have to get started for the next session.

1048
00:54:13,455 --> 00:54:18,398
There is a wrap-up room on the other side of West Hall, so if you guys would like to

1049
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:23,742
keep the conversation going and maybe build some of those mentorships, go right ahead

1050
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,162
over there.

1051
00:54:24,182 --> 00:54:25,463
Thank you for your support.

1052
00:54:25,923 --> 00:54:27,944
Thank you all for coming and seeing us as well.
