1
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:09,076
Alright, let's go ahead and get started. Um, just warning you, there probably will not be time

2
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:14,400
left over for questions, so if you have them, I mean, feel free to keep them in case I end a

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,523
little bit early, I do tend to talk very quickly when I'm nervous, um, but in the worst case

4
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:24,846
scenario, keep your questions and you can email me or tweet at me, um, with your questions and

5
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:29,189
I'd be happy to discuss them with you. Um, but let's go ahead and get started on writing

6
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,451
modular characters for system driven games.

7
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:37,016
You might know me as the captain of Kit Fox games, which I started five years ago.

8
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:40,599
Our biggest releases were Moon Hunters a couple of years ago.

9
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:42,721
Last year we released The Shrouded Isle.

10
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:47,687
Both of those featured what we would call lightly, at least procedural characters.

11
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:51,891
And we are soon releasing Boyfriend Dungeon.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,372
Very exciting.

13
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:58,273
Not system-driven characters, by the way.

14
00:00:58,273 --> 00:01:00,255
Extremely hand-authored.

15
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:05,438
So please don't interpret this talk as saying you must create system-driven characters or

16
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,179
all games should have system-driven characters.

17
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:07,800
That's ridiculous.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,260
because boyfriends sometimes need authoring.

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,482
But last year I also helped Tarn Adams of Door Fortress

20
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:18,922
co-edit Procedural Generation in Game Design,

21
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:21,963
and if that's a textbook that sounds interesting to you,

22
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:23,263
please know I didn't write any of it,

23
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:26,664
but I did co-edit a lovely 25 different authors

24
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,164
on lots of different subjects.

25
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:30,325
I am extremely proud of it,

26
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:32,445
and I actually have a discount voucher

27
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:34,686
for 20% off up here on the stage,

28
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:35,886
so if that's interesting to you,

29
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:36,906
grab it just in case.

30
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:42,849
And next year we're actually going to be working together again, this time writing chapters,

31
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:48,472
both of us, and also editing other people's procedural storytelling and game design.

32
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:52,314
So I've been thinking a lot about the kinds of things that make interesting generators,

33
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,075
the kinds of things that make terrible generators.

34
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:58,218
I've made some of some things that are terrible and some that aren't.

35
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,783
And for this particular talk, I wanted to say a huge thank you to Emily Short and Jason

36
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:09,989
Grinblatt, whose work I am building on extremely transparently in this talk, so you're going

37
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,230
to hear their names a lot.

38
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,414
And if you're interested in this topic, you absolutely must follow both of their work,

39
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:17,436
ideally on Twitter, but if not, I guess...

40
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:23,921
in real life-ish. But let's get started. So I'm going to assume that the goal of creating

41
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:28,605
a system-driven game is to create something emergent and uniquely interesting. Something

42
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:33,649
that's more than the sum of its parts. If all you really wanted was A and then B and then C,

43
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:37,973
obviously you would author it yourself. But writers are often frustrated by systems-based

44
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:41,716
writing because we want to write towards an experience, and instead it often feels like

45
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:42,717
we're asked to create a system-driven game.

46
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:48,620
create a pile of unrelated words, phrases, and scenes, and after a while of creating

47
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,562
these word piles, it's easy to feel like our efforts are actually less than the sum of

48
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:53,983
our parts.

49
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:58,746
And it's especially easy to combine these and make it feel predictable or repetitive,

50
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:03,709
which Kate Compton has coined the oatmeal problem in her blog post, So You Want to Make a Generator.

51
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:10,984
I can generate 10,000 bowls of oatmeal, each oat in a different position and orientation.

52
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:14,328
And mathematically speaking, they will be completely unique.

53
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,310
But the user will just see a lot of oatmeal.

54
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,958
So she points out that what we're really looking for is perceptual uniqueness, not true uniqueness,

55
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:23,819
just perceptual.

56
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,122
And throughout this talk, I'm going to refer to that as meaning, which is kind of a fluffy,

57
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:32,523
hippie word, but if you're more math-oriented, it makes you feel better.

58
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:37,206
Feel free to think of it as perceptual uniqueness, because that is kind of what I mean.

59
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:39,707
I'm just a little bit lazy and colloquial, I guess.

60
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:44,630
And at this point, you might be wondering, why even talk about characters at all?

61
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,832
Why not places or objects or worlds?

62
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:50,434
There is a whole universe of stuff out there to generate.

63
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:53,956
A civilization, for example, can be every bit as complex as a person.

64
00:03:53,956 --> 00:04:00,140
But after contributing to a civilization Twitter bot, GP Lackey's Unknown Peoples is a delight,

65
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,463
I realized the same principles can be applied fundamentally across types of generators,

66
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:07,885
whether you're generating civilizations or furniture or people.

67
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:13,249
If you're curious about text generation in particular, I do recommend checking out Tracery

68
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:17,212
or Cheap Bots Done Quick, which is what made this lovely Twitter bot.

69
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:22,316
But for this talk, I will generally be assuming that you're generating actual characters,

70
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:26,600
full characters as game objects, not just text generation.

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,485
So that any time I refer to generating text, I'm probably using it as a symbol for a greater

72
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,006
data space, if that makes sense.

73
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:38,457
But I'm focusing on characters in this talk because they are a common fantasy for procedural

74
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:42,018
designers and a common nightmare for writers.

75
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:45,658
And they're a fantasy slash nightmare for the exact same reasons, which is that humans

76
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:50,860
are excellent pattern finders and patterns in generated people feel more artificial and

77
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,240
alienating than patterns that we see in generated places or objects.

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,341
There is no such thing as an uncanny valley for furniture, right?

79
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,662
So if we can generate people, we can generate anything.

80
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:06,850
So ideally we want characters' diverse information bits

81
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,751
to funnel down into a singular,

82
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,952
perfect moment of understanding.

83
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:12,653
And so we need to change the way that we write

84
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:13,833
and the way that our writing is used

85
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,616
so that a bunch of words can become meaningful,

86
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,316
memorable moments for our players.

87
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:22,564
So, I'm gonna break this down into four things.

88
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:26,747
Overall, the base fundamentals are building orthogonally,

89
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:28,109
and then we're gonna talk a little bit

90
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:30,750
about creating higher order meaning,

91
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,712
and then we're going to talk about surfacing that meaning

92
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:36,275
to the player, and then why iteration with your co-authors

93
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:39,397
is actually extra important in this particular field.

94
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:41,719
So, orthogonality I'm gonna use a lot.

95
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:44,961
I didn't have a lazy colloquialism for this one.

96
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:46,723
And I'm gonna use it because...

97
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:51,088
Well, to clarify what I mean by system-driven, I don't mean linear and I also don't mean

98
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:51,528
branching.

99
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:52,650
That's kind of barely a system.

100
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,015
What I'm talking about is system-driven games that provide a possibility space for the player

101
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:58,176
to explore.

102
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:03,163
So rather than telling a particular story or a particular set of stories, we're instead

103
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,766
only saying these are the kinds of things...

104
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:09,528
the kinds of stories that might be told in my game.

105
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:11,709
And those boundaries are here marked

106
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,210
on this helpful diagram as X1, X2, and X3.

107
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,271
And that was coined as a story volume

108
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,172
at Project Horseshoe a couple years ago.

109
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:20,493
And in Jason Grinblatt's words,

110
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:21,913
a story volume quote,

111
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,735
encloses a family of emergent stories

112
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:27,476
created by a set of carefully curated system parameters.

113
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:29,999
And these parameters are often fluffy,

114
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:32,783
things like themes and your setting and so on.

115
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:36,107
Maybe your story volume includes societal collapse

116
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,330
or love ballads or moon festivals.

117
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,973
It's kind of up to you what your story volume is about,

118
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:43,777
but you are defining what is allowed and what isn't

119
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:45,399
rather than what should be.

120
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:52,947
And the key for me was to wrap my head around the orthogonality that in order for this beautiful

121
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:57,731
space to exist, x1 must be a completely different axis than x2 or x3.

122
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:03,456
A value on x1 needs to be easily separated from a value on x2 so that they can be combined

123
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,278
to create meaningfully different results.

124
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,834
We're used to thinking of this physically.

125
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,296
We're used to seeing different character traits physically,

126
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:14,579
such as height or weight, be combined freely.

127
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:19,523
To use an example from Emily Short's chapter 21 in my book,

128
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,224
height and weight can be considered orthogonal,

129
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:22,485
and usually are.

130
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,326
You can combine them freely.

131
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:26,248
You could have tall and thin, or tall and wide, whatever.

132
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:34,993
And you know usually we don't get the impulse to correlate these with each other. We don't suddenly think oh hair length should probably predict a skin color

133
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:39,576
But we do tend to do that with personalities, and it becomes very fuzzy very quickly

134
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:45,479
So this might seem up front like an example of four orthogonal personality traits

135
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,442
Combining these let's say you could have you know low or high of any of these four traits

136
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:52,303
Oh, wow, I can create 60 different personality types.

137
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:53,604
Incredible.

138
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:58,447
Unfortunately, as Emily Short points out, this difference might not be observable or

139
00:07:58,447 --> 00:07:59,688
meaningful to the player.

140
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:04,792
These traits, flirtiness and extroversion in particular, do overlap in the kinds of

141
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:09,415
behaviors they can create, because both traits govern whether or not a character might want

142
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:12,797
to talk to you, and if so, how often, how intimately.

143
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:17,659
So, players won't always see the difference between a very flirty character versus a very

144
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:18,500
extroverted character.

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,101
This is also a problem in real life, but that's a different question.

146
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,363
So she recommends, for example, thinking of what if romantic interest replaced flirtiness.

147
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:30,065
And that's interesting because it is observed under different circumstances.

148
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:35,227
A shy person can still express high or low romantic interest in the player, and a highly

149
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:38,308
extroverted can express both of these feelings.

150
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,209
And so they are much more modular.

151
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,050
And after you've picked your orthogonal traits,

152
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,231
this is where it starts getting very tempting

153
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:47,973
to correlate them, especially in a straightforward,

154
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,813
logical-seeming way.

155
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,694
And you should resist this temptation.

156
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:54,616
I mean, you might be tempted to make someone imaginative,

157
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:56,656
much more likely to fall in love with the player,

158
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,737
because that makes sense, right?

159
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:01,179
Or maybe it's more interesting, or it's more realistic,

160
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,060
or you're afraid of your characters being too random.

161
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,281
But it's bad, and you should think about

162
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:08,202
orthogonality very deeply, because...

163
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:14,969
Even if you're talking about orcs, you want orthogonal traits not only for story volume reasons,

164
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:19,294
but also it allows for the possibility of interesting transformations.

165
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:23,078
Part of the success of the Nemesis system is that depending on the input,

166
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:25,821
different traits can be applied and combined at will.

167
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:31,567
Zun here could be burned or scarred or strengthened in any number of system driven ways depending

168
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,147
on what happens.

169
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:35,511
He could change completely depending on the player and roll of the dice.

170
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:41,877
If archers or marksmen here were more likely to get, I don't know, a hand injury, I mean

171
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:45,941
it would make more sense, but it would also be much less interesting and rich for the

172
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:46,661
player to explore.

173
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:53,216
Orthogonal traits also allow you to hide some of those traits and reveal them over time,

174
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:55,638
letting the player get to know the character in an interesting way.

175
00:09:55,638 --> 00:10:02,202
If being an ascetic, like Zayna there, number four, if being an ascetic implied something

176
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,965
about what kind of vice she had, it wouldn't be interesting to learn what it actually was

177
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:08,186
because you'd have a feeling of what it was already.

178
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:12,949
Getting to know her would feel less like meeting someone and more like just filling out the

179
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:13,870
rest of the cookie cutter.

180
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:18,350
In Moon Hunters, we made the player myth a bit orthogonal,

181
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,611
such that different components,

182
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:21,073
such as events that you encountered,

183
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:23,416
or cause of death, or your constellation,

184
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,641
could be combined at will, which did reduce redundancy,

185
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,484
but the individual pieces remained

186
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:31,607
maybe too orthogonal, I would say.

187
00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:35,740
I mean, system designers and writers should absolutely work together to keep your story

188
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,183
volume free of arbitrary or logical limitations.

189
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:45,847
Lateral, meaningful connections between systems can make your story volume absolutely richer,

190
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,228
which we'll talk about in just a moment.

191
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:52,072
But direct constraints within a single system, such as your character traits, usually make

192
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:53,093
your story volume poorer.

193
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:57,595
So let's think with our writer brain.

194
00:10:57,595 --> 00:11:01,117
So how many people here identify primarily as writers?

195
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:02,098
Writers.

196
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:03,299
Oh, interesting, interesting.

197
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,922
How many people identify primarily as system designers?

198
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,183
And what about narrative designers?

199
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:12,733
Okay, okay, interesting, interesting.

200
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,054
Well, I think it is important for system designers

201
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:16,515
to put on their writer brains also,

202
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:18,576
but let's all do that,

203
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:21,458
and think beyond piles of words and descriptors

204
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,860
to figure out what our meaning actually is.

205
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,701
I mean, without a writer,

206
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:28,902
a person is a meaningful, meaningless jumble of descriptors

207
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:31,684
and making them feel powerful and coherent

208
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:35,146
is more than just pruning their vocabulary.

209
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:38,448
If you do carefully make a pool of possible words,

210
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,049
you do get occasionally interesting outputs.

211
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:47,076
If you only generate words and actions related to spaceships and aliens, it will feel sci-fi.

212
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:50,199
And it'll occasionally be kind of sensible and interesting.

213
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,584
But it'll also start feeling like oatmeal eventually, no matter how well you tune it,

214
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:59,649
because there will be occasional blips of meaning, and the rest won't really fit together.

215
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:00,390
They'll just be bits.

216
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:03,526
And it's because you've used the same structure

217
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:04,487
for all of them.

218
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,890
You've only generated the bottom most layer of meaning,

219
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,033
the corpus of information.

220
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:11,136
So even if you have an enormous variety of options

221
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:12,057
in that bottom layer,

222
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:14,380
players will still be able to sense deeply

223
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,343
that they're all just buckets

224
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:18,145
filled with different flavors of water.

225
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:24,178
Artists and writers often create coherence in our creations kind of subconsciously.

226
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:27,441
We attach meaning and texture to the things we create.

227
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:31,485
And in this slide, you can kind of see one character that feels aloof, and one that feels

228
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:34,127
a bit rebellious, and one that might be a bit wistful.

229
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:38,431
This is conveyed consistently in the design of their posture, their costume, and body.

230
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:40,173
And yet, they are not cookie cutters.

231
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:43,274
So you have to help your algorithm do the same thing,

232
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:46,596
help it make connections between seemingly unconnected systems

233
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:47,936
and content.

234
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,377
I'm going to talk about how to do that in a moment.

235
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:52,438
But if you can figure out a way to create higher order

236
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,638
patterns of meaning, even a little bit,

237
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:55,919
you'll have more satisfying results

238
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,600
because you're varying the shape of the bucket, not just

239
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,280
the water inside.

240
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:02,614
So what are the themes of your world?

241
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,876
What does your story volume reveal

242
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,797
about humanity and the universe?

243
00:13:06,797 --> 00:13:09,840
Is it a utopian world of curiosity and hope?

244
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,644
Is it a pulp adventure of good battling and overcoming evil?

245
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:16,406
Is it a female power struggle in isolation?

246
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:17,687
Whatever your themes are,

247
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:20,009
these archetypes can become the highest layer

248
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,631
of your systems, shaping your bucket

249
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:23,112
that your systems fill in with content.

250
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:29,370
So when you start thinking about what your highest level of meaning are, this should

251
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,174
be reflected in the very essence of your systems, ideally not only in characters, but also in

252
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:36,096
places and objects and so on.

253
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:41,860
One of the best examples of this so far are Emily Short's Annals of the Parikhs, which

254
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,362
is a generated novel.

255
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:48,326
It's a guide to fictional places in an England-ish setting.

256
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:58,331
She defined these five suits in her corpus, salt, beeswax, venom, mushroom, and egg.

257
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,552
Yes, she's wonderful.

258
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:07,075
And what she did was she went through her corpus of information and tagged them all according to which suits.

259
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:10,498
suit or suits they could identify with.

260
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:13,820
So for example, something that was tagged venom

261
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,382
could be something colorful or something deceitful,

262
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:19,064
something serpentine, something ornate,

263
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:21,366
brightly colored, yeah, beautiful.

264
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,127
And these are things that normally a machine

265
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,848
wouldn't think to associate.

266
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:26,369
Normally it would just think to associate.

267
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,051
bright colored things with, I don't know,

268
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,032
like even if you had a machine learning thing going on,

269
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:34,134
it would say, oh, it's childlike or something.

270
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,596
But in the meaning of her universe,

271
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:38,777
venom became this underlying current

272
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,978
where you could kind of sense,

273
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:45,061
oh, a venom place feels different from an egg place.

274
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:46,622
So if this is at all interesting to you,

275
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,423
I do highly recommend her talk

276
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:49,904
going much more deeply into this,

277
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:50,645
from Proc Jam 2016, entitled

278
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:54,427
Five Strategies for Collaborating with a Machine.

279
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:57,977
But there's lots of different classification systems

280
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:58,578
close at hand.

281
00:14:58,578 --> 00:14:59,458
You can probably think of suits

282
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,279
off the top of your head really quickly

283
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,960
if you don't want to create your own.

284
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,141
I mean, tarot offers something.

285
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:04,921
I mean, cards.

286
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,002
I mean, at the very basic level,

287
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,923
you can think of elements even.

288
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:09,584
So that's what I'm gonna use for my example now

289
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,105
since we're all probably familiar with it.

290
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:13,106
Card suits are so familiar.

291
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:15,228
What is a character or even a storyline,

292
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,689
a plot arc that feels more water-like

293
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,090
or feels more fire-like?

294
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,553
Even these very basic concepts that are familiar to us draw connections between things that seem on the surface

295
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:32,597
Unconnected such as excitability and the color red. It's a very basic thing in us, but it is not a basic thing for a machine

296
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,360
So it's also important to remember orthogonality.

297
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,501
It's tempting to script, let's pretend we're procedurally

298
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:41,581
generating Mass Effect.

299
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,401
I'm not working for BioWare.

300
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,302
I have nothing to announce for you, unfortunately.

301
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:48,503
But I think it's a good example of something

302
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:51,204
that might be tempting if we were to make that game,

303
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:54,184
to script certain races or factions or massive locations

304
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,825
to be purely of one theme or another.

305
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,826
But that undermines the ability of the population

306
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,286
to be varied and writerly.

307
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:04,067
Instead, think of a character's archetype or bucket shape

308
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:06,128
as just another axis of modularity.

309
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:09,310
Allow it to combine with your character's other aspects.

310
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,892
And I recognize to some extent that orthogonality

311
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:13,593
and higher order meaning are somewhat

312
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:15,034
at odds with each other.

313
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:17,295
It is a fine line to walk like everything else

314
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:18,136
in art and writing.

315
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:24,445
But, for example, if the Asari were allowed to have water-type and fire-type and air-type

316
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:29,313
individuals, it would make that race feel more believable and feel more meaningful to

317
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:29,954
your players.

318
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:32,879
I would hope that every race would have this flexibility.

319
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:37,628
Moon hunters did use an extremely basic, rigid form

320
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:41,089
of this higher order meaning concept, somewhat by accident.

321
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:43,170
And it would have been much more effective

322
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,651
if we had been able to apply the generation

323
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:48,592
of different suits to the world and its encounters

324
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,932
in a more coherent way, for sure.

325
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,865
So now we've generated maybe too much information

326
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:54,525
about a character.

327
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:57,085
Not only does it have all of its word piles,

328
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:58,826
but also it's in this suit, right?

329
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:00,766
So there's a whole universe of potential background

330
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,067
which could show the player.

331
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,087
And we need to figure out a coherent way

332
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,648
of figuring out what to emphasize.

333
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:09,088
Assuming it can't all be given at the same instant,

334
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:10,709
we have to help the player understand it all

335
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,629
as quickly and easily as possible.

336
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:16,679
Perceptual uniqueness, though, can come in multiple forms.

337
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,061
I wanted to take a second to highlight Caves of Qud

338
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:22,303
as having an interesting approach to meaning.

339
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:25,606
Caves of Qud blurs the line between mechanical meaning

340
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:28,468
and intrinsic writerly meaning here.

341
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,250
You can see Mehmet is an individual

342
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,871
that I'm talking with here.

343
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:35,053
And somewhat down the page, you'll

344
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,715
see disliked by urchins for ruining

345
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,216
the festival of Utz Yara Ux.

346
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:44,275
Now that first part, disliked by urchins, has mechanical meaning.

347
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:49,298
If the urchins are a faction, and if I'm nice to Mehmed, if I share water with him, for

348
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:52,539
example, the urchins might not like that because he's their enemy.

349
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,220
It's kind of standard faction mechanics.

350
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:00,122
However, ruining the festival of Ut Yara Ux is more uncertain.

351
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,103
It's possible that...

352
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:08,310
that Jason and Brian could patch in something about festivals of gods that is relevant here

353
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:13,074
that can be ruined somehow. Or it's possible that Ut Yara Ux is a random text generated

354
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:16,918
and festival is just a cool word and he ruining is also kind of cool.

355
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:22,506
So that's what he claims happened, and it never actually happened, and there is no way to ever ruin a festival.

356
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:29,857
It doesn't matter. For the player, they have the mechanical meaning, and they also have this broadening of their horizon through fluffy writerly meaning.

357
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:32,881
And either way, this character is perceptually unique.

358
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:36,188
So, regardless of what kind of meaning you're going for,

359
00:18:36,188 --> 00:18:38,251
you have to surface it to the player.

360
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,173
Because the faster a player can internalize

361
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:42,135
multiple important aspects of the character,

362
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:44,077
or at least be clued into what those might be,

363
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:46,320
the faster a player can also synthesize those

364
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,801
into a single unique identity,

365
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:50,604
and remember them as a person, rather than a file entry.

366
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,543
But each character of course is going to have so much data points that they can be conveying

367
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:57,645
at once that choosing between them can be difficult and create waste.

368
00:18:57,645 --> 00:19:01,468
A common way to write lines for a dynamic character in a system driven game is to try

369
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:05,491
and apply all the variables into one channel of expression such as the way they greet you.

370
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:10,655
You might have the character check all kinds of variables about themselves and then choose

371
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:11,595
what to say to the player.

372
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:14,758
This is very common and not recommended.

373
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:19,500
It's intuitive and potentially meaningful, or you could end up writing a thousand of

374
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,643
these, the player sees one, and it happened to be the same one as the last NPC that talked

375
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:26,024
to them, right?

376
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:30,886
So stacking too much, this is what I learned from this, is that stacking too much information

377
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:34,988
and systems into one channel of the character's expression.

378
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:37,886
is setting up for redundancy.

379
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,268
It's even worse, actually, when you're reacting

380
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:42,530
to something about the player's context,

381
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,111
which is also tempting,

382
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:46,753
because the player is the number one constant

383
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:47,934
that all NPCs have in common.

384
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:53,684
So another approach might be that we look at our set

385
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:56,226
of system parameters, you know, we write a bunch of things

386
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,927
and we shuffle them together and we think,

387
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:00,148
well, maybe we should surface the ones

388
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,809
that are best written.

389
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,170
Let's surface the interesting ones.

390
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,691
Let's make those more common.

391
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:07,412
The problem there is that of course,

392
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:09,653
I mean, yes, things are generally interesting looking

393
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:13,155
at first, but D and E now just feel more repetitive

394
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:15,717
and more common, and instead A, B, C, and F,

395
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:18,078
which were your less interesting lines,

396
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:20,299
are more rare and more remarkable for the player.

397
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,301
Which is a little bit of a shame.

398
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:28,066
So one possible solution is to have your character express themselves in as many ways as possible,

399
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:31,229
orthogonally broadcasting their information simultaneously.

400
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:36,314
The Civilization series does a little bit of this in that the leader characters simultaneously

401
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:40,597
convey something through their posture about how they feel about you, and then what they

402
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:43,500
actually say reflects the most important current issues.

403
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,141
Now, of course, beyond that, they do kind of just throw all the information up there

404
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:50,782
and you could theoretically see each of these fields as a different channel.

405
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:55,023
At least you don't have to ask Cleopatra ten different questions, I guess.

406
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:56,503
But it is a lot to take in at once.

407
00:20:56,503 --> 00:21:02,024
The Middle Earth series does more carefully separate out the procedural information here.

408
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:07,686
It's not like Zog is trying to express his class, his race, his level, and his history

409
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,246
with you all in one line.

410
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:13,547
You can get what you need from the UI and then the writerly bit from what he says.

411
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:18,650
But the problem is there's so much information and so much of it is abstract or needs to

412
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,191
be observed over time that the gold standard has become to just throw it all on the screen

413
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,492
at once.

414
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,374
And you can't physically show the player everything.

415
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:29,655
I know that you think it happens in Dwarf Fortress, but it doesn't.

416
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,837
Tarn and Zach actually put in a ton of effort to figure out what information to actually

417
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:35,098
include and highlight.

418
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:40,000
For example, you'll notice in Dwarf Fortress, it doesn't actually try to simulate dialogue

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,882
between characters because it would seem too repetitive.

420
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:43,562
So instead...

421
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,481
Even Dwarf Fortress has to think about

422
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,482
what is the meaning of this conversation?

423
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:50,844
What are they trying to say and why?

424
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,206
So here is a strategy for deciding

425
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:55,548
what is appropriate to highlight about your characters.

426
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:59,748
Okay, actually I have one more false start here.

427
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:01,429
Don't take a naturalist approach quite either,

428
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:04,051
because if you try to mimic the real world,

429
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,732
we often see someone's physical attributes first.

430
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,814
Let's pretend this guy, Choi Youngjae,

431
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:10,455
is a generated character.

432
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,476
We can see his physical attributes,

433
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:14,697
maybe he introduces himself, we see his name,

434
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:16,358
and then we get to know him,

435
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:18,339
and over the years of getting to know him,

436
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,461
we find out his childhood and secrets.

437
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:23,723
The problem is that in those first minutes,

438
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:24,323
he's just a name and a face.

439
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:28,608
and who here is terrible at remembering names?

440
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,210
Yeah, so it's like basically you have no information

441
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,114
about this character, it's just a model.

442
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:35,835
But so you might as well not have generated

443
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:37,097
anything else, right?

444
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:39,840
So thinking again about perceptual uniqueness,

445
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,723
we shouldn't hide any of that perceptual uniqueness

446
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:43,564
that we might have access to.

447
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,175
One of the best solutions I've seen to this

448
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:48,936
is actually to have a human parse it for you.

449
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:53,059
Bad News is a wonderful piece of procedural performance art.

450
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,101
Ben Samuel is a co-creator there on the right.

451
00:22:56,101 --> 00:23:01,404
It's his job to pick out from a procedural character sheet

452
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:03,306
which parts of his character are interesting

453
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:07,028
to act in dialogue with players in real time.

454
00:23:07,028 --> 00:23:09,410
And he's amazing at it, it's incredible,

455
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,231
but I assume you don't have the budget

456
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,073
to send an actor home with your characters to interpret.

457
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,694
their data for your players.

458
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:18,776
So, okay, we have a crowd of characters.

459
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:20,297
What does the player need to know?

460
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:21,738
There is a pattern that I've seen

461
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:22,998
across a few different games

462
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:24,659
and that we've started to employ.

463
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,361
The first most important thing

464
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:30,063
is if this character has been encountered before,

465
00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:31,924
within the first second of seeing them,

466
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,547
They should know what has changed.

467
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:38,472
Because if the player has already created a mental bookmark for this character,

468
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:42,317
this is Tom or Choi or whatever, YoungJai,

469
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:44,660
then I should know what has changed.

470
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,044
Now he's social media famous. Wow, that's interesting.

471
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:49,707
He has changed over time like people do.

472
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:54,577
The second most important thing is to remember what,

473
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:57,778
get a reminder of what their unique trait is.

474
00:23:57,778 --> 00:23:59,579
Maybe this guy's a bodyguard,

475
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,560
he has really high discipline,

476
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,461
and maybe nobody else has those

477
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:05,181
in at least the nearby vicinity.

478
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:07,542
So in this area of the game,

479
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:08,843
these are the things we need to know.

480
00:24:08,843 --> 00:24:11,304
He's a bodyguard with high discipline,

481
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,445
and also now he's social media famous.

482
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:14,826
But we still don't remember his name.

483
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,786
That's fine, we don't need his name.

484
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:19,027
Most of our bookmarks of other people

485
00:24:19,027 --> 00:24:20,327
don't actually have names attached.

486
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:21,727
That's why we forget them.

487
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,128
What we remember is what is important and meaningful

488
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:26,508
and perceptually unique about them.

489
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,929
And if the player sticks around

490
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:29,249
to actually observe what's going on,

491
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:31,729
maybe now we see his name and we're reminded

492
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:34,490
and we get to see his current status.

493
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,250
We spend a little bit of time with him

494
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,390
to see what's going on.

495
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,171
This is information that might change at any moment.

496
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:42,691
So, I mean, the player just kind of naturally will assume

497
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,532
that it's not worth paying too much attention to,

498
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:45,352
but it might be relevant

499
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:46,492
depending on your gameplay situation.

500
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,198
And finally, if the player opts in,

501
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,401
then they can interact with the character for more detail,

502
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,184
which are the finer details that make him feel

503
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:55,987
like a real character that the player

504
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,430
can choose to interact with or not.

505
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,603
Now this does handily indicate the amount of words we can generally afford to spend

506
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:07,367
per message, going from fewest on the left to most on the right.

507
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:11,330
It also lets us prioritize where to spend most of our time writing variety, since obviously

508
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,092
the information on the left side will be seen more frequently.

509
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:15,833
It does make sense to budget extra variety there.

510
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:21,297
For example, if you were to write a bunch of greetings for a character, maybe make it

511
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:23,239
mostly about the changes in notifications.

512
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:25,040
Maybe that's what greetings should be about.

513
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:29,809
So now you have an idea of what meaning to give

514
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:32,671
to your player as quickly as possible.

515
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:35,513
And I know iteration is probably an overused word

516
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:38,975
in our industry, it can make a lot of us shudder,

517
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:41,136
but I think it's worth calling out here specifically

518
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:43,417
because we're not used to iterating systems

519
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,179
in the same way that we iterate our content.

520
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:48,520
We usually think that writing procedural content

521
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,062
goes like this, you dream of an infinite possibilities.

522
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,436
You sit down and you think of some actual possible outcomes for your system.

523
00:25:57,436 --> 00:26:00,320
You tell the computer what to do with it and then, yay, we have something beautiful and

524
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,841
unique.

525
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:05,566
Unfortunately, programmers generally will want to call this moment alpha.

526
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:07,179
It is not.

527
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:11,202
Because you really do have to do a few more iterations.

528
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,665
I would call both of these your co-authors.

529
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:18,107
Your corpus of data and the systems that combine them.

530
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:20,268
You're both working with them, and they both have their own

531
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:22,710
flavors and textures they're going to give you.

532
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,571
So now that we know it's not alpha.

533
00:26:24,211 --> 00:26:27,695
You really should take a moment to examine your co-authors and iterate as much as possible

534
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:31,859
because it's not just your algorithm that adds flavor, it's also what information you're

535
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:32,699
putting in.

536
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:37,244
And this might mean your co-members of your writing team or it might mean external public

537
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:38,765
domain co-authors.

538
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,369
Emily Short recommends the characters of Theophrastus.

539
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:47,711
an ancient Greek philosopher who specialized in writing about personality types and example

540
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:50,253
activities that different personalities do.

541
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:54,915
And feeding that in as a co-author will obviously have different effects than feeding in medieval

542
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,355
descriptions of popes.

543
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:59,497
Look, there's a new character being generated right now.

544
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:03,779
So you can try different co-authors as part of the iteration process and see how it adds

545
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,640
unexpected flavor and texture to your world.

546
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:09,929
And you'll go around this loop a few times,

547
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,410
but you'll find better results

548
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,471
the more that you are able to measure them,

549
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:16,173
not just as a writer for what jumps out at you

550
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:19,475
as well written and what seems poorly constructed,

551
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:21,236
but also at a very basic level,

552
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:23,638
what does common actually mean?

553
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:26,820
What does too surprising mean in your system?

554
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,441
Is it too weird, not weird enough?

555
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:30,442
If you actually went through and helped your system

556
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:33,665
identify words that were supposed to be more common

557
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:36,526
and words that were supposed to be more rare or strange.

558
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:39,568
then it's pretty easy to also have analytics

559
00:27:39,568 --> 00:27:43,331
that tell you how often surprising outcomes happen

560
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:44,872
and whether that's what you actually want.

561
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:48,654
Finally, across all procedural authors I've talked to

562
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:50,735
that have created anything interesting,

563
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,356
they all talked about the importance

564
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:54,938
of creating room for exceptions

565
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:58,340
and handwritten flourishes that break all of your rules.

566
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,801
You should absolutely allow

567
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:02,483
occasional authored surprising lines,

568
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,603
which totally.

569
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,744
buck all of the rules.

570
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:08,125
For example, if your system always generates

571
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,346
a character's childhood in detail,

572
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:12,267
maybe it usually generates traumas

573
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:15,269
and parents and siblings and hometowns,

574
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:16,869
you should allow occasional flourishes

575
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:19,671
like they have no memory of their childhood

576
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:22,052
or something equally unexpected.

577
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:24,793
And that does take up some time in your planning,

578
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:27,274
so plan accordingly, but it is an important part

579
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:29,075
of every successful generator that I've seen.

580
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,031
So hopefully your universe of characters

581
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:33,831
now feels less like a bowl of oatmeal

582
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:35,712
and more like a field of stars.

583
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,472
The more interesting ones are surfaced

584
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:39,833
and made to shine brighter to the character.

585
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,793
And we can draw meaning between them

586
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:44,094
for the player as much as possible.

587
00:28:44,094 --> 00:28:47,154
And finally, as we iterate, we'll build with the player

588
00:28:47,154 --> 00:28:50,335
an understanding of our world and its rules

589
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:52,135
that exposes the underlying meaning

590
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,756
we want to tell with our story volumes

591
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:56,096
that they can explore with their own agency,

592
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:58,577
which provides an experience that no strictly authored

593
00:28:58,577 --> 00:28:59,637
or branching narrative ever could.

594
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:01,058
And thank you.

595
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,671
Yeah, we have a question, not a comment.

596
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:30,912
That's what I heard.

597
00:29:30,912 --> 00:29:32,092
Yeah, it's not a comment.

598
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,513
It's really simple.

599
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:33,913
Amazing.

600
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:35,554
I'm a little bit confused.

601
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:38,055
So you were talking about building orthogonality

602
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:42,577
in your traits and you then commented on how.

603
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:49,606
correlations between traits is not a good thing and I'm a little bit confused on why. So for example if you look at your

604
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:53,787
example of Shadow of Mordor the

605
00:29:53,787 --> 00:30:00,709
more melee based orcs tend to have a slightly larger scale than the range based orcs and that kind of made sense and felt

606
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:03,250
good with the gameplay and

607
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,011
it seems a little bit odd to say that

608
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:09,712
correlations such as that would not necessarily be good in random generation

609
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:17,183
I mean, it's possible that I'm overreacting to the instinct of a writer to strongly correlate

610
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,604
things all over the place.

611
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:22,366
And so I err on the other side of never.

612
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:24,187
Obviously, there should be some in there.

613
00:30:24,187 --> 00:30:27,329
And that's part of what higher order meaning is anyway.

614
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:31,972
I thought that's exactly what higher order meaning was the how things are interconnected

615
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:36,395
and build a something that's more than just a random blandness.

616
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,907
Yeah, and iteration will help you sort through that.

617
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:43,269
It is definitely a blurry, weird space to be in,

618
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:44,349
but I think that the more you iterate,

619
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:45,329
the more it'll become clear,

620
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:46,550
oh, this is an interesting connection,

621
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,011
and this is a connection that actually weakens

622
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:51,252
the overall volume.

623
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:53,073
But it's up to you and your game, sorry.

624
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:54,113
All right, no, thank you, I'm just curious.

625
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:54,693
All right, thank you.
