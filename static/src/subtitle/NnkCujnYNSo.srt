1
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:07,207
So it's been 17 years since Doom was released.

2
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:11,088
It's kind of funny that we've never done a post-mortem anywhere on this game.

3
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:14,809
Which is kind of crazy. But now we're here to do it.

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,190
And so what we're going to do

5
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:22,872
is kind of go through the development of the game on a month-by-month basis.

6
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:25,252
We're actually going to start

7
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,853
about a year before we started on Doom to kind of

8
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:30,914
foreshadow some things in the future.

9
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:41,027
Okay. There's a little bit of volume. Um. Okay, so we'll start

10
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:47,812
in December of 1991. Uh. Actually, yeah, okay, so.

11
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:49,894
Actually it wasn't December, was it? It was like.

12
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:51,975
Anyway. It's like.

13
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,457
As far as you know, this is December 1991.

14
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:59,101
It's August 1991. And, uh, we moved id software to Madison,

15
00:00:59,141 --> 00:00:59,681
Wisconsin.

16
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:01,002
Where I went to college.

17
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,657
and we went, we visited in the mid, mid-summer,

18
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:07,078
and the place was great, just like that picture there,

19
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:09,700
it was awesome, lush, green, everyone having fun.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,601
So then we just, we moved the whole company,

21
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:14,202
which was only four people at that time.

22
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:18,383
And then when we got there, you know,

23
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:19,624
that's kind of what happened to us.

24
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:22,725
And so we couldn't even go outside anymore.

25
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:23,946
We had to kind of stay inside.

26
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:30,888
So, we were working on Commander Keen at that time, and during that, you know, last half

27
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:36,932
of 1991, we basically saw that there was this computer called the Next Computer that was

28
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:42,176
created by Steve Jobs' company, and it looked really, really interesting.

29
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:50,481
It was an amazing workstation, and we basically, during December, kind of finished Commander

30
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:50,781
Keen.

31
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:54,444
And we went on our, like, two-week vacation.

32
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,206
But John Carmack didn't go on vacation.

33
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:59,667
He's going to stay and program, especially if he

34
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,148
wanted to program a NeXT computer.

35
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:05,851
So he ordered a NeXT computer COD, but he didn't have a car.

36
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:08,292
And it's snowing and freezing.

37
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:11,815
So that's John going through the snow to the bank

38
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:15,197
to get the money for COD.

39
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:18,599
So when the guy shows up, he can pay him the $11,000

40
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:18,859
and then.

41
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,173
we finally got our next computer.

42
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:24,234
And that was in December of 1991.

43
00:02:26,654 --> 00:02:28,475
We start working on Wolfenstein 3D,

44
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:32,756
and we really just kind of messing around with the next.

45
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:35,636
It wasn't until the summer, like half a year later,

46
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:37,417
we actually used the next computer

47
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,198
to do the hint manual for Wolfenstein

48
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,138
and some Commander Keen brochures.

49
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:46,619
Yeah, it was worth a lot there for us.

50
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,919
We were planning on using it later.

51
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:51,000
It turned out to be a very important computer for our

52
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,004
company. So right after Wolfenstein shipped, we were

53
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,287
contacted by a company named Imagineer and they wanted a

54
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:05,310
Super Nintendo version of Wolfenstein. And so we were very

55
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,734
excited about getting our game on a console. And so we hired a

56
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:13,456
guy to start working on a contract because we've got other

57
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:14,197
games that we've got to make.

58
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:26,492
All right. So now it's November of 1992. And we had a year

59
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:32,195
previous to this, November of 1991, actually shipped our, I

60
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:36,858
think it was our third, third FPS. It was our first texture

61
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:42,341
map game called Catacomb 3D. And so it shipped a year before this

62
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,884
time. But after this point, we decided that we're going to make

63
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:46,604
another FPS.

64
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,052
And surprisingly, to some people,

65
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:54,216
surprisingly, Doom was actually the fifth id software FPS.

66
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:56,958
Those are the other games that we had done that were shooters.

67
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,543
Originally, Hover Tank 1 was just colored walls

68
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:04,465
that you kind of drove your tank through.

69
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:09,449
And at that time, it was kind of a harsh, creative environment

70
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,951
to make an environment come alive.

71
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:15,514
And so I would put a green cube, and that's a tree.

72
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:20,804
essentially in my mind, you know. And, uh, Catacombs 3D actually had textures on the

73
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:25,286
walls and that gave it a lot more sense of space and a lot more fun, and you can cast

74
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:29,587
your magic spells and blow things apart and stuff. And then the others you probably know.

75
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:37,270
Spirit of Destiny is a sequel to Wolfenstein, by the way. Um, so, we basically start working

76
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,933
on, uh, some of the tools for the next FDS, for, start working on Doom. Um,

77
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:49,765
programmers in the audience might recognize the acronym WAD, which stands for Where's All the Data?

78
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:56,570
That's actually made after the fact. We were in a cheap apartment called La Prada,

79
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:02,795
and Carmack was downstairs working on stuff, and we had used LUMPS in the previous games and stuff.

80
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:07,019
And I was working upstairs doing the Doom Bible, and he called up and said,

81
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:11,582
I need an extension, like, what's a bunch of LUMPS? And I said, WAD?

82
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:13,935
Or someone said, yeah, that works.

83
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:14,095
OK.

84
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:14,716
A lot of lumps.

85
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:17,898
So a lot of people started using that.

86
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,000
And then the Lucasarts or the?

87
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,022
Yeah, and then Lucas, yeah, Dark Forces later

88
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,563
named their files GOBS.

89
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:26,285
So everyone was kind of coming up with another three-letter

90
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:26,765
extension.

91
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:28,347
Yeah.

92
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,488
So after we were in these apartments

93
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:33,391
and kind of putting together the file formats for Doom,

94
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:37,254
it then finally moves to the Black Cube in Mesquite,

95
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:41,337
which was just down the street from the apartment complex.

96
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:46,319
And thank you Google for providing a picture of Tony's

97
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:52,821
Tower, which there is no other one on the internet.

98
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:52,921
Yeah.

99
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,902
So we basically start thinking about what is Doom going to be?

100
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,283
What is this next game?

101
00:05:58,563 --> 00:05:59,484
It started with a name.

102
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:04,765
We played a lot of D&D for years before we

103
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:05,946
started making Doom.

104
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:10,607
And so we decided that this was going to be one of our D&D

105
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:11,668
inspired games.

106
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:15,436
uh... karmic was really excited to do a game had demons in it

107
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,239
and uh... you know we all agree that we just did not see so

108
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:21,861
the hands of the middle of the world

109
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:23,723
that's what else is it

110
00:06:23,823 --> 00:06:28,166
so that i was going to be a little bit

111
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,048
so that will be

112
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:32,510
tom thompson's tom starts uh...

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,333
working on the doom bible right after we move in and then he finished it at the

114
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,095
very end of november of nineteen ninety two

115
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:44,374
And it was basically a whole kind of a design document for a lot of the game.

116
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:50,196
A lot of the sketches of like where all the levels are in the game and the names of stuff.

117
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,837
Progressions you go through, lists all the tools, all that kind of stuff.

118
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,517
I mean you can look it up on the internet.

119
00:06:55,557 --> 00:07:01,059
This is kind of part of the beginning of the design doc here to kind of say like what Doom is.

120
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,460
And you know there were a lot of, we were coming up with all these ideas for the technology of the game and like what it's going to be.

121
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:11,947
And we felt like really sure before making the game what it

122
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:14,289
probably was going to turn out to be like.

123
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,990
We knew what the technology advances were going to be.

124
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,312
We had an idea that we were going to be doing some dark

125
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:21,052
subject matter.

126
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:23,374
It was going to be like not bright halls with Nazis in

127
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:26,475
them, but like dark, scary hallways.

128
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:29,097
I call it Scary Dark Fast.

129
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:33,379
We made a lot of halls because of Tom's last name.

130
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:34,700
So the theme.

131
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,621
So part of the design was.

132
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:43,232
you know, Tom wanted to do, like what we'd done in Wolfenstein,

133
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,113
a progression that was like level to level progression.

134
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,854
Yeah, I mean, yeah, like people really expected that from Wolfenstein,

135
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:52,654
and I think that was not the place to innovate, essentially.

136
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:57,035
I think that was a really good, I can complete a chunk, you know,

137
00:07:57,135 --> 00:08:00,435
and perhaps frustratingly complete a chunk, but I can, you know, get there,

138
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:03,696
and boom, I have a success, and that was a good sense of accomplishment

139
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,316
that was very important to this kind of game.

140
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:06,757
And then...

141
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:12,125
And then John was thinking about the technology and what he could do with the tech and he was like,

142
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:15,327
he didn't really, he was starting to lay down some of the basic data structures,

143
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,349
but he also was thinking big.

144
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,550
So John wanted one big world.

145
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,692
He just wanted like one big level.

146
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:23,893
Everybody's going to run around the level.

147
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:25,554
You could like see through doors and then.

148
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:30,576
So then it was like, okay, well, okay, it's one big level and we're doing sort of science fiction.

149
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:31,957
What's the other data there?

150
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:34,399
Yeah, science fiction with demons and stuff like that.

151
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,783
Well, let's make a big base, you know, and then a lot of places to go and kind of sense of place and so on.

152
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:44,908
So we start calculating, you know, how much memory are we going to use for this game, because, which they are doing,

153
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:50,532
while I'm doing about a month of work on this big world and all these things and little nuances and...

154
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:54,100
and we're like calculating sprite sizes, map sizes.

155
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,142
And there's this cool computer room,

156
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,823
and there's all these tunnels.

157
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:59,724
And we're like, there's no way that this is going to work.

158
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:01,265
I mean, we don't have enough memory.

159
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,067
We can barely go above one megabyte.

160
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:04,047
So we're like, we have a new design.

161
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,068
Do you do new design?

162
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,729
We're going to just kind of do levels.

163
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,608
So that's funny.

164
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:19,450
I remember something about that a month ago.

165
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,692
Yeah.

166
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,413
So that was not fun.

167
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:28,195
So Tom was not very happy about that.

168
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:29,736
I feel something snapping.

169
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:31,417
Mentally.

170
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:34,419
You know, like when we were in Wolfenstein,

171
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,301
I had, since it was something that was not

172
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,682
an elegant part of the engine, I had to really, really, really

173
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:41,843
fight for push walls.

174
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,654
but I was like, you're going to be walking through things,

175
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,615
opening doors, you got to have some secrets.

176
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:49,117
You know, I'm like, I grew up, you know, playing Mario

177
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:49,717
and stuff like that.

178
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:50,738
I want secrets.

179
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:52,739
And so I really, really fought for football.

180
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,360
It finally got in.

181
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,000
It's exciting.

182
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:57,843
So that was kind of like snap zero of like, you know,

183
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:00,505
why am I fighting for something that would make the game so fun?

184
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:05,568
And then sort of like, what was that month of work that was lost?

185
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,750
But in that sense.

186
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:13,363
Did you hear that?

187
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:16,544
In that sense, I mean, Carmack was

188
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,705
trying to get the best technology out there

189
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:22,226
and what he could, the best way he can innovate.

190
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:24,667
And I was trying to do the same and just like that kind

191
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,687
of flash heads a bit.

192
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:26,467
Yes.

193
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:31,049
So now we'll focus on December.

194
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:32,369
We're all working.

195
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:35,290
We know that like half the month is gone for vacations and stuff.

196
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,651
Even though we're doing Doom and it's exciting,

197
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:40,732
we're still human and everybody should be taking vacation.

198
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:41,792
Everybody.

199
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:46,100
everybody. But at Christmas, you know what people go. So

200
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,223
here's a picture of Tom with hair and you know, he's, he's

201
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:55,508
using. Thanks. Thanks, everybody. I've lost my glasses

202
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:59,551
while I'm over there. By the way, as advice to any of you,

203
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:06,836
if you ever invent anything, just go get a patent on it.

204
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,940
Regardless, because copyright, because at this time,

205
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:15,849
I was at the desk and I was kind of, man, my wrists are kind of sore.

206
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:23,050
So I had my girlfriend sew this three years before computer wrist pads came out.

207
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:29,452
And it's kind of always been a long regret of mine, but...

208
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:31,332
Could have been rich.

209
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:33,873
Anyway, but...

210
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:36,213
My wrists were happy.

211
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:37,094
That's all that's important.

212
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:38,234
Anyone could see...

213
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,877
Perhaps there's an Altic Lansing speaker on the right.

214
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,218
This is all ancient technology.

215
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:47,581
But the next computer was actually like a Mac right now.

216
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,422
It's basically the same operating system

217
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,524
that you're using right now with the Mac over it,

218
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:54,405
with the Mac UI on top of it.

219
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:56,846
And thanks, Pepsi, for sponsoring this slide.

220
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,789
The nice old calculator, for some reason, is using that.

221
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,492
So then we move to January.

222
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:11,783
January we were beginning making the game.

223
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:14,944
And there was a, you know, with us, these games never have

224
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:17,605
like pre-production where we like draw a bunch of concepts

225
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:18,865
and then kind of vet things.

226
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:21,186
You know, when we make something, it goes in the game.

227
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:22,246
That's just the way it is.

228
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:26,168
So we immediately start creating the technology

229
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:28,608
and we start creating the artwork.

230
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,470
And we're very confident that what we're making is going

231
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,430
to be pretty awesome.

232
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,551
And so we put out a press release.

233
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,960
in January as we basically begin making the game, telling the

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,662
world how revolutionary the game is going to be. And the press

235
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:49,084
release had, like, here are the big features that we had at the

236
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:51,525
end of the press release. And each of these features in the

237
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:53,326
real press release, which you can, like, Google on the

238
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:56,207
Internet, has a whole bunch of explanation behind it. And

239
00:12:56,267 --> 00:13:00,269
probably three or four of those didn't even make it into the

240
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:00,449
game.

241
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,341
Don't do a press release before your game is actually out.

242
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,642
There was a gardening section that just really didn't fit.

243
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,662
Yeah, it was like decades later.

244
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:14,103
Then we get into February.

245
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:16,744
That's when we actually start making art.

246
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:19,924
We were trying to do new things.

247
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:24,365
So instead of just drawing pixels in deluxe paint

248
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:27,325
and making the art that way, Adrian,

249
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:29,286
who was a really amazing pure artist,

250
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:30,126
he would draw the.

251
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:35,481
the actual characters. And then we started making them in clay, modeling them in clay.

252
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:41,605
And we had an X computer that had a video camera that was set up to capture the monsters

253
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:45,807
as they were put on like a lazy Susan that could rotate eights. We had like a post that

254
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:53,151
would mark off eights. And so we would take kind of a picture of it and run it through

255
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:54,792
a program called the

256
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:57,773
Well, yeah, they said, what's the name?

257
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:01,976
We're putting stuff in, and separate things are coming out,

258
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,377
like palettes and stuff like that.

259
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:06,439
I just said, like, Fuzzy Pumper Palette Shop or something.

260
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,420
And that's that.

261
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,101
That was the name of the tool that we

262
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:14,465
made to take these 16-bit images through a video camera

263
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:17,787
and palettize them into VGA's 256 colors, the Fuzzy Pumper

264
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:18,327
Palette Shop.

265
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:22,290
So Adrian only did a few of these clay models,

266
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,111
and then that was it.

267
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:23,651
There's no more.

268
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:24,812
He's not doing that anymore.

269
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:27,243
Because every time you can animate them, the clay just rips.

270
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:31,144
Because we had to light them, so when you light clay, then it goes...

271
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:31,704
Yeah, it was...

272
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:32,345
It's all over.

273
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:35,686
It was new and weird, so we kind of stopped doing that.

274
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:41,427
We basically got the engine up and running pretty quickly,

275
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:46,389
you know, throughout January and then into just the very beginning of February.

276
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:51,492
and we took some screenshots uh... and uh... actually we made a bunch of alphas

277
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:55,114
and stuff while we were making the game and how many of you have actually seen doom alphas?

278
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,554
not that many people

279
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:01,256
cool so you'll get to see them all those hands will be raised in about two minutes

280
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:07,177
so we have uh... the first level that uh... that tom was working on

281
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:10,038
actually got in the game is E2M7

282
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:12,879
uh... but it was supposed to be like the first level in the game

283
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:17,910
We had a different UI, and that was the first crate maze ever made in the game.

284
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,230
Thank you.

285
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:18,611
Yes.

286
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:27,157
But part of that was basically John was worried about, like, too many polys in the environment,

287
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:31,640
you know, because he wanted fast, fast, fast, and then really have a blazing fast game.

288
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:38,446
So I kind of made crate maze and things like that that were more orthogonal and very occlusive,

289
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,507
so it would be fast, faster, and faster.

290
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:44,247
So we were experimenting with UI.

291
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,809
We had, like, that's Tom's basic UI that he drew himself.

292
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:48,490
And then the other one, was it?

293
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,112
I'm available for art duties later.

294
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:55,475
Was there the other UI?

295
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,857
Was it done by Adrian?

296
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,818
The second one is done by Adrian.

297
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,299
No, I think I did most of that.

298
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:03,700
He did the shell, and I did the text.

299
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,160
OK.

300
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:07,202
This is my girlfriend's chainsaw.

301
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:10,524
It's a Macaulay Eager Beaver.

302
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:11,305
Sitting.

303
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:16,060
I used to be sitting on one of my arcade machines, but I sold it, so now I'm sitting in my garage.

304
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:20,083
And if you come over, you can like go like that.

305
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:25,287
But it's kind of drippy and stuff. It's an old chainsaw. It doesn't work anymore.

306
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:31,051
So you can see there, there's like a power cable going to the video camera that was used to digitize the actual chainsaw.

307
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:37,015
And so all the actual weapons that you saw in Doom were just toys that we bought at Toys R Us.

308
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:40,217
And we just kind of held them in front of the video camera and took a snapshot.

309
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,789
and uh... we only have so many toys and is like three or four

310
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:48,010
so it is kind of took pieces and kind of slam them together and the likes pain

311
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,771
and kind of edited on the stuff so

312
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:54,252
but the plasma gun in the bfg are kind of the same the same weapon

313
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:57,613
uh... below where you are the better are you can do

314
00:16:58,613 --> 00:16:58,793
but

315
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:00,034
it was fine for that

316
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,574
that's not that actual shotgun

317
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:04,555
the decoder

318
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:06,575
the city for the for the cap

319
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:10,515
We'd actually play with these toys at work.

320
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:11,816
We were just really busy working.

321
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:16,759
And at this time, basically, Carmack, you know,

322
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,300
really wanted efficient spaces.

323
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,641
So he says, get books on military stuff.

324
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:23,263
It's basically, you know, give me cement buildings,

325
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:26,745
you know, bunkers, very squarish things and so on.

326
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:29,366
It'll really run fast and be very efficient, you know.

327
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,247
And I was like, okay.

328
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:33,408
And then went over and looked at various things like this.

329
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:39,884
that were not very inspiring. Yeah, it's kind of block, you know, it's sort of like that

330
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:44,386
movie, you know, it's boxy but good. Well, you know, it's not that great. So, so, you

331
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:47,867
know, so Tom made a bunch of levels that were a bunch of cement blocks basically with some

332
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:51,929
other textures put on it and they just, they weren't that fun to go into because it was

333
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:58,372
like corridors with rooms that you kind of go into and, you know, it might make sense

334
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:01,713
when you're playing a game where, you know, hey, demons have taken over a military base

335
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:01,913
so.

336
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:05,045
make it look like a military base and have demons sitting in the rooms but

337
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:08,226
flow-wise it just was no fun it was bizarro so

338
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:10,708
so it wasn't that cool but we

339
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:13,669
actually made a uh...

340
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,410
made a demo our first pre-alpha

341
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:17,371
of the game

342
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,591
and uh...

343
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:21,973
that's what we have here hopefully it'll play correctly

344
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:26,875
the lens flare rendering that we did back then was great yeah lens flare was awesome

345
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:27,376
over the text

346
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:31,718
so yes evil unleashed was our subtitle back then

347
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:39,191
And so this was basically the first level that we made using the data structures we created and

348
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,813
DoomEd which was the tool that I wrote to create the levels and

349
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:48,537
and you can see the the second gen UI there with like automap in the top right and

350
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:52,399
And this was the first time the monsters were rotating in the engine

351
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:59,183
Yeah, and again the interface was made sort of larger show there be less actual screen real estate to render again. It was a

352
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,685
for performance thing is gonna be faster if there's you know like sort of

353
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:04,906
sixty seventy percent of the screen to render

354
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:09,429
but it doesn't look that cool when uh... most your screen is taken up with a bunch of UI crap

355
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:13,812
it's it's kinda like old school like uh... like a game like system shock or something

356
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:17,113
where it's important to have interface around you because you're physically doing things like that

357
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:19,855
but here you're just like it's in a raw environment and it doesn't really

358
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,956
yeah I wanna see his head you know so

359
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:23,117
so um...

360
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:28,080
so we you know we have the UI there we could actually put a UI in the game see it's not

361
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,200
working too well take it out

362
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:33,900
And yeah, there were items at this time. You notice on the screen. I believe there's a

363
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:38,762
Sandwich both a sandwich and a heart of Lothar on the same screen

364
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:42,723
There were a lot of like the captain's hand was a key to a door

365
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:49,886
And so there's a lot of esoteric and I more like adventure II kind of things since it was one large world originally. Yep

366
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:51,706
Let's see, is this the same

367
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,107
Yes March

368
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:08,500
finally get past February. In March, something interesting happened while we were making

369
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:16,022
the game. So 20th Century Fox contacted us because we did Wolfenstein, which is a pretty

370
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:26,204
fast game. And they thought that we would be the right team to make Aliens the game.

371
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:29,245
And so we already have a technology running.

372
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:32,266
You know, we're ready to start running with Doom.

373
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:36,248
And they kind of stop us, because we all love aliens.

374
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:37,908
Especially Adrian.

375
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,269
Yeah, especially Adrian.

376
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,469
So you know, the shapes of the monsters.

377
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,210
We had Giger books all over the place in the art room.

378
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,471
So the bathroom, you know.

379
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:47,712
Yeah, totally.

380
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:50,913
I don't know what that means.

381
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,613
We talked about it for half an hour.

382
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,313
That's about it.

383
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:55,974
It was like, hey guys, here's a really awesome opportunity.

384
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:57,035
We talked about it, and we're like.

385
00:20:57,475 --> 00:21:01,176
you know what, I don't want to give up creative control on this game, you know, this could

386
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:05,557
be something that's like really original, but we do like the idea of running away from,

387
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:09,558
you know, we were talking about demons already, so it's like, well it'll be kind of, you know,

388
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:16,660
alien-ish. Sci-fi with demons, that the mix of science and sort of mythos and stuff like

389
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,481
that was one of the true powerful things, the juxtaposition of that. Yeah, if you're

390
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,882
in space you kind of expect fighting aliens, but you don't expect fighting hell, so that

391
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:26,983
was something we thought was going to be cool.

392
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:30,483
So we decided, let's not do the aliens attacking the space

393
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,285
marine. Let's do the hell demons attacking the space marine.

394
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:39,488
That'd be more original. It was back then. Really? So then we

395
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,791
start doing, I'm working on this level, which is the second level

396
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:46,573
of the game, UNM2, and you can see the horrible, you know, that

397
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:51,096
wall texture with the brown crap on it, and the red stripe. But I

398
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:55,178
was like having to explore, like, forget the cement square,

399
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,519
you know, rooms with

400
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:59,860
the hallways at 90 degrees and stuff.

401
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,062
I wanted shapes that were more interesting.

402
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,844
And you can see these are like real kind of early textures,

403
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:10,588
but I was trying to make a level that didn't feel realistic,

404
00:22:10,888 --> 00:22:13,510
but you could still kind of identify it as a place

405
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,011
that might be military base,

406
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:18,954
because you're kind of at a science station on a moon.

407
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:24,018
So I wanted it to be more interesting to explore.

408
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:25,739
So that's where I started to play around with.

409
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:31,706
Lots of contrast in room heights and contrast in lighting.

410
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:35,347
Because the engine does really great lighting.

411
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:44,189
In fact, on this slide, the Doom engine did something that I don't know many other engines do.

412
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:46,970
I think the Build engine did it, but it does what's called diminished lighting,

413
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,572
where the light gets darker automatically through the engine as it tries to render off into the distance.

414
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:56,145
which means that you have a game that's just automatically scary.

415
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:58,966
You don't even have to really try, you just kind of just draw some stuff,

416
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:02,666
make the light a little bit, you know, medium, and it's just dark in the distance.

417
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:07,667
And you can have like a really bright, a bright light in the background to create silhouettes of stuff.

418
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:11,348
So the Doom Engine was really amazing for creating scary spaces

419
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:13,688
because it just made it scary automatically.

420
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:15,448
And then?

421
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:20,769
So then I made this room, which I don't think to you guys is very impressive looking,

422
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:22,250
but back then...

423
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:28,208
This was the room that really changed the look of the game because this was the, before

424
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:31,810
all that other stuff that you saw, this was really like the room that showed, hey, we

425
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,992
can have like high ceilings with, you know, banks of computers up, you know, higher than

426
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:41,894
the player and show like a real, you know, how high can this get?

427
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:43,755
What kind of scale can I get in this game?

428
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:48,497
This was almost one of these, we're kind of defining the possible scale of the game and

429
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:51,658
this is one way that we're doing it through this room.

430
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:59,560
It's a very important difference in that most games, which is kind of where we started, are doing a very functional

431
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:07,248
Oh, I could be here in this space. There's a console that I could use kind of thing. Where this was kind of an abstraction or a

432
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:09,490
different almost the

433
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,912
artistic choice to

434
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:17,617
to to just elevate and and make things grow and be huge and big and different

435
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:25,840
And that was like this room is like the start of something like very large that really defined Doom and that was brilliant by John.

436
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,622
Yeah, just the abstract level design instead of trying to be realistic is really what this room started.

437
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:35,004
And so we basically, everybody loved it. The artists came in and were like, that's it man.

438
00:24:35,064 --> 00:24:39,866
So that's it. The game is, the level design is set.

439
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,287
You know, basically we're going to be doing the abstract stuff.

440
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,569
But then disaster struck.

441
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:49,235
What happened? We all had to stop working on Doom.

442
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,517
It's so drama-filled, this whole game.

443
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,038
The finale of Days of Our Lives.

444
00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:00,021
The Super Nintendo version that we had gotten a guy to work on

445
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:02,402
was not finished, and

446
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:05,164
Imagineer was not pleased.

447
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:09,346
It had been, you know, since I think the summertime,

448
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:10,767
so it'd been like about nine months,

449
00:25:11,347 --> 00:25:12,908
and they hadn't heard anything from us, and we're like,

450
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:13,528
oh, what?

451
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,932
you know, oh, that guy was working on the port. And we

452
00:25:17,972 --> 00:25:20,654
couldn't get a hold of the guy. And like it was, it was, it was,

453
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:24,016
you know, it was a nightmare situation because we couldn't,

454
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,678
we couldn't get it done basically with somebody else.

455
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,762
And so, and so basically we stopped working on Doom right in

456
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,564
the middle kind of and basically ported Wolfenstein to the

457
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:37,926
Super Nintendo. And so the whole team jumped on it, artists

458
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:39,628
jumped on art, you know, just like stop Doom.

459
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:46,784
I have a programming degree and I've been doing design for a long time, but I pulled

460
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:50,507
that out and did the bonus screen where all the junk bounces around on the screen at the

461
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:50,627
end.

462
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:52,208
Everybody's like, we're not going to help.

463
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:53,669
We've got to get done with this thing.

464
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:54,830
We've got to get back on Doom.

465
00:25:55,651 --> 00:25:59,974
We wanted to ship it Christmas, so we all jumped on it and it took us three weeks to

466
00:26:00,014 --> 00:26:01,915
just blast out the port.

467
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:05,252
and that's including all of the, you know, put rats in there

468
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:07,093
and green blood and all of that stuff.

469
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:09,313
For some reason Nintendo didn't like, you know,

470
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:11,654
like swastikas and Hitler and stuff like that.

471
00:26:11,694 --> 00:26:15,296
So you fought the Statmeister Meisterstat.

472
00:26:15,636 --> 00:26:15,856
Yes.

473
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,577
Of, you know, whatever.

474
00:26:18,617 --> 00:26:19,657
We had to get it out.

475
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,099
So then, you know, we could kind of get back to it.

476
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,139
Work on Doom.

477
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,360
Started again after that three week.

478
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,301
Like, what the hell?

479
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:31,401
And then.

480
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:40,566
And then I was working on that E1M2 level and I made this thing

481
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:44,608
here, which is like a, you know, it looks kind of innocent. It's

482
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,971
this, it's this, these stairs that kind of go down. But the

483
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:52,374
way that the code was structured, it caused a recursion

484
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:57,157
problem when John was traversing his sector list internal data

485
00:26:57,177 --> 00:27:00,499
structure. It slowed the game way down because it was looking

486
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,740
into something that had to go in and out of a list.

487
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:10,340
recursively and the game super started chugging and he liked the way that the game was starting

488
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,864
to look so he wanted to fix the problem instead of hey just draw a bunch of blocks.

489
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:21,251
Yeah so that was the cool moment there because I was sitting there giving constraints and

490
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:25,936
said I'll do the best I can with these blockers things and John just said.

491
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,190
hey, this looks cool, screw you, make your tech cool.

492
00:27:29,391 --> 00:27:30,191
Fix the engine, dude.

493
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:31,511
This is really cool.

494
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:33,012
That's the great part of the tension

495
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:37,013
of a team of great people is the ability to do that.

496
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:41,615
So the way that he was storing the sectors internally

497
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:44,116
and traversing through them wasn't any kind of rocket

498
00:27:44,136 --> 00:27:47,096
science or anything, but that's kind of why we

499
00:27:47,257 --> 00:27:51,478
hit this problem with this area of the level.

500
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:54,999
So basically, John had to fix the problem.

501
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:56,522
And so he started reading up.

502
00:27:57,322 --> 00:28:02,504
And then the BSP tree was born.

503
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:06,665
This was based off of work by a guy in the audience here.

504
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,666
His name is Bruce Naylor.

505
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:10,727
And he had researched this for, I

506
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:12,988
think it was back-based culling off of 3D models.

507
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:15,588
And John had read a white paper on it and decided, hey,

508
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:20,090
I could use that into basically that culling algorithm

509
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,451
to cull out non-visible sectors inside of a level.

510
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:23,571
So.

511
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,088
he adapted that algorithm into the engine,

512
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,409
and it was instantaneous.

513
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:31,090
You know, super fast.

514
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,291
And that was great.

515
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:35,333
So John Carmack was impressed about, like,

516
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:36,353
this looks really cool.

517
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:37,794
And he could see that, and that's

518
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:38,975
what led him to technology.

519
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:41,196
Yeah, and that was great, because the whole industry's

520
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:44,278
been using BSPs now for a very long time, a couple decades,

521
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,419
I think, since then, almost.

522
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:52,263
So then we get to April.

523
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,476
We work on another alpha.

524
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,617
We kind of get another alpha out there.

525
00:28:59,457 --> 00:29:00,758
This is like some of the text.

526
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,198
I don't know if you guys can read it,

527
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,299
but this is some of the text out of the readme file

528
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,920
that we always put in all of our deliverables

529
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,741
that we kind of send out.

530
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:10,202
And these were just sent out to like beta testers

531
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:11,262
that we've known for years.

532
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,323
So it was just a few people that we sent these to.

533
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:18,626
But we kind of reached what we felt was an alpha milestone.

534
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:20,166
So this is-

535
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:21,507
People called like football.

536
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,427
Pushwall and Fruit Basket.

537
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:26,290
Yeah, actually, that's the name of some of the testers.

538
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:31,914
So we're using a DOS extender to take advantage

539
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:33,535
of 4 megabytes of memory.

540
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:36,397
So we're not limited to the lower 640k.

541
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:41,060
And down at the bottom left, you can see the little two dots.

542
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,962
That's kind of our frame rate counter down at the bottom,

543
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:46,204
since we didn't want to put a big number on the screen.

544
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:54,351
Hey man, if this gets out, you can all kiss your autographed Doom handbooks goodbye.

545
00:29:56,752 --> 00:29:59,813
So, you can explain the difference.

546
00:29:59,873 --> 00:30:02,473
This room is a little more sort of a story-based thing.

547
00:30:03,294 --> 00:30:08,856
When, like Doom was a great game with sort of, you know, things jumping out at you

548
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,637
and just pure, you know, raw experience, which was brilliant about it.

549
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:18,179
At this point, my thought about it was, hey, there's, you know, speaking of aliens,

550
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:19,159
uh...

551
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:24,557
What Jim Cameron did that was so great is he showed you just at the start of the movie,

552
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:28,918
there's all these people's transponders in this one place over there.

553
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:34,439
And your journey is towards that, so you have a deeper and deeper and deeper sense of dread as you head to it.

554
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:39,599
And so that was the very, very small, simple story I was trying to inject on there,

555
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,120
is just that sense of deeper dread underneath the scary sort of experience.

556
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,761
But as you know, it's kind of boxy right now in this version.

557
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,272
Yeah, this is one of the early boxy, hey, do military boxy room kind of stuff.

558
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:53,512
And that's why you can see it's...

559
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:57,634
Yeah, and at the time we had to, you know, we're trying to find a texture style and stuff.

560
00:30:57,674 --> 00:31:01,136
So the silvery cool one was like kind of realistic looking.

561
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:02,697
It was kind of a really interesting...

562
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:03,717
More spacey.

563
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:06,839
Yeah, more spacey and kind of cool and the stone and stuff.

564
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:10,220
So we kind of stuck with what was okay to do.

565
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:13,582
This was E1M7.

566
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:16,503
And, you know, there might be some people out there.

567
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:22,001
that have played E1M7 a million times. This is like the really

568
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:24,803
early version of E1M7. So if you play the level a lot, you

569
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:28,325
totally know where you're at in here, but how different it is

570
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:33,769
from the actual release game. This is a lot of, still using

571
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:35,570
these is a limited amount of textures. We didn't have that

572
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,691
many textures back then because we kind of were dumping a lot of

573
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:42,895
effort into the modeling and the texturing or the characters

574
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:45,016
having to pixel, you know, basically do pixel editing of

575
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,697
the characters, cleaning up all the frames.

576
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:49,415
That was a lot of work to clean those guys up.

577
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:51,916
And it's the weekend here, so none of the demons are there.

578
00:31:53,297 --> 00:31:54,377
Taking some time off.

579
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:55,818
Knocking one back.

580
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:57,858
That's the end of E1M2.

581
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:04,701
That's E1M6.

582
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,722
You can see I was playing around here with actually the,

583
00:32:08,022 --> 00:32:09,783
I did all the programming of everything

584
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,163
that happens in the environment in the game.

585
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:13,404
So all the flashing lights, the stairs, the platforms,

586
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:14,064
the switches.

587
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:20,082
all that stuff I was coding all of that and testing it in my levels. So while I'm making

588
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:23,943
the levels, I'm testing the functionality of the levels at the same time with cool features

589
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:28,225
like, hey, it'd be cool if this, you know, there's some lockers. It'd be really cool

590
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:31,685
if there were some demons in the shower here. That's what that's supposed to be.

591
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:35,887
You know, you get dirty, you know, killing and maiming and all that stuff. Consigning

592
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:37,667
souls to hell and all that stuff.

593
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:44,791
At this point I'm very glad he was doing some of the gameplay stuff right now because sometimes

594
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:50,054
it's difficult to get gameplay stuff in sort of a technical focused company.

595
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:53,675
So I really wanted teleporters in the game.

596
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:55,096
Teleporters were my new push wall.

597
00:32:55,616 --> 00:33:03,560
So I like stole one of Adrian's graphics and I colorized it red and I stole his metal texture

598
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,620
and put bands around it.

599
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:07,610
here, can you make this teleport to another one of these

600
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,430
somewhere else in the level?

601
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,351
It's like, OK.

602
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:10,911
So that was awesome.

603
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:11,872
I was like, I'm free.

604
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:12,412
I can make it all.

605
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:15,473
I can go over here and do special rooms and all.

606
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:17,774
It was nice to be able to do that.

607
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:19,414
So it was non-snappy.

608
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:20,875
Yeah.

609
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:24,116
Yeah, this was basically E1M2.

610
00:33:24,997 --> 00:33:27,538
And I think that's probably the end of that video.

611
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:31,439
Yeah, we had little signs and stuff in there.

612
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:34,871
These are real early signs that don't exist in the Finnish game.

613
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:37,013
It's like programmer art or designer or whatever.

614
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:40,396
It was programmer art.

615
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:41,817
Dark Hall.

616
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:44,178
There's the exit.

617
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:44,699
Why, why?

618
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:47,081
Cute.

619
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:50,843
Yeah, that's basically everyone that was in the company at that time.

620
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:51,884
The very bottom there.

621
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:55,167
So it was a pretty small team.

622
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,030
And then we get to May of 1993.

623
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:08,845
And so we put out another pre-beta. I don't think this is

624
00:34:08,865 --> 00:34:12,506
like maybe a minute. But we're improving the game. We're making

625
00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:16,047
new builds. It's funny that they're not out all over the

626
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:22,269
place. So it's good to get the video here. So we were like,

627
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:24,910
this is getting more real. We got a lot more textures in this.

628
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,851
You can see the UI at the bottom is totally changed up. We're

629
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,132
just playing around with new things. We have a font.

630
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:33,544
Yeah, now there's a menu system.

631
00:34:33,644 --> 00:34:39,145
And so we took some of those little markers on the side

632
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:41,406
there are kind of taken from Wolfenstein.

633
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:45,487
But we basically are trying to kind of fill out the menu

634
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,727
system so we can program some stuff in there, some more

635
00:34:48,747 --> 00:34:51,588
functionality so we don't have to put command line parameters

636
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:52,768
to enable functionality.

637
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:55,609
We got our skill levels in there because we need to put

638
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:56,849
stuff in the levels.

639
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,169
Like while we're making the levels, we got to.

640
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,133
be able to put, you know, monsters of varying difficulty in there. So, like, now we're getting

641
00:35:03,153 --> 00:35:09,959
more, you know, just kind of more of the game, more of the game actually going. So, yeah,

642
00:35:09,979 --> 00:35:14,983
you can see they just disappear now, but, hey, you can shoot them. Pop. You can shoot

643
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:20,047
the, you shoot the demons, they disappear, you know, not fun, but, you know, at least

644
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:24,751
it's working. And in this, so yeah, I think this was pretty much the whole thing, this

645
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:25,351
little bitty level.

646
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,060
but it gave us a lot more textures, some shooting, new UI,

647
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,961
menu system, so we're kind of dumping a whole bunch of stuff

648
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:36,782
in there with just, it was just two of us programming at that

649
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:40,183
time, just me and John. But the artists are doing a lot of work

650
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:44,764
redoing, you know, the bullet clips and the armor and, you

651
00:35:44,804 --> 00:35:47,345
know, the artifacts that you pick up, because in the game

652
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:48,985
you actually were picking up a lot of artifacts, it was

653
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:51,586
keeping track of items that you picked up, even all the way

654
00:35:51,626 --> 00:35:53,226
until October. So...

655
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:58,865
eventually decided that that was not gonna be a fun thing to do, picking up all these items.

656
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:03,167
We're doing that in Wolfenstein, but it wasn't something that kind of fit inside this game.

657
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:04,948
And there's, I think that's Tom's.

658
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:09,829
Yeah, you think that? I think Adrian did that, I'm pretty sure.

659
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:15,752
That sort of speaks sort of to the original One World design being like turned into like map that you go through.

660
00:36:17,713 --> 00:36:18,973
Yes, we were at June.

661
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:21,014
In June.

662
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,264
I think Jay had talked to Computer Gaming World, which is the really cool magazine back there

663
00:36:28,304 --> 00:36:29,145
for PC games.

664
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:33,348
And so a guy named Chris Lombardi came out and he did a preview of Doom.

665
00:36:33,388 --> 00:36:34,269
It was a two-pager.

666
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:35,070
This is just one of them.

667
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,794
And he did a really great job on this preview, sneak peek.

668
00:36:41,374 --> 00:36:46,218
And so they actually, in this issue of CGW, they did two previews.

669
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:48,340
One was called Companions of Xanth, and one was Doom.

670
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,086
and they got Companions of Xanth on the cover

671
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,947
with a kind of a mention of Doom on it.

672
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:56,468
So that was really cool that we actually got

673
00:36:56,988 --> 00:36:59,248
ourself mentioned on the cover of a magazine, finally.

674
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:01,989
The first time that we actually got any kind of press

675
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:03,970
was I think on the phone after Wolfenstein,

676
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,650
we did like a radio interview with somebody.

677
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,930
And so that was really exciting.

678
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,691
And random.

679
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:10,171
Yeah, and so it was cool to see, you know,

680
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:12,012
the first time that Doom was in something,

681
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:13,672
we're right in the middle of development.

682
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,593
So now July hits.

683
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:24,870
Yeah, and at this time, you notice Doom has a lot of variety and monsters.

684
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:30,995
At this time, like a month before, there was nothing flying.

685
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:35,439
There was a bunch of going, it's going, you know, and shooting stuff at you,

686
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,082
throwing stuff at you, coming and destroying you and stuff like that.

687
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:41,765
And again, it was sort of a fight to say, you know,

688
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:44,988
there needs to be something flying. I realize, you know, this is.

689
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:50,075
fake 3D and stuff, but there needs to be something flying, something that can come down at me,

690
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:54,057
you know, something that doesn't have to be in the same path that I am, you know, something

691
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:56,798
that can come up and, you know, scare the crap out of you.

692
00:37:57,398 --> 00:38:03,701
Finally, after a lot of effort, then finally we got the flying skulls and things like that.

693
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,782
But it was kind of a fight, you know.

694
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,663
And that kind of led to...

695
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:12,656
another little snap in my happiness, like trying to, you know, this should be obvious,

696
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:15,377
you know, why can't we just, you know, do this and that's cool.

697
00:38:18,058 --> 00:38:24,280
Anyways, so, at that time, there's like Id and there's me and there's a circle of, you

698
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,662
know, people having fun and really loving what they do and talking to each other and

699
00:38:29,702 --> 00:38:33,403
I'm kind of like isolated and alone like the sad clown.

700
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:40,853
So yeah, Tom wanted more creativity.

701
00:38:40,913 --> 00:38:43,794
Things were getting optimized out of the design.

702
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,935
And so we kind of felt that Tom's vision was kind of too

703
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:49,915
much for what we were trying to boil the game down to, which

704
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:51,995
is pure speed, DMs, keys, doors.

705
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:55,476
Since it's scary dark fast, things like I wanted were

706
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:58,216
like environment dangers, things that were different

707
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:01,337
from a bunch of hallways and green slime and stuff like

708
00:39:01,397 --> 00:39:06,198
that, and in the end, it's just like, well, it's difficult

709
00:39:06,298 --> 00:39:06,538
to be.

710
00:39:08,493 --> 00:39:13,115
the thing was a pure thing and it's difficult to be on the fifth version of the same thing

711
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:15,696
and seems they've done a few more of those

712
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:23,078
uh... that you just want to know get your creative yayas out and uh...

713
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,980
he was kind of ahead of the design game where we're trying to

714
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,002
yeah considering I was making trees out of like green blocks

715
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:36,143
I was kind of like uh... you know I was ready to explode

716
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:37,403
so

717
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:44,236
So then we get to August, and so then Tom leaves.

718
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:45,777
We depart.

719
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:50,938
We parted ways, and we had a meeting and just parted ways.

720
00:39:51,318 --> 00:39:55,198
And after the meeting, I felt a deep sense of relief,

721
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:59,499
because this thing has just been eating at me,

722
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,540
and been unhappy, and not getting my creative juices out.

723
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,440
And that led me to the realization

724
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:05,760
that.

725
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:12,030
all like all of us wanted was creative happiness. Creative happiness always wins and it will

726
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:18,791
make things sort out. So Carmack wanted creative, his technical creative happiness and to do what

727
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:22,812
he wanted to do. John had thought in creative happiness, you know, he's getting to do a lot

728
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:27,173
more design, you know, that he's brilliant at instead of just like being hampered by tools

729
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:34,215
and stuff like that. And this allowed me to get out. Unfortunately, I kind of did Rise of Triad,

730
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:35,635
which a number of people like.

731
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:38,620
uh... but it was sort of like wolf of stein

732
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:40,782
one point five you know

733
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:45,326
and i i i i'm really proud of the death match death matches incredible like

734
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:48,368
crazy things going on drug missiles you know and playmalls and stuff

735
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:51,291
uh... and actually there's a inside story

736
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:55,094
uh... the god mode of rise of the triad

737
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,636
is actually something john did

738
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:00,618
while no clipping through walls in wolfenstein

739
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:04,161
because he would sit there and he turned no clip on to like go look at a

740
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:05,042
different room or something

741
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:08,704
and then he just kind of go,

742
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:11,665
ooooh, I am moving through walls, I will destroy you all.

743
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:15,166
So that kind of turned into a God mode.

744
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:16,306
The actual sound effect.

745
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:19,367
And they're like, ooooh, I will destroy you all.

746
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:21,607
Kind of an inside joke.

747
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:23,088
But the thing I want to get,

748
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:25,048
the point I want to make about that though

749
00:41:25,128 --> 00:41:26,489
is did Rise of the Triad,

750
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:28,549
but then eventually years later.

751
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:34,401
I did get to get my creative yayas completely out with Anachronox, which is a space game

752
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:40,506
which had characters which really told, had a really sense of space and I'm really proud

753
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:42,327
of the writing and the experience of that.

754
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:49,413
Yeah, Tom actually was developing Prey after Rise of the Triad and he left 3D Realms, they

755
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:54,077
kind of renamed themselves, he left 3D Realms while he was on Prey to help

756
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:57,522
a startup, Ion Storm, so he could make anachronox,

757
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,723
his giant RPG.

758
00:41:59,223 --> 00:41:59,603
Yeah.

759
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,344
Prey was an interesting project.

760
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:03,925
I had sort of an interesting thing

761
00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:06,266
that kind of showed up a little bit in anachronox,

762
00:42:06,306 --> 00:42:08,667
but it's a series of combined classes

763
00:42:08,947 --> 00:42:11,588
that each kind of contribute to each other, three primaries

764
00:42:11,688 --> 00:42:13,388
and two that add to each other.

765
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,630
But that just wasn't creatively working out,

766
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,091
and the team wasn't really happy with it

767
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:22,272
either, the way things were going.

768
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:28,388
The one thing that I do like that is in Prey is grab pass, so you can just walk up the wall.

769
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:36,070
I had the very perfect image originally in Prey of being able to go like this and throw a grenade

770
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,511
and have it bounce on the ceiling like that and wait for somebody and like that.

771
00:42:40,531 --> 00:42:42,272
So it would be a great death match kind of thing.

772
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:50,673
Anyway, so then Tom goes and eventually he does an acronax, but during this time Tom's gone.

773
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:56,211
Tom was creative director and he was on the project for 10 months and now there's a void

774
00:42:56,692 --> 00:43:00,213
And so we need to hire some other people because I'm not going to finish doing all the levels myself

775
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:04,734
Because I still have you know programming to do in the game and everything, but you know

776
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:08,816
I just did one one to say one more thing and

777
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,156
That can you stand over here?

778
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:14,057
All right, what's your mic at me? I?

779
00:43:14,097 --> 00:43:16,998
Just wanted oh yeah, I just wanted to say that

780
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:26,372
I am proud to have worked on Doom, and after 18 some years, I can wear this shirt and say

781
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:28,173
that, you know, I wrote it.

782
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:40,700
Yeah, that'll be $20 for another shirt to come off.

783
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:47,846
We actually made Wolfenstein shirts that way as well.

784
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:49,587
So Wolfenstein 3D wrote it, and then we

785
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:51,669
did a bunch of the Doom ones while we were making the game.

786
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,050
It's pretty funny.

787
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,575
Yeah, actually we came up with, I think I did the Roadout shirts,

788
00:43:58,695 --> 00:44:01,037
and then I did the Go to Hell ad.

789
00:44:01,437 --> 00:44:04,620
And then Apple did these really simple couple word ads.

790
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,161
I think they stole it from me personally.

791
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:09,063
Oh, yeah.

792
00:44:09,204 --> 00:44:11,686
OK, so now we have to hire some new people, right?

793
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:14,168
So we just hired two more people to replace Tom.

794
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:20,030
Dave Taylor. Everybody knows Dave, hopefully. And then the

795
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,410
legendary Sandy Peterson who was working with Chaosium on

796
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,711
Call of Cthulhu and a bunch of other stuff. So he was a well

797
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,552
known designer back then. So then these guys jump on the

798
00:44:31,592 --> 00:44:35,872
game. Sandy is taking over Tom's design work. Dave is doing a lot

799
00:44:35,892 --> 00:44:39,453
of programming for us to get the game out. You know, we get into

800
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:44,274
September. We're making a lot of progress on the automap. Lots

801
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,434
of levels are getting done.

802
00:44:46,272 --> 00:44:53,096
in the style of game levels back then. And we get the DMX sound drivers. We didn't have

803
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:57,438
enough bandwidth to do the sound drivers ourselves. So we actually had a guy named Paul Radek.

804
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,961
He wrote the sound drivers that he was licensing out. So Dave got those hooked into the game.

805
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:07,945
So we actually get sound effects and everything. In October, we finally get another build of

806
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:11,227
the game. It's a pre-release. And it's

807
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:17,593
getting close, you know, we're only, I think, what, two months away from release at this point.

808
00:45:18,153 --> 00:45:23,515
So, so the game's looking better. You can see way more textures in it, the lighting's better,

809
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:29,557
we have a lot more time to make more of an environment in this game. So this doesn't

810
00:45:29,577 --> 00:45:35,600
have the sound effects in it because it would be annoying, but you can see how much more

811
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,241
work's been done to that really simple level, and it does take a lot of time.

812
00:45:39,725 --> 00:45:44,067
when you're making levels to just keep going over and over the same area

813
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:49,571
and refining your texture alignment, your lighting, and your effects, and your placement,

814
00:45:49,851 --> 00:45:52,352
and everything that you're trying to do in these things.

815
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:56,715
Making a great level requires a ton of iteration and a ton of play.

816
00:45:56,735 --> 00:45:57,796
You need to play your own level.

817
00:45:58,276 --> 00:46:00,857
And so I play these things a lot.

818
00:46:00,957 --> 00:46:05,360
And this isn't even the final version of it because there's no lift there in the final game.

819
00:46:07,217 --> 00:46:10,038
You can see that even the sky is different.

820
00:46:10,959 --> 00:46:16,581
That's like, trying to be realistic, it looks like, you know, you're on Phobos and there's

821
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:21,403
space above the mountains, which, sure, space would be black like that, but it doesn't look

822
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:21,823
that good.

823
00:46:22,003 --> 00:46:26,905
You know, a black void like that doesn't, it doesn't feel as good as something that

824
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:32,107
has more light, so we kind of made it, we changed the final, the final, uh,

825
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:35,397
the final sky to actually be light colored.

826
00:46:35,477 --> 00:46:37,278
So the level actually felt a lot better.

827
00:46:37,438 --> 00:46:40,421
Yeah, if you put stars in there, they would kind of alias or something.

828
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:44,123
Yeah, they would drop out and look samply.

829
00:46:45,224 --> 00:46:46,585
You can see that we're picking up items.

830
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:47,766
We're keeping track of items.

831
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:51,029
And next to the Doomguy's head, we have the lives.

832
00:46:51,629 --> 00:46:54,051
So we still had those kind of things in the game.

833
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:58,594
Even at the intermission screen, it was keeping track of your rewards for items

834
00:46:58,654 --> 00:46:59,795
that you picked up and stuff.

835
00:46:59,835 --> 00:47:02,277
But I basically just didn't think that.

836
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:09,822
Like this was a, this is like, I felt like this is a pretty modern game, let's get rid of the things that arcade games had in them.

837
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:19,490
So, I didn't like the idea that you would have to have lives and like you could end the game and kind of get really mad because you tried really hard to get through like E2M5 or something.

838
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:27,917
So, I got rid of the idea of lives and if you get killed you just go back to the beginning level infinitely as much as you want.

839
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:34,415
And we have a save load feature in the game where you can save it at any second while you're playing and reload it instantly.

840
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:42,542
So it would be, you know, there's a high probability that players would be able to actually finish the game and get through it.

841
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:50,068
So you can see here, walking through E1M2, how much different it is.

842
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:53,871
You can see that these fireballs from these guys are still, I think it's Tom's art.

843
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:54,292
Yeah.

844
00:47:54,832 --> 00:47:56,314
The fireballs that they're throwing is old.

845
00:47:58,262 --> 00:48:01,304
But at least you can see the game getting more done.

846
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,727
And really, the next step past this point was the final game.

847
00:48:04,747 --> 00:48:07,789
It was just the next revision of all of these little layers

848
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:12,473
of graphics and level design and menu systems and stuff

849
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:12,853
like that.

850
00:48:14,054 --> 00:48:17,617
So you can see, I actually had to run a TSR program called

851
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:21,380
Fake Date to allow me to record the demo,

852
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,762
because we had a time-locked press release version

853
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:25,283
that we sent out.

854
00:48:27,308 --> 00:48:30,188
It's hard to say. I don't think you can set the date manually

855
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:36,550
inside of DOSBox. So going forward, November was like, okay,

856
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,530
we're at the very end. We've got to hurry up and get this game

857
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,331
done. So we're all doing final polish work on it. So a lot got

858
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:47,752
done. The first IPX multiplayer in a game was created, like a

859
00:48:47,852 --> 00:48:52,633
fast shooter game. The word deathmatch is created. I came up

860
00:48:52,653 --> 00:48:54,933
with that just while I was thinking about, you know, what

861
00:48:54,953 --> 00:48:55,733
kind of mode that would be.

862
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:59,399
We put co-op in there because it just seemed obvious that you'd want to go through the

863
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:00,560
game together with friends.

864
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:07,581
We finished all of the extra 10% of the game that it takes to really make it feel polished.

865
00:49:08,702 --> 00:49:12,863
And then we got modems working and all the game maps were modified to handle all the

866
00:49:12,903 --> 00:49:15,463
game modes that we had with all the difficulty levels and everything.

867
00:49:15,964 --> 00:49:19,064
So it was really just tons of polish at the very, very end.

868
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:22,649
and we were spending more and more time at the office.

869
00:49:23,149 --> 00:49:25,990
The Usenet was going crazy because everybody knew

870
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,750
the game was coming out for a whole year,

871
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,851
so they were inventing all kinds of stories

872
00:49:31,311 --> 00:49:36,232
and new games based off of cheat codes that we had.

873
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:39,453
Actually, the internet created some cheat codes,

874
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:43,153
so it was just like really furious at the very end.

875
00:49:43,173 --> 00:49:47,454
That last November, December was pretty crazy.

876
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:52,026
And then basically that was December 10th is the day that we

877
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:56,048
are putting the game up on the net. We had a 30 hour stretch

878
00:49:56,068 --> 00:50:00,370
at the very end of no sleep, 30 hours, everybody just running

879
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:05,152
the game on every machine. We had a last minute bug that was

880
00:50:05,632 --> 00:50:09,734
like, it was a really crazy bug that only if you knew everything

881
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:12,495
about the technology would you know how to debug. But basically

882
00:50:13,235 --> 00:50:14,456
the game runs on a timer, so.

883
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:18,047
even in the future with 50 megahertz, 50 gigahertz

884
00:50:18,107 --> 00:50:19,348
processors, this game will always

885
00:50:19,388 --> 00:50:20,750
run at the correct speed.

886
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:25,994
But in doing that, using the timer at a low level,

887
00:50:26,394 --> 00:50:29,257
interrupt level, basically if the timer starts

888
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,799
at some crazy random value when the game starts,

889
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,441
there's a possibility that it could hit zero.

890
00:50:34,922 --> 00:50:36,603
And at that point, the game just locks up.

891
00:50:36,964 --> 00:50:39,606
So we sometimes saw the game running on a bunch of machines

892
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:41,688
and would just randomly lock up for no reason at all.

893
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,040
only only Carmack could figure out that it was the timer code

894
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,821
that was wrapping when that happened. So fix that bug and

895
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:52,502
then it never you know, that was just like during that last time

896
00:50:53,402 --> 00:50:55,162
fixing that bug. And it was the last thing that we had in the

897
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:57,743
game. So ironically,

898
00:50:59,183 --> 00:51:03,744
doom is uploaded to my college computers, you know, decided

899
00:51:03,784 --> 00:51:07,745
Wisconsin upload the game to the college University of Wisconsin

900
00:51:07,825 --> 00:51:11,306
FTP server, and everyone was waiting for it. So we had

901
00:51:12,513 --> 00:51:17,115
You know, we had to try and get in there, get a slot in there to do an upload, which is what we did.

902
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:22,157
And so, you know, we were using a modem and putting the game up.

903
00:51:22,797 --> 00:51:24,878
And it blew up the whole server.

904
00:51:26,158 --> 00:51:29,939
And then we had to get on the phone with the sysop of the FTP server.

905
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,140
And then we had to have him kick everybody off.

906
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,722
And then we had to slot in again because we had hundreds of people trying to get onto the server to get the game.

907
00:51:36,742 --> 00:51:39,483
And we couldn't even get the game up on the server because they're sitting there.

908
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:40,923
And then it blew up again.

909
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:40,983
So...

910
00:51:42,323 --> 00:51:44,765
the second time the game blew up and and uh...

911
00:51:45,425 --> 00:51:48,528
and then basically had to tell him to just lock everybody off

912
00:51:48,928 --> 00:51:49,829
so we could just upload it

913
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:51,230
and so he did that

914
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,631
and now bucky's happy

915
00:51:53,171 --> 00:51:54,692
and then the game was uploaded

916
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:59,776
uploaded to the world and made its way across all the bbs's and uh... you know

917
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:00,997
everybody knows the rest of the story

918
00:52:01,758 --> 00:52:03,739
uh... we went on to make doom 2 and quake and

919
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:04,920
and that weirdly

920
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,862
uh... level ten of doom two was mine

921
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:15,653
what the diamonds and what that was a funny moment.

922
00:52:15,793 --> 00:52:17,033
And so that's it.

923
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:19,034
That's the story of how we made Doom.

924
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:22,555
Thanks everyone.

925
00:52:26,616 --> 00:52:28,896
We can do questions.

926
00:52:29,576 --> 00:52:33,097
First of all, I would like to, this is an odd job.

927
00:52:34,005 --> 00:52:38,306
and really like to thank everybody that like gets the games and downloads them,

928
00:52:38,326 --> 00:52:41,787
because you're just kind of like sitting in a room doing like this thing because you like

929
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,628
to play it, you know, it's like I want to play that thing.

930
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:50,590
And then all of a sudden, oh, this is really great, it's like, you know, okay, nice to meet you,

931
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,731
I don't know how this happened, but it's kind of cool.

932
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,872
So questions, anybody has questions?

933
00:52:58,752 --> 00:53:02,093
It would be great to hit a microphone so everyone can hear it.

934
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:06,451
So to me, one of the sort of most interesting dynamics in

935
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:12,174
Doom was the variety in sort of enemy attacks and just sort of

936
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:13,134
the timings of them and so on.

937
00:53:13,154 --> 00:53:16,196
I was curious as to kind of where along the process or how

938
00:53:16,256 --> 00:53:18,817
much, did they come out the way you'd planned or was there a lot

939
00:53:18,857 --> 00:53:22,399
of change throughout in terms of like fireball speeds and enemy

940
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:24,600
run speeds and shotgun timing and whatnot?

941
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:28,703
Yeah, everything in the game was totally iterated on like

942
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:29,083
heavily.

943
00:53:29,103 --> 00:53:32,525
So, you know, we made really best first guesses.

944
00:53:33,372 --> 00:53:37,674
The game frame rate, the rendering rate was locked at 35

945
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,256
frames a second, even though it could probably go 70.

946
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:44,218
We made it 35, so the rest of the game would run evenly on

947
00:53:44,238 --> 00:53:44,898
more systems.

948
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:49,121
And we ran the internal AI at 10 frames a second, so we

949
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:52,242
would have a good speed for the enemies.

950
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:54,464
We don't want them coming too fast, because it's just not

951
00:53:54,744 --> 00:53:55,845
very fair or fun.

952
00:53:56,405 --> 00:54:00,787
So we put first guess values in for everything, the damage,

953
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:02,608
how the damage scales on weapons.

954
00:54:03,008 --> 00:54:07,792
the weapon firing rates, how much per second damage that could possibly be, to try and

955
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:12,315
perfectly balance all the weapons so, you know, what you were having to decide was if

956
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:17,119
something's really far away, you want to use not the shotgun, and if something is big,

957
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:21,223
you want to use the rocket launcher, and stuff that's really far away, use the pistol or

958
00:54:21,243 --> 00:54:21,903
the chain gun.

959
00:54:22,604 --> 00:54:27,808
So we did a ton of balancing on that to try and kind of even out the damages and the times

960
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:28,589
that they would fire.

961
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:32,632
And I'd have to say it just felt...

962
00:54:33,032 --> 00:54:38,514
perfect, you know, even years later when we played Deathmatch in other games and come

963
00:54:38,554 --> 00:54:42,516
back to it, it just, it just, we got really lucky balancing all the damage.

964
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:44,416
Thank you.

965
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:46,317
I can't see you over there.

966
00:54:46,337 --> 00:54:48,258
I guess there's a hand over there.

967
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:49,279
Hi.

968
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:50,899
Hi there.

969
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,462
So now that the game is, well the game has been finished for a while and ported for a

970
00:54:56,602 --> 00:54:57,702
lot of systems.

971
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:03,245
Do you guys go back and think that there was any element that you want to change?

972
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:10,348
And also, which port do you think is the best and the most, best representation of the game?

973
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:18,032
I don't have anything that I want to change other than, you know, I would go over the

974
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:20,693
levels probably and just do some more polish on the levels.

975
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:25,155
But they really, they feel great and I think the game is...

976
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,202
I really don't have any, like, I don't look back and go, oh, man, that was really messed

977
00:55:30,282 --> 00:55:30,422
up.

978
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:34,404
Like, you know, with Quake, there was some damages with the rocket launcher I would probably

979
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:34,765
change.

980
00:55:35,345 --> 00:55:36,626
But with Doom, it just seemed right.

981
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:42,610
I guess we've got one more question.

982
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:43,711
Yeah.

983
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:43,991
Hello.

984
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:44,951
I'm Carlos.

985
00:55:45,672 --> 00:55:46,493
First of all, thanks for coming.

986
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:54,598
I recently read Masters of Doom, and it reminded me of kind of like when I was growing up,

987
00:55:55,915 --> 00:55:58,216
people had with John Romero, like, you know, someone who was very excited, very passionate

988
00:55:58,236 --> 00:56:02,818
about what he was doing. One of the things that I thought about was how you guys always

989
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:06,819
wanted to make like the best games around you. You wanted to compete with the greatest

990
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,980
and you wanted to break new ground and, you know, make the, you know, use like CarMax

991
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,802
technology and apply it in design in ways that nobody had seen before. And you then,

992
00:56:15,162 --> 00:56:20,724
when you disagree with, I think, I saw a YouTube interview with Matt, like Matt Chat.

993
00:56:20,764 --> 00:56:21,424
Matt Chat, yeah.

994
00:56:22,682 --> 00:56:25,644
you say you disagree with some of the decisions that were made in Quake and you ended up,

995
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:29,267
you know, doing your own thing and you still wanted to, you know, make your own, you know,

996
00:56:29,407 --> 00:56:31,869
great first-person shooter in your vision of it.

997
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,951
Right. So as a creator,

998
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:39,934
what made you transition from, you know, that passion towards, say,

999
00:56:39,955 --> 00:56:44,318
AAA games, towards a different focus now, towards, say, social space?

1000
00:56:45,478 --> 00:56:45,839
Well, I...

1001
00:56:46,898 --> 00:56:50,499
played deathmatch like constantly for years and love

1002
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,719
deathmatch. I really deathmatch is like one of the most fun

1003
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,040
ways to play a game for me. But nowadays going into the into

1004
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,221
the latest games are not they don't feel the same way. They

1005
00:57:03,261 --> 00:57:05,822
feel like I feel like I'm going slower through the world. And I

1006
00:57:05,862 --> 00:57:09,222
really like the doom and quake speeds of the player run. It

1007
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:12,443
felt like they're more skill based than, you know, like,

1008
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:14,383
then then just like aiming.

1009
00:57:14,837 --> 00:57:19,719
at somebody with a rail gun, not as much fun for me.

1010
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:23,900
And as a designer, it's way more challenging

1011
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,621
to make a game that hundreds of millions of people

1012
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:29,142
will like, like say social games.

1013
00:57:29,222 --> 00:57:31,903
It's much more of a challenge to try and get back

1014
00:57:31,983 --> 00:57:35,884
to the roots of what's fun and to make it palatable

1015
00:57:35,904 --> 00:57:37,005
to way more people.

1016
00:57:38,065 --> 00:57:41,546
So I still have some really great ideas

1017
00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:43,067
for some shooters that I'd like to make,

1018
00:57:43,787 --> 00:57:44,327
but right now.

1019
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:49,570
You know, I've moved through, we've both moved through a lot of different kinds of designs

1020
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:53,212
in our careers and it's fun to touch a lot of different areas.

1021
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:58,116
Well, I think John's genius is seeing the next thing

1022
00:57:58,656 --> 00:58:02,419
and perhaps the timing has been off occasionally, but when Carmack

1023
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:08,103
and I made a joke first level of Super Mario and left it on John's desk,

1024
00:58:08,743 --> 00:58:11,105
he closed the door when we came in after, you know,

1025
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:13,006
crashing and stuff and he said, we are out of here.

1026
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:14,699
He knew it.

1027
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:15,899
They said, this is it.

1028
00:58:15,979 --> 00:58:16,659
We're out of here.

1029
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:17,019
Boom.

1030
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:18,300
This is a success.

1031
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,220
The scrolling?

1032
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,220
And yeah, with the tile scrolling stuff.

1033
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:24,701
And when we did Monkeystone together,

1034
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:26,522
it's like it was a very early cell thing.

1035
00:58:26,542 --> 00:58:29,043
The cell carriers didn't really have it together as far as games,

1036
00:58:29,463 --> 00:58:32,984
but that's the biggest thing now is mobile games and stuff.

1037
00:58:33,004 --> 00:58:35,124
So it was brilliant a little early on that one.

1038
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:38,385
And now it's striking the forefront again with social games

1039
00:58:38,465 --> 00:58:41,086
and sharing it with Brenda, the brilliant Brenda.

1040
00:58:42,906 --> 00:58:43,126
Thank you.

1041
00:58:43,974 --> 00:58:45,601
Thanks, I think that's it for questions

1042
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,269
because we have to run to another talk.

1043
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:48,616
Yes, thanks everybody.
