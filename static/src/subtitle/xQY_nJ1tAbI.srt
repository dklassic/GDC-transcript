1
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:09,813
Welcome to Creating Dr. Grobort's Invaders for Magic Leap 1. Uh, I'm James. I've been

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:14,275
doing a lot of weird stuff in my career, but this one was definitely the weirdest. I started

3
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:19,417
a long time ago making PC games from four months on the Lift Tech Engine, uh, which

4
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,678
were interesting, uh, worked on, do you remember what this is?

5
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:29,894
Yeah, there we go. A few people remember the N-Gage. We did a big tactical RPG for the N-Gage

6
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:35,143
shortly before the platform went away. Worked on PlayStation 2 era and GameCube and Xbox

7
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:37,586
stuff in Montreal with some really lovely folks.

8
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:44,836
Went down to New Zealand the first time and did a couple more Xbox and PlayStation games

9
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:49,620
down there and even did a game for the iPhone 3GS, which was new and shiny at the time when

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,043
mobile games were a thing that was just like, what is this?

11
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:53,723
How does this work?

12
00:00:55,884 --> 00:01:02,466
Shipped a bunch of stuff in the Xbox 360 PS3 era, and then was offered an interesting opportunity

13
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:03,906
to go back to New Zealand.

14
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:07,008
I'd gone back to Canada, was living in Toronto, working with Ubisoft up there.

15
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:13,530
We did Splinter Cell Blacklist, which was a pretty exciting project, and was invited

16
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,830
back to New Zealand to work on something that was new and shiny.

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,271
And it didn't look like this at the time.

18
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:21,154
To be fair, this was a few years before the form factor was really finalized.

19
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:26,639
So I went to New Zealand to work with the crew on a really exciting game for the Magic

20
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:28,941
Leap 1, which shipped last August.

21
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:36,367
So the Magic Leap, just I'm sure everybody's kind of aware, but they're a spatial computing

22
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:37,248
company from Florida.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,064
We've got offices now everywhere from Zurich to Tel Aviv to Austin to Wellington, New Zealand.

24
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:53,452
And we've just launched the first round of the hardware in August last year, and it's been been really exciting to see what happens.

25
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:58,775
And we work out of Weta Workshop. Our crew is in Wellington, New Zealand.

26
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:04,459
And Workshop is a physical, award-winning physical effects and props company.

27
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:09,262
So if you've seen anything like all the Lord of the Rings films, and the Hobbit films,

28
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:11,543
all of the armor and the swords and everything that came out of that,

29
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:17,427
District 9, the guns from that and the mech suits, Kong, all kinds of films.

30
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:19,968
Workshop makes really incredible stuff.

31
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,713
And so it was sort of a strange thing to have a physical props company making a video game.

32
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:32,016
So we work out of a new studio that we call Weta Game Shop, which is just down the road

33
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:34,998
from the main workshop because we sort of outgrew our space there and we needed to go

34
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:35,339
somewhere.

35
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,903
And it's fairly typical as game studios go, you know, you've got desks and those sorts

36
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:41,243
of things.

37
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:42,784
What isn't typical about the space?

38
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:46,727
is that we have one area that is a testing,

39
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,109
we have two testing areas,

40
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:50,771
one of which has got movable walls and furniture,

41
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,513
a bunch of cubes,

42
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:54,474
really nice to be attached to a props company,

43
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:55,755
they can make us all kinds of fun stuff.

44
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,937
And so we can reconfigure our spaces

45
00:02:57,997 --> 00:03:00,460
to try and experiment with the different ways

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,422
that people's homes and offices might be set up.

47
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:07,011
We have a more locked down, kind of full-on testing space.

48
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:10,795
And then, of course, our areas for hardware storage and

49
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:11,396
things like that.

50
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:13,358
But otherwise, it's kind of what you'd expect

51
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:14,138
from a game studio.

52
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,886
So just to clarify a couple of things.

53
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:23,508
So spatial computing, what do I mean by that?

54
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:26,545
So we're all on the same page.

55
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:30,726
VR is something that, it's a completely digital environment, right?

56
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,486
It shuts out the real world and it takes you to a whole different place.

57
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,347
It's amazing for immersion into whole other worlds.

58
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:42,288
Augmented reality sort of knows about, it's geospatially aware usually, it knows about

59
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:45,749
the world and it can tell you some information about what's around you, but it doesn't actually

60
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:46,809
integrate with the world.

61
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,790
Spatial computing and mixed reality really does, it's digital content that interacts

62
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,610
with your real world.

63
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:57,370
Um, and that is where lots of the excitement came from me,

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,071
was how are we gonna put games into your house,

65
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,252
into your office, into the spaces around you,

66
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:04,713
and interact with them in a meaningful way.

67
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:08,895
So, the first game that, uh, we've made, uh,

68
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:11,036
is Dr. Grubort's Invaders.

69
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:14,198
Um, it's a fairly large-scale experience.

70
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:16,119
It's a long-form, uh, action game,

71
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,840
uh, which is, uh, kind of unusual for this space.

72
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,041
I'll show you a quick clip from the trailer

73
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,862
rather than the full trailer, but you'll get a sense of it.

74
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,613
The trailer itself is actually a lot of fun, but it's a little bit long for the presentation,

75
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,173
so I recommend you check that out on YouTube.

76
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,134
So how did we get to this?

77
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:44,795
How did we get to that experience?

78
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:48,676
Long and winding road, it turns out.

79
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:49,956
We had to build a team.

80
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:53,777
As I say, Weta Workshop didn't have a games team prior to this happening, right?

81
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,318
This is a new thing for them.

82
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,719
They tend to make physical products, not digital products.

83
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,599
And so...

84
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,933
It actually worked out really well for us because we're making digital things that go

85
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:09,015
in the real world, so there's still that sense of, this is a thing that I need to be able

86
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:09,615
to interact with.

87
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:10,776
It needs to feel real.

88
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:14,538
So you take a bunch of people who are really amazing at making physical stuff that feels

89
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,759
real but shouldn't actually exist in the world.

90
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,222
Like if you pick up a Weta Workshop Ray Gun and you turn it over, you'll notice that there's

91
00:05:21,262 --> 00:05:22,523
a serial number on one side.

92
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:25,806
There's details built into every aspect of everything that they do.

93
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:30,770
And it's that attention to detail that companies keep coming to them for again and again and

94
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,010
again.

95
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,814
We had to build a game, which as you all know is, you know, real easy, right?

96
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:36,715
No?

97
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:40,698
So we had to build a team, we had to build a game, and we had to help Magic Leap build

98
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:41,278
a platform.

99
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,340
So you know.

100
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:44,981
No pressure.

101
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:47,263
And we stacked all these things together.

102
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:52,667
And it was a very interesting, very exciting challenge, which is why I signed on.

103
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:58,372
What was really important for us was that Magic Leap did recognize games as foundational

104
00:05:58,412 --> 00:05:59,332
to the platform, right?

105
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:05,737
So our colleagues at Magic Leap Studios in Florida made some really wonderful experiences.

106
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:10,481
Project Create is a really beautiful sandbox that lets you do all kinds of fun stuff.

107
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:14,923
I highly recommend letting some knights fight it out before you drop a T-Rex on them.

108
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:21,165
And Tenandi, which is a collaboration with Sigurd Ross, that is a beautiful music...

109
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,926
It's like living in a music video from an alien planet.

110
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:27,587
Check it out.

111
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,068
And of course us and Invaders, and lots of other partners have come along for the ride

112
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:32,528
and built lots of other cool things as well.

113
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:37,350
And really, what's important to note about this is that...

114
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:41,939
There are going to be lots and lots of people coming to this platform, right?

115
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,809
Mixed reality and spatial computing, as I'm firmly convinced, is the future of this stuff.

116
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,604
And it's gonna be used by everyone everywhere.

117
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,705
But at the moment, the only people in the world

118
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:57,208
who actually know how to build stuff for this new medium

119
00:06:57,308 --> 00:06:58,088
are game developers.

120
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,770
We're the only people who do real-time, 3D,

121
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,571
interactive content.

122
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:06,734
And it's going to happen very, very quickly

123
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:09,336
when as all of these folks start to go,

124
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:11,978
we need to be in this space and using this stuff,

125
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:13,499
you're gonna start to get approached

126
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,939
by all kinds of interesting people.

127
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,241
So I encourage you to please welcome them with open arms

128
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,002
because we've got so much to share with them.

129
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:25,276
Um, so as I said, we were helping them build this platform.

130
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:30,062
Um, the purpose of the team really was to be the end point from hardware,

131
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:31,904
software, operating system.

132
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:35,067
As everything came together, we were there at the end to go, cool,

133
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:36,749
we're going to use this and break it.

134
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,811
And then we will provide you with feedback.

135
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:43,655
So to do that we used the absolute latest of everything.

136
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:48,557
I'm on the big bench there, which was like literally you were locked into position so

137
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:50,257
you could make sure that everything was visible.

138
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,739
Eventually some stuff made it to a hard hat at one point.

139
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:58,661
Then to what we called the wearable device three, which Jake is wearing down there with

140
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:02,442
the big handles on the side, which you'd often be kind of balancing because you had to strap

141
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,363
the thing on yourself and then crank down.

142
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:10,485
It sounded a little bit like a medieval torture device when you put it on somebody because the way that you cranked it, it just went click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

143
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,806
And it was, um, trying not to squeeze it too tight.

144
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,127
Um, and Joe's hanging out there with one of the early PEQs.

145
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:24,569
Um, so whether it was the SDK or anything else, it was really quite interesting to constantly have this stuff.

146
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:30,191
Also, the conversations you get to have with customs as you come back hand-carrying one of these prototypes, uh, through the airport.

147
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:31,191
Um.

148
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:34,205
So we were in this constant feedback loop.

149
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:38,668
And we would fly over to Florida several times a year.

150
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,249
We would spend time with all of those different teams

151
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,211
and explain to them what we were trying to do,

152
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:47,653
where we were breaking stuff, what we were excited about,

153
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:50,094
and what opportunities we saw so that we could help them

154
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:51,595
steer their efforts as well.

155
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:54,777
And one of the big things that we had to do there

156
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:57,578
was to learn the language and the goals of these other teams.

157
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm not an electrical engineer.

158
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,260
I am not a...

159
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:08,323
A interface designer who's worried about how the very first experience of like opening

160
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:09,083
the box works.

161
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:10,243
All of those other things.

162
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:14,104
So we had to learn their language as much as we could so that we were able to communicate

163
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:15,124
more effectively with them.

164
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:21,186
And one of the things that I think helped us a lot in doing that and being involved

165
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,587
in that process was showing up with something fun.

166
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:27,928
This is one of the early Magic Leap offices.

167
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:30,748
Oh, sorry.

168
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:32,028
Um...

169
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,182
And this was one of our earlier demos on the WD3.

170
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:42,323
And we set up the whiteboard you can see over there.

171
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:44,244
And people just wrote their names down to come and get a

172
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:44,924
demo with us.

173
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,205
That board was full for five days.

174
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,966
Everyone came to play.

175
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:53,028
One of my favorite experiences I've ever had as a game

176
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:57,330
developer was an electrical engineer who spent all of his

177
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,431
days working on low-level circuit board stuff that I do

178
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:01,511
not understand at all.

179
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:02,852
Who doesn't play games?

180
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,333
who just knew that he had one of the world's most interesting problems to go and solve,

181
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:10,196
and he was just curious what the heck we'd actually been up to.

182
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:11,798
So he came over to play.

183
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:15,743
He had a giant grin on his face the entire time he played.

184
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:16,805
He kept laughing.

185
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:19,368
When he took the device off, he looked at me and said,

186
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,830
how did you do that?

187
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,075
I just said, well, with the thing you made, dude.

188
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,517
And he was just ecstatic.

189
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:27,418
He was over the moon.

190
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:29,619
And I saw him for the rest of the week,

191
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,580
and he was walking on air.

192
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,022
Because he didn't have that opportunity

193
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:36,064
to see the end result of all of his hard work,

194
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,545
to see it all come together.

195
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:40,227
And that's one of the beauties of what we do in games, right?

196
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,069
Is that we take all of this hard work

197
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:43,670
by all these other people, and then we distill it down

198
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,211
and make something exciting.

199
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,934
So that was always really wonderful

200
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:50,255
to be able to go over and share those things.

201
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:54,018
So Dr. Robots Invaders is an action game.

202
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,661
And to make this game, we wanted to make sure

203
00:10:57,681 --> 00:11:00,063
that everybody could play it, because we didn't really

204
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:02,025
know for sure who the audience was going to be, right?

205
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:04,547
We were fairly confident there would be fellow developers,

206
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:06,508
some of whom would be game developers,

207
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,570
but many of whom would be application developers,

208
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,152
enterprise developers, those sorts of things.

209
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:13,434
So we weren't, you know, and it's a brand new medium.

210
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,696
So we don't have a lot of conventions to go by.

211
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:22,356
Historically, action games have been used on, you know, input devices like this.

212
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:23,516
Lots of buttons.

213
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:28,017
I think the dual analog stick control thing is amazing.

214
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:29,678
I mean, I worked on Splinter Cell for a while.

215
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:34,159
If you want to see my 2014 talk all about how those systems are tuned down to a nutshell, go for it.

216
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:39,561
But for a lot of people, that's a very intimidating input system to approach.

217
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:40,421
So.

218
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,945
What we use instead for Magic Leap One is the control and gesture.

219
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,268
So control is a six-off control.

220
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:53,314
It's tracked by the device, no external lighthouses or anything required to see what's there.

221
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:59,221
It's got a touchpad on the top, an analog trigger, bumper button, and the home button there.

222
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:01,549
It's basically like your start or pause button.

223
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:02,930
And gesture.

224
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,931
And the device can recognize left and right hand,

225
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,353
and about eight or 10 gestures at this point,

226
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,634
with more being added all the time.

227
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:13,738
And so for us, our mandate right from the beginning

228
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:15,459
from Greg Broadmore, our creative director,

229
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:18,341
was make sure that it's a two-button game.

230
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:22,044
So trigger for something, the thumb button

231
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:23,485
for something else, trigger obviously.

232
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:24,666
Well, we'll get to that in a second.

233
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:25,286
That's pretty obvious.

234
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:26,187
And the hand.

235
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:28,309
So simplify this whole thing down.

236
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:33,066
And this was really, once we wrapped up,

237
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:36,569
this was really exciting for me as well,

238
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:39,312
because my mom has never played my games.

239
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:41,954
My dad's never played my games.

240
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:45,557
They appreciate what I do, and they

241
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:47,960
like that I'm happy doing it, but they don't play them.

242
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:50,642
Well, that's a shield.

243
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:51,723
Oh, that would be awesome.

244
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,185
I mean, where is that hole in my couch?

245
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:00,981
Holy shoot! You girls gotta put this on!

246
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,427
That was one of the coolest things that ever happened to me.

247
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:09,788
My mom got to play my game and had a good time.

248
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:11,408
And that was pretty special.

249
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:14,689
So I feel like we kind of checked a box

250
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:15,909
on the everybody can play button,

251
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,170
or list, whatever that is.

252
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,891
So the game itself starts with these ray guns.

253
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:23,071
Ray guns are the heart of the Dr. Gordbort's IP.

254
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:27,912
Greg, who created it a little over 10 years ago,

255
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,273
started off with just some paintings of ray guns.

256
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:35,029
And then they started making physical ray guns and then comic books and a lot of other

257
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,350
things that have come along since.

258
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:42,153
And so we wanted to, that's really where we started with, and so we wanted to make sure

259
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:42,894
you could get it.

260
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:43,434
A ray gun?

261
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:44,515
Cool, right?

262
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:46,236
Also quite dangerous.

263
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:47,797
Probably should sign a waiver.

264
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:54,154
And the nice thing about ray guns is that once you, that's Gimbal, once he hands you

265
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:57,615
that ray gun, now it's in your hand, attached to the control, being tracked accurately.

266
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:02,196
And the thing with the ray gun is that we've made the game, at its heart, it's quite simple.

267
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,617
You are under attack and you have a solution to the problem.

268
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:13,830
Everybody kind of understands what to do very, very quickly.

269
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:16,513
The game has a lot more depth to it as you get further into it,

270
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:19,036
but at the very heart of it, at that initial experience,

271
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,439
it's really like, what is this thing in my hand?

272
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:22,400
What is that?

273
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,141
Oh, no.

274
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:23,881
OK.

275
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,805
And the time to solve is pretty quick.

276
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:33,159
One thing I'll mention is when people get their first virtual object in their hand,

277
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:38,061
or the first time they can actually experience a virtual object in the real world, in mixed reality,

278
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:40,621
give them time to appreciate that thing.

279
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:45,663
As I mentioned, you know, we... Workshop is really about details.

280
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:54,344
Excuse me. Um, and so we had like a variety of skins, for example, for the ray guns and

281
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:59,426
stuff. Each one of these things has got so much detail and texture to it. Um, and you'll

282
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:02,447
see the very first time someone gets a hold of a ray gun, they sit there and they just

283
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:07,829
go like, what is, okay, this is a thing. There are bits on it moving, there are dials, there

284
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:11,431
are bobs. When you fire it, it almost feels dangerous because the whole thing kind of

285
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:12,951
vibrates and shakes. The effects are great.

286
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:16,977
So yeah, give people a chance to look at stuff.

287
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,918
Also, players will just like, they'll put their head in stuff.

288
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,719
So you can't control that, right?

289
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,241
So make sure that you sort of consider your virtual content

290
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:29,362
in a way that you don't get that,

291
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:30,442
because that's really disturbing.

292
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,143
What we came up with, James Brown,

293
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:35,964
one of our graphics programmers, did this really wonderful.

294
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,256
Um, technique of an, what we call an outline shader.

295
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,577
The device has a clip plane sitting at 37 centimeters.

296
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,578
So it's just out from your face.

297
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:49,139
Um, and that's to avoid, uh, virgin's accommodation conflict, right?

298
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,740
So we, we can render content 37 centimeters all the way out to

299
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,601
infinity, multiple depth planes.

300
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,342
So stuff feels like it's in exactly the right place.

301
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:59,203
Your eyes naturally adjust to it.

302
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,003
It's great.

303
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:04,765
But we want to make sure that if you bring something in too close, it's doesn't.

304
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:11,288
hurt basically. So one way around this for us, for all of our content, was we used this

305
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:15,250
sort of outline shader to make sure that at that clip point you weren't getting things

306
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:22,893
like the backs of people's eyeballs. Another thing we found was that putting UI on a raygun

307
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:27,015
didn't actually work out great. When people are playing.

308
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,553
They're really looking out here because of, and this is going to be different, of course,

309
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:32,974
for every experience that you make.

310
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:37,598
But in our case, when we were playing a shooting game, where there's objects out at a distance

311
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:41,101
that you need to target, people are looking at that and they're doing this and they're

312
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:41,922
going, blam, blam, blam.

313
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:43,891
with the ray gun.

314
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:46,553
And so we thought, well, hey, this object's

315
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:47,454
going to be in field of view.

316
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,634
They'll see it kind of regularly.

317
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:50,155
We can tell them about stuff.

318
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:52,957
So at one point, we actually had like a health system

319
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:54,938
that was like a three hits sort of system.

320
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:56,979
And we put these like heart bulbs on the back.

321
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,021
Reality is, everybody looks past that object.

322
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,782
And occasionally, they use it to aim a little bit.

323
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,823
But often, of course, if you try and do

324
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:08,206
this for any length of time, you get this and then this.

325
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,507
And it gets quite tiring very quickly.

326
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:15,606
So, um, uh, what we found was that people don't actually, after they're done examining the object,

327
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:19,749
it's become a real thing to them and they don't, you know, object permanence kicks in.

328
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,591
They don't need to look at it all the time. They're like, cool, I got this.

329
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:25,733
Um, so yeah, having stuff directly on the control.

330
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:30,017
If you had an up close experience, I think, where you're doing sort of something fine on a table or whatever,

331
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:33,479
uh, that might work, but for us, we found it wasn't super helpful.

332
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,655
So with all of these ray guns, where we ended up, we experimented a lot.

333
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:43,137
We had these dispensers, for example, that sat in your room and you had to stick your

334
00:17:43,157 --> 00:17:46,439
hand in them to get ammo out of them and a bunch of other things.

335
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:49,080
We had Shake to reload.

336
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,622
And what we found generally was the more complexity we put outside of the player's experience,

337
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,583
the harder it was for people to understand.

338
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:01,588
A dispenser seems like a really cool idea hanging out, but remember you're in the real

339
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:01,928
world.

340
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,849
So now I'm taking up real estate that could be occupied by a robot or some other gameplay

341
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:06,249
object.

342
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,290
So it was like, what if I don't have a good place to put that?

343
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,110
And all of the complications that come out of that.

344
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:16,852
So where we ended up with it was actually putting the variety inside of different classes

345
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:17,352
of ray gun.

346
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:21,413
So we had heat ray guns that, you know, melted things and burned the armor off.

347
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:24,533
We had force ray guns which shattered things and pushed them around.

348
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,514
And then we had the grappling hook which allowed you to.

349
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:35,968
And all of these ray guns sort of, over time, the player learns how to use them through

350
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:41,656
the different missions and you get this different kinds of challenges inside of the caverns

351
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:42,458
I'll talk about in a minute.

352
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:47,864
But generally speaking, what we found was keeping things in the player's hand, keeping

353
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:52,626
stuff, you know, centered on the player was generally better than trying to externalize

354
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:55,587
it in an action experience.

355
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:59,829
But there are times, which I'll get to in a second, where we externalize stuff because

356
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:03,790
we're in a much quieter environment, or more gentle environment.

357
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,331
But if we give you three of these things, how do you use them?

358
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:09,592
How do you get a hold of them?

359
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,713
We came up with what we call a tool bangle.

360
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:19,063
Which basically, as soon as you touch the top of the trackpad there, it pops out these three,

361
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:25,045
each of the classes of tool that you've got, and then you just swipe your hand through it,

362
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,566
or just tilt even in that direction, and it very quickly just swaps over to that.

363
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,454
People get into that rhythm quite quickly,

364
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:36,275
because it's always heat, grapple, force.

365
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,236
So people very quickly get into this rhythm

366
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:39,516
where they're just like, oh, I need my force.

367
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:41,717
And they just flick their wrist, and the next thing

368
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:42,497
they know, they've got it.

369
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:43,358
Works really well.

370
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:46,499
So we're in this strange new world.

371
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:47,599
We're in mixed reality.

372
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,360
We're throwing robots at the player and everything else.

373
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,921
So how are we going to teach the player

374
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:56,863
how to learn about this space and enjoy it quickly?

375
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,608
One of our primary ways was Gimble, and Gimble is a companion character who features very,

376
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,490
very heavily throughout the game.

377
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:09,673
He's a companion.

378
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:10,755
Oh, cool!

379
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,437
You must be my human.

380
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:14,420
You look so... lifelike.

381
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:20,662
Um, and just having a friend there is really quite, someone who just addresses you directly

382
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:24,405
and is able to, you know, be nice about what's going on around you.

383
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:25,126
Very helpful.

384
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:29,929
Um, he was, uh, he's also the kind of the core protagonist of the story and the story

385
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:30,069
teller.

386
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:30,329
I'm Gimbal.

387
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:30,550
I'm Gimbal.

388
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:30,770
I'm Gimbal.

389
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:30,990
I'm Gimbal.

390
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,210
I'm Gimbal.

391
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,430
I'm Gimbal.

392
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:31,690
I'm Gimbal.

393
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:31,911
I'm Gimbal.

394
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:32,131
I'm Gimbal.

395
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:32,351
I'm Gimbal.

396
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:32,571
I'm Gimbal.

397
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:32,791
I'm Gimbal.

398
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:33,031
I'm Gimbal.

399
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:33,292
I'm Gimbal.

400
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:36,276
Nice to meet you!

401
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:38,516
An introduction is in order.

402
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:47,719
I am Dr. Grodbort, and I am broadcasting to you from my headquarters at the Dr. Grodbort's factory.

403
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,240
So Gimble was able to bring all the human characters in the world through a holographic projection.

404
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,194
We did some fun stuff with these guys.

405
00:20:56,815 --> 00:20:59,239
They will look at the player, so they'll head track to you.

406
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,327
There's a few moments where Dr. G will point at you, for example, and he points directly at you.

407
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:05,269
And those are really...

408
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:08,849
kind of spooky moments where you're staying there and this character just looks at you

409
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,731
and you're like, okay, hi, all right, we're here now.

410
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:15,995
Couple of little tricks you can get away with when you're using holographic projection.

411
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:19,698
If you keep walking around him to a point where he can't look at you anymore, he'll

412
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:22,800
just sort of flicker and reorient because that way you don't have to do a bunch of footsteps,

413
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:24,641
which was quite helpful.

414
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:29,045
And it meant that we could kind of pick good spots for him no matter what.

415
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,023
The other valuable thing that we found was, you can see from Gimbal there, the projections

416
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,544
coming off of the ring on his neck.

417
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:42,466
That means that when Gimbal starts projecting, you can sort of immediately tell where that

418
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:44,387
character is going to be and follow to it.

419
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:47,807
And he's your guide.

420
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:51,730
So obviously, you've got a limited field of view.

421
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,332
It's fairly large, but it's still limited.

422
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:57,494
And because we're introducing objects to the world

423
00:21:57,535 --> 00:21:58,816
that were not there previously,

424
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:01,037
how are you supposed to know that this thing's behind you?

425
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:04,120
Well, audio cues help a lot, but we need to get you there.

426
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,941
So one of the things that Gimbal does,

427
00:22:07,022 --> 00:22:10,505
it's super valuable, is he'll gesture at a thing,

428
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:11,886
look at it, move to it,

429
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,547
and you naturally just follow him there.

430
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:18,733
And he was also a teacher, so this is explaining,

431
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:21,675
like, Gimbal is throwing a wrench at you

432
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:23,576
so that you understand what pain is.

433
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:26,337
And the way that we communicated pain to the player

434
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:28,718
was the, or that they were taking damage

435
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:31,400
was all virtual content would go red for a second.

436
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,881
The world would actually slow down.

437
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:36,062
That's a really, really valuable tool you've got access to.

438
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,023
When the whole world is moving at normal speed,

439
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:40,224
but suddenly game time changes,

440
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:42,766
people notice that very, very quickly.

441
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:44,506
It's super, super effective.

442
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,885
Um, and then, uh, through he'll do an animation to explain to you how to put

443
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:54,389
your hand up, see your hand up, see your shield, um, and now you blocked it.

444
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,530
So.

445
00:22:56,805 --> 00:23:02,909
And finally, also really helpful, the character when you're in combat and he hides out in

446
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:07,051
his hidey hole and he calls out where the threats are coming from to help you orient

447
00:23:07,071 --> 00:23:07,411
yourself.

448
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:13,675
Yesterday, my colleague Jordan did a great talk at the GDC AI Summit and so if you want

449
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:18,358
to know more about Gimbal, definitely dive into that one, it'll be on the vault afterwards.

450
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:24,042
So we've got people moving around, we've started to show them where stuff is, we're guiding

451
00:23:24,062 --> 00:23:24,982
them through this space.

452
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:30,912
with a companion, but you're still standing and you're doing all this stuff.

453
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:35,637
So our core game loop actually incorporate quite a lot of breaks in it to give

454
00:23:35,717 --> 00:23:36,879
players a chance to rest.

455
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,324
And we loop between two kind of main spaces, what we call home base.

456
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:48,648
Which is where players have this map of the robot planet that allows them to select missions

457
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,689
and they can buy ray guns and do other things like that.

458
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,273
It's also where we deliver story content, so that projection of Dr. Gorburt for example.

459
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:59,837
Those are always moments where the player is operating at their own pace and they can

460
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:03,060
be kind of calm about things and take a moment to investigate stuff.

461
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:07,915
When you go into missions, now you're fighting robots, you're collecting gubbins, which are

462
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:12,517
the currency in the game, and you're destroying these big caverns and things like that.

463
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:17,579
And what we found was that, generally speaking, in the mission space, we put players in there

464
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,000
for about two to five minutes.

465
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,441
Any more than that, you're moving around and it can get quite tiring to do that.

466
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:29,324
And so we, and it's also just like, stuff is in your face and trying to kill you.

467
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:31,067
You need a break.

468
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:34,369
So we come back into home base, and you spend as much time

469
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,269
as you want to there.

470
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,930
And what we tried to get to was a point where players felt

471
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,012
that rhythm, and they knew that whenever they came back

472
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,452
to home base, they can take a break.

473
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,973
And they can step back, and maybe they'll come back

474
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:48,154
tomorrow, or later in the day, or something like that, after

475
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:49,875
they've played for half an hour, or whatever it is.

476
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,456
Because movement just can be tiring.

477
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:57,317
Not all of us are like our animator Jake.

478
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,081
Sorry, when I saw that I just had to throw it in.

479
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:04,642
It's just they were going to do a mocap test,

480
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:05,643
and I was like, really?

481
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:06,044
OK.

482
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,927
One of the things that we also, again,

483
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,029
we're trying to make a game for everyone,

484
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,132
we did a lot of work around accessibility

485
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:17,153
for our second update.

486
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:20,076
This is a very difficult space.

487
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:22,798
This is because, as with everything in mixed reality,

488
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:23,839
this is new, right?

489
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,120
And so.

490
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:30,910
We were trying to get into, just think about the different ways that players could interact

491
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,691
with the content.

492
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,038
So for example, shield is on your left hand, or on your off hand actually, so you can play

493
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,239
left or right handed, doesn't matter.

494
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:44,405
So we added in our second update, we added the ability to put the shield on the bumper

495
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:46,787
so you could play with one hand if for some reason the other one...

496
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:51,974
was not being detected well or you had an injury or for any other reason.

497
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:54,257
We put an aim beam in there.

498
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:58,322
Generally speaking, the visual effects guide the player's shots really well,

499
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:01,306
but if you're having difficulty with depth, that will help.

500
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:02,607
Aim assist.

501
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:07,247
Um, which allows you to interact with objects at a distance.

502
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:12,549
So the robot planet has moments where you're plugging things in and grabbing stuff.

503
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:16,170
But this lets you kind of step through those things, even if you can't quite reach that.

504
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:22,072
Um, invincibility, um, was, and, uh, the ability to skip mission parts.

505
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:25,113
It's like people are there to see what's in this experience.

506
00:26:25,153 --> 00:26:25,333
It's a.

507
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:30,438
It's, I keep saying this, but it's new, right? So, um, we want you to be able to see all of it.

508
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:35,183
Um, there's no reason not to. So why not? The other nice thing about invincibility is a great

509
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:39,226
way to stop and look at the art. Also pause the game because the game content doesn't disappear.

510
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:44,171
So if you want to take a walk around a robot, just pause the game. Um, and subtitles. And we're

511
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:49,577
pretty excited about this one. I had my doubts, but they assured me you were the one for the job.

512
00:26:53,097 --> 00:27:00,363
Sorry about that. The video capture unfortunately cuts off the side, but the way that our subtitle system works is that it pins itself to the speaker.

513
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:06,449
If you look away from them, it drags to the corner of your field of view, but it's still quite legible.

514
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:12,294
And it biases towards the side that the speaker is closest to, and as you look back, it comes back to them.

515
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:17,260
It scales depending on distance.

516
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,146
I think the steps after this would be being able to dynamically scale the font and a few

517
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,948
other things that are kind of new standards.

518
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:28,833
But I feel like these were good first steps, and I'm excited to see what other people get

519
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:29,053
up to.

520
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:31,416
And of course, it's all quite experience-dependent.

521
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,873
So how do we get all this stuff in the real world?

522
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:39,115
One of the first big challenges is figuring out

523
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:39,936
where to put stuff.

524
00:27:40,636 --> 00:27:43,999
So at the beginning of the game, the first time you play.

525
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:49,978
If we don't recognize the space immediately, because once we've got a scan of the space

526
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:52,339
and we know where it is, we can just recall that and bring it back up.

527
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,921
But if we don't, we have this scanning experience.

528
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:59,224
So a player walks around, you can see this shader, and it fills in in a really interesting

529
00:27:59,264 --> 00:27:59,404
way.

530
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,646
It feels like you want to try and cover the whole space in this funky stuff.

531
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:06,749
We've got these buttons in the space that just float and hang around, and as you walk

532
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,612
around and press them, they're there to encourage players to walk around and get a better scan.

533
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:17,373
And so you can kind of, it also helps you understand, ah, this is the space that the

534
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,074
game currently understands.

535
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:23,438
And so it hopefully encourages people to do a fairly robust scan.

536
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:29,763
Once we've got that, then we use a world search to figure out where to put stuff.

537
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:34,847
So this is us just moving the colliders there, the player, and so we're just moving the player

538
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,229
around and trying to figure out, okay, that's where the stand can go.

539
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,392
Control's trying to be, okay, I need to be about here to the player.

540
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:44,234
You can't quite see it, but there's stuff on the walls that's moving around.

541
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:47,295
Of course, the player would never see this, but in debug we kind of go,

542
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:48,796
all right, where is stuff going to fit?

543
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:52,178
So once we've figured out where we're going to put stuff,

544
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:54,339
we need people to be able to find it.

545
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:57,941
One of our primary tools was what we call a glint system.

546
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,102
So you can see that those waves kind of pulling off to the side.

547
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:05,284
At any given time, there's really one thing that we want the player to be looking at,

548
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:07,806
and we just have a priority system which sorts that.

549
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,928
And so these glints sit in the corner of the field of view and just draw your eye to it.

550
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,008
It's quite subtle.

551
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:16,510
It's not as – it's more subtle than getting out of this in-editor capture.

552
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,592
But we found that that was really valuable and it extended into a few other parts of

553
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:22,192
the gameplay.

554
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:27,675
Gimbal, of course, as I previously mentioned, will always go, hey, things are over here.

555
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:30,936
Wait until seen.

556
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:32,177
So the look-ats were really great.

557
00:29:32,257 --> 00:29:32,657
Basically – oh, sorry.

558
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:32,797
Yeah.

559
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,418
It was great.

560
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,058
Thank you.

561
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:36,679
Thank you.

562
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:36,999
Thank you.

563
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:37,700
Thank you.

564
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,020
Thank you.

565
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:46,520
So that's an example of objects waiting until the player looks at them before they activate.

566
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,142
So we could have all these great animations of like portals opening and all this other

567
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:50,963
cool stuff going on.

568
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:54,325
But if a player never sees it, well that's a bummer.

569
00:29:55,346 --> 00:29:59,910
And it doesn't, you know, it doesn't sell the fantasy as much.

570
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,633
So what we would do is leave, for example, in the case of the porthole being closed there,

571
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:07,295
we would leave a glint on it and the porthole had a closed state.

572
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:09,977
And you'd be kind of looking around going like, oh is that, oh what's that?

573
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:10,557
And then it would.

574
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,101
And we did that with lots of different objects so that players were always sort of aware

575
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:19,162
that this was a living mechanical thing happening to them.

576
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:21,462
Or around them, I should say.

577
00:30:21,982 --> 00:30:22,662
Sometimes we have to.

578
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,043
Spatial audio is super, super important.

579
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:30,164
Figuring out where things are, I mean, being able to hear stuff, the non-occluding speakers

580
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:34,805
on the Magic Leap One are quite good for basically positioning stuff around the player.

581
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:38,905
You would hear things coming out of walls and all around you all the time.

582
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:44,508
Again, not a lot to get in there from me, but Dave Shumway is speaking about this on

583
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:50,392
Thursday and his examples from Crate are amazing and he can get you lots of details there.

584
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:53,113
So if you're into the audio side, I'd strongly recommend that.

585
00:30:57,017 --> 00:31:00,279
Again, stuff happening outside of your field of view, the porthole sparks were a really

586
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:00,760
valuable thing.

587
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,884
So as portholes were opening and being, basically we were like cutting them into the wall and

588
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,026
doing that we would cast these sparks off and we'd always try to make sure the sparks

589
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:10,607
would cross the player's field of view.

590
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:14,650
And that was really effective because of course they had directionality and so it would pull

591
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:16,652
your attention towards them and you'd see them happen.

592
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:20,746
And lastly, this one's really subtle,

593
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:22,828
but it was a really neat thing that Simon,

594
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:25,009
our VFX guy came up with,

595
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:27,611
was ambient motes of stuff in the air.

596
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,332
So we just kind of filled the space

597
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:32,253
with this little gentle bit of dust.

598
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:34,495
And then that dust was always being sucked

599
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:36,036
into whatever porthole was open.

600
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,258
So there's always this sort of like subtle background thing

601
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,940
drawing your attention towards where stuff was going on.

602
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,542
It's a little thing, but it was one of those, you know,

603
00:31:46,302 --> 00:31:49,584
We've gone through like six things, right? It's like everything on top of everything.

604
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,706
You just try and layer this stuff in correctly.

605
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:58,050
So how does all this stuff actually work? Now these are all like these weird contraptions, right?

606
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,591
You've never dealt with this stuff before.

607
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:04,754
I've got the robot planet, we got miscars, we got a store, all of this stuff.

608
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:08,657
These are fantastical objects. You've never interacted with them before.

609
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:14,480
So one thing we found pretty quickly was making stuff

610
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,381
physical was absolutely key.

611
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:20,603
Every time we tried to abstract something away, we

612
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:21,783
found that people got lost.

613
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:24,845
So making it physical, making it something where you're

614
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:27,126
really doing this with your hands and your body and you're

615
00:32:27,186 --> 00:32:30,608
moving to it, was really important.

616
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:34,470
So in this example, the players plugged in to get a

617
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,692
mission, their mission card prints out, and then they put

618
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:39,193
it in the thing.

619
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:44,369
So they put it in the briefing stand, and then now they can go and set up their load

620
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:45,711
out of what ray gun they want to use.

621
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:52,097
Each step was discrete, and you could go forwards and backwards in the chain depending on what

622
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:52,637
you were doing.

623
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:56,882
And that was really helpful for us because we knew where the player was at at any given

624
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,503
point in this set of interactions.

625
00:32:58,964 --> 00:33:01,466
So we could make sure that you were guided through nice and cleanly.

626
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:07,608
and not confused by, you know, basically any time that you were doing two things at once,

627
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:12,192
people kind of lose track of it. Eventually we'll probably get to the point where, you know,

628
00:33:12,272 --> 00:33:16,355
operating in virtual spaces like this, or sorry, with virtual content in the real world like this,

629
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:21,159
is, you know, kind of normal and will have some set of, you know, regular standards and norms

630
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:24,922
that like WASD kind of stuff that people are used to. But in the meantime,

631
00:33:25,563 --> 00:33:30,384
You know, playtest the crap out of it and you'll be surprised at just how quickly you

632
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:37,905
can overload somebody's awareness of things. Um, and you know, make it fun. Oh no, there

633
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:42,046
we go. Um, the briefing cards and a lot of other bits and pieces that we had, you can

634
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:47,146
just grab and throw around. Just like, people would spend like minutes just chucking this

635
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:50,947
card in the air and then catching it and chucking it and catching it. People make a game out

636
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:54,688
of anything, right? Um, and we just reprint you another card. Why not?

637
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,370
And making it smooshable was really important.

638
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:05,677
So smoosh is something that Tom Hall, one of our programmers, came up with as a way

639
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:07,739
to avoid object interpenetration.

640
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,946
Because nothing ruins immersion quite like going, oh this virtual object just goes right

641
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:16,630
through this virtual object and it has no sense of weight or presence.

642
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:24,794
That's me using my hand. The render on the capture is not great but you get the sense

643
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:30,896
of that. So each one of these physical objects, or virtual physical objects, including things

644
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:34,917
like the robot planet and whatnot, as you touch them and push them, they smoosh, they

645
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:39,899
bounce around. They've all got physicality. And so nothing ever clips through anything

646
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,999
else. And that was

647
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,763
He just, he came up with that one day, showed it to us, and everybody kind of went,

648
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:50,787
everything has to do this. Like, everything. Which made our lives slightly more complicated,

649
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:52,669
as you can imagine, but it worked out for the best.

650
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:02,757
And lastly, making this thing really physical, um...

651
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:06,317
The Grappling Gun came out of one of our feature jams.

652
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:10,741
So we would take some time off from core development

653
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,624
every few months, and even sometimes we

654
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:17,326
were doing it once a month, to try different things out.

655
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:20,469
And the Grappling Gun came out of one of these jams.

656
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:22,371
And again, it was one of those things that was like,

657
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:23,352
we need this.

658
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:24,533
This is really cool.

659
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:26,514
It lets you reach out.

660
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,034
grab something at a distance, pull it to you, and examine it.

661
00:35:31,374 --> 00:35:33,635
And if you rip off a robot's leg,

662
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:35,717
and then you've got this object in your hand all of a sudden,

663
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:37,338
you're looking at it, and then throw it back at him,

664
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:38,558
it's a good time.

665
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:41,220
There's just lots of bits and pieces you can interact with.

666
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,441
What gets even weirder is that you reach

667
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,623
into the robot planet through the portals

668
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:48,124
that are in the wall, and grab a virtual object

669
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:51,106
from beyond the wall, and then pull that back to you.

670
00:35:51,506 --> 00:35:53,548
And that is quite an experience the first time you do it.

671
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:59,952
That also led us to some puzzle mechanics that you'll encounter later on in the game,

672
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:03,015
which are basically these robot planet security locks.

673
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:08,580
So again, this is another way to sort of control the pacing of the environment, or sorry, control

674
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,041
the pacing of the gameplay.

675
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,344
You're in there, you know, later missions and

676
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,960
Things are kind of intense and there's lots of robots and we want to like slow stuff down

677
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,440
a little bit.

678
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,302
So we get into combat, we do some stuff, and then the robots like lock you out for a second.

679
00:36:23,922 --> 00:36:27,563
Now you pull this thing out of the wall and it's got all these boxes and bits and bobs,

680
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:28,703
it's almost like a busy board.

681
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:33,004
And you're bopping and changing and moving stuff around and they're just really fun to

682
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,845
interact with, but again, it's at the player's own pace.

683
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:40,426
So it slows things down a little bit, lets you take that moment to kind of enjoy and

684
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:40,906
appreciate.

685
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:44,735
So how do we get these robot invaders into your living room?

686
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:56,965
Well, this is what we call a human-scale combat.

687
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,587
So you see we've got these robots that

688
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,209
are of different sizes.

689
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,190
They navigate the environment a little bit differently.

690
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:07,434
And we're just putting them in your space with you.

691
00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:12,175
And the different robots, we started with our probe bot.

692
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:14,916
This is like a small flyer, like a really nasty wasp.

693
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:16,097
It's the first thing you encounter.

694
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:20,059
Flying stuff is great because it can clear your couch,

695
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:21,120
your table, your whatever.

696
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,321
It can just get around to the player very quickly.

697
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:24,782
Super helpful.

698
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:26,663
It was also actually like the very first thing

699
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:29,004
we put into mixed reality from workshop.

700
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:31,786
That's Sam Miller, one of the original

701
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,828
Magic Leap engineers demonstrating.

702
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,328
They were just, they were trying to take a picture

703
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:37,989
and go like, is this thing really here?

704
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,611
It's a lot of fun.

705
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:43,056
But yeah, I can't recommend strongly enough,

706
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:46,520
like if you need something that is quick and can get around,

707
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,841
look at flying stuff.

708
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:50,064
And these use the same flight graph as Gimbal,

709
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,967
so we got a bit of reuse on that space.

710
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:55,972
The Simpletron are these tall, gangly, kind of like creepy

711
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:56,352
dudes.

712
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:00,857
They're about eye average, kind of eye height for most players.

713
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:04,801
And we wanted them to be like a melee enemy.

714
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:08,064
So they just originally their attacks, like they'd walk up and they'd take a swipe at you.

715
00:38:08,464 --> 00:38:12,768
It turns out that that was like getting really close and really kind of in your face.

716
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:19,975
So we gave them a ranged, like a ranged punch where they wind up and throw this punch out from quite a, they can do it from quite a distance.

717
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:22,117
And then eventually when.

718
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,210
As we were getting closer to kind of the final form factor of the device and we were able

719
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,032
to move around more, we went back to giving them some melee attacks as well that were

720
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:38,355
like this spinning attack, for example, where he just like sticks his arms out and helicopters

721
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:38,655
at you.

722
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:41,417
And you can hear it coming and it sounds like a million razor blades.

723
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:43,158
It's really, it's a bit freaky.

724
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:47,060
Fun fact though, everything is physical, including that attack.

725
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,961
So if you sit down, it will miss you.

726
00:38:48,981 --> 00:38:51,082
It goes right over your head.

727
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,825
And then we had our Thugmabot, and these guys were waist high, they're just like permanently

728
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:58,785
angry little dudes.

729
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:03,387
They've got a jetpack so that they can clear obstacles in your room and in the caverns.

730
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:06,328
And they had a couple different ranged attack types.

731
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:10,169
And you can see all these robots are wearing different types of armor.

732
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:15,531
The armor for us was really valuable because it let us challenge the player's ray gun choice

733
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:16,191
in different ways.

734
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:20,473
So like the rubberized one over there melts when you hit it with heat, but will reflect

735
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:22,533
force and just the grapple bounces off of it.

736
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:27,535
That shiny chrome armor there can be obliterated with a force weapon,

737
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:33,437
but again the grappling hook will just skid off of it and it reflects the heat ray guns.

738
00:39:34,598 --> 00:39:38,159
And these are the fully armored versions, but when we introduced them to the player,

739
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,701
we would give them just the torso armor or just the leg armor,

740
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:45,542
and that let us challenge the player's precision and also start teaching them

741
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:50,904
where they were going to be vulnerable to certain types.

742
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:57,409
And lastly I'd say, um, it's really important to keep this stuff kind of silly.

743
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:01,153
Or at least it was for us.

744
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:04,556
Because again, we're attacking you with these characters.

745
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:07,438
This is really, it's in your space. It's quite personal.

746
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:11,402
So we made sure that everything, they've all got really goofy voice lines.

747
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:14,825
They've got these fun little animations that they're idols.

748
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:24,253
The rockets that get fired from the Thugma bots are these like super angry little things that make goofy noises as they fly by your head.

749
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:26,295
Also really good for spatialized audio.

750
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:30,138
And we've just added kind of humor wherever you could.

751
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:35,363
If you use the grappling hook on the walls of your room, like just against the wall there,

752
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:38,385
you'll find that you can rip things out of the wall that you wouldn't expect.

753
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:41,668
There's all kinds of stuff hidden behind the, you know, the boards of your house.

754
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:46,733
So the robots all shared a nav mesh

755
00:40:46,753 --> 00:40:47,854
that was made up of grid positions

756
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:49,894
that were constantly being weighed to find the best spot,

757
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:52,535
taking into account things like player position,

758
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:54,195
particularly line of sight

759
00:40:54,695 --> 00:40:56,436
based on whatever attacks they had available,

760
00:40:57,016 --> 00:40:58,516
the position of the other robots,

761
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:00,457
the height of surrounding geometry,

762
00:41:01,397 --> 00:41:02,697
and the available movement states

763
00:41:02,757 --> 00:41:03,957
from one position to the next.

764
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:06,058
So do I need to be able to jet pack over there?

765
00:41:06,138 --> 00:41:07,378
Can I walk there in a straight line?

766
00:41:08,518 --> 00:41:11,099
So this was a really important,

767
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:13,239
and I think it's one of those challenges

768
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:13,940
that you'll find.

769
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,663
And it feels like a traditional game challenge until you go,

770
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:19,064
I have no control over the world.

771
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:21,586
All of my level design stuff goes out the window

772
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,328
because I don't know where your couch is.

773
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:27,091
So being quite dynamic about this is really important.

774
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:31,795
And the attack tells, so that glint system

775
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,878
that we use to kind of indicate where stuff is at

776
00:41:34,898 --> 00:41:38,281
for the player was really valuable

777
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:39,903
and we ended up with that.

778
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:57,806
So you can see how, um, you can see how there was those glints there where they were yellow

779
00:41:57,846 --> 00:42:02,887
to indicate, okay, that's the position of a thing. They would go red, uh, when the robot

780
00:42:02,907 --> 00:42:06,288
was about to attack. And that's how you knew where the, where the threat was coming from,

781
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:08,088
uh, if you didn't happen to be looking at it.

782
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:11,085
And so we had to manage the intensity of all this.

783
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,627
We built a thing we call the action timeline.

784
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:18,311
And that's set up in such a way that we can stack and base,

785
00:42:19,132 --> 00:42:22,214
sorry, we can decide who's going to attack the player

786
00:42:22,254 --> 00:42:23,915
and when based on a variety of criteria,

787
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:25,977
like their distance to the player, did they last attack?

788
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:27,838
How close to my field of view are they?

789
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:30,681
We want to bias attackers to the ones that you're looking at

790
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:31,501
versus the ones outside.

791
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:33,643
Create kind of that Kung Fu fight circle feeling.

792
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:40,354
Um, so the action timeline, basically everything has a buffer of exclusivity and we can address,

793
00:42:40,655 --> 00:42:46,319
adjust that. So it says no other attack action can take place during this time. Um, we activate

794
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:51,424
the tell, which is that red glow at a certain point. Um, there's a wind up time on everything.

795
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:54,826
So how long does it take before the robot's actually able to attack? So in the thugging

796
00:42:54,846 --> 00:42:59,030
bots case, you could see him like standing there, embracing himself to take a shot. Um,

797
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,131
and then the attack itself.

798
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:06,851
And so by dynamically scaling this, we could really quite dramatically change the difficulty

799
00:43:06,871 --> 00:43:07,972
level of the game.

800
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:12,536
And so as you get later in the game, the exclusive buffers come down and down and down so that

801
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:14,057
robots are attacking more frequently.

802
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,702
And that was actually, that one variable became the one that we kind of focused on the most.

803
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:23,606
So where are all these robots coming from?

804
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:24,687
It's the robot planet.

805
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:26,128
So we have these caverns.

806
00:43:31,518 --> 00:43:35,444
So to sell the idea that this robot planet is this big space where these robots are being

807
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:39,549
manufactured and invading the Earth from, we had a few of these really big caverns that

808
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:40,070
would open up.

809
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:44,557
And you can see, if you walk up towards them or you stand to the left or right of them,

810
00:43:44,577 --> 00:43:47,281
you can just see all of this detail and depth inside of them.

811
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:52,632
And we also use them as sort of a form of environmental storytelling.

812
00:43:52,672 --> 00:44:01,760
So they start off in the furnace where they're like melting down metal for building something.

813
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,704
And then in the smelter you can see them manufacturing the parts for whatever that thing is.

814
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:10,567
And then in assembly you can see them putting it together before we get to, well, the bit

815
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:11,387
at the end, which I won't spoil.

816
00:44:13,716 --> 00:44:19,380
And these caverns, all of them ended up with these light, what we call gates, which were

817
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,144
kind of light puzzle elements, like the heat-based one over there, this little robot who just

818
00:44:24,184 --> 00:44:27,206
pulls a lever, the idea being that you're sabotaging the robot planet.

819
00:44:28,327 --> 00:44:34,352
Each one of these responded to different attack types, like the heat, the force, the grapple,

820
00:44:34,732 --> 00:44:36,473
and some of them were compound and had two.

821
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:43,027
One thing I'll note about that though is that we were, you know, sure we're dynamically

822
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:46,168
placing stuff in the environment, we're trying to get it all right all the time, and we've

823
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:49,950
gotten our stuff out beyond the player's wall, but you've got to make sure they can see it

824
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,332
because if that cavern happened to get placed up against the side of the wall...

825
00:44:54,032 --> 00:44:59,136
And the thing that they needed to shoot, the gate they needed to shoot, was like over there somewhere.

826
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:04,020
You can't walk through your wall, right? So you can't even physically get yourself to a position where you can see it.

827
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,505
So we had to, we developed a, like a test harness basically in Unity that allowed us to kind of look through and figure out,

828
00:45:11,565 --> 00:45:16,249
okay, we assume that players can stand, we had to make a few assumptions.

829
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:20,632
One of them was players can stand about this far away and see roughly this much.

830
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:26,120
And the caverns themselves, again, to adapt to the player's space, could also lift up

831
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,620
a sill.

832
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,543
So they started off, and they're about yay high, and if there was a couch or something

833
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:34,105
and that was just where we had a piece of clear wall, we would lift a sill up and then

834
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,686
the robots could actually jump over out of it.

835
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,768
And again, you had to make sure players could still see what was in there.

836
00:45:40,943 --> 00:45:42,304
So how do you get this consistency

837
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:43,224
in diverse environments?

838
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:44,044
We've got the scan.

839
00:45:44,064 --> 00:45:46,466
We've got the world search to make sure stuff is there.

840
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:49,487
We did end up with a small minimum spec.

841
00:45:50,168 --> 00:45:53,249
During the scanning phase, ideally, players

842
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:56,071
just look around, and we get what we need very quickly.

843
00:45:56,471 --> 00:45:59,712
But if necessary, if they hit the Pause button,

844
00:45:59,752 --> 00:46:01,413
we'll show them what the minimum spec is.

845
00:46:01,913 --> 00:46:06,396
And so for us, that was like two 50 by 50 centimeter spaces,

846
00:46:06,856 --> 00:46:08,857
one 50 by 50 centimeter floor space.

847
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,239
and an 80 by 90 on the wall if we needed that.

848
00:46:14,181 --> 00:46:15,582
Once the scan satisfied those requirements,

849
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:17,843
then we knew we could play the game in that space.

850
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:21,306
So basically, you can't control the level, right?

851
00:46:21,326 --> 00:46:22,907
The level's not there for you anymore.

852
00:46:23,187 --> 00:46:24,628
That's the player's room.

853
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:27,370
You can encourage people

854
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,731
to move their furniture around, probably.

855
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:30,972
I'm sure that there will be experiences that do that,

856
00:46:31,072 --> 00:46:32,033
but we wanted to make it work.

857
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:35,455
So you really need to focus on what a systemic experience is.

858
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:36,896
How are you going to govern the play?

859
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:41,494
The game's really got to fit the player's space.

860
00:46:42,654 --> 00:46:44,355
So we focused on mission design.

861
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,316
So that was which robots get introduced when,

862
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:49,176
what type of armor shows up when,

863
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:52,738
which combinations of armor, the rate of spawn,

864
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:55,179
the rate of attack, all of those kinds of things.

865
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,400
And so we were able to pace out the experience

866
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,681
so that everyone had roughly the same order

867
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:02,962
of experience tap into them,

868
00:47:03,962 --> 00:47:05,963
and roughly the same sort of intensity of experience.

869
00:47:07,143 --> 00:47:10,824
And so I think it's really important to kind of, you can create, and we did this a few

870
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:15,486
times over the course of development, where we create a bit of a, like a target ideal

871
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:17,747
of like, oh, the best experience would kind of be this.

872
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:18,967
What would we do?

873
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,608
What variables would we need access to, to try and get us to that point?

874
00:47:22,888 --> 00:47:25,809
And then make that true so we can kind of paint that experience everywhere.

875
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:29,691
So we had to plan to be wrong.

876
00:47:30,271 --> 00:47:33,532
This was the thing, like, we've got all these robots and stuff, but as we were doing this,

877
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:35,013
we were, you know.

878
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:39,687
We had quite a bit of hardware change over time.

879
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:41,208
This was the WD3.

880
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:44,549
And you can see here, as Richard's playing,

881
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,771
he's really, you know, he's standing in one place

882
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:51,493
because he's got this tether to a PC

883
00:47:52,194 --> 00:47:54,955
and he can't move around so much.

884
00:47:56,145 --> 00:48:02,772
And so we knew for a fact that we were going to be untethered, our sixth off would work

885
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:05,475
with, you know, attached to it, people are going to be able to walk everywhere.

886
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:06,696
This was certain.

887
00:48:06,896 --> 00:48:07,537
This would be true.

888
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:10,039
We were helping, you know, the Magic Leap team get there.

889
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:16,780
And it still blew our minds how wrong we were about all of the assumptions that we had around

890
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,141
player movement and everything else.

891
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:23,946
Where we got to in the end, you can see how different this is with what Jimmy Baird, one

892
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:27,870
of our lead designers, calls a game about movement, where really we're trying to get

893
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,351
people to move around in this space.

894
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:32,694
And it turned into a much more dynamic experience.

895
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:38,479
So yeah, when you're developing on early stage stuff, you can prepare to be wrong.

896
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,680
You know you're going to be wrong.

897
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,271
And it still shocks you a little bit about how wrong you are.

898
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:48,294
And I will say that ambiguity is difficult.

899
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:54,478
This was a long road for us to help develop the platform

900
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,318
and develop the game.

901
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:00,341
We had to really conserve our energy throughout development.

902
00:49:00,381 --> 00:49:02,162
We were in research and development phase

903
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:03,283
for quite a long time.

904
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:06,044
And we could have been sprinting at every milestone

905
00:49:06,104 --> 00:49:07,665
and throwing ourselves up against this thing.

906
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,686
But we knew that at some point.

907
00:49:11,106 --> 00:49:13,048
You know, the time for that would eventually come.

908
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:16,311
But in the meantime, we needed to just be experimenting

909
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:17,632
and be cognizant of it.

910
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:21,435
It was amazing how fast the Magic Leap Engineering

911
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:22,817
groups moved, right?

912
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:26,120
They were moving mountains to make a brand new platform

913
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:26,961
from scratch.

914
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:31,345
Like, I still can't quite comprehend

915
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,407
how they pulled all that stuff off in the time they did.

916
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:40,243
But for us, it meant that we sort of, we tried to build something to share with them, to

917
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:45,548
help them guide their process, to get them excited and engaged with what we were making.

918
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:51,587
Um, but when we got to, and, but then we still had gas in the tank once it was like, okay,

919
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:53,947
we've got the final form factor, away we go.

920
00:49:54,507 --> 00:49:58,588
The good news is, um, you know, it's probably not going to be this kind of hard again.

921
00:49:58,608 --> 00:50:00,789
Uh, we now have a platform.

922
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:04,670
We have the operating system, we have the SDK and it's getting better all the time.

923
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:10,291
Uh, just in December, we did a game jam and in three days we built nine prototypes.

924
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:13,572
And, uh, it used to take us three days to get something to work.

925
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:15,933
So it feels really good.

926
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:18,434
It feels like we're in a very exciting space with this.

927
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:20,795
So we shipped it.

928
00:50:21,575 --> 00:50:24,477
We launched Dr. Robots Invaders at the LEAP convention

929
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:27,458
in October in Los Angeles.

930
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,719
We built four of these demo bays.

931
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:33,621
You can see they look quite big and quite open compared

932
00:50:33,661 --> 00:50:35,221
to probably what your living room would be.

933
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:39,984
And that's partly, you know, it gives the robots lots of space

934
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:40,884
to navigate and everything else.

935
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:42,124
But it's also because.

936
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,144
You can play in a much tighter space that you're familiar with.

937
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:49,790
When you're in an unfamiliar space, like, it's a health and safety hazard.

938
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,634
Because you'll be running around, and I saw some great stuff.

939
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:56,100
I saw somebody actually like dive behind that thing and shoot from underneath a coffee table,

940
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:56,841
which I thought was great.

941
00:50:58,265 --> 00:51:03,808
Um, so yeah, bear in mind that if you're demoing things, uh, any space that you're familiar

942
00:51:03,868 --> 00:51:07,789
with, you've, you've got like a built in kind of proprioception and, and sense of that space

943
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:08,850
that other people won't have.

944
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,490
So we try to make it safe for everybody.

945
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,191
Um, of course because it's what a workshop, we couldn't.

946
00:51:13,812 --> 00:51:15,213
you know, just do it normally.

947
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:17,535
We had to have lots of folks there.

948
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:19,496
You know, our scientists were great.

949
00:51:19,516 --> 00:51:21,738
They were welcoming people into the experience,

950
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:23,379
getting them to sign their lives away on a

951
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,060
blood-spattered piece of paper,

952
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,842
and then handing them off to us for demos.

953
00:51:27,822 --> 00:51:29,524
We had Lord Coxwayne himself there,

954
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:30,745
and the Lady Victoria.

955
00:51:30,765 --> 00:51:32,146
It was a good time.

956
00:51:32,586 --> 00:51:34,848
And people just really enjoyed it.

957
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:36,949
It was really gratifying for us to spend,

958
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:38,871
having spent all that time, you know,

959
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:41,433
quietly hiding out in New Zealand,

960
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,774
making this funky thing.

961
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:46,433
for people to just go and have a real good time with it.

962
00:51:47,414 --> 00:51:49,897
The press reception was really positive, which was gratifying.

963
00:51:50,217 --> 00:51:53,160
And I think lots of folks have said

964
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,824
that it's been helpful for them to see what a full experience

965
00:51:56,844 --> 00:51:57,845
can be in this medium.

966
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,023
So just to wrap up, if you have the opportunity to help develop on a platform, communication

967
00:52:05,063 --> 00:52:05,424
is key.

968
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:09,807
I mean, that's true always and forever, right, of anything we do, but it really is.

969
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,868
Be prepared to live with friction.

970
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:16,071
This stuff was really hard for a long time and you just kind of have to get zen about

971
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:16,191
it.

972
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,973
Our technical director, Mike, I swear is some sort of Buddha.

973
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:23,457
You've got to figure out what's under your direct control and maximize for it.

974
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:24,177
So we knew.

975
00:52:25,438 --> 00:52:53,786
That we could control, for example, like we're working in Unity, we're on, we're in editor on PC, fine, no problem. We can build lots of stuff there, figure out how we take that to this early stage hardware as quickly as possible. But then how do we, you know, make as much as we can, and then push it over, make as much as we can push it over to speed up. And lastly, of course, bring the fun to your partners. If you're a game developer working with non game teams, you can you can make their month by showing up with something great.

976
00:52:55,747 --> 00:52:58,330
So, spatial computing is super ridiculously exciting.

977
00:52:58,411 --> 00:52:59,372
I'm very excited about it.

978
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:00,994
It's why I moved back to New Zealand.

979
00:53:02,075 --> 00:53:04,378
And I hope you all have a crack at it.

980
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:07,822
Everything is new again, including our audience.

981
00:53:08,343 --> 00:53:09,804
One of the things, as I said at the beginning,

982
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:11,186
we're really

983
00:53:12,268 --> 00:53:14,129
Like, people can just get into this.

984
00:53:14,209 --> 00:53:16,170
You put it on, and you're like, oh, I've got a thing.

985
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:16,991
Oh, I've got a ray gun.

986
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:18,091
Oh, things are happening.

987
00:53:18,752 --> 00:53:20,473
And we've seen this with all of our experiences.

988
00:53:20,553 --> 00:53:22,133
Tenandi, you just reach out and touch stuff.

989
00:53:22,754 --> 00:53:24,235
And it's quite different.

990
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,617
And so you're going to meet all kinds of people who have maybe

991
00:53:28,697 --> 00:53:30,718
never played games before, certainly never played

992
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:32,880
an immersive game before like this.

993
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,381
And so be prepared for that.

994
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:36,962
Get physical.

995
00:53:37,502 --> 00:53:42,867
You know, we found that we could prototype a lot of stuff by, you know, just basically acting it out.

996
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:48,673
You know, this is like, where does Gimbal need to be in relation to the robot planet as the player goes through different steps?

997
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:55,379
You know, so there's Greg, Jimmy, and Jordan acting out like what would happen as you're working, as you, as the player goes through this stuff.

998
00:53:57,221 --> 00:54:02,306
You've got almost no control over the player's space, and that's a feature, not a bug.

999
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,432
Build to it. You know, it's going to be hard. It's going to be tricky.

1000
00:54:07,352 --> 00:54:11,535
But take advantage of that. Take advantage of really thinking through systemic design.

1001
00:54:14,176 --> 00:54:15,297
And focus on player comfort.

1002
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,642
You know, both the physical and the mental.

1003
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:20,703
You know, take like, even light physical activity

1004
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:22,184
can be tiring over time.

1005
00:54:23,184 --> 00:54:25,645
You know, you think about like the minority report interface

1006
00:54:25,665 --> 00:54:26,665
where he's moving stuff around.

1007
00:54:26,685 --> 00:54:28,126
It was an interview and Tom Cruise said

1008
00:54:28,146 --> 00:54:29,846
it's one of the hardest things he's ever done in film

1009
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,227
because he had to keep his arms out there

1010
00:54:31,287 --> 00:54:32,887
for shot after shot after shot.

1011
00:54:33,388 --> 00:54:34,948
You know, so think about things like that.

1012
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:38,609
Make sure that you're not building something in a vacuum

1013
00:54:38,669 --> 00:54:40,290
where you're like, cool, I built this on my computer.

1014
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:44,692
Always, always, always push to device, stand up and test.

1015
00:54:44,972 --> 00:54:48,097
Move around, play it in the environment that you expect it to be played in.

1016
00:54:51,604 --> 00:54:54,048
And defend the planet from the robot invaders.

1017
00:54:55,811 --> 00:54:56,332
Thanks very much.

1018
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:06,673
So, from Wednesday through Friday, we'll be at the Unity booth.

1019
00:55:07,093 --> 00:55:10,495
We're showing the Dr. Goreborts Invaders single player demo.

1020
00:55:10,835 --> 00:55:14,158
And we also have a brand new experience called Gore Battle,

1021
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:17,580
which is an early look at our first multiplayer experience.

1022
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,560
It's a lot of fun.

1023
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:21,062
And it's... yeah.

1024
00:55:21,962 --> 00:55:23,724
I don't want to spoil anything, but there's also a tea party.

1025
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:26,005
So I do recommend checking that out.

1026
00:55:26,585 --> 00:55:29,387
Sign-ups will be open, I think, from first thing in the morning at the booth.

1027
00:55:31,399 --> 00:55:36,103
Also, as I say, we have offices from Zurich to Tel Aviv to Austin to Seattle to New Zealand,

1028
00:55:36,784 --> 00:55:37,785
and we are always hiring.

1029
00:55:37,925 --> 00:55:42,189
And David Martin, one of our senior recruiters, is here if you want to talk to him about all

1030
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:42,970
that fun stuff.

1031
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:46,173
And otherwise, I think we've got about three or four minutes for questions.

1032
00:55:53,918 --> 00:56:00,805
Great job. I played the game myself actually my mom had the same experience as your mom didn't she actually almost knocked down a wall painting trying to like

1033
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:05,770
Robot and so a number of people we've had almost put their heads through walls trying to look at portals

1034
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:11,175
It's like it was it was really amazing for me to see and that kind of brings me to you

1035
00:56:11,195 --> 00:56:15,059
know, you mentioned the physicality of this and then how you know players can get a little bit tired and so forth and

1036
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,342
I'm wondering, given that you've, you know, you've spent years on this.

1037
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:30,792
Do you have a sense of what you think the breakdown might be going forward in mixed reality between these kind of more physical experiences do you think that's going to be what really drives the popularity of these platforms, or will it be kind of a little

1038
00:56:30,812 --> 00:56:33,675
bit more kind of casual, almost more like.

1039
00:56:34,332 --> 00:56:38,375
Kind of how traditional games are, maybe something more like the, you know, the Angry Birds experience.

1040
00:56:38,835 --> 00:56:41,437
What's your take on what you think people are actually going to be doing?

1041
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:46,300
And do you have any statistics on what people have been doing in the game out in the wild,

1042
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:50,223
like in terms of playtime, you know, and so forth, completion rates and things like that?

1043
00:56:51,748 --> 00:56:57,071
So, I'm trying to read somebody's question, but, you know, are we expecting to see casual

1044
00:56:57,091 --> 00:56:59,512
experiences, more physical experiences, more seed experiences?

1045
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:01,953
I think the answer to that is we just don't know.

1046
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:04,435
I think we'll see probably a lot of stuff, right?

1047
00:57:04,475 --> 00:57:08,397
Like it's just, you know, just like on your phone or your console, you've got everything

1048
00:57:08,457 --> 00:57:10,118
from a match three to God of War.

1049
00:57:10,418 --> 00:57:14,300
And I think people are, you know, people are going to find and want different things depending

1050
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,081
on their mood.

1051
00:57:15,261 --> 00:57:16,241
So we'll see how that goes.

1052
00:57:18,462 --> 00:57:20,483
The second part was about the stats.

1053
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:23,264
Yeah, so we have some, yeah, we do have some analytics.

1054
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:26,245
And basically, we were looking for, yeah,

1055
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:28,266
how long are people playing for, you know,

1056
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:29,927
average session length, things like that.

1057
00:57:31,547 --> 00:57:33,708
Off the top of my head, I think our average session length

1058
00:57:33,808 --> 00:57:35,729
is somewhere between 10 and 40 minutes,

1059
00:57:35,749 --> 00:57:36,689
which is quite a range.

1060
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:39,190
But we see, you know, you obviously see outliers,

1061
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,470
people who play for a couple hours,

1062
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,692
the battery will go for almost three hours playing.

1063
00:57:43,812 --> 00:57:43,952
So.

1064
00:57:45,652 --> 00:57:52,278
Yeah, it's quite variable, I think. But yeah, it's also like, it's worth noting, I think that because

1065
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:57,803
we're so early in this in this stage of the platform, like people are, people are engaging

1066
00:57:57,843 --> 00:58:02,867
with it, both as players, I'm here, I want the experience. And as developers going, how does this

1067
00:58:02,907 --> 00:58:06,390
thing work? And so like, they're just jumping in going like, okay, buttons are kind of like this.

1068
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:10,714
That's cool. That's a reference for me in the get out. So I think our actual like, the reality of

1069
00:58:10,774 --> 00:58:12,075
our stats is probably not.

1070
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:16,056
It's not indicative of players per se.

1071
00:58:16,096 --> 00:58:18,097
It's indicative of this wide range of people

1072
00:58:18,137 --> 00:58:19,278
who have got access to the device.

1073
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:20,418
Cool, thank you.

1074
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:22,779
You mentioned how unusual it was

1075
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:24,159
for Weta to make a video game.

1076
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:26,680
I'm just wondering how that decision came about.

1077
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,961
Like who was like, we need a game studio,

1078
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:31,121
let's go talk to the guys that did Lord of the Rings swords.

1079
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:34,722
Oh, so the Magic Leap Weta Workshop relationship

1080
00:58:34,823 --> 00:58:36,063
predates Magic Leap.

1081
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:38,544
So Rony Abovitz, who's the CEO of Magic Leap,

1082
00:58:39,764 --> 00:58:46,889
first got in touch with Weta to work on a sci-fi world that he wanted to create, because that's

1083
00:58:46,909 --> 00:58:52,412
what we do. And so they were already had that relationship going and as Magic Leap became a

1084
00:58:52,492 --> 00:58:58,015
thing, he was like, we need games, we need content. Hey, guys, I love this. The Gord Bort's ray guns

1085
00:58:58,055 --> 00:59:06,761
and stuff seems like a good fit. And away they went. Awesome. Thanks. Okay, hop this way and

1086
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:07,921
then this way. Sorry. Ladies first.

1087
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:19,843
Thank you. This was great. I'm wondering what you see different considerations or like net new things developers should keep in mind for multiplayer when it comes to spatial computing.

1088
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:23,389
So things to keep in mind for multiplayer in spatial computing.

1089
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:27,410
Space obviously is like, I mean the spatial part is the huge one.

1090
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:32,332
We've had four or six people running around, you know, playing with each other and

1091
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:38,494
the, there's a reason there's a tea party to kind of start the experience to keep things chill before we start moving people around a bunch.

1092
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:44,031
I think, yeah, I think space is honestly the single biggest consideration.

1093
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:50,334
And then like what's, um, interactions with other people are amazing in mixed reality.

1094
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:54,495
Like it's just, there's something really special about being able to do something unreal and

1095
00:59:54,515 --> 00:59:57,136
a little bit weird just together in the real world.

1096
00:59:57,517 --> 01:00:03,379
So yeah, I would strongly encourage like anything that's cooperative or, um, like direct one-to-one

1097
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,200
interaction is, is, yeah.

1098
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,260
Thank you.

1099
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:06,720
Cheers.

1100
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:12,221
So I played the game and I was really impressed with the transparency.

1101
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:16,325
I was curious how you guys achieve that because most of the games have all the assets,

1102
01:00:16,365 --> 01:00:18,766
they still look really transparent in the real world.

1103
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:21,949
Do you have any new tricks how to fix that?

1104
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:25,553
Yeah, so ways to make the virtual content appear more grounded.

1105
01:00:26,634 --> 01:00:28,255
I think it primarily is just our lighting model.

1106
01:00:28,975 --> 01:00:31,057
That, we tweaked that a long time.

1107
01:00:31,957 --> 01:00:34,319
And I'm unfortunately not the best person

1108
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,920
to speak to the specifics of that.

1109
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,923
You probably, if you swing by Unity booth, Tom Hall's there.

1110
01:00:41,403 --> 01:00:42,704
He can probably tell you a little bit more about it.

1111
01:00:44,365 --> 01:00:44,545
Cool.

1112
01:00:45,485 --> 01:00:47,887
We got, oh, you can go for it, yeah.

1113
01:00:49,307 --> 01:00:49,988
Two minutes, okay, cool.

1114
01:00:53,673 --> 01:01:03,437
In my understanding, Magic Leap 1 has a two-layer display that contains two different focal lengths.

1115
01:01:04,197 --> 01:01:11,479
And what is the usage of any game title?

1116
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:15,898
near layer is dedicated for the RayGans,

1117
01:01:16,558 --> 01:01:22,303
or when the robot comes close to the user,

1118
01:01:22,383 --> 01:01:25,445
do you use the near layer and the far layer?

1119
01:01:26,466 --> 01:01:29,368
So when are we, how are we choosing,

1120
01:01:29,388 --> 01:01:31,349
excuse me, how are we choosing which depth plane

1121
01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:31,990
to be using?

1122
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,271
It's driven primarily by

1123
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:38,284
Excuse me, eye tracking.

1124
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:40,325
So based on what the player is looking at,

1125
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:42,087
so if you're looking at a robot at a distance,

1126
01:01:42,127 --> 01:01:43,168
we're rendering far plane.

1127
01:01:43,428 --> 01:01:44,589
If that robot comes up really close

1128
01:01:44,609 --> 01:01:45,670
and you're looking at it right here,

1129
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:49,012
it's like a fundamental part of the platform

1130
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:52,195
is really to make sure that the rendering

1131
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:54,537
is as accommodating to the eye as possible.

1132
01:01:54,637 --> 01:01:55,718
So it's eye tracked that way.

1133
01:01:56,158 --> 01:01:58,380
So we just, we drive it based on the standards

1134
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,321
that the SDK sets.

1135
01:02:00,422 --> 01:02:03,945
Is it smooth on switching between layers?

1136
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:09,532
Um, it's quite, I mean it's a fraction of a second and people are blinking enough that

1137
01:02:09,632 --> 01:02:13,657
usually you don't notice it so much but um, sometimes you'll see it switch a little bit

1138
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:17,461
but that's, yeah. Um, it's not, yeah. Don't notice it really.

1139
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:18,882
Uh huh. Okay. Thank you.

1140
01:02:19,063 --> 01:02:19,263
Cheers.

1141
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:38,773
Real quick, did you ever think instead of like having people like skip certain sections if they're having difficulties, did you ever think of maybe setting up a sort of scaling difficulty where like the exclusion buffer that you're talking about was kind of like maybe increased a bit, or you know, decrease the amount of robots coming through or?

1142
01:02:38,913 --> 01:02:43,116
Yeah, so dynamic difficulty scaling. We experimented with it. Unfortunately,

1143
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:48,240
It was a really difficult one to get the right kind of information out of it.

1144
01:02:48,941 --> 01:02:54,104
I definitely think that's a place to be looking, especially to accommodate as many players as possible.

1145
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:57,187
But yeah, unfortunately for us, it wasn't something that...

1146
01:02:57,787 --> 01:02:59,569
We never kind of got it to a place where it felt right.

1147
01:03:00,049 --> 01:03:02,311
So we kind of were like, we'll step back.

1148
01:03:02,351 --> 01:03:06,194
And the skip was added a bit later to accommodate for anybody who had real challenges with it.

1149
01:03:07,114 --> 01:03:07,375
Thank you.

1150
01:03:07,395 --> 01:03:09,136
Okay, last one. Cool.

1151
01:03:10,882 --> 01:03:12,062
I really enjoyed the experience.

1152
01:03:12,943 --> 01:03:17,445
But we, I'm using it actually as a reference point for something we're working on right now.

1153
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:22,107
The thing I was most interested in were the portals, right, that the robots come out of.

1154
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:25,128
I was kind of curious, can you speak to how you guys accomplished that?

1155
01:03:25,228 --> 01:03:29,871
Because, you know, trying to include the spatial mesh, and I had like the occlusion mesh.

1156
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:32,832
It was, I got a solution, but it took some work.

1157
01:03:34,493 --> 01:03:35,853
So how do we get the portals on the wall?

1158
01:03:37,054 --> 01:03:38,575
It's basically, we're...

1159
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:45,838
We're rendering the entire cavern space on the other side of your wall and just sticking it on there.

1160
01:03:46,038 --> 01:03:51,101
It's not like a traditional, not traditional, it's not like a proper portal system.

1161
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:57,164
It's literally like we've put the geometry on there and then we've put occluders around it so that you can only see through from certain angles.

1162
01:03:58,124 --> 01:03:59,865
Basically one of the big challenges we had was...

1163
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:06,154
Making sure that like these, the robots are walking with IK and stuff, right?

1164
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:10,438
So having them, having the physics transfer nice and cleanly between the real world and the virtual

1165
01:04:10,478 --> 01:04:15,401
world and having shots travel through that and everything else. We tried a few times through

1166
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:20,085
different portal systems and all of them at the end of the day were a little bit too expensive and

1167
01:04:21,586 --> 01:04:25,028
Just created so many edge cases that we stuck with that format.

1168
01:04:25,669 --> 01:04:29,291
I think in the future it would be really nice to have a really sweet portal system.

1169
01:04:29,651 --> 01:04:32,173
So we'll probably build something like that at some point I'm sure.

1170
01:04:32,273 --> 01:04:37,497
But yeah, at the moment it's just like literally, there's the level, stick it on the outside of the wall.

1171
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:39,078
Try not to walk through the wall.

1172
01:04:39,438 --> 01:04:39,798
Thank you.

1173
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:41,780
Cheers. Thanks very much everyone.
