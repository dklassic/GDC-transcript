1
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,910
So this is The Art of Thirsty Suitors.

2
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:15,332
I'm Chandanayak Anayaka.

3
00:00:15,372 --> 00:00:17,474
I'm the co-founder and creative director of Outerloop Games.

4
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:21,164
been making games for a long time.

5
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,166
I started Bethesda when I was 19.

6
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:24,087
I was a baby.

7
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:30,454
And I've been making games in various roles, art design, narrative production, biz.

8
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:33,678
And then we started Outerloop Games in 2017.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,002
The game we're talking about today is Thirsty Suitors.

10
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,103
It's our second game.

11
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:41,446
The first game we did as a team was called Falcon Age.

12
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:49,759
And Thirsty is a game about fighting your exes and disappointing your parents while skateboarding and cooking.

13
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,741
I kind of call it a baby Yakuza game if you've played Yakuza games.

14
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:59,464
Not that it has anything to do with Yakuza, but it's a narrative RPG with turn-based combat.

15
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,685
And it's a short version.

16
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:03,185
It's a baby version of it.

17
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:07,788
Here's a little snippet of it.

18
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:07,993
As you can see, it's very stylized.

19
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:13,957
So today we're going to talk about how we combine 2D and 3D techniques to create a compelling illustrative look.

20
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:18,160
Leveraging 2D, which we've learned the hard way a lot of times on this project.

21
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:21,543
Sometimes less is more, which also we've learned the hard way on this project.

22
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:30,716
Designing around the strengths of our art team, looking for scalable solutions, specificities universal, and cultural experience and inspiration.

23
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:38,159
The last two points are related because this game is really built on experiences and the fantasies of the folks on the team and myself.

24
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:40,493
of

25
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:01,471
and she is coming off of a bad break and she has really pissed off all her exes and her parents.

26
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:06,393
So the game is about you coming home and trying to reconcile all those relationships.

27
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:12,996
And that's where the turn-based combat comes into play with the exes and then cooking through trying to talk to your parents through cooking.

28
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:15,377
And the skateboarding ties into the narrative as well.

29
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:19,819
So there's definitely some surreal elements which we'll get into.

30
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:21,678
of the game.

31
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:34,868
And I think we're, yeah, we're at 18 or so.

32
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:40,453
We're at 16 right now, but it varies from how on the production.

33
00:03:40,673 --> 00:03:42,775
And this has been about three years on this project.

34
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:46,498
Of those folks, nine is the art team.

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,662
But before I get to the art team, I want to say Justin and Anna are two main programmers.

36
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,344
None of this stuff is possible without them.

37
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:55,106
So artists, be best buds with your programmers.

38
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:58,949
Vijay did art direction concepts in 2D.

39
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,430
Emma is our 3D character in skinning.

40
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,514
Ong does, we have an animation team of one, which I know it's a lot of stuff, but he's a beast.

41
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:13,056
Alicia and Lisa are environment artists.

42
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:15,338
Darren does environments concepts in 2D.

43
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:16,658
Wade here, visual effects.

44
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,800
Ben, visual effects and tech art.

45
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,642
And myself, I'm still doing too many jobs, but I'm trying to do less.

46
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:24,123
with each project.

47
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:32,073
So we're fully remote, spread across four continents and seven cities.

48
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,516
So a lot of Slack and Miro.

49
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:39,442
We do all of our art meetings and design work on Miro these days, so for the async communication.

50
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:49,871
So this was the first, we had multiple iterations, but this was the first key piece of art that Vijay worked on to really set the style.

51
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:54,936
And we were trying to figure out how to build the demo and what we were going to do.

52
00:04:55,578 --> 00:05:02,283
This is an early version of Jala that changed, and a version of Sergio, which is, if you played the, there's a demo on Steam.

53
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:08,467
It's her first ex, her ex from third grade that still have feelings for her, and your parents watching.

54
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:14,872
So this is gonna really set the stage for what the style is gonna be, the color choices, the texture ideas and lighting.

55
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:25,079
And then this is another concept art Vijay did to showcase what the end of a fight could look like, and some of the elements that could come to life.

56
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,048
So Jala went through multiple iterations.

57
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:33,731
The first piece that actually we ever did for a pitch was the image on the left.

58
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:36,053
And so, you know, it had a little more realistic art style.

59
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:39,956
And then the second version is what you saw in the key piece of art.

60
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:44,759
And then as the story developed, you know, she's in her mid-20s.

61
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,163
We thought that she looked too young for the type of relationship drama that she had gone through.

62
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:57,638
We did the third version, still felt, didn't quite translate well to 3D and then the current version is on the right side.

63
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:13,667
One of the early things we did was figuring out how many Xs there were and what all the color palettes were, so we did some initial color keys for each of the characters to try to set sort of a mood, because each of the characters also has their own world.

64
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:21,354
As you get into a battle, it's in the real world, but it goes into what we call their fantastical inner worlds, and each of those has a local color palette.

65
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,372
Some of these names have changed, and we changed color palettes along the way.

66
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:33,475
So from that color palette, we developed the ideas for the various Xs.

67
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:39,878
And they all have kind of a range of color values that we picked from.

68
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,419
And this took a while to iterate on.

69
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,660
And this is like three or four iterations on some of them.

70
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,462
And really, the art direction and the art design

71
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,424
evolved with the narrative as we figured out the story, because we really didn't know what the story was initially.

72
00:06:52,464 --> 00:07:04,109
We knew Jella just has the worst luck with her relationships, but what that meant and what odor and who she battles, that came all through development.

73
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:13,833
So as we got into each of the exes' battles, there's a key color for each of the exes to design their world around.

74
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:22,790
And so these are some of the elements and some of the world ideas and kind of key pieces of art to define what those worlds look like.

75
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:25,906
Same with the costumes.

76
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:34,431
Each of the X's has a big wardrobe change as the battles start and they all tie into their key colors and personalities.

77
00:07:35,431 --> 00:07:43,196
And each battle is a little different based on when Jaller dated them and what problems they had together and they're trying to resolve that through.

78
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:48,538
It's weird because the battles aren't, they don't really hit each other.

79
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:51,420
It's like all these fantastical holograms and things like that.

80
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,381
So it's really the personification of

81
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:57,376
them have an argument shown through a turn-based combat.

82
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:03,942
And in between the combat, there's narrative choices and dialogue choices, and some lines do emotional damage.

83
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:10,708
And so there's a lot of mixture of sort of the physical movements as well as the dialogue choices.

84
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:19,677
And this is one of the early design process for Dia, one of the earlier exes that you meet.

85
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:30,342
The whole theme for this is around the idea that in her world, she's a queen, and her palace looks like a 90s Hype Williams music video.

86
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:33,924
So there's a lot of 90s music video inspirations for some of these sets.

87
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:39,527
And again, keying off her colors to get the look that matches her outfit as well as the environment.

88
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:46,360
And then she has three minions or crystals that support everything she says.

89
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:53,242
I tend to come in on narrative design and then blocking.

90
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,283
So we'll block out the levels once we have the fighting system figured out.

91
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,244
And then this is Alicia's work.

92
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:03,125
She came in over after the concept work to do some initial geo.

93
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:09,527
And then this is geo lighting effects and some shader work.

94
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:14,753
And so by the time we go through the process, a bunch of us have touched the levels.

95
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,636
I'll come back and do a final lighting pass and rim lighting.

96
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:19,877
So we have a custom-tuned shader.

97
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:20,958
This is all done in Unity.

98
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:24,120
Custom-tuned shader and standard lighting.

99
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:31,145
And this is Dia's intro as we start her battle.

100
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:11,295
So there's a little sample of the battle.

101
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:13,657
It's a fully voiced game.

102
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:15,158
We're just in the middle of doing that right now.

103
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:27,068
So the way the battle system works in the game, which also affects the art and design, is you have to figure out your opponent's weaknesses.

104
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:32,152
So Dia has three question marks up there on her UI there.

105
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:38,377
And so Jala has to use various taunts and figure out her weakness, and then you can follow up with an attack that matches.

106
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:29,453
So you see we do, we mix a lot of 2D and 3D, you know, for every time Jala taunts or Dia taunts, there's a lot of sprite work.

107
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:35,197
And these are all just, you know, sprites we put together in Photoshop and then we lay it out in the world.

108
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:38,619
And they have sorting changes so that they don't conflict with the environment.

109
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,640
They always draw behind the characters, but on top of the environment.

110
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:47,604
And then when you put somebody in a mood, there's, you know, obviously very, very over the top effects.

111
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:55,764
So cooking is a way to build your relationship back up with your parents.

112
00:11:55,844 --> 00:12:01,126
The game is laid out in chapters, and each chapter you can start the morning with cooking with your mom or dad.

113
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:09,469
You can go skate around in town, and there's random suitors that are trying to win your heart that your grandma's sending from India.

114
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:17,752
And then one of your exes will call you, and then really the big thing for that day is battling with your ex.

115
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,961
So there's a good example of how we set up our environments.

116
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,705
The top is the concept art, and the bottom is what a screenshot looks like in Unity.

117
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:28,006
So you can see it's very similar.

118
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:34,913
We bake in a lot of the lighting, sometimes into the texture, and a mixture of directional light and some point lights.

119
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:38,416
It's not very accurate, but we don't really care so much about that.

120
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:40,458
It's more for getting the look that we want.

121
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:46,951
So this was built by Lisa and Alicia came in to do some props and Ben does our shader work.

122
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:50,852
So we have one custom shader that we share for the environments as well as the characters.

123
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:55,214
And I came in and did a final lighting pass and post-processing.

124
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:00,195
So this is Jala's home.

125
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,396
You can come in, there's a cookbook.

126
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:04,917
There's different recipes that unlock.

127
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,879
And the cookbook is just frame animation.

128
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:23,213
So that's just the painting straight to the frame.

129
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:24,334
We did this the hard way.

130
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:26,516
We tried to model it out and tried to do lighting.

131
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,058
It just didn't look as good at all.

132
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,085
So when your mom eats, there's a memory of her.

133
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:38,588
This is her and your dad and their first date.

134
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:44,293
She'll never tell you she liked it though, so it's just, you know, that's what she's saying.

135
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,635
Again, we try to use 2D as much as possible where it made sense.

136
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:54,820
It's a lot faster for our concept artists to draw this than it is for us to build it, you know, the model out.

137
00:13:57,907 --> 00:14:02,489
UI, there's a ton of UI in this game as an RPG and all the different systems.

138
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,093
Yeah, as well as game directing, I did all the UI work with Vijay.

139
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:19,078
So I'll do all the layouts in Miro and really white box it out and then sketch it out in Photoshop and lay everything out with Unity.

140
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,580
And then Vijay came and did some illustration work on top of that.

141
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,901
But yeah, I'm still working on UI.

142
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:32,054
And for each chapter, there's a chapter card that we layer together and animate in.

143
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,715
There's a plugin called DoTween in Unity.

144
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,575
I use that everywhere.

145
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:43,757
Every piece of UI that's moving or any piece of 2D element that's moving, it's a kind of procedural animation system.

146
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:44,917
It's really easy to keyframe.

147
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:49,498
And it makes it a lot quicker than just using traditional animation support in Unity.

148
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:52,659
So any 2D element in the game, I just use DoTween.

149
00:14:55,031 --> 00:15:01,254
The cookbook was, I think it was four frames that was due tweened together and cross fading between it as it opens and closes.

150
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:18,442
In between the chapters, you can go to the Timber Hills map, and on the map is where Jalop, you know, decides where she wants to go skating or go back home cooking and go to the skate park, which is run by Soundy, a mascot bear.

151
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:20,664
There's a whole thread for that.

152
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:24,528
And this is what it looks like in game.

153
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:27,150
So concept to...

154
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:28,891
in-game version.

155
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:34,153
You also get notifications from each of the suitors, so you can do extra favors for them.

156
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,757
And again, it's a combination of 2D and 3D.

157
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:52,039
3D model for Jala and a bunch of 2D sprites layered with some polygons as well.

158
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,121
And these are little 3D models, flight models.

159
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:17,733
Official setup, because it's, I think we have 21 speaking characters, 18 actors that we're about to record.

160
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:23,336
We wanted to make sure, again, with one animator, how do we animate all these characters?

161
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:27,939
And we ended up doing blend shapes and a real basic set of phonemes.

162
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:34,463
I think there's eight shapes plus some extra smile, pout, teeth clench.

163
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:39,646
And we created an automated process to do a base pass where we can feed in the script.

164
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:51,595
to a spreadsheet, and then the WAV files, and it generates, and then we can go and hand clean up as we need it, but mostly it's animated, I mean automated, and it works out pretty well.

165
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:59,140
Speaking of animation, this is Eizo, our animation department.

166
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:08,648
He also does weird tricks when he's not animating, and a lot of that translates to, everything's keyframed in the game,

167
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,122
Yeah, he's a very prolific animator.

168
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:17,351
When we design the suitors, it's always fun to, you know, it's a combination of narrative and animation and, you know, everybody gets involved.

169
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:26,761
Being on a small team, I think that's what I really treasure, is that when we're designing these characters in these battles, everyone gets a chance to add to it.

170
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,723
It's been a fun project.

171
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,102
I think we're almost done.

172
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:34,285
So sometime this year we'll be out with it.

173
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,387
So that's Thirsty Suitors.

174
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:39,269
Thank you.

175
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:48,137
I know there's a lot to cover.

176
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:52,061
I just wanted to save some room for any questions if anybody had any questions about anything in the game.

177
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:00,229
Thanks for the insightful talk.

178
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,058
It's a really stunning vision with a really small art team that you have.

179
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:08,950
How long is your production cycle and how is it segmented?

180
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:29,555
Yeah, so we typically figure out what the game is in the beginning, so the first thing we did was prototype a suitor battle, and then that really went through a bunch of iterations until we figured out the current sort of combat, where it's like, okay, how much conversation, how much fighting moves, and what the elements are.

181
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:35,338
Once we had that down, we usually spent about, some of the levels, probably about two to three months.

182
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:43,522
There's a whole skate park that was in the first part of the video and that was like probably one of the biggest scenes and that took probably six months, a couple artists.

183
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:47,203
And then most of the sets are by one to two months.

184
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:53,626
And then characters, it varies depending on how many costume changes and effects, but those are probably

185
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:58,529
In a we have like monthly milestones that we kind of figure out what we're going to do.

186
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:07,473
So from design to Completion, it's probably two months per section of an area How long has it taken altogether so far?

187
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:08,013
Oh three years.

188
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:08,814
Okay.

189
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:15,397
Yeah three years and we started with a pretty full crew Well, maybe 12 and ramp up to 16.

190
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:15,837
Yeah.

191
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:16,717
Yeah.

192
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:17,358
Cool.

193
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:17,698
Thank you.

194
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:17,918
Yeah

195
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,112
Hey, looks great.

196
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:29,378
Um, I was wondering you at the beginning of the talk had cultural like inspiration stuff as the last two points.

197
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:35,162
And I'm wondering if you could go into more of that and how that's played into the different characters in the game and the setting.

198
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:41,585
Yeah, I mean, each of the exes is based on someone from the team or multiple stories that we talk a lot about.

199
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:46,267
There's a lot of immigrants on the team and we share a lot of shared trauma.

200
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:50,789
So, yeah, a lot of it's just based on our personal stories of people we know.

201
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:53,110
I mean, some of it's definitely, like, fantastical.

202
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,893
There are things in the game that I would never say to my mom, but we let the player decide if they want to or not.

203
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:02,695
Yeah, so it was interesting.

204
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:15,666
One of the exes is South African, our producer is South African, so we did a lot of, you know, she talked to her parents and we did a lot of research about like what's the region of South Africa we want to derive the visual look from.

205
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:17,387
And then we're casting.

206
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:19,068
Casting's been kind of difficult.

207
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:26,454
It's a very specific game and I wanted to, for each of the exes or characters, I want to be very specific about who we cast.

208
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:34,393
Yeah, so everything in the game is very culturally represented and it comes from the team.

209
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:38,356
The game actually started, when I first pitched it, it was a game about arranged marriage.

210
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:47,503
But we decided not to do that because none of us on the team had direct experience with arranged marriage and we didn't think we could speak to it.

211
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:49,184
well.

212
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:55,468
So that's when we turned it from Arranged Marriage to JALA and her personal relationships.

213
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,090
Thank you.

214
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,633
So I'm obsessed with this.

215
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:07,714
I feel so seen by this character, first of all, like literally attacked in every single slide in a good way.

216
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:25,618
But what I want to ask is about, you know, some challenges around designing a character like her, because as an Indian gamer musician, like in that type of vibe, age group, et cetera, I also recognize that even though it's like, oh, my God, a win, I feel seen.

217
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:29,279
At the same time, we have so many different experiences because

218
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:30,259
like this.

219
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:46,419
Yeah, we know we're not going to please everybody, right?

220
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:49,941
And that was, from the beginning, we're like, that's not a thing we're trying to do.

221
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,862
So Jala is half Sri Lankan, half Indian.

222
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:56,224
Meghna, our main writer, she's Indian, and I'm Sri Lankan.

223
00:22:56,284 --> 00:22:59,005
And that's sort of like, we took our inspirations from that.

224
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:04,348
The colorism is also, you're familiar, in South Asia is a big thing.

225
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:09,290
So we were very mindful about like, Jala and her ex, Tyler, that's in the cover.

226
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:13,112
You know, seeing two

227
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,422
You don't typically see two dark-skinned women on any cover.

228
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:26,464
And we also made sure some of the men characters were lighter-skinned than the women, because typically it's the other way around.

229
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:36,267
So a lot of it is very specific, and we're not trying to really attract all South Asians.

230
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:40,709
So we thought if we focused on the character's journey, then we could be more specific about Jala.

231
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:42,149
And that's how we approach it.

232
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,970
And we're still going to get people that are probably not going to be happy with it.

233
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:51,653
talk a little bit more about how you decide between choosing 2D or 3D for a particular asset?

234
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:08,841
Yeah, a lot of the times we did it, let's build it 3D, and then we spent months doing it and realized that's like the bad approach.

235
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,142
And then we go, let's just paint it.

236
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:18,570
So for the cooking, there's at the end where she's showcasing the food to her parents.

237
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,471
We made that sure the camera never changes.

238
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:22,473
So it's like it's animated and it's fixed.

239
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:24,435
And then we painted something just for that.

240
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:45,935
And then for the map, and when that worked out, then we're like, oh, let's do the map that way, let's do the memories that way, let's do some of the UI that way, let's do some of the moods that way, and it just kind of expanded, just added a little more, and there wasn't really much tech to it, it's just standard Unity sprites, and sorting was the only issue, and then that kind of extends to the effects, the look of the effects as well.

241
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:48,799
So there was no master plan.

242
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,687
It's just, hey, our concept artist is really good at doing this versus what we can do in 3D.

243
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:58,654
And let's try to utilize the special powers of people on the team more.

244
00:24:59,275 --> 00:24:59,876
Yeah, that's awesome.

245
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:00,096
Thanks.

246
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:03,650
Hello, sorry.

247
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:23,901
I think the art looks really good, although I'm curious about some of the game design decisions, mainly pertaining to the different gameplay styles and how they play into the narrative, because you see in the RPG moments, it's like QTEs and turn-based combat, while there's more action-y stuff when you're not in conflict, so I was curious on why you decided to go that direction.

248
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:27,827
Just for pacing and it worked out for the narrative we wanted to do.

249
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:32,488
So the cooking is very action-y cooking, like the combat.

250
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:35,788
But instead of battling somebody else, you're trying to win your mom's approval.

251
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:36,788
There's an approval meter.

252
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:39,949
And she'll comment on every time when you do something.

253
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:41,929
She'll never say you did well.

254
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:50,291
And then some recipes are harder or less hard, depending on... When you're cooking with your dad, it's a whole different vibe.

255
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:52,192
in the game.

256
00:25:52,993 --> 00:26:01,440
And then when, I think in the video, when you fall in battle, there's a giant version of your dad that picks you up and then throws you back into battle.

257
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:09,887
Yeah, so we'd really try to key in on each of the characters and you can summon your auntie when you need to buff up and things like that.

258
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:15,792
There's a bunch of different summons that are like folks that you, might be some exes or your mom or

259
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:41,140
Whatever how it works out in terms of the mechanics We started with the idea of doing turn-based combat because we thought it lends itself to really for these narrative moments where we can have conversations Combat and conversations instead of doing like at the beginning as more of like a cutscene approach That's really a decision because the again the the conversational moments and decisions are as important as the the action that you do All right.

260
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,400
Thank you.

261
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:41,720
Yep

262
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:45,426
A bit of a specific tech question here.

263
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:54,866
With those 2D assets, were those lit or unlit, or just default Unity sprites, or how did you end up matching the lighting of a 2D asset with the 3D world?

264
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,108
They're completely unlit.

265
00:26:56,228 --> 00:27:02,310
So there's just like straight PSDs in a texture sheet brought into Unity.

266
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,291
And then they're painted with general lighting and shadows.

267
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:15,713
Again, our lighting isn't so strong that you, I mean, if you've stared at it, you probably noticed the lighting directions, not exact, but for the moment it works.

268
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:16,214
Sure.

269
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:16,894
Thank you.

270
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:20,595
Anything else?

271
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:21,655
Okay.

272
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:25,151
Hi.

273
00:27:25,332 --> 00:27:29,393
You mentioned that you have a lot of remote team and team all over the place.

274
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:39,257
How would you say, because it seems like there's a lot of interconnection between the art and the programming and the design, more so than most games.

275
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:45,480
I was wondering how you found success in making sure everybody's on the same page when not even in the same time zone.

276
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:50,204
Yeah, so we do, Mondays we do stand-ups at 4 p.m.

277
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:51,045
West Coast time.

278
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:54,466
That's when Beijing's waking up and Brisbane is waking up.

279
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:58,928
And so everyone's almost like either end of their day or beginning of their day.

280
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:04,011
So we do a lot of like what we're going to do for the week and any issues to talk about live.

281
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:08,053
And then I do my narrative mornings like 8 in the morning.

282
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:13,355
And then sometimes I'll go over stuff with the Australians when they wake up.

283
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:18,059
So I'm kind of doing on both ends, but we do a four day work week.

284
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,380
We've been four days for two years.

285
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,122
So Thursday afternoons at 4 p.m.

286
00:28:22,162 --> 00:28:25,345
we'll do a play test with the whole team with wherever the build is.

287
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:30,209
And all those notes go into Notion and gets assigned to a different task.

288
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:34,473
And then after the play test we all hang out and just chat and check out games.

289
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,995
So that's how we kind of build a culture for over three years.

290
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:48,609
I have a giant beatmap that is the story for the game and what happens when, so everyone knows where things are and it gets updated as we change for narrative.

291
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:52,648
And then we have reference for each of the characters and each of the environments.

292
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:56,810
We have art meetings every two weeks, I think on Wednesdays.

293
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,392
And there's a giant mural that has all the art meetings from the last three years.

294
00:29:02,152 --> 00:29:06,514
So we try to not do too many meetings, but there's like the three we try to sync up on.

295
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:10,876
Everything else is on Slack, or notes on mural to each other, or notion tasks.

296
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:12,497
Thank you.

297
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:12,998
Yep.

298
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:17,920
Anybody else?

299
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:21,445
Awesome.

300
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:22,627
