1
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:09,217
OK, so my name is Stefan Englund.

2
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:10,378
I come from Finland.

3
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:14,240
It's a bit cold there right now, so it's kind of nice to

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,343
be here in very warm San Francisco.

5
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:22,967
I work at Supercell as a game designer, and I've now worked

6
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:25,909
in the Clash Royale team for roughly one year.

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,713
I joined the team really soon after the global launch, but I

8
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:32,414
had the privilege.

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:37,798
to follow the development very closely as I was working at Supercell in other teams.

10
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:41,940
I played very actively in all the internal playables.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,900
We are a small team.

12
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:45,301
There's a photo of the team.

13
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,202
Current developer team.

14
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:54,985
So we're 16 and I'm the only one with the title Game Designer there.

15
00:00:55,225 --> 00:01:00,207
Everybody is very much involved in all kinds of different aspects of design there.

16
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:01,708
So everybody is kind of a designer.

17
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:07,748
And we are super independent, just like other teams at Supercell,

18
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:10,909
and basically all the decisions regarding Clash Royale,

19
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:13,711
like the game itself, is done by this group.

20
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:15,492
So it's cool.

21
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:20,394
My main areas that I work on is card balancing,

22
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,496
the game's economy, and system design.

23
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:27,338
So that gives me a pretty holistic view on the whole game.

24
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:34,832
But I, of course, run all decisions by the team and we discuss everything very openly.

25
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:41,815
In this talk, I will focus on card balancing, which is perhaps the part that I'm most passionate about.

26
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:46,576
And I feel that it's also the one that I've learned most about during this past year.

27
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:49,538
So, let's get going.

28
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:55,420
So, I'm going to talk about a few topics here.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,220
First of all, I'm going to...

30
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:01,020
talk a little bit about Clash Royale, like what is Clash Royale,

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,303
introduce the game a little bit and talk about some things like how we

32
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,785
do the upgrade levels and how we handle the balancing there.

33
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:13,868
It's kind of like a background information for the rest of the talk.

34
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:16,330
Then I'm going to talk about our goals for balancing.

35
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:21,613
Why do we do it and what are our thoughts and define some terms here.

36
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:24,935
Then I'll talk about some of the key principles we have.

37
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:28,838
when we think about balancing, what kind of things do we think about there?

38
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:35,522
And then how do we decide which cards we then rebalance,

39
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:38,384
what are the things we think about and take into account there.

40
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,466
So, let's get started. Clash Royale.

41
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:44,448
First of all, how many here have played Clash Royale?

42
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:47,590
Okay, quite a few.

43
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:51,213
Nice. How many have not played Clash Royale?

44
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,469
Okay, there's a few. It's a free game, you should try it, it's pretty nice.

45
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,311
Alright.

46
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,656
So, well anyways, Clash Royale, so it's a

47
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:07,799
real-time PvP game, and it has its roots in

48
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:12,683
collectible card games and MOBAs, but it's like a bit

49
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:18,067
of a mix of those genres and then tailored for mobile.

50
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,548
And in Clash Royale you...

51
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:23,767
collect cards, upgrade them, you build a deck of eight cards,

52
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:27,208
and then you go to battle against random players

53
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:27,808
around the world.

54
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,590
And it's real-time PVP.

55
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,891
You generate this resource called Elixir

56
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:37,152
during the course of the game, and then you

57
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:40,274
use it to cast cards on the play field

58
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,994
and to rotate your deck at the same time.

59
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:43,995
And you have like three minutes.

60
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:48,177
plus one minute of overtime to try and destroy all the enemy

61
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:48,577
towers.

62
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,218
And usually, pretty much 30 seconds into the game,

63
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:53,758
there's already total mayhem and chaos on the field.

64
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,759
And the units, they move and act by themselves

65
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,619
when you deploy them.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,260
And there's still plenty of decision-making

67
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,181
to do with things like timing the placement,

68
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,962
and managing the elixir, optimizing the deck cycle,

69
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:09,303
defending, counter-pushing, et cetera.

70
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,143
Something I want to talk about is the.

71
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:16,461
stats we have in the card, or the cards basically.

72
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,182
They actually have quite a lot of stats.

73
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:21,225
Like the knight is like a very vanilla, very basic card

74
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:21,605
in the game.

75
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,107
And even that has quite a lot of attributes.

76
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:26,650
So I'd like to think of these like.

77
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,054
compare the cards in a way a little bit more to like,

78
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,456
let's say, League of Legends heroes than,

79
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:34,457
like let's say, Hearthstone cards.

80
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:37,880
There's way more like parameters that you can tweak

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,700
and that affect it.

82
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,283
And so even like a vanilla card has that many like things,

83
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:44,365
not to talk about them, like a more complex card,

84
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:47,167
like Electro Wizard that shoots multiple targets,

85
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:49,289
stuns them, and when you deploy it,

86
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:51,370
it does a zap effect and so forth.

87
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:57,118
So from balancing perspective, it's of course nice that there's lots of these parameters that you can tweak.

88
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:02,361
You can do like a really small thing like adjust a little bit of hit speed here or movement there

89
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:06,423
and it can tweak it just a little bit to the card.

90
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:10,785
But one thing that's tricky there is that it actually makes...

91
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,515
it's a bit more challenging to mathematically balance the cards

92
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:19,457
to figure out that this is a good spot for the card

93
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:21,219
compared to, let's say, Magic the Gathering

94
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,222
where you have mana cost, attack, and defense.

95
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,384
And that's basically it for a vanilla card.

96
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:29,806
So it's a bit trickier.

97
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:32,228
And of course, also to not make it too easy,

98
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:37,633
we have then the upgrade levels and the different rarities.

99
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,154
So I want to, like...

100
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,838
use a few minutes to explain how we do that,

101
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,900
like how we handle that thing.

102
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:49,803
So I'll start with the commons.

103
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,665
So commons, there's 13 levels of commons, right?

104
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:55,487
And for each level, when you upgrade it,

105
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,710
we give exactly 10% damage and 10% hit points more.

106
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,702
But we don't adjust any other stats.

107
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,283
We don't adjust the hit speed.

108
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:07,105
We don't adjust movement speed or radius or anything like

109
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,387
that, because when we touch only these values, we ensure

110
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,590
that the interactions between the cars actually remain the

111
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,832
same from when they are at the same level.

112
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:22,116
So as an example, archers, one archer would two-shot one

113
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:24,318
goblin at level one.

114
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:28,095
And at level 13, the interaction is exactly the same,

115
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:30,095
but the damage and hit points are just higher.

116
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,857
So this helps keep me sane.

117
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:38,159
So how do we handle, then, the different rarities?

118
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,020
It's actually kind of simple.

119
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,901
We start at the higher level, but then we

120
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:48,403
upgrade them in the same method, like 10% each.

121
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:53,685
So basically, a level 1 rare has the value.

122
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:55,752
of a level three common.

123
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,374
And an epic starts at level six,

124
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:02,235
and a legendary, a level one legendary

125
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:06,077
is basically like a level nine common.

126
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:09,898
And then the place, and what we have there

127
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,459
is this thing we call the tournament cap.

128
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,101
That's a card cap level that we use in tournaments,

129
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:17,302
and also in friendly matches in the game.

130
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,603
We actually like not only cap cards there,

131
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:21,984
but we even level up cards to that cap.

132
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:23,745
And that is the spot where we.

133
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:31,416
balance the cards. So when I make values for a new legendary card, I balance it, kind of

134
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:39,420
compare it to the level 9 commons and see from there. So this ensures that the interactions

135
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:47,825
remain the same at all equivalent levels. And then it basically ensures that at max level,

136
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:53,488
if everything is at max level, then we have the same balance that we have at the tournament

137
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:57,926
And then we think of the level differences there.

138
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:00,888
Then more of a bit of a spice to the game,

139
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,370
or something you can specialize in things and so forth.

140
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,312
So it's like a spice thing.

141
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:07,933
But the main thing is to balance it there.

142
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:10,815
And something to note also that I want to mention

143
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,517
is that between rarities, it's not meant

144
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:16,299
to be more powerful as such.

145
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,482
The idea is that the more rare the card is,

146
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,761
the more exotic mechanics we introduce,

147
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:25,842
and the more advanced mechanics.

148
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:28,884
So as I had earlier, the knight, very vanilla card.

149
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:29,425
It's a common.

150
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:31,667
And then we have electro wizard with all kinds

151
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:33,428
of crazy abilities, and it's a legendary.

152
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:34,609
So that's the idea.

153
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,812
And the same applies to when we go upwards in arenas.

154
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:41,174
The abilities get a bit more complicated.

155
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:44,397
It's also cool for introducing the cards gradually

156
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,359
and introducing mechanics gradually for the players.

157
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,181
All right, so that was the basics.

158
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,083
So let's jump to like.

159
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,571
the actual topics. So let's talk about the goals of balancing.

160
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:07,679
It's usually quite good to figure out why you're doing something and

161
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,661
think about the goals of what you're doing. Then you'll kind of have something to aim for.

162
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:15,604
So for balancing, I would say

163
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:19,066
it's fun to have fun and interesting gameplay. Also includes

164
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:19,646
depth and so forth.

165
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:25,855
And then have variety, so there's a variety of different play styles and

166
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,957
different deck archetypes that are viable.

167
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:33,781
And then the game feels fresh, both with new cards making the game feel fresh,

168
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:38,845
but also that in between games you have surprising moments and stuff like that.

169
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:39,906
So the game feels fresh.

170
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:45,370
And if I would have to sum this in one sentence, it would be that...

171
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:49,473
you want to have a healthy metagame.

172
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:52,656
So that's the ultimate goal, the quest for the healthy metagame.

173
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:57,920
So let's define what this healthy metagame really now

174
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,161
means.

175
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,362
So let's start with metagame.

176
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:05,647
So first of all, metagame is not exactly a dictionary term.

177
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:09,170
And I didn't find anywhere a proper definition for it.

178
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,852
And it can mean many things, even

179
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,514
like game developers seem to talk about it

180
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,135
with different meanings.

181
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:15,275
But.

182
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:21,964
Players of PVP games and developers of PVP games, when

183
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:26,966
they talk about balancing, they usually, like metagame is

184
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,066
kind of an established term.

185
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:31,347
And for the purpose of this talk now, metagame means the

186
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:35,028
cards, combinations, and strategies that the community

187
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:37,089
at large have found most effective.

188
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:41,090
So the metagame is not something that the developers

189
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,251
create as such.

190
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:46,192
And unfortunately, they rarely even predict perfectly.

191
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:46,472
But.

192
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,343
Balancing is then the tool that we can use to steer it in

193
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,164
directions that we want.

194
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:58,406
But as a player and a developer, I actually find

195
00:10:59,347 --> 00:11:02,489
the concept of metagame quite intriguing and interesting.

196
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,291
I feel it's kind of like the idea that we are the toy

197
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:09,833
makers, and we create toys, but we don't really know what

198
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,474
the kids will figure out to do with them.

199
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,655
And usually, it's something totally

200
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:14,635
different that we intended.

201
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:16,775
But that's also exciting.

202
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:18,556
So that's metagame.

203
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:22,859
So what's then healthy metagame and an unhealthy metagame?

204
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:31,244
So you could think of it as being a state of fun, variety,

205
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:31,904
and freshness.

206
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:36,267
And to cover the total extremes, let's first look at

207
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,028
what would be a broken metagame.

208
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:42,451
It's not like a realistic state, but a broken metagame

209
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:43,792
would be where you have nothing.

210
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:44,172
It's like.

211
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:46,343
Yeah, it's broken.

212
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:48,724
So an example would be this type of card.

213
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:52,406
You just instantly win the game by playing it.

214
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:54,326
It doesn't make any sense.

215
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:56,727
But there's no strategy.

216
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:57,868
There's no interaction.

217
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:58,748
There's no variety.

218
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,229
It's just stupid.

219
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:03,010
But this is really not a realistic state,

220
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,570
if you think about it.

221
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:08,772
Already common sense says that you can't make a card like

222
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:08,972
that.

223
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,634
So what's then a perfect metagame, which is kind of

224
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:20,145
unrealistic. So that would be like everything is in perfect balance, everything is in seamless harmony,

225
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:24,690
everybody loves everything in the game and like everything is just like absolutely fantastic.

226
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:30,637
Like it's not really like, it's kind of utopia, it's nice to kind of maybe strive there and...

227
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:36,156
think about it and dream about it, but we need to be honest with ourselves.

228
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:41,878
People have different tastes and we can't really reach it.

229
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:44,459
So instead we have something in between.

230
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,680
We have unhealthy and healthy metagames.

231
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,481
The unhealthy state might be a bit tilted.

232
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:54,362
You maybe have only two viable playstyles,

233
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:55,802
there's not so much variety.

234
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,483
Maybe it's kind of fun for a while.

235
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,641
And a healthy one is like there's several things that are going on.

236
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:08,602
But it might be maybe less varied, but it's really fun or something.

237
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:12,763
And one way to look at this is kind of like think of it as a diet.

238
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:18,225
So it's kind of like, you know, it's nice for a week in GDC, but you know, you kind of...

239
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:26,188
Like, yeah, you know that it's not good for you in the long run, and you will kind of feel bad afterwards.

240
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:27,708
And the healthy one is like...

241
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:32,374
That's where you want to be, and you know that it feels good

242
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:33,755
in the long run to be there.

243
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:37,619
So all right, this slide kind of looks like we're talking

244
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,101
about something completely different here.

245
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:40,763
All right.

246
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,345
So that's the definition of unhealthy and

247
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,026
healthy metagames.

248
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:49,312
So then let's talk about some of the key principles we have

249
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:50,913
for balancing.

250
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,591
So first, this is how we do it.

251
00:13:57,772 --> 00:13:58,392
That's basically it.

252
00:13:58,692 --> 00:13:59,133
Any questions?

253
00:13:59,173 --> 00:13:59,253
No?

254
00:13:59,273 --> 00:13:59,633
Just kidding.

255
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,194
So make everything overpowered.

256
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:05,778
Or well, make everything feel overpowered, to be more

257
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:06,078
precise.

258
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:09,581
So let me illustrate this a little bit.

259
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:12,063
So let's take chess, for example.

260
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,845
I mean, it's an archetype of a very balanced game, right?

261
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:18,368
And a game that would only have chess, soldiers, duking it

262
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,610
out, that would be extremely balanced.

263
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,119
It couldn't be more balanced.

264
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,702
But to be honest, it doesn't sound to me that much fun

265
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:27,723
and exciting.

266
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:33,007
But overpowered, that's kind of like the Marvel Avengers.

267
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:36,330
So certainly, they're all overpowered.

268
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,873
And we could argue about who's more overpowered than the other.

269
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:43,536
But they all have their unique traits, their unique moments,

270
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:47,199
when they are the best and kind of balanced, in a way.

271
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:53,530
between each other. So the concept of making everything feel overpowered is about making

272
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,712
everything fun and exciting. And this has of course a lot to do also with character design

273
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:05,155
and art style, but that's not the topic now. So how do you, with game balancing, make

274
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:07,976
something, everything feel overpowered? So how would you...

275
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,460
make these superheroes?

276
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,582
Or in Clash Royale's case, how would you make all the cards

277
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:14,863
feel overpowered?

278
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:18,727
So an alternative way to say this is each card

279
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:19,747
needs its moment.

280
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,552
So there needs to be some purpose for the card.

281
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:28,735
Or more technically, there needs to be enough situations

282
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:32,138
where the card can bring huge positive value.

283
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:36,422
And you can then switch out here the card to heroes,

284
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:37,703
spells, characters.

285
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:42,194
whatever the game has. So an example from Clash Royale of a

286
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:50,097
card that feels overpowered is Pekka. She's this like giant

287
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:54,719
robotic warrior thingy that deals insane amount of damage to

288
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:58,540
a single target and can take a lot of punches. So she can

289
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,501
really feel overpowered in those moments.

290
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:04,949
when she's smashing through some really powerful unit and then

291
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:07,010
still going for a big counter push.

292
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:09,232
And if she reaches the tower, she can easily,

293
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:11,393
with a few swings, take it down.

294
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,095
So Pekka is super overpowered.

295
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:15,835
Everything is good.

296
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:18,476
But unfortunately, everything needs a counter.

297
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:20,257
Too bad for Pekka.

298
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,318
And for Pekka, there are actually plenty.

299
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,941
So in fact, she's considered by top players.

300
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:30,378
to be one of the weaker cards in the game,

301
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:33,981
because she's so easy to distract and counter

302
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:36,323
with actually very low value cards.

303
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:38,505
But that's actually the thing.

304
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:40,287
That's what keeps her in check, and that's

305
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:43,770
what makes gameplay interesting and allows the metagame

306
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,431
to evolve.

307
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:48,655
So you have these counters to cards,

308
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,037
but you also have the counters to the counters,

309
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:52,218
et cetera, et cetera.

310
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,800
So the metagame evolves.

311
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:58,105
And this is basically what makes everything that feels

312
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,866
overpowered to not actually be overpowered.

313
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,728
And another thing that's good with having multiple counters

314
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,109
is that it acts as a safety net.

315
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,832
And yeah, this pretty recent card, Elite Barbarians.

316
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:16,573
If there are players who have played it, you might know what

317
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:16,834
happened.

318
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:19,535
So it's two very fast and strong barbarians, and they

319
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,656
are extremely devastating when left alone.

320
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:26,549
But when it was released, it was actually very, very weak,

321
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,310
like kind of the weakest card in the game.

322
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,451
And it was met with a lot of disappointment.

323
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:32,491
That's from the forums.

324
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,753
So yeah, my bad for the value, sorry.

325
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:37,933
Really.

326
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:41,635
So a few weeks later, we buffed it.

327
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,216
But it was a bit too much.

328
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:47,117
And my bad again.

329
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:48,837
So sorry.

330
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:52,118
Sorry also for players, if they watch the video ever.

331
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,658
So I definitely learned some lessons there.

332
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,380
And it was really very powerful indeed.

333
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,282
And for a few weeks, we had a pretty action-packed gameplay

334
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:06,183
when they were smashing through all the towers.

335
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:10,945
But the good thing is that the tools to counter it existed in

336
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:13,666
the game, and players did use them, and players did figure

337
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,006
out them.

338
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:16,667
So having counters for everything acts as a safety

339
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:16,848
net.

340
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,583
So it's not an excuse to make bad balancing, but I do think

341
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,524
that it's inevitable that mistakes happen.

342
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:30,646
So having a safety net there, having multiple counters, can

343
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:33,567
turn this disaster into perhaps a little tilted and

344
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:37,088
unhealthy metagame.

345
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:41,649
So make everything full overpowered, but everything

346
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:42,590
also needs a counter.

347
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,050
And something I have to.

348
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:49,183
say here though is that these two principles were heavily, heavily inspired by Blizzard.

349
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:58,166
So Blizzard's approach to multiplayer game design as presented back in GDC 2008 by Rob Bardo

350
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:04,888
was really inspirational talk. And in general like Blizzard's games have really been and can

351
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:11,571
continue to be a great inspiration at Supercell. So yeah, I wanted to say that don't take my word

352
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:13,211
for it like for the stuff that I mentioned like.

353
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:18,039
So yeah, you can find actually this talk online still,

354
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:18,900
at least the audio of it.

355
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,900
So it's worth checking out.

356
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,140
All right, so make everything feel OP,

357
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:24,141
but everything needs a counter.

358
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,041
So let's move on.

359
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:29,542
So a little bit about new cards and old cards.

360
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,143
So something that's important to us

361
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,683
is to make new cards meaningful.

362
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:38,144
Because if the goals of balancing

363
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,425
are to offer fun, variety, and freshness,

364
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,296
going to make sense that you have to make the new card meaningful. If the new card is not used, it

365
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:51,059
doesn't meet any of these criterias. So you're going to have to make it meaningful enough so

366
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:56,641
it's used. And something that I want to bring up here is that we often get these comments and

367
00:19:56,661 --> 00:20:03,044
speculations about how new cards are overpowered, so we just monetize them then. But the thing

368
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,004
is that that's not true.

369
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,283
There are, of course, places where we think about

370
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:07,483
monetization, obviously.

371
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:11,005
But card balancing is just not one of them.

372
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:15,088
And I honestly think that it's hurtful, both in the short

373
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:17,429
term, but especially in the long run, if you have

374
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,752
monetization as an actual goal for balancing.

375
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:25,174
Because it's just like it contradicts with the other

376
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:27,235
goals, with the actual goals.

377
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:31,297
So yeah, just wanted to clear that out.

378
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:35,456
So making new cards meaningful is important.

379
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:37,817
So they actually have an impact on the game.

380
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,258
So you could say we aim to make new cards balanced,

381
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:43,478
but we kind of round up a little bit.

382
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:47,399
Hopefully not like elite barbarians up a little bit.

383
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,700
But an important part in making new cards meaningful

384
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,441
is to try to fill a gameplay gap.

385
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:56,341
So maybe there's some spell or units that's missing,

386
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:00,202
or something needs like alternatives or counters.

387
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:05,145
So just to make sure that the new card clearly has its own spot

388
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:09,468
and isn't just like a strictly better version of some old card in the game.

389
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:13,291
So as an example I could mention the Ice Spirit.

390
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:18,914
It's a single one elixir unit that sacrifices itself, deals a bit of damage

391
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:22,417
and then freezes the building and units that it hits.

392
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:28,341
And the idea kind of came from having an alternative to the one elixir skeleton

393
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:30,642
which was the only one elixir card at that time.

394
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:35,309
And Zap was and still is a very versatile card in the game.

395
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:37,449
So that stuns the enemy.

396
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:40,029
So this was kind of also meant as an alternative to Zap.

397
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,710
And then we had, prior to this update,

398
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,150
we had released the Fire Spirits.

399
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,431
And it was kind of a cool mechanic

400
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,091
where they sacrifice themselves and explode

401
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:49,131
kind of like as a fireball.

402
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,812
So we thought that we could utilize the same mechanic

403
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:54,912
and do a more chill version of the Fire Spirits.

404
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,013
So having a purpose for each card.

405
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,685
is important and it also ties to our strategy of keeping the total card count reasonable.

406
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:11,751
It's also important for us to keep old cards relevant though,

407
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:14,133
so like the iconic Baby Dragon and Mini Pekkas.

408
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:20,458
So we do rebalancing of old cards to keep them relevant and in the changing metagame.

409
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:25,529
And whenever we do that, we aim to stay true to the soul of

410
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:25,909
the card.

411
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:28,891
So essentially, that means that we try to avoid these

412
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:31,633
complete reworks of the cards.

413
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:37,278
And instead, we do smaller changes to the basics.

414
00:22:37,318 --> 00:22:40,100
This also makes it a bit easier to predict, because a

415
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,442
complete rework is essentially like making a new card.

416
00:22:44,423 --> 00:22:47,045
But another thing that's important is that when there

417
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,366
are a lot of players playing the card, so it

418
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:53,276
This way, it can play like it played before.

419
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:58,299
So while we communicate about the changes quite a lot, not

420
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,159
everybody reads it.

421
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:02,722
So it's nice if the players can still play the same way.

422
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:05,223
They can deploy it on the same spot and play it very

423
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,985
similarly, so it feels familiar.

424
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:13,568
So make new cards meaningful, but keep old cards relevant.

425
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:19,446
And then something we decided very early on is that we want to keep on rebalancing.

426
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:23,170
We want to do regular, semi-regular balance changes.

427
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,251
We've been doing balance changes roughly once per month.

428
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,754
And there's no exact science to this cadence.

429
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:35,701
It just felt like that was when the metagame felt like it was getting a bit stale.

430
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:40,305
So there was this feel of that we could have a little bit of change.

431
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,206
So we did that.

432
00:23:43,217 --> 00:23:44,718
we chose the one month cadence.

433
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:47,800
And at the beginning, the reactions

434
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,302
were a bit negative, maybe, towards the balance changes.

435
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:55,184
But over time, as we just kept on doing them,

436
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:56,965
because we felt that it was important for the game,

437
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,767
players started to actually appreciate them,

438
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:01,708
and they started to look forward to them as well.

439
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:05,185
So it was a good thing.

440
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:09,168
But there's also like the metagame really needs also time

441
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,329
to evolve by itself.

442
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,992
So you kind of need to find the sweet spot for your game.

443
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:16,355
Like what is, how do you want to approach this?

444
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:21,720
And an extreme of like not giving it enough time

445
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,302
is that players might start to take it as a crutch.

446
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:25,083
Like that they.

447
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:29,350
that instead of figuring out counters to the current meta

448
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,732
decks and so forth, they actually just roll their thumbs

449
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:34,773
and wait you to do a balance change.

450
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:39,276
So it becomes a balancing act of being a crutch

451
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:42,719
and then managing the frustration of the players

452
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,560
when you're not addressing imbalances.

453
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:50,804
And something that we notice when

454
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,565
doing these different kinds of changes

455
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:53,846
is the buffs are.

456
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,966
we learned that buffs are nicer than nerfs.

457
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,848
And it's quite natural, it makes sense.

458
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:00,671
Because nerfs tend to hit cards that are used a lot

459
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:02,013
and that are very powerful.

460
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:05,296
So there are a lot of players who get a bit disappointed.

461
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:07,979
And so it's not something that we want to do lightheartedly,

462
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,603
but we of course do it when it's needed.

463
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:16,608
And it makes more sense to nerf one card than the buff,

464
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:17,108
like 69.

465
00:25:18,622 --> 00:25:21,066
So, and buffs on the other hand, they hit cards,

466
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:23,229
there's not that many use, so those who use them

467
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:25,232
are of course super happy, and those who don't,

468
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:27,035
like, they might be happy that there's a new card

469
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:28,557
coming in into the meta maybe,

470
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:30,600
or then they just feel indifferent

471
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,522
because they don't have to deal with that card usually.

472
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:35,266
So balance changes are always complex.

473
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:39,212
complex things so communication is very important.

474
00:25:39,652 --> 00:25:42,133
So it's not just about informing players that hey,

475
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,973
this is the change we did, but it really helps

476
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:47,434
with managing expectations because the buffs are never,

477
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:50,575
we never intend buffs to make the card

478
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:52,155
the most used card in the game.

479
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:56,517
Likewise with nerfs, we never mean to kill the card.

480
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:57,937
It's still supposed to be relevant,

481
00:25:57,997 --> 00:25:59,157
it's still supposed to be used,

482
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:02,978
but just be slightly weaker and be in a better place.

483
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,620
So when communicating, it's a good spot to give reasons,

484
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,481
background, and some context to why the balance

485
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:11,161
changes were made.

486
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:14,482
We always make this in-game post about the changes, and

487
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:20,624
then we have in our blog a bit more context and a bit longer

488
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:21,185
descriptions.

489
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:26,627
And then also, what helps a lot is that there's a very

490
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:29,307
active community of YouTubers, streamers.

491
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:35,447
and so forth that are doing even more in-depth views

492
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:37,728
of the changes and all the ramifications,

493
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,228
all the indirect changes, et cetera.

494
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:44,089
So keep on balancing regularly,

495
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,530
knowing that buffs are nicer than nerfs.

496
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,031
So that's basically like these key principles.

497
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:58,713
So next up is to talk about

498
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:04,390
how we decide which cards to rebalance.

499
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:10,917
All right, so there's 70 cards in the game right now.

500
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,500
But it doesn't really make sense to tamper with all of them

501
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,122
at once, obviously.

502
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:17,523
It's too big of a change.

503
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:23,008
And the ramifications become impossible to predict.

504
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:24,470
So how do we decide then?

505
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:28,658
I think it boils down to like three parts.

506
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:33,240
It's we listen to the players, and then we utilize data.

507
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,542
But at the end of the day, it really boils down to these two

508
00:27:37,582 --> 00:27:38,922
kinds really make the decision for you.

509
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:41,604
In the end, it boils down to intuition and just like

510
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:43,264
knowing your game.

511
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:45,725
All right.

512
00:27:46,006 --> 00:27:48,067
So let's talk about listening to players a little bit.

513
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:53,413
So feedback and analysis from players plays a very big role.

514
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:55,594
We are very, very fortunate that we

515
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:58,936
have a big and very passionate and active community.

516
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:04,198
And many of the best players from all over the world

517
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:07,940
are actively writing strategy articles, analyzing the cards,

518
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,940
analyzing the metagame.

519
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,723
So the community and the players can't make the decision for you.

520
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,624
It's like an invaluable tool for like.

521
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:24,648
that you should listen to. And by following the community, you

522
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:28,950
really can get this pulse on the players' feelings. You have to

523
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,992
look sometimes a little bit between the lines, like what's

524
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:36,194
actually the root of the problem there, because complaints about

525
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:39,316
a certain card, the balance for a certain card, might not

526
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:42,238
actually be like that specific card is...

527
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:47,013
imbalanced, but it might be that there's just lack of variation,

528
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:49,393
for example, rather than you need

529
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:52,274
to nerf that specific card.

530
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:54,775
And one thing that's worth realizing

531
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:58,616
is that, especially after a game has matured,

532
00:28:59,796 --> 00:29:03,177
the developers are really not the world's best players.

533
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:05,198
Definitely not.

534
00:29:05,758 --> 00:29:07,878
And the players can really, really teach you

535
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:08,399
about your game.

536
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,221
embrace this swallow your pride stay humble, there's a lot to

537
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:17,303
learn from the players and I have an example of this where

538
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:20,426
this like kind of for the first time really really struck on us.

539
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:23,768
So that's this there's this

540
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,551
you to burr the I think this was the video that made it made

541
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:29,272
him famous to

542
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:33,775
John from or in students and back in April last year the

543
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,035
game was like one month old.

544
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:38,978
He made this video about how to use the one electric

545
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:42,808
And the team watched this video.

546
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:50,053
And we were a bit surprised at what things you can do with

547
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:52,735
that only one elixir, and that skeleton.

548
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:57,519
And yeah, at that moment, we really learned quite a lot.

549
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:58,760
Not just about the skeletons.

550
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,201
A lot of players learned about the skeletons at that point.

551
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:02,622
We had to nerf it after a couple of weeks.

552
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:06,785
But we also learned a lot about the game.

553
00:30:08,194 --> 00:30:12,196
And about the fact that how much depth there actually is in this game.

554
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:17,979
And the fact that players really can and will teach you about your game.

555
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,140
So that was like a valuable lesson learned there.

556
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:25,683
We still have these moments every now and then like with some videos that we watch.

557
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:28,564
Oh, this is how you play this game.

558
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:31,626
And something that's also related to listening to the players

559
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:36,528
is that the top players are the trendsetters in the game.

560
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:37,028
So. .

561
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,201
I mean, they have access to all the cards.

562
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:42,262
They tend to experiment and craft the new decks

563
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:45,023
to outwit their opponents and gain the edge.

564
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:48,085
And quite often the trends then slowly trickle downwards.

565
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:55,129
And another example where this concretely dawned on us

566
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:57,590
was when we had our first live tournament.

567
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,551
So that was also in April 2016.

568
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:03,033
So that was a nice month for learning.

569
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:07,418
We had this invitational tournament in Helsinki.

570
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:11,379
And there was this young Finnish guy called Jason,

571
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,520
who ended up getting to the finals,

572
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,620
and then he beat everybody on stage 3-0,

573
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,741
including some of the top players in the game.

574
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:24,903
And he was using this deck that no one else had ever tried,

575
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:28,184
and it immediately got dubbed the Jason deck.

576
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,485
It was a pretty basic deck, really,

577
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:33,665
and only contained common and rare cards.

578
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:44,734
He played it really well, and after the tournament we really got to see for the first time the effects of esports and this concept of top players being trendsetters.

579
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:48,935
When we saw how the deck use rate went up.

580
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,436
So yeah, people saw the tournament and people definitely tried out the deck.

581
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:56,417
And it helped that it was only using very basic cards.

582
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:58,017
That was quite cool.

583
00:31:59,377 --> 00:31:59,878
Cool to see.

584
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:02,478
So, listen to the players.

585
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:07,236
To get a second opinion, you can also check out data.

586
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:09,917
You can use it to verify stuff.

587
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:16,819
So for us, using data means mostly looking at use rates

588
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:17,540
and win rates.

589
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,541
And a bit definition time again.

590
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:23,962
So I suppose use rate can mean different things

591
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:25,623
for different companies and different games.

592
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:29,024
But what we track is percent of battles

593
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:31,865
where the player owned the card and used it.

594
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:33,025
And win rate is.

595
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:36,821
percent of battles where the player used this card and won.

596
00:32:38,262 --> 00:32:41,803
So we look at these metrics both at individual cards level

597
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:44,105
and also for full decks.

598
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:48,187
So what do players use and what do they win with, basically?

599
00:32:48,987 --> 00:32:51,209
So what we read out of these metrics, then.

600
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,310
First thing to mention is that use rate is the main metric we

601
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:54,430
use.

602
00:32:57,855 --> 00:33:02,277
And the thing is that it really tells directly about what is the state of the metagame, right?

603
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,719
And if the goal is to have a healthy metagame, then it makes sense.

604
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,023
UseRate is the one that shows you how you're doing with that.

605
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:14,725
So when looking at useRates at different arenas,

606
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:18,307
you're going to get a feel of what the players see in the game.

607
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:24,891
And you can then back this up with what the community is talking about.

608
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,231
And maybe some of the comments that you see in the forums

609
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,651
might be actually coming from just a certain trophy range

610
00:33:31,752 --> 00:33:34,972
where a card might be overused, and so forth.

611
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,293
So use rate is a pretty good indicator.

612
00:33:38,313 --> 00:33:42,395
And it's also something that I think is a good indicator of

613
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:46,036
something being overpowered or underpowered, because very

614
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,537
strong cards also tend to be used quite a lot.

615
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:52,422
But win rates, they tell stories, too.

616
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:55,282
So it can, for example, be a good indicator of sleeper

617
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:56,883
cards or high-skill cards.

618
00:33:57,463 --> 00:34:00,323
These type of cards that not that many use, but those who

619
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:03,124
do, those who specialize in them, can be winning

620
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:04,104
consistently with them.

621
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:07,685
So it might not be a good idea to not buff that kind of card

622
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:08,025
too much.

623
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:09,965
Depends.

624
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:15,286
And win rates, though, as well as use rates, they also

625
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:18,266
heavily are affected by the current metagame.

626
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,567
So obviously, if some.

627
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:27,877
good card is used a lot, the counters might get used a lot and so forth, and the counters might be good for winning games and so forth.

628
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:34,041
I want to mention here now that these are not necessarily the best metrics for some other game.

629
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:40,785
You really need to figure out, understand your own game and figure out what you want to achieve using the metrics.

630
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:46,988
So I think for example a game like Hearthstone, I think it would be very useful to look at things like

631
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:53,943
win rates across different classes to get the different classes balanced between each other.

632
00:34:55,163 --> 00:34:57,944
And in a one-on-one fighting game like Street Fighter,

633
00:34:58,704 --> 00:35:04,845
I'm sure they track the win rates between different matchups with different heroes.

634
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:08,426
So that's something that you have to figure out for your own game.

635
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:16,267
So, when we look at these metrics, we look at different arenas, different trophy ranges,

636
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:17,107
from the

637
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,253
from the top players and also from the challenges, which

638
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:23,736
is the in-game tournament system, which is played

639
00:35:23,756 --> 00:35:24,797
with tournament-capped cards.

640
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:28,981
And when it comes to evaluating the balance

641
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:32,224
for individual cards, we really mostly

642
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:35,146
look at the top players and the top challenge players.

643
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:37,472
because they have access to all the cards,

644
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:38,592
they know how to use them,

645
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:40,973
and they are kind of the trendsetters,

646
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,133
as I mentioned before.

647
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:43,873
So I think that's a good place to start.

648
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:45,854
But we do look at also lower arenas,

649
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:48,635
what do players see there,

650
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:51,235
that we don't mess up their game too much.

651
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:55,396
So what is then a good use rate?

652
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:59,237
We have in the game currently 70 cards,

653
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:01,197
and it's eight cards per deck,

654
00:36:01,698 --> 00:36:05,598
so that makes roughly 9.4 billion different permutations

655
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:07,205
Which is nice.

656
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:14,450
We don't have quite yet enough players to fill that, but we'll

657
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,931
try to get there.

658
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:19,334
So if everything would be used perfectly evenly, it would

659
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:21,155
make for an average use rate of 11.4.

660
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,920
But that doesn't make much sense, does it?

661
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:31,403
We can't expect all cards and all combinations

662
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,364
to be used evenly.

663
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:33,725
And it can't be the goal either.

664
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,505
Like a deck with.

665
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,181
only the most expensive cards in the games.

666
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,822
It won't win you many games.

667
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:42,525
I see a gentleman here is changing his deck right now.

668
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:44,726
Right.

669
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:47,528
So how do you figure out then what's a good use rate?

670
00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:52,131
That really then boils down to knowing your game.

671
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:57,774
So when we look at the use rates then and ponder why,

672
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:00,456
ponder about them, we might think, OK,

673
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:01,657
why is a card popular?

674
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:04,804
Why is it used so much?

675
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:07,206
So maybe it is very powerful.

676
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:09,107
Probably is.

677
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:13,250
But it could also be that it's just a very, very good counter

678
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,391
in that current metagame.

679
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,173
Or maybe it's just like an extreme versatile card,

680
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:17,753
like the zap.

681
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:22,036
It's a cheap, versatile card that fits almost every deck.

682
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:27,360
So it makes sense that it has a higher use rate.

683
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,023
Another way to look at this is to think of target use rates.

684
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,044
So for example.

685
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:35,439
you might look at different main attack cards.

686
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,502
They should be viable alternatives to each other, right?

687
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:42,903
Like cheaper ones fit more decks for sure,

688
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:46,205
but ideally they are all viable and they are kind of...

689
00:37:46,826 --> 00:37:49,527
you can look at them and compare them to each other.

690
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:52,509
Or direct damage spells, maybe like an even easier example,

691
00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:56,171
that they have their own twists and situations,

692
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:58,853
but they should be really viable alternatives to each other.

693
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,802
So these are all quite objective ways to look at the

694
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:05,703
use rates and think about what is a good use rate and how

695
00:38:05,723 --> 00:38:06,043
does it look.

696
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:09,225
But then there's also a more subjective way to look at it,

697
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:11,847
which I call spiciness.

698
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:16,029
So there might be these cards that are a good spice to the

699
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:19,951
game, but we don't want them to be used too much.

700
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:20,551
We don't want them.

701
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:22,592
They are just there for variety.

702
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:26,494
So if we first look at bread and butter cards, we would

703
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:29,476
have the iconic Barbarians.

704
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:36,208
It's an iconic common vanilla staple card that can be considered for most decks.

705
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:43,032
And it's fine if it's used quite a lot, especially if the meta is such that it's a good counter there.

706
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:50,055
And then there's like spicy cards, and the X-Bow is an example of that.

707
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:55,505
So it's this building that rapidly fires arrows at a huge

708
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:58,087
range and can reach the enemy tower from the other side of

709
00:38:58,868 --> 00:38:59,188
the river.

710
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:01,670
So it's very powerful when it's played well.

711
00:39:02,371 --> 00:39:05,474
But we deliberately actually don't want it to be among the

712
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:06,574
most used cards in the game.

713
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:09,617
And this is something we learned during the beta,

714
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:14,161
because there it was quite powerful, and it was used by

715
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:14,961
almost everybody.

716
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:18,925
And the community, and in the end, also we felt.

717
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:24,551
that it fits more as a spice to the game rather than this main

718
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,971
strategy used by most players.

719
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,212
But spice is important.

720
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:29,252
Spicy cards are important.

721
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:31,733
They add a lot of variety, keep the game fun,

722
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:32,493
keep the game fresh.

723
00:39:33,313 --> 00:39:35,974
So I think you should have these type of cards as well.

724
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:40,976
And I think metrics-wise or data-wise, a good way to

725
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:44,357
recognize a healthy spicy card is that.

726
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:48,774
It has a low use rate, but a pretty high win rate.

727
00:39:49,195 --> 00:39:51,355
So that means that there are these highly skilled

728
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:54,636
and specialized players that are using it and win with it,

729
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:56,817
but it's not really seen in every match.

730
00:39:57,257 --> 00:40:00,678
Next bow is, for example, a card that has a super low

731
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:02,199
use rate at lower levels.

732
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:05,640
It's quite hard to use well, but actually top players,

733
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,401
every now and then, it tends to become used quite a lot,

734
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:13,622
actually, and in some tournaments, in some eSports events,

735
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:15,083
we can see, might see it at like.

736
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:19,055
Quite many of the players on stage are actually using XBow.

737
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:22,818
So I think it's in a fairly OK place at the moment.

738
00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:26,180
So you need to understand these things.

739
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,242
And you need to be able to look at the cards and the game

740
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:31,003
from very different points of view.

741
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:35,687
And it's also actually important to understand

742
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,489
advanced concepts of the game.

743
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,291
Especially if you're the person actually doing the balancing.

744
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:46,962
I think you really need to understand how the game works.

745
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:51,364
Sure, you will be learning all the time from players and by playing yourself,

746
00:40:51,404 --> 00:40:55,565
but you need to understand what the top players, for example, are talking about.

747
00:40:56,145 --> 00:40:58,546
So in Clash Royale, there's plenty of these things.

748
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,767
You could have the elixir advantage,

749
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:05,188
the concept of defending and counter-pushing, multi-lane pushing,

750
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,770
a bit more advanced stuff like knowing all the card interactions,

751
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,611
or what different deck archetypes exist and how they work.

752
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:15,267
what kind of opening moves there are,

753
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:18,528
identifying the deck cycle, breaking the deck cycle,

754
00:41:19,749 --> 00:41:22,270
understanding what's spellbaiting and building

755
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,291
decks around spellbaiting, kiting troops,

756
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:29,873
the pros and cons of having the flying attribute in a card,

757
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:32,994
because it's not always good, and the pros and cons

758
00:41:33,054 --> 00:41:35,976
of having slow units, fast units, very fast units.

759
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:37,837
You need to understand these kind of things.

760
00:41:38,517 --> 00:41:41,618
The point is not to now go through and explain all these.

761
00:41:41,658 --> 00:41:43,419
The point is that you need to know your game.

762
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,603
right? So play your game a lot, both during development and release. It's really important.

763
00:41:53,144 --> 00:42:00,347
And this is something like during the development of Clash Royale, it was played a lot. As we saw

764
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:06,010
with the Orange Juice video thing, we didn't figure out all the things. But it was played a

765
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:11,112
lot in the company and even there, players outside, people outside the team were

766
00:42:11,858 --> 00:42:13,919
like coming up with good strategies, teaching,

767
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:17,460
like kind of teaching, teaching kind of the team

768
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,061
about like all kinds of stuff.

769
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,141
So it's really important.

770
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:22,642
Play a lot, both during development

771
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:23,422
and then after release.

772
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,963
So to figure out which cards to rebalance,

773
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:29,764
we listen to our players.

774
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:30,784
We learn from them.

775
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:32,224
We utilize data.

776
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:35,445
But in the end, you're the one who has to make the decision.

777
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,646
So it boils down to like understanding the game.

778
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,871
and intuition.

779
00:42:40,111 --> 00:42:43,512
So that's basically the topics covered.

780
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,554
But the quest for the healthy metagame, it continues.

781
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:53,336
So we have unhealthier metagames, but with a

782
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:57,597
persistent game that's meant to last for years, it's really

783
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:58,597
a never-ending process.

784
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:02,019
I mean, new cards are added, new game modes are added, and

785
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:05,000
the player base matures, the players learn more, and we

786
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,240
learn.

787
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:09,231
more and more. So the eternal quest just continues.

788
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,995
So I feel that there was like a bunch of things now in this presentation, but I still feel like

789
00:43:15,035 --> 00:43:19,138
that I only like really scratched the surface of things regarding gameplay balancing.

790
00:43:19,778 --> 00:43:27,523
So here's some little selection of talks and articles and videos that I personally found very

791
00:43:27,643 --> 00:43:32,726
useful and inspirational. Some expand on these concepts that I talked about and some...

792
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:38,617
are about other interesting concepts around game balancing,

793
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,478
things like power creep, counterplay.

794
00:43:42,439 --> 00:43:44,740
So I really recommend checking these out

795
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,901
if you're interested in this and if you're doing this stuff.

796
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,262
So yeah, you can take a photo.

797
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,904
I'll have a little pause before I go to the next slide.

798
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:57,167
All right.

799
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:01,309
So just to recap the things.

800
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:03,363
from this presentation.

801
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:06,905
So the goals of balancing are to offer fun, variety,

802
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:10,026
and freshness, which feeds to a healthy metagame.

803
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:12,527
And some of the key principles we use

804
00:44:13,088 --> 00:44:14,809
are making everything feel overpowered,

805
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:17,410
but having counters for everything,

806
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,691
and making new cards meaningful,

807
00:44:20,051 --> 00:44:21,332
but keeping old cards relevant,

808
00:44:22,072 --> 00:44:23,553
and keeping on rebalancing,

809
00:44:23,753 --> 00:44:26,014
knowing that buffs are nicer than nerfs.

810
00:44:27,155 --> 00:44:28,455
And to decide what to balance,

811
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:30,456
listen to your players.

812
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:35,373
utilize data, but at the end of the day, just play, play,

813
00:44:35,393 --> 00:44:37,114
play, play the game and know your game.

814
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:38,855
All right.

815
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:44,317
I'll leave this here, and we can have a little Q&A.

816
00:44:49,379 --> 00:44:49,880
Thank you very much.

817
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:02,832
Any questions?

818
00:45:03,113 --> 00:45:03,213
Hi.

819
00:45:03,253 --> 00:45:03,413
Hi.

820
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:04,974
Fantastic talk.

821
00:45:05,174 --> 00:45:05,574
Thank you so much.

822
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:06,355
I read everything about it.

823
00:45:07,076 --> 00:45:07,956
I came in a little late.

824
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:09,077
I wasn't sure if you had mentioned this,

825
00:45:09,117 --> 00:45:10,918
but how big is your balancing team?

826
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:11,839
Is it just you?

827
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:12,820
Is it like six people?

828
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:13,840
It's me.

829
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:15,422
Really?

830
00:45:15,702 --> 00:45:19,505
Yeah, the Clash Royale team is in total 16 persons.

831
00:45:19,945 --> 00:45:24,168
So that's like all the developers, and the QA guy,

832
00:45:24,328 --> 00:45:27,670
the community manager, data analyst, and so forth.

833
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,132
So yeah, I'm the only one.

834
00:45:29,498 --> 00:45:31,240
But all the card ideas come from the whole team.

835
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,721
Yeah, yeah.

836
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:32,742
And also balancing.

837
00:45:32,782 --> 00:45:35,124
We bounce around the ideas with the whole team.

838
00:45:35,144 --> 00:45:35,985
Cool.

839
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:37,967
Awesome.

840
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:38,687
Thank you.

841
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,590
Hi.

842
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:43,072
Thank you for the talk.

843
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:44,834
Thank you for flying away from the cold to come

844
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:45,574
visit us down here.

845
00:45:46,615 --> 00:45:48,297
When you were doing the internal balancing, and I

846
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:50,579
know you joined the team after it launched.

847
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:56,366
Were you testing out all the different levels or were you using the tournament level as

848
00:45:57,367 --> 00:46:00,390
your model that you would then build off of afterwards?

849
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:08,126
Both. So there were plenty of tests where we started from scratch,

850
00:46:08,826 --> 00:46:12,489
and I started from like zero and also at the same time tested the progress

851
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:16,632
and the economy and the first few days, first seven days.

852
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:21,015
We also had like a 30-day company playable where everybody was duking it out.

853
00:46:21,336 --> 00:46:23,137
So there you got kind of the different levels.

854
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:30,682
But then we also had these tests where we everybody had like this same like equivalent level cards and like

855
00:46:31,142 --> 00:46:33,664
We're playing this kind of like more like eSports-y things

856
00:46:34,244 --> 00:46:37,425
When the goals of those different tests were to either test the metagame

857
00:46:37,445 --> 00:46:40,687
Which is why you kind of you know tested the or excuse me the progression

858
00:46:41,147 --> 00:46:44,509
And that's why you were testing the you know the progression progress

859
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:50,531
And then the goal of the other the balance tests was more just figuring out if you actually had a competitive game

860
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:57,982
Yeah, you could say that. I think there was also for the balancing between the troops also with the

861
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:04,606
kind of the meta progress and stuff like that. So it was also to test those, like how do the early

862
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:09,069
cards work and how does it work when you like early on get an epic card that's actually like

863
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:13,592
kind of a level six card in a way compared to the commons that might be like a level four and so

864
00:47:13,632 --> 00:47:16,274
forth. It all works out. Thank you very much. Thank you.

865
00:47:17,597 --> 00:47:17,877
Hello.

866
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:23,418
Will it make sense to show real-time metrics publicly

867
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:24,079
to the users?

868
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,300
Maybe.

869
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:37,323
I think one trick it might be that it might tilt the metagame

870
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:37,963
even more.

871
00:47:38,784 --> 00:47:40,784
So if there's cards that are used a lot,

872
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:43,905
then they get used even more, and so forth.

873
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:47,414
But it could. There could be some stuff to show. I don't know.

874
00:47:47,854 --> 00:47:47,994
Yeah.

875
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:49,054
Thanks.

876
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:49,694
It's a nice idea.

877
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:56,917
So piggybacking on that a little bit, how transparent are you with the players about the balancing that you're doing?

878
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:02,138
And how do you, as kind of a community question, how do you manage their expectations and keep them from...

879
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:07,380
There's a little bit of reluctance to mess with the stats too much because people get upset.

880
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,061
How do you balance all that? And do you use communication to do that?

881
00:48:10,561 --> 00:48:13,482
I'd like to think that we are quite transparent about it.

882
00:48:15,899 --> 00:48:21,062
But yeah, I do feel also that we could do a better job at

883
00:48:22,863 --> 00:48:25,284
explaining this kind of stuff, like what are our goals with

884
00:48:25,304 --> 00:48:27,045
the balancing, and what do we think about when

885
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:27,906
we do the balancing.

886
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:33,189
So it might sometimes feel very shallow, our

887
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:34,129
explanations maybe.

888
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:38,492
Do you explicitly expose the stat changes on a website or

889
00:48:38,512 --> 00:48:40,473
anything, or just people find out about it by playing the

890
00:48:40,493 --> 00:48:40,653
game?

891
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,154
No, no, I mean, we yeah, we post like the we put always before we do the stations,

892
00:48:45,174 --> 00:48:50,699
we post them like in the inbox and we post them in our blog with explanations why we

893
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:58,907
did it and and then also like we do some cooperation also with some influencers

894
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:03,151
that they they get kind of access to the information and they can do videos about

895
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,434
it perhaps. And some, of course, do like.

896
00:49:07,073 --> 00:49:11,474
just proactively, so they go more in depth in things like they might talk about,

897
00:49:11,514 --> 00:49:14,415
like their ramifications and their own opinions about it and so forth.

898
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:15,315
Wonderful, thank you.

899
00:49:15,675 --> 00:49:15,915
Thank you.

900
00:49:16,776 --> 00:49:22,357
Hi. So in recent months, you guys have increased your release cadence of new cards.

901
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:24,698
Has that affected your process in any way?

902
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:26,718
What are some of the challenges there?

903
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:30,520
Yeah, it's become like infinitely more stressful.

904
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:37,187
So in the beginning, when we released our first card, we

905
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:41,591
released them all at six cards at a time, four cards at a

906
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,232
time, and so forth.

907
00:49:42,252 --> 00:49:48,037
But it was in November that we decided to go with that.

908
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:50,780
OK, let's release one card every two weeks.

909
00:49:52,321 --> 00:49:55,104
And these are many, many good attributes.

910
00:49:55,144 --> 00:49:56,865
People got to focus on that one card.

911
00:49:57,823 --> 00:50:00,484
At the time, it wasn't a huge amount of cards.

912
00:50:00,524 --> 00:50:02,345
And also, it kept the game fresh.

913
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:05,706
But it was actually quite challenging for me, because I

914
00:50:07,947 --> 00:50:11,429
had to think about the balance of new cards that we were then

915
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:14,650
developing before even seeing what the old cards were doing

916
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:15,130
to the game.

917
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:19,292
We had to do balance changes in between when there was only

918
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,873
one week or two weeks to the next card being released.

919
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:23,534
And we don't know what it will do to the game.

920
00:50:24,132 --> 00:50:26,334
So it has definitely added challenges.

921
00:50:26,455 --> 00:50:27,856
And we are actually now changing.

922
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:31,421
We announced it already that we are changing that cadence,

923
00:50:32,202 --> 00:50:34,244
partly because of this, actually,

924
00:50:34,425 --> 00:50:37,428
to be three to four weeks.

925
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:38,029
Awesome.

926
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:38,490
Thank you.

927
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,990
Thank you.

928
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:42,245
So this will kind of piggyback off that question,

929
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:43,825
then I have a small follow-up afterwards.

930
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:47,046
But so you mentioned that while conceptualizing cards,

931
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,227
you made sure that every card had a specific scenario

932
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:50,528
it provided utility for.

933
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,689
So every card has its moment, right?

934
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:55,369
So do you think that there would be a point

935
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:57,710
that every niche utility would be filled,

936
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:00,031
or do you think that the release of new cards,

937
00:51:00,151 --> 00:51:02,472
it creates new utility, new niches

938
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:04,052
for there to be utility for,

939
00:51:04,472 --> 00:51:06,393
and do you think that you could pretty much

940
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:07,534
have an endless amount of cards,

941
00:51:07,594 --> 00:51:08,734
or do you think there's a point where?

942
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:14,456
you know, every scenario has its niche card, I guess.

943
00:51:15,696 --> 00:51:17,577
Yeah, so...

944
00:51:21,198 --> 00:51:23,159
Yeah, it is challenging to,

945
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:28,861
always more and more challenging to come up with new uses

946
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:29,461
for the cards.

947
00:51:30,852 --> 00:51:34,615
and to again fill like a new gap and find a new utility.

948
00:51:34,715 --> 00:51:37,037
We still have a bunch of ideas, of course.

949
00:51:37,057 --> 00:51:40,660
And something we discussed like regarding the like,

950
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:43,903
like kind of how many cards fit in the game,

951
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:45,003
how many cards does it make sense?

952
00:51:45,043 --> 00:51:46,645
That's something we talk about a lot,

953
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:49,367
but we don't have, it's not yet in any way a problem.

954
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,528
And we don't have like.

955
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:53,949
We're kind of not there, but it's something we talk about.

956
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:55,470
And then something else.

957
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,593
So with Clash of Clans, like Supercell is also one of their amazingly successful games.

958
00:52:01,013 --> 00:52:06,457
There has been just like a huge kind of subculture of the industry that just focused on like cloning that game basically.

959
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:14,642
What do you think of like the current sub industry, I guess, of Clash Royale Clans and the success of those?

960
00:52:14,782 --> 00:52:18,284
And how do you see that industry like growing?

961
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:22,807
in the close future, I guess.

962
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:27,049
So, do you mean, what do I think about clones and copying?

963
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,769
I guess, yeah.

964
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:28,130
Okay.

965
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:33,552
Well, I mean, like totally blatant clones, let's say,

966
00:52:33,592 --> 00:52:36,154
that you seriously just copy-paste,

967
00:52:36,394 --> 00:52:38,635
copy the whole code base and stuff like that.

968
00:52:39,475 --> 00:52:41,937
That, I think, is a bit disrespectful.

969
00:52:41,957 --> 00:52:43,277
But, like, I don't...

970
00:52:46,124 --> 00:52:48,485
Seriously, I think most games are not really clones.

971
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:53,267
They really, I think most games try to find their own thing.

972
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:55,727
They are inspired, heavily inspired might be,

973
00:52:55,787 --> 00:52:57,828
like by a game and they take it.

974
00:52:57,868 --> 00:53:00,769
And I think it's more, almost flattering.

975
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:05,171
And I like this genre and I'm happy to try out

976
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:05,931
these new games.

977
00:53:05,991 --> 00:53:08,292
It's cool that you guys kind of pioneered

978
00:53:08,312 --> 00:53:10,552
a whole new genre of game, but thanks.

979
00:53:11,113 --> 00:53:11,313
Thank you.

980
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:12,919
Hi.

981
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,342
So when a card is either overpowered or underpowered,

982
00:53:17,642 --> 00:53:19,164
sometimes that's because the numbers just

983
00:53:19,184 --> 00:53:20,145
need to go up or down a little bit,

984
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:23,747
but other times it's because what it qualitatively does

985
00:53:24,328 --> 00:53:26,690
is either not healthy or too weak or something.

986
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,511
What kind of factors do you use to determine

987
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,814
whether you should be adjusting the numbers on a card

988
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,055
versus adjusting what it does?

989
00:53:35,226 --> 00:53:40,549
So, what's the question? How do I decide which stats to change in a card?

990
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:41,810
Was that the question?

991
00:53:45,172 --> 00:53:49,235
It really depends on the cards and the situation.

992
00:53:49,535 --> 00:53:53,938
I don't think there's any one rule.

993
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:56,119
For example, just trying to...

994
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,102
So that it's staying true to the soul of the card that I mentioned.

995
00:54:01,253 --> 00:54:07,595
that I don't make a fast unit slow or make a fast hitting unit too slow and so forth.

996
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,056
But looking at what makes sense,

997
00:54:10,536 --> 00:54:16,378
which is the moment or the place where this card is too weak or too powerful

998
00:54:16,718 --> 00:54:17,898
that needs tweaking.

999
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,439
Is it that it doesn't do much damage?

1000
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:24,820
Does it have a hurtful interaction with some card?

1001
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:29,022
That it one-shots something that maybe it shouldn't one-shot and so forth.

1002
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:30,802
It really depends on the situation.

1003
00:54:31,258 --> 00:54:35,599
I guess the thing that I was specifically referring to is cases where, if you think

1004
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:40,481
back a while ago when Elixir Collector was steadily, the HP was dropped, the HP was dropped,

1005
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:46,622
the HP was dropped, and then eventually you decided actually we need to change the cost

1006
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:50,843
and the Elixir generation rate at some point, and then the card was in a healthier place

1007
00:54:50,883 --> 00:54:51,263
after that.

1008
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,664
What prompted that kind of change of approach?

1009
00:54:55,644 --> 00:54:57,465
That's not really like, I don't know.

1010
00:54:59,955 --> 00:55:04,538
We just discuss kind of like different things and like what would make sense.

1011
00:55:04,598 --> 00:55:08,422
And maybe also like sometimes there might be good suggestions also in the community

1012
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:11,624
about like that this could be like tweaked in this direction.

1013
00:55:11,664 --> 00:55:14,186
But I don't know. There's not really like any process for that.

1014
00:55:15,888 --> 00:55:18,089
Thank you. Sorry, I can't answer that better.

1015
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:21,592
Hi. Here.

1016
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:25,395
You have a monad system that is based on time.

1017
00:55:26,143 --> 00:55:31,685
in your game. I'm very curious how you decide if a card needs to cost 5, 6 or 7.

1018
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:41,286
Can you answer that please? Yeah so when we kind of do new cards one thing that then like

1019
00:55:41,786 --> 00:55:47,287
quite early comes up is like at which elixir cost should we try to kind of get this card?

1020
00:55:47,307 --> 00:55:51,108
What is kind of an elixir cost that maybe we want to get like a new card there or

1021
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:59,039
It would be cool to make this card into like a seven elixir card and then we try to balance the stats accordingly

1022
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,101
So this again like not really like any

1023
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:08,893
strict process to this, like it's just like flying. Sometimes it's like, okay, we start with a card,

1024
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:13,694
like this could be cool as a seven elixir card, but then like things, maybe like the artists create

1025
00:56:13,714 --> 00:56:17,775
like a cool character and then it's like, okay, this doesn't anymore make sense as something

1026
00:56:17,815 --> 00:56:22,616
tanky, so maybe we need to like change this into something else. So I don't know, doesn't really

1027
00:56:22,656 --> 00:56:30,017
like it. My question is regarding to if I play a card that cost seven, I have to wait another

1028
00:56:30,037 --> 00:56:32,918
X seconds to cast another card.

1029
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:35,594
Do you take into consideration this fact?

1030
00:56:36,054 --> 00:56:37,434
Yeah, OK.

1031
00:56:37,735 --> 00:56:39,295
Yeah, that ties kind of into them,

1032
00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:47,318
like how the elixir works and the deck cycle.

1033
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:55,141
So it's kind of a trance thing, like how to go there shortly.

1034
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:57,622
Let's say, like in Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone,

1035
00:56:57,642 --> 00:56:59,443
you have this, or Magic the Gathering,

1036
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:01,524
there's this concept called the Jedi curve, where you have

1037
00:57:02,943 --> 00:57:06,347
like that a one elixir card or a one mana card should be one one,

1038
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:09,671
a two mana card should be two two. This is the thing you're talking about, right?

1039
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:10,872
Like, so how do we define like,

1040
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:14,697
what is the stats of kind of a three elixir cards? And that's the thing.

1041
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,078
That's like,

1042
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:20,684
it's kind of mathematically a bit like trickier to define because there are all

1043
00:57:20,724 --> 00:57:21,805
these parameters, like.

1044
00:57:22,544 --> 00:57:27,085
affecting it. So we kind of compare to the existing cards that okay there are other three

1045
00:57:27,145 --> 00:57:32,226
elixir cards or the other four elixir cards have these kind of stats so maybe it should be like in

1046
00:57:32,246 --> 00:57:35,927
this place maybe it's like a bit weaker with damage than compared to mini pekka for elixir

1047
00:57:35,967 --> 00:57:38,588
or maybe it has a bit more hit points and so forth. Okay thank you.

1048
00:57:41,897 --> 00:57:47,119
When you launch a new card, you have this fantastic pie with data from players' feedback and

1049
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:54,262
actual data from them. So what happens before that? When and how do you decide to launch a new

1050
00:57:54,302 --> 00:58:03,345
card? It boils down to intuition alone? Or what sort of data do you gather before? Because you

1051
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:09,347
don't have the player's data yet. So it's all team data internal? Or you use external play

1052
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:10,588
testing for a new card?

1053
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:14,697
So what's the question now?

1054
00:58:16,138 --> 00:58:18,780
What's the process you follow to decide that the card is

1055
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,862
ready and in a well-shaped, ready to launch in the game?

1056
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:24,764
So when a new card is ready and we want to release it.

1057
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:32,490
Well, we kind of have set a deadline for the release, for

1058
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,171
the next version.

1059
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:36,794
So we try to get the card ready by that time, I guess.

1060
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:39,576
But that's not really what you're asking, I suppose.

1061
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:44,857
But I'm trying to wrap my head around the actual question,

1062
00:58:44,877 --> 00:58:45,097
maybe.

1063
00:58:45,297 --> 00:58:48,678
Should we ask maybe, how do you get the data

1064
00:58:50,038 --> 00:58:51,899
to tell that a card is ready to be launched?

1065
00:58:52,939 --> 00:58:53,799
What's the trigger point?

1066
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,380
We don't really get any data for a new card

1067
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,900
when we're making a card, if that's what you mean.

1068
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,440
So just intuition-based?

1069
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,521
Yeah, so we put it out, and then we

1070
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:04,701
see how players use it like this.

1071
00:59:05,518 --> 00:59:09,740
We just test it internally and try to figure it out.

1072
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,761
I think we're running out of time.

1073
00:59:13,741 --> 00:59:16,882
So I have to wrap this up.

1074
00:59:17,662 --> 00:59:20,963
There's actually this wrap-up room.

1075
00:59:21,163 --> 00:59:23,243
I see you at least have some questions.

1076
00:59:23,324 --> 00:59:23,944
Maybe others have.

1077
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:27,185
I'm going to go to this wrap-up room.

1078
00:59:27,225 --> 00:59:27,945
It's right across.

1079
00:59:28,185 --> 00:59:29,605
I think it's overlook 2022.

1080
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:31,406
Am I right?

1081
00:59:31,626 --> 00:59:31,886
I don't know.

1082
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:37,683
So I'm gonna go there if people want to come there ask more questions. You're welcome to do so

1083
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:39,606
Okay. Thank you very much
