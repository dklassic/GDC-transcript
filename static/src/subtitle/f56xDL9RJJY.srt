1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:17,753
Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for coming to our panel. The four day work week. We did

2
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:22,996
it. What now? We're super excited to share all the details of our four day work weeks

3
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:27,879
and how that went for each of us. We're four very different studios. We're all working

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,502
on very different things and have all had our different successes, challenges and

5
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:36,026
ways that we went about our four day work week. So this panel is really just an introduction,

6
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:40,910
starting point, a way to think about the four day formula, what has worked, not worked,

7
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,334
things you may be considering for your own studios and exposing all the whens,

8
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:48,276
whys and hows of operating every week like it's a.

9
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:50,097
three day weekend.

10
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:54,258
So with that in mind, I'll introduce myself

11
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,440
and then I will let the panel introduce themselves as well.

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,960
My name is John Cooney.

13
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,301
I go by he and him pronouns.

14
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,181
I'm the CEO of Armor Games,

15
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,762
which is a full remote 11 person studio.

16
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:09,903
We started 15 something years ago as a flash games website.

17
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:12,164
And now we're predominantly a publisher

18
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:13,465
for indies and small teams.

19
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:18,909
we're working on games like Baron Breakfast and Snacko and Spirit and the Mouse. We moved to a

20
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:26,696
four-day work week last October and we structured it as a 32-hour work week with Fridays becoming

21
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:31,640
part of the weekend. So I'm happy to moderate the panel. I'm going to chime in on some things,

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,885
but I'm mostly going to try to let our other panelists speak the most. So let's just roll down

23
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:40,528
the list in order starting with Selim.

24
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:43,678
Hey everyone, my name is Sadim Daboos.

25
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:45,759
I'm the co-founder of Co-op,

26
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,121
which is a worker-owned game studio,

27
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,562
and it's also a cooperative.

28
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:53,245
We're actually celebrating our 10th birthday in two months.

29
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,806
I'm really, really excited and proud about that.

30
00:01:56,147 --> 00:02:01,290
And we started with our four-day work week in 2020,

31
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:05,653
and then went back to five days just to kind of feel it out.

32
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,576
And then we're like, oh yeah, four days is where it's at,

33
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:10,757
and permanently made the switch last year.

34
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:12,449
Uh, that's me.

35
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,444
Great and Tonya.

36
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,684
Hi, I'm Tanya Short and I'm the Captain, CEO,

37
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:21,985
Director of Kit Fox Games.

38
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:24,886
We're 11 people based in Montreal.

39
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:28,287
We released Boyfriend Engine and Moon Hunters

40
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,147
and we're working on some secrets

41
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:32,928
and we've also done some publishing.

42
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:36,870
So we're probably best known as the publishers

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,431
of the upcoming Graphical Dwarf Fortress,

44
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:42,351
but feel free to look also look up Paparazzi,

45
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:43,732
Six Ages and other things.

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,744
We went to four days, 32 hours starting last June

47
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:52,326
and the run up to the launch of Boyfriend Dungeon,

48
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:55,069
we decided that that was the best way

49
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:58,752
to have a sustainable pressure as launch was coming up.

50
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:03,575
And it was almost impossible to go back to five days.

51
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:06,558
We briefly discussed it, but nobody wanted to even try.

52
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:10,181
So it looks like we're four days at the very least

53
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:13,283
until the pandemic is actually over, but probably forever.

54
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:16,297
Great, and finally, Chris.

55
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,258
Yes, my name is Christopher Chancy.

56
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:24,281
I am the founder and CEO of Manavoid Entertainment, a studio based out of

57
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:26,141
Montreal. It's about 36 people now.

58
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:31,664
Amongst other things, we've recently released Rainbow Billy, The Curse of the

59
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:35,185
Leviathan. We're on the four day week since 2019.

60
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:38,827
So, you know, it was really part of our core values as a studio to.

61
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:44,068
have a no crunch culture and to try and give the best advantages to our staff.

62
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:47,289
And so we implemented it pretty early and it's been going great.

63
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:49,629
We've never went back to the five days since then.

64
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,530
Much like John, we're on the 32 hour week with Fridays off.

65
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,510
Great. Thank you, Chris. And thank you, everyone on the panel.

66
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,591
I'm going to go ahead and stop sharing my screen.

67
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:06,212
So we'll go back to just looking at our faces so you don't have to look at my presentation the whole time.

68
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:11,881
And yeah, thank you everyone who's come to our panel.

69
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,103
This is very roughly structured,

70
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:17,966
but the first part we're really gonna focus on

71
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,667
is thinking about how we planned

72
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:21,229
and dreamed out our four-day work week,

73
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,631
what that kind of how we arrived at those moments,

74
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:24,472
what did it look like,

75
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:29,176
what did initial planning look like for our work weeks.

76
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:31,238
And then after that, we'll move into more of

77
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,299
some of our respective challenges,

78
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:36,840
some of the things we found from moving through this process,

79
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,001
things that changed along the way.

80
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:41,143
And we'll end by talking about the future.

81
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,184
Where do we see it fitting in with our studios in the future?

82
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,125
Lasting impressions,

83
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,946
thoughts about how the four-day work week might fit in

84
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:49,607
to the larger indie space,

85
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,848
but also the game industry as a whole.

86
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,750
And then at the end, we'll have room for Q&A.

87
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,691
So feel free to save any questions you might have

88
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,431
for our panel.

89
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:03,301
We're very happy to answer any questions that there might be towards the end.

90
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:07,189
So thank you everyone. Let's go ahead and start with

91
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:14,826
you know, how we got here and how we started. So the first question for the panel is really

92
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:19,908
talking about, you know, what prompted this change? Like what was the point at which

93
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:26,850
you all decided that it was time to move and shift from a five-day workweek to a four-day workweek?

94
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,931
And maybe I'll just pick someone to start off with and then we can start that conversation.

95
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,452
So let's start with Salim.

96
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:49,082
Sure. So we started in the summer of 2020. And I don't know if you remember, but that was a pretty rough time. It was after the murder of George Floyd, we were going through pandemic, there was, you know, a lot of

97
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:58,976
A lot of stress on our team and on a personal level just of like what was happening in the world. And we just felt like just you know

98
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:05,401
keeping our heads down and working throughout didn't feel right for us. We really wanted to be engaged in social movements. We

99
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:12,767
really wanted to have more time to sort of engage with our families and our communities. And we felt like work was taking too

100
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:18,232
much from us to be able to to do that. And so that was where the conversation for four day work weeks.

101
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:24,889
began. It was a necessity for our well-being, our mental health, and our need to engage with

102
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:28,552
what was happening around us. Things that were just more important than frankly video games.

103
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:38,120
Yeah, I think I can chime in a little bit too. We had talked about it for some years before we did

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:46,548
it. I had always felt that the humans making the games matter.

105
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,589
at least as much to me as the business that is profiting from the game.

106
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:59,374
So when it became very clear to me last summer that giving bonus vacation days wasn't quite

107
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:06,158
cutting it, giving various perks wasn't quite cutting it, this seemed like a way that we could

108
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,478
give more.

109
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:14,609
more buffer in a way to the human side of Kit Fox

110
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,370
without losing, we could afford to risk

111
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,290
the potential losses from that.

112
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,431
And yeah, after we'd been enduring the pandemic

113
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,252
for that long and we were, like I said,

114
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,192
we were running up to the launch of Boyfriend Dungeon

115
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,213
and I really needed people to not burn out

116
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,614
and I needed them to stay on after launch

117
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:34,595
and really come with 100% of their health.

118
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:44,725
It seemed like the best at least temporary solution. And, and then we thought well why not continue.

119
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:53,303
We implemented it in a, in kind of a knee-jerk reaction to an article I had read when,

120
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:59,445
back in 2019, there was an article that came out of a study in Norway that it was all around

121
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:06,267
focused hours of work. And basically the article was saying that, you know, in a normal day,

122
00:08:06,588 --> 00:08:12,650
on a five-day week, a human being can only have about four to four and a half hours of focused

123
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,031
work. The rest of the time you're a little bit distracted. You're on Facebook, you're, you know,

124
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,691
talking with colleagues, whatever it is.

125
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:21,893
And that they made a test and with a four day work week,

126
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:25,035
that four hours of focused work became five hours

127
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,197
to five hours and a half of focused work.

128
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,599
And so in a sense, in four days,

129
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,721
they felt like you could achieve as much as in five days

130
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,882
because the amount of focused work didn't change.

131
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:41,251
And so, you know, from that and also being in Montreal, there are a lot of studios here.

132
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:45,872
And so it is a competitive landscape to, you know, find staff, find senior talent and all

133
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,373
of that stuff and bring them into the studio.

134
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:54,776
And we were very much into already the idea of kind of trying to balance out work and

135
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:59,018
life together and kind of redefine what it means to work in, you know.

136
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:00,815
in the 21st century.

137
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:03,376
And so we decided to implement it at that time.

138
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:10,181
And as I said, the reception immediately was pretty crazy.

139
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,501
So we decided to keep it.

140
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,400
That's awesome.

141
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,422
And so as you were thinking about your, you know,

142
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:17,663
switch over to this new work week,

143
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,485
and as you were starting to plan things out,

144
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,187
what were your expectations around, you know,

145
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:24,428
the fact that there was no longer going to be a Friday

146
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:26,650
or whatever day you take off for the four-day work week?

147
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,771
Were you expecting productivity?

148
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,372
I know, Chris, you talked about this a little bit.

149
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:32,834
Were you expecting productivity to stay the same?

150
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:35,356
Were you expecting productivity to drop, you know,

151
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:37,418
a full 20% because there's that less time?

152
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,019
What were your expectations going into

153
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,921
rolling this out for your teams?

154
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,977
Our expectations were that we were going to probably lose a bit of efficiency in the short term.

155
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:58,391
Like I feel like I'm very aware of what I don't know in life. And so I was approaching it with the humility of knowing that we were going to have some some bumps down that road.

156
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:11,240
And so we decided to implement it for six months before we even decided to kind of look at what what the results were we decided to kind of give ourselves a really solid period of time and not stress out about it too early.

157
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,083
And so yeah we did expect some.

158
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:17,352
you know, some rough patches in the beginning.

159
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:19,873
There was a little bit of a slowdown at the start.

160
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,654
I think everyone was kind of getting into the groove.

161
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:24,275
You know, we can talk about this extensively,

162
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:26,055
but probably in the next section,

163
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,496
there's a lot of, you know,

164
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:29,197
challenges that come with the four-day workweek

165
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,157
that you need to be aware of.

166
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:32,978
And we kind of hit those face first every time.

167
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,041
But pretty quickly, I would say within three months,

168
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,645
I feel like we had reached a level of efficiency that

169
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,167
was similar to what we had in the past,

170
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,389
just with much happier people.

171
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,812
So it was a net positive for us.

172
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:51,536
Anyone else?

173
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:57,228
Um, I had very, uh, minimal expectations.

174
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,969
I wasn't really sure how things are going to play out.

175
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:01,510
I had a feeling that mental health was going to improve.

176
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,972
And then that was like a very drastic, uh, obvious shift for us.

177
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:07,393
Uh, so that was just really great.

178
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:12,875
I think something that I was unsure of is our team had scaled up during the

179
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:15,336
pandemic as a remote studio for the first time.

180
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:19,538
And so there are a lot of members, uh, of our studio that were, you know, people

181
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:21,939
I've never worked with, uh, in, in person.

182
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:28,688
And it definitely took a while to convince them to that the four day work week was real.

183
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:34,651
You know, it just when you're not a tight knit team, you have new members and they're just like,

184
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:38,812
oh, you're saying I can take off on Friday. Like, are you sure? And we noticed a couple

185
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:39,873
of people who were just like,

186
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:45,605
not doing that and that they're like well I can't finish my work if I don't continue working Fridays.

187
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:51,831
And so something we didn't anticipate was just how we were assigning work, how we were tracking it,

188
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,534
how much work was being assigned, and just a cultural level of

189
00:11:56,987 --> 00:12:05,052
providing safety to those newer team members who just started with us and were suddenly being told they're okay to take time off on Fridays.

190
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:11,216
That was a, that was a bit of a surprise for us that that, like, need to kind of convince and make that feel safe for people.

191
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:23,303
Yeah, I know for us as a studio. One of the biggest things and we're already segwaying into the next section but for us one of the biggest things that I think.

192
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:28,759
we thought about and then ended up doing was framing it as a trial and really running with

193
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,902
it as a trial. That way, when things were not working, if things weren't going to work, or if

194
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:40,747
things were going really well or whatever it was in between, that it was recognized that this is

195
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:45,210
just a trial, that we're going to see if this fits us. And if it doesn't fit us, there's ways we can

196
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,193
roll back or change or figure out. Giving ourselves the room to fail a little bit was really kind of

197
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:52,075
critical in our planning and something that

198
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:57,404
helped alleviate a lot of the planning speed bumps that we were expecting but didn't know

199
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:04,456
were going to happen as we were moving along. Yeah, I just wanted to add that our expectations

200
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,319
where the productivity would slightly dip.

201
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,443
I don't really believe that, I mean, maybe some of us

202
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:16,186
on the team do work that can be properly quantified

203
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:19,649
and like have productivity that's comparable to widgets,

204
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,010
but I think most of us don't.

205
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:26,014
I'm not even sure most of my tasks are focused work tasks,

206
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:27,055
if it comes down to it.

207
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:31,658
Like, I think I do a lot of loose brain chaos emails

208
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:33,720
and like that doesn't really.

209
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:41,371
need or create focus. But we were willing to, that's why I put it in terms of risk,

210
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:47,316
rather than anything we felt was measurable. My expectation was more, what Selene was talking

211
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:54,382
about, the mental health would be a little bit more stable, that people would feel like more

212
00:13:54,502 --> 00:14:00,207
able to put in those four days if they knew that they would have the three days at the end. And so

213
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:08,078
We expected to lose, I would say I expected to lose five to 10% just because I think most people,

214
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,185
most weeks check out Friday afternoons anyway, like even if they are doing work,

215
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:21,515
probably it's not the most focused. So that was my baseline expectation.

216
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:27,109
I can just riff off of what John, you mentioned before, I think it's super

217
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:31,292
important to leave yourself the room to fail at the four day workweek as well.

218
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,655
We implemented it, um, with a concept that was, this is a privilege that,

219
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,316
you know, that everyone has now.

220
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:41,899
Um, but you know, if ever shit hits the fan, you know, we could go back to the

221
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:43,260
five day week for a period of time.

222
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,102
if ever it doesn't work out for some reason, we could go back to the fight. Like, you know,

223
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:51,784
allowing yourself and telling everyone that this is kind of a trial thing is an important,

224
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:56,966
I think, aspect of it. And then the other thing for us that we had mentioned to everyone initially

225
00:14:57,026 --> 00:15:02,629
was just in the concept of work using the agile method, you know, we're working on sprints with

226
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:07,211
tasks and all that stuff. And I think it is important to try and get some data out of it,

227
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:11,593
you know, velocity and trying to get, you know, an amount of hours that it takes to do a certain task.

228
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:15,856
But, you know, at the end of the day, I'm not asking people to log in hours.

229
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:18,779
I'm asking them to deliver their tasks for the sprint.

230
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,904
And so we were already in a dynamic with, with everyone on our team, where we trust

231
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:27,447
that, you know, they'll they're, they're responsible for the work that they need to

232
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:27,587
do.

233
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:36,758
And, you know, them understanding that this was the reasoning behind it was that we trusted them to be able to achieve what they needed to achieve within the four days instead of the five.

234
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:45,409
Also gave them the opportunity to decide if they wanted to work a few hours on the Friday, but maybe take the Thursday afternoon a little bit more, you know.

235
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:50,717
chill, it gave them the flexibility essentially to be able to kind of pick and choose when they

236
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:56,545
felt more creative and when they felt more focused or when they felt more in a work mode.

237
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,409
So I think that's also something that really worked out for us.

238
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:08,120
Thanks. And Chris, you were we can kind of move into like the next section talking about how we're measuring the things that we're doing.

239
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:13,224
And to the to thank you, Chris, for answering the questions on how you were measuring that success there.

240
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:18,347
Firstly, Martanya, how are you measuring success for your team?

241
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:22,190
How are you measuring whether or not the four day work week was working or not?

242
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,071
Was it productivity?

243
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,453
Was it general feel?

244
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:27,453
How's everyone doing like?

245
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:32,175
What were you using as like kind of the benchmarks for deciding if this was a fit for you?

246
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:40,319
Well, part of why I was dubious about measuring the productivity is I think it's Goddard's law.

247
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:47,582
As soon as you make something a measure of success, it becomes a useless measure.

248
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:49,983
Because people.

249
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:55,430
sometimes unconsciously. If I told them they have to do a certain number of points,

250
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,191
well, I think they'll do that number of points.

251
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:06,793
I really, I could go back and look at now historically because it's not a measure that

252
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:11,237
everyone's striving for. There's no punishment attached to it. I could see what the productivity

253
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:17,443
is, but realistically, we would take it off if people felt like they weren't making forward

254
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:21,447
enough momentum because that kills the morale of many game developers. If they can just feel

255
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,029
like the project is stagnating and they're not moving forward.

256
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:34,592
Um, now, what are the chances that it's the Friday? That's the problem in that case? It seems pretty unlikely, like they still have, you know, a good number of hours to move a project forward. So maybe there's some other issue at that point.

257
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:50,636
Um, but yeah, it was really it was more just a, it was not measurable. It was really asking the team like, what do we think is the benefit? Is it worth the fact that maybe we will take 10% more time to make our projects, potentially? Is everyone okay with that?

258
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:53,977
And so far everyone is.

259
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:56,528
How about you, Selim?

260
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:00,329
Yeah, I agree that there was a lot of a gut check feeling

261
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:01,670
kind of thing going on.

262
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,391
We did track, we like just for planning purposes,

263
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:09,152
we're like, okay, well, this is how much velocity

264
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,192
our programmers were hitting.

265
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,573
There's how many points that we're completing in a sprint.

266
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,134
Let's see what it's like in four days.

267
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,114
And then we found that there was kind of very little

268
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:19,355
like difference for us.

269
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:26,808
Some weeks there were more productive some weeks were less productive it just kind of seemed to follow the same kind of cadence as a five day work week.

270
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:42,202
And we also checked our art asset output and kind of found the exact same result as well. And so it was like, okay, well on a productivity side, it's pretty much plus or minus within the standard expectations so not much of a change there, which is great.

271
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:53,580
And then we just conducted a bunch of interviews and anonymous feedback and one on ones about the four day work week to see how people were reacting to that.

272
00:18:53,701 --> 00:19:00,345
And it was pretty much, you know, maybe this sounds obvious, but it was really positive across the board.

273
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:03,467
And that was and I mean, just like me personally, like I was.

274
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,088
dying during the time.

275
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:07,510
Like I was fucking having a miserable time at work.

276
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,871
I was really stressed out.

277
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:10,272
I needed more time.

278
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:12,393
And so like just me on a personal level,

279
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:14,755
I could see the benefit to myself.

280
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:19,278
And that was, you know, co-op is a, it's a cooperative.

281
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:22,040
So we vote on our, on all of our policies,

282
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,123
but I'm just here representing the studio as myself.

283
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:29,145
And I could say easily that it had a significant impact

284
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:30,126
on my mental health.

285
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:33,308
So that was enough, honestly, for tracking.

286
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:35,691
Yeah, let's talk about that.

287
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,413
Let's talk about mental health impact on your team,

288
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:41,014
what you saw, like, especially as you were, you know,

289
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:42,675
going through your initial rollout

290
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:45,156
into like people feeling comfortable.

291
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:46,716
What were you seeing on your teams

292
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,077
in terms of mental health?

293
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:50,638
And were people coming fresh to work on Monday?

294
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:53,640
Were they feeling like the more time is better?

295
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,081
Was there anyone feeling anxiety

296
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:57,401
from the fact that it's a shorter week?

297
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:58,622
What were you seeing on your teams,

298
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:00,523
especially through the early stages

299
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,323
and going into the parts

300
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:03,484
where you're starting to become comfortable?

301
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,022
I can speak to that anxiety element because that was definitely present for us in our.

302
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:16,211
in our first attempt at the four-day workweek because we had I would say kind of poor production

303
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:21,974
planning as well as a milestone around when that was happening. So for some people they felt like

304
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:27,797
because of those such that scenario they felt like they couldn't as freely take that four-day

305
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:35,581
workweek and had to do overtime which we always track at co-op and also pay out at 1.5x salary.

306
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:36,742
So it was like

307
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:41,439
okay, if we're going to treat four days as the standard and the fifth day is overtime,

308
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:46,981
we need to also track that. And so there was anxiety around milestones and finishing things,

309
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:52,143
but I think those were really rooted in poor production practices because when we revisited

310
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:57,285
four-day workweek with a much stronger emphasis on smoothing out our production pipelines,

311
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:00,586
that anxiety kind of went away pretty quickly.

312
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,145
Yeah, on our side, it's similar.

313
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,306
You know, I think a lot of our processes

314
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,926
had to be reworked for the four-day work week.

315
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:15,208
But, you know, we did also do some interviews anonymously,

316
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:17,928
you know, sent out surveys and stuff like that.

317
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:21,269
And across the board, morale was up, you know,

318
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:24,130
and then I'm not sure what the stats are on this.

319
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,690
I'd have to go back and check, but, you know,

320
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,531
my gut feeling is there was a lot less absenteeism

321
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:29,151
during the week.

322
00:21:29,431 --> 00:21:29,931
I think, you know,

323
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,772
There's a lot of appointments that you need to do during the week because things are closed on the weekends.

324
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:39,754
And then people are going to kind of pick and choose a moment in the week where they're going to do that thing.

325
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:43,797
Now everyone knows that they have the Friday to do whatever that is.

326
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:46,998
And so when they need to plan something in the week, they don't plan it on a Tuesday.

327
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:50,260
They know that the Friday is off, so they'll just do whatever they need to do on the Friday.

328
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,440
So.

329
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,341
The four days was really all hands on deck a lot more than what we would see before.

330
00:21:56,901 --> 00:22:06,043
And I also feel like this might extend to just generally people taking sick days is

331
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,204
also something that I think we saw less of.

332
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:12,704
I think organically people just felt that they could be refreshed with the three-day

333
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:17,505
weekend and then come back into the work week ready to work, basically.

334
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:22,118
Tanya, is there anything you wanted to add?

335
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:25,760
I mean, it was very popular.

336
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,542
I don't think a single person ever complained.

337
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:33,906
I know that there is a little bit of a rough.

338
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,042
bit which I don't know if we're getting into the all the concerns yet but as far as mental health

339
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:46,588
goes um for me and my community manager we both have the kinds of things that might need us to

340
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:51,332
respond over the weekend uh for me it's more like an urgent business partner email for for her it's

341
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:53,754
like you know a discord fight breaks out something like that.

342
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,798
And so that's always been on our radar.

343
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:00,640
Like this doesn't really change that.

344
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:04,724
I know one thing we've adjusted for her

345
00:23:04,744 --> 00:23:07,066
is she tends to leave a bit early Thursday afternoon

346
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:09,008
planning to do a bit on Friday

347
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:15,493
just because it helps break out that weekend silence.

348
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,375
It's really hard to be away from social media

349
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,456
for a whole three days.

350
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:20,618
Like that's like an eternity in Twitter time.

351
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,983
I think initially her mental health, maybe it was harder

352
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,346
because she was anxious about leaving it for three days.

353
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,107
And now that we've worked out this system,

354
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:33,930
she can leave it for the two days and feel better about it.

355
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:37,754
Yeah, we definitely had something similar to that,

356
00:23:38,514 --> 00:23:41,517
where, especially with social media and partners,

357
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:43,859
there was a lot of anxiety around that.

358
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,642
I would say with partners, it's been a lot easier

359
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:47,142
because I've just...

360
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:49,638
people are like, are you available for a meeting on Friday?

361
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:50,819
I'll be like, nope, sorry.

362
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,221
Just no, I don't, I don't even say we don't work Friday.

363
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,483
I don't have availability, sorry.

364
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:57,244
Exactly. I'm just not, I'm not available.

365
00:23:57,424 --> 00:23:57,764
I'm busy.

366
00:23:57,844 --> 00:23:59,045
Yeah, exactly.

367
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:02,668
So that, that, that has worked pretty well for us.

368
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,629
In terms of social media,

369
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:05,850
something that we've just kind of realized is that

370
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,631
our

371
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:15,337
team and community management in general is vastly undervalued in terms of resources.

372
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:20,439
And so that actually brought up a really good conversation at our studio over the needs of

373
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:25,922
community management and that we were placing too much responsibility on one person to handle

374
00:24:26,502 --> 00:24:31,644
so much. I think this is a common thread in a lot of community management roles.

375
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:37,207
And so it actually forced us to hire up for that role so that we have two people in that

376
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,327
and that they can alternate.

377
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:50,770
And we also have paid volunteers for our Discord and our Twitter so that we can have people kind of keep eyes on things when core stuff is not available or, you know, it's a Friday and stuff and that's like really helped.

378
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:58,158
I think spread the load instead of feeling like Twitter and discord are all one person's responsibility and it's always turned

379
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:04,841
on. We actually had really good conversations around boundaries around that. We also close our discord during high traffic

380
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:11,503
times in our marketing push like you know we'll close our discord from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. or something so that people can't

381
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:11,983
talk so that.

382
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:17,109
even our mods can get some rest. And I think it just brought up a lot of conversations around

383
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:22,614
the boundaries and needs for rest versus the expectations of things like community management

384
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:27,319
and how that those were unfairly eating into people's personal time.

385
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:31,423
I think I have to mention that, you know,

386
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:38,354
organically, the leads ended up still doing a small meeting on Friday

387
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:43,799
mornings to kind of plan for the weeks ahead. And, you know, we don't stop them

388
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:47,862
from doing that, like, you know, as long as everyone is comfortable and they take

389
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:49,844
those hours off on another day in the week or whatever.

390
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:55,328
You know, anyone that kind of wants to have the peace and quiet of not being bothered by the entire staff on a Friday.

391
00:25:55,348 --> 00:26:00,751
You know, the leads do meet up and admittedly, I don't really do the four day work week myself.

392
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:06,975
I'm still in the rigmarole of trying to, you know, make everything happen all the time with the company.

393
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:07,176
So.

394
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:11,964
I in that sense, like I'm not I'm not giving a good example of what the four

395
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:12,905
day work week should be.

396
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:17,967
I feel like everyone watching this should follow Salim and Tanya's example, not

397
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:22,029
mine, because, you know, and we had this discussion with our leads, but it's in

398
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:26,791
part it's important that people don't feel like they would need to work on a

399
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:30,593
Friday to advance in the company or become a leader in the company or, you

400
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:32,914
know, kind of get get a head.

401
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,255
So that was really, really important to kind of kill that vibe right away.

402
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:37,776
And again, it just comes back to.

403
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:42,884
know, working on deliverables and making people understand that, you know, this is just what

404
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:47,728
they do in their sprint. This is part of their tasks and that whenever they decide to do them,

405
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:50,991
it's the same for you. You could decide to work on the Friday if you wanted to, but we're not,

406
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:54,153
you know, be it on the Friday or Thursday, it doesn't matter to us.

407
00:26:54,653 --> 00:27:01,639
I have one more note on mental health, which is I'm the first and so far only Kit Fox parent.

408
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:10,723
but I have found having a day where my kid is in daycare and I don't have to work, like it's a

409
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:17,926
massive mental health benefit that like all my my friends who have young children who don't

410
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:24,289
have Fridays off, like it seems like how do you get anything done and they're like I don't know.

411
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:28,551
So I mean it's I almost feel like it's something we should offer to all parents.

412
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:31,879
Yeah, I just a second that

413
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:33,441
fridays for me. I have tw

414
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:34,442
are two and four years ol

415
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:48,044
One of the things that's been really important to me is being a part of their lives as much as I can.

416
00:27:48,104 --> 00:27:57,247
And what Fridays have done for me is, yes, the time away from them and having my own personal time to for my own mental health has been really good.

417
00:27:57,307 --> 00:28:03,110
But I've also every single Friday morning I volunteer at my my older daughter's preschool.

418
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,451
And that's just been like one of the best things about the four day work week.

419
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,792
It's not even work related at that point.

420
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:10,693
It's just my time.

421
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,802
that I feel like I'm getting back.

422
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:16,167
And this only could happen unless I was taking

423
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,511
every Friday morning off from work normally.

424
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:22,178
So that was really important and great for me.

425
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,582
And speaking on like things that have been really.

426
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:31,453
good and beneficial. What are the benefits? What have you seen have been the major benefits for

427
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:36,295
your studios moving to a four-day workweek? And what are the big things that you've seen? And

428
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:40,398
what are the big picture things that you share when you want to talk about how great the four-day

429
00:28:40,438 --> 00:28:46,241
workweek is? I mean, I feel like I've covered this, but for me, it's just like, it's a place

430
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:51,684
I want to work at, you know? It's a place I want to work at a lot more than I used to. And I think

431
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:52,965
that's a pretty big deal.

432
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,110
Yeah, I mean, sorry, I interrupted you, Chris.

433
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:02,012
No, no problem. I think one thing that we noticed was, so we started in 2019,

434
00:29:02,552 --> 00:29:10,014
before the pandemic. And I'm really proud that our retention rate was very

435
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:14,656
close to 100%. Despite a worldwide pandemic in the past three years, I

436
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:18,757
haven't lost anyone on the team, be it to mental health or you know, whatever

437
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:19,797
reason, like everyone.

438
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,687
seems happy so everyone is sticking around, everyone seems healthy so they're sticking around.

439
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:28,856
We added a lot more during the pandemic to make sure that everyone was feeling

440
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:31,121
good and everything but still I think the...

441
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:37,552
the four-day workweek definitely helped everyone kind of be able to regroup, refocus, you know,

442
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:40,952
like talk with their families, do whatever they needed to do in those three days off.

443
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:46,053
That maybe on a five-day workweek would have just added a lot to the stress level of the team.

444
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:53,235
So retention, I think, is something, you know, as a studio owner, is a huge advantage

445
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:57,096
that we have versus other companies. And another thing I think

446
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,397
is that our employees are kind of getting used to the four-day work week as well.

447
00:30:01,777 --> 00:30:08,298
So I think it's going to be hard for them to find, you know, that same lifestyle in another studio.

448
00:30:08,818 --> 00:30:13,139
And so that also plays into, you know, trying again for us to have that best, you know,

449
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:18,220
work-life balance. I think studios that are going to offer that are going to have a unique

450
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,540
retention level with their employees and, you know, just generally have happier, healthier

451
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,021
employees working for them. And honestly, in the end,

452
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,152
People make games, you know, we need computers and brains.

453
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:31,973
I keep saying this all the time,

454
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,154
but I think it's really important to realize

455
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:36,536
that our primary resource to make video games

456
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,377
are human beings and, you know,

457
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,478
making sure those human beings feel as creative

458
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:43,880
and as focused and, you know, as ready as possible

459
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,662
to hit the ground running on a workday,

460
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:50,284
I think is all positive things that you wanna do.

461
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,230
Awesome. Yeah. And I know

462
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,651
just echoing a lot of wha

463
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:02,033
said here. Um, but I thin

464
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:04,194
that we saw is everyone w

465
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:06,315
on Monday with like stori

466
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:06,955
did over their weekend an

467
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:13,682
that they had going on and then just hit the ground running super hard. We saw that everyone

468
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:19,170
felt like they were coming to work happy and refreshed and then and I think for us, especially

469
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:25,098
framing it within the pandemic, everyone at Armor Games was struggling really hard, like really hard.

470
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:37,946
And we were at a moment at the company where we realized we weren't we were just trying to get everyone to the level of just being okay like okay was just the baseline we wanted to hit like can we get people to work going.

471
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:45,488
Okay, and I think the four day work week really helped us get beyond the okay bar and start moving towards.

472
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:47,589
like, what is ideal?

473
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:49,009
What is the ideal workplace?

474
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:49,950
And what does that look like?

475
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,850
And it really was that push for us.

476
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,951
And I think everyone feels those benefits

477
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:58,792
and feels a lot of the things that are positive

478
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:00,132
and good about the four-day work week.

479
00:32:01,573 --> 00:32:02,793
But on the other note too,

480
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,194
there was a lot of things that challenged us as well

481
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:08,614
at Armor Games, especially around certain disciplines

482
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:11,515
had more trouble adjusting to a four-day work week

483
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:11,955
than others.

484
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:12,996
What were some of your,

485
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:20,918
What were some of the things that you saw from your teams as you were rolling out the four day work week. Were there certain disciplines or

486
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:27,460
certain groups that were more challenged. Was there. Was there. Was that the company as a whole that was working through certain

487
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,961
things. Did it expose anything that you weren't seeing before from your studio. I know we went into some of this more or less with

488
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:37,862
some of you. But I was just curious if there's anything else the group saw.

489
00:32:39,922 --> 00:32:50,427
I'll start. I mean, Kit Fox has always been very, I would say, efficient about our communication. We're very focused. We didn't have a lot of excess meetings to cancel or get rid of or anything like that.

490
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:56,618
We, I think we did have a situation where,

491
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,542
like we believe in like being professionally respectful

492
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:01,603
is one of our pillars.

493
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:04,526
And for us, what professionalism means is like,

494
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:06,488
we have very, very synchronous work together

495
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:07,349
as collaborators.

496
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,291
We have core hours every day where everyone works

497
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:11,513
at the same time together.

498
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:15,116
And that's great, but in a five day week,

499
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:26,650
I think that sort of normalized nine to five working system, people sort of build in their own buffer, where they, because there isn't the flexibility of the schedule itself.

500
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,813
They build the flexibility in you know if I'm not feeling that great on Tuesday.

501
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:37,158
And I'll do the hours, but it'll be Friday that I then then maybe to get my tasks done I have Friday afternoon.

502
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:44,341
And that kind of flexibility had to shift in favor of the employees time and energy instead.

503
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:50,504
So for me, for example, if I have a bad Tuesday, it's sort of bad to work on Friday, right?

504
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:54,866
Like it's not when everybody's available. I can't collaborate with people properly on Friday.

505
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:59,628
I can't necessarily make it up because people won't be there. And I still could,

506
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:03,050
but it's, you know, it's overtime at that point. I'm working on the weekend, et cetera, et cetera.

507
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:18,981
And so one thing that I'm trying to encourage with my employees is to think of you can still do makeup Fridays, but, but it's tough because like I said like if your collaborators aren't there if your team members aren't there like it might not be a replacement

508
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:24,565
for that Tuesday afternoon you missed you might have to power through on Tuesday anyway somehow and how do you do that if you haven't slept.

509
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:35,531
So it's a, it's sometimes it's still a struggle, I think, to try and really feel like every day you're putting in that good 25% of a week.

510
00:34:39,315 --> 00:34:44,341
I think for us, we actually have a mix of asynchronous work

511
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:46,724
that ends up working really well

512
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:48,927
for when people use Fridays as a makeup day

513
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:51,890
where it's actually like, oh great, there's no one here.

514
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:52,711
That's perfect.

515
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,515
When I, if I take a Monday or Tuesday off

516
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:58,338
and I work on a Friday or I do Friday overtime,

517
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:14,930
Those are days where I'm just like so efficient because I can focus on all the tasks that I put off during the week, where I have to communicate with a lot of people, just because of the complexity and inefficiencies that we may, we may have on our project.

518
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:32,048
But we've also gotten really our team is pretty distributed across different time zones and also have different needs, mental health, physical health, emotional health, etc. And so we still maintain a very flexible time off policy and like let people just kind of, you know.

519
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:36,813
take whatever time they need, even within the four days, I think it's really important to still

520
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:41,495
provide that level of flexibility. And so we've gotten into a bit more of a culture of scheduled

521
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:46,317
messages on Slack, asynchronous communication, and I think that those are really, really

522
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:53,120
beneficial in general for remote work as well. And in a way that the four-day workweek has

523
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:59,683
actually made that more normalized and easier for us. Yeah, I know. Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Chris.

524
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:06,321
I had an employee who said that he did not want to work the four-day work week and he absolutely

525
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:12,384
wanted to work five days a week which was a strange one to have to deal with because again

526
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:18,246
I don't want to give him anything more than the others for working the extra day because that

527
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:22,988
defeats the purpose of the four-day work week but at the same time I understand that a lot of people

528
00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:28,471
you know have work as kind of their social life and work is very melded together.

529
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:32,352
And so do you stop someone from working on the fifth?

530
00:36:32,412 --> 00:36:36,113
So we ended up kind of, you know, discussing it openly

531
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:39,793
and kind of having the fifth day be more of like a paid,

532
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,534
you know, if he wants training

533
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:43,294
or if anyone wants training on a Friday

534
00:36:43,354 --> 00:36:45,755
and they want to kind of go through more schooling

535
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:48,456
or they want to go and like have this Udemy class

536
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:49,676
that we buy for them or.

537
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:54,317
stuff like that. We we're always open to doing that. And the

538
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:56,978
Friday is kind of a moment for that we had employees that

539
00:36:57,018 --> 00:37:00,139
wanted to do their own personal projects, which we encourage

540
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:03,159
them to do on the Friday. And so that even if they had questions

541
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,000
or whatever during the Friday, you know, like, feel free to go

542
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,781
on discord and say whatever you need to say. But so that was a

543
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:13,502
bit of a challenge to where, you know, a lot of programmers told

544
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,643
me actually that they didn't need the three days off, which

545
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:17,843
was a strange one. I'm like, you're

546
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:22,485
you're serious right now, you don't want to take the three days, you absolutely want to work the

547
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:28,928
five days. So that was a weird one to deal with, but I think it's important to still stay the line

548
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:32,790
of not encouraging people to do the five days because it would defeat the purpose of the four

549
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,090
day week.

550
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:42,642
The other thing that was kind of just an obvious one, but that you only kind of have to think about once you're in it is how you how do you deal with holidays?

551
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:51,650
Is it suddenly a three day work week when there are, you know, there are eight weeks in Montreal where, you know, during the year where there's a national holiday?

552
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,363
And so we decided to that we were going to stick to the four day work week.

553
00:37:56,423 --> 00:37:58,904
But when it's a holiday, you can decide to have that day.

554
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:02,266
If it's a Monday, you can decide to have the Monday off and then work the Friday

555
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:04,407
or you can keep the Friday off as usual.

556
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:08,650
But, you know, there's there was discussions around that as well.

557
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,132
You know, it not being an issue, just being like, OK, well, logistically,

558
00:38:12,152 --> 00:38:14,113
what do we want to do with this situation?

559
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:17,134
In my mind, again, it all comes back down to.

560
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:20,896
sticking to the sprint, sticking to the deliverables, no matter the number of

561
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:24,257
days it takes you to do, that's kind of our expectation of work for the next two

562
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:25,817
or three weeks, depending on the sprint size.

563
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,458
And that's kind of how we ended up treating it.

564
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:31,459
I don't know if Salim or Tanya, you know, you have a different way

565
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:32,599
to deal with holidays or Joan.

566
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,140
Holidays has been, uh.

567
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:42,982
a big back and forth for us as well. I think where we landed was a similar thing of like,

568
00:38:43,002 --> 00:38:47,005
yeah, either take them Monday or Friday, but also recognize because we are removing a day

569
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:51,808
and those holidays are kind of designed around a five-day workweek to like, that we need to

570
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:56,652
sort of accommodate the fact that that would maybe cut a lot of time off from our sprints

571
00:38:56,692 --> 00:39:01,095
and getting things done. I think it's kind of an open conversation at our studio, honestly.

572
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:04,478
It's something that we might revisit.

573
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:07,955
Yeah, we're still trying to figure it out too.

574
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:11,057
So far we've just said sometimes it's a three-day week.

575
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:15,079
And that doesn't feel great as a product manager

576
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:19,362
because typically we forget when we plan the sprint.

577
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:21,883
I mean, if you remember when you're planning the sprint

578
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:24,645
then it's not as bad, but you still have to look at,

579
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:25,666
well, how much would we get done

580
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:28,287
if we added two more days or three more days, right?

581
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:35,069
Um, but I think when one reason why we keep defaulting back to, well, it's just

582
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:39,112
another day off is, uh, we have some people who are part-time in addition.

583
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:43,455
So they're only working three days a week or two days a week, and they

584
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:44,476
should have a day off too.

585
00:39:44,756 --> 00:39:45,297
And it, right.

586
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:49,260
And it's like, well, if a three day a week person gets the day off, why don't I?

587
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,580
Right.

588
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,143
So then we're just like, well, I guess now you get off what 60 days a year,

589
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:54,924
52 plus the eight red days.

590
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:13,336
Yeah, I know for us, holidays have been like, like we've said before, like the moment you go from a four day work week to a three day work week, that's really, it gets really compressed, it gets really, it almost

591
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:16,188
in some ways it becomes li

592
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:16,788
you're like, oh, that's i

593
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:17,288
can be challenging. We, u

594
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:18,109
to keep all of our holida

595
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,689
them in ways that made th

596
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:21,169
the time that was availabl

597
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:22,490
start to squeeze the cale

598
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,330
does start to, especially

599
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:41,696
We're trying to plan, you know, an offsite.

600
00:40:41,736 --> 00:40:44,138
A lot of us haven't actually met each other in person before.

601
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:47,821
We haven't actually seen each other in two or three years.

602
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:51,184
So as we're starting to plan that, we're also having to consider that as well, especially

603
00:40:52,205 --> 00:40:54,487
as a publisher with lots of publishing partners.

604
00:40:54,507 --> 00:40:56,889
We want to make sure that they're being taken care of as well.

605
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:59,551
And that's always been like.

606
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:12,758
Yes, holidays and extra days off and those kind of things have been really kind of a challenging thing and I think something that we're all kind of speaking to on this panel is we're learning a lot of things in real time, and we are.

607
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:17,722
There's no guidebook on how to do a four day work week with a with.

608
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:24,766
in the games industry or as an indie or it's just it's something where we kind of have to solve

609
00:41:24,806 --> 00:41:28,549
these things on our own and see if they fit and all of our teams are different so we all have to

610
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:34,714
kind of fit it differently to our different needs. It's worth noting that part of this

611
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:40,198
conversation also started because our so we had somebody at three day work three day weeks and

612
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:44,621
paid appropriately like years and years before any of this.

613
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:50,312
And they pointed out that legally, they are still owed those eight days.

614
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:53,495
Like it's in the laws of Quebec at least.

615
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:59,501
But it'd be weird to then give them time off and not everybody else.

616
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:03,728
Yeah, we had to do a surprising amount of research

617
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:07,749
into US laws on how 40, like we just assume 40 hours

618
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:10,950
is a full week of work and it's bizarre.

619
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,331
Well, technically we do pay those hours, by the way.

620
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:16,972
I don't know if that's a different segment, I forget.

621
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,313
But technically we have 40 hour weeks

622
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:21,313
according to the government.

623
00:42:21,353 --> 00:42:25,475
It's just, we have eight hours of self-improvement

624
00:42:25,535 --> 00:42:27,916
or something is what it counts as.

625
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:28,696
Cool.

626
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:31,855
Let's get into the future of the four day work week.

627
00:42:31,895 --> 00:42:34,836
We're starting to run out of time, so I want to make sure we cover this topic.

628
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:38,498
We all gave our various experiences on our four day work weeks.

629
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:42,839
We're all very different studios, but I'm curious from this group.

630
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:46,281
Do you think that, you know, Indies, Indie developers as a whole

631
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:49,002
will be able to move in this direction and do this?

632
00:42:49,222 --> 00:42:52,983
Is this going to be a broader trend for the greater industry?

633
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:53,784
Where do you see

634
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:59,445
the difference between a four-day and five-day work week starting to shake out as more studios

635
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:09,488
jump on board? Huge question dude. Sorry. I think you know it's kind of a strange one but

636
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:15,670
I think it's going to need a big cultural shift in just the way work is perceived

637
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,791
in the general population for

638
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,952
for it to become something that's kind of normalized.

639
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:25,054
I think it's an arbitrary number to say that we should work

640
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:25,875
five days a week.

641
00:43:26,155 --> 00:43:27,395
It could be two, it could be three.

642
00:43:28,056 --> 00:43:31,477
Like who cares in the end, as long as you can live

643
00:43:31,538 --> 00:43:32,138
and be happy.

644
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:37,921
I think also a lot more people are orienting their life.

645
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:41,343
I think the pandemic has put a lot of different perspective

646
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,684
on what it means to work and what it means to be happy

647
00:43:44,704 --> 00:43:47,486
and at home and feel safe and secure and healthy.

648
00:43:48,346 --> 00:43:52,771
I think people are maybe less career oriented now

649
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,993
that there's been a worldwide pandemic

650
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:57,135
and everything's gone to shit in some fashion.

651
00:43:57,755 --> 00:43:59,557
I think a lot of people now might be saying,

652
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:04,282
well, maybe I wanna enjoy an extra day or two a week off

653
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:06,243
so that I can take care of my family,

654
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,205
do things that I enjoy, do things that I love,

655
00:44:09,126 --> 00:44:11,088
maybe sacrifice even some salary to do that.

656
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:13,050
I think I know people that have gone.

657
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:18,972
from the AAA studios that have come into smaller studios that are on the four-day week or have

658
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:23,335
decided to like chop their hours to do a three-day week even if they were making the huge salary with

659
00:44:23,355 --> 00:44:29,400
the AAAs. And you know I think we're going to see more and more people trying to go down that

660
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,563
lifestyle route instead of like the career you know money route.

661
00:44:33,143 --> 00:44:35,684
And I think that's a good thing in general.

662
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:37,604
And if more and more people start doing that,

663
00:44:37,684 --> 00:44:39,245
then I think it's going to get more normalized

664
00:44:39,305 --> 00:44:40,745
and you will see more studios doing it.

665
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:44,446
I think it is another beast for a AAA studio

666
00:44:44,946 --> 00:44:47,567
to tackle a four-day week than it is an indie studio.

667
00:44:48,487 --> 00:44:50,208
Just the sheer scale and coordination

668
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:53,049
of like a 400-person team working on a game.

669
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:54,269
I don't know how that would work.

670
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:58,130
But I think for indies, I expect that it's going to be

671
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,351
like more and more regular to see studios

672
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:01,171
on the four-day work week.

673
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:24,153
Yeah, to speak back to something that Chris mentioned, in terms of, you know, hiring people and attracting talent. That is one of the main things that small studios can offer. I can't imagine that this won't become the norm in the future. And I think it should become the norm. I don't see any reason for it not to be.

674
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:29,614
And part of that is retaining talent, attracting talent, because, you know, as small companies,

675
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:34,136
we don't compete with the big studios in terms of salary or benefits or whatever.

676
00:45:35,016 --> 00:45:39,437
So we have to find other ways to engage people in meaningful ways and make our

677
00:45:39,677 --> 00:45:47,759
work environments attractive for them. Honestly, maybe this is the pandemic,

678
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,820
like existentialism speaking a little bit.

679
00:45:51,402 --> 00:45:54,644
But I think that if there was a will,

680
00:45:55,825 --> 00:45:58,887
any industry out there could go to 40 hours a week.

681
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:02,549
It's just, it's more a matter of everyone wanting to do it.

682
00:46:03,149 --> 00:46:06,571
Like I think if all of the employees of Ubisoft

683
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,512
woke up tomorrow and said,

684
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:10,233
we only want to work four days or we quit.

685
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:13,617
Like suddenly it would be, they figure it out, right?

686
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:16,640
And that's like the magic of unions and co-ops

687
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,302
and all these other like worker forces.

688
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:21,384
It would be very, very difficult.

689
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:22,265
I'm not saying it's easy.

690
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:25,227
I'm not saying, I know that it would be even,

691
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:27,409
you know, exponentially harder,

692
00:46:27,469 --> 00:46:29,030
the larger your organization is.

693
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:33,234
Hats off to Chris already for 30 people versus 11,

694
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:37,377
but I absolutely think it'll become more and more normal.

695
00:46:37,497 --> 00:46:38,318
And I hope it does.

696
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:38,758
And I hope.

697
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:45,718
the most for our most vulnerable workers for like QA and community management and all the

698
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:51,062
people that are exploited more that they get to have more and more the kind of lifestyle that

699
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:58,326
they want for their talents. Sorry, Salim, you were going to say something in the middle of the

700
00:46:58,346 --> 00:47:03,269
night. I kept talking. No, no, no. I forgot what I was going to say. Sorry.

701
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:06,934
Cool, so let's just wrap up and then we can go to Q&A.

702
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:08,776
But the last question I wanted to ask the group,

703
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:13,080
if there was just one thing that you'd recommend

704
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,243
to any team considering a four-day work week,

705
00:47:15,263 --> 00:47:16,344
whether it's a piece of advice,

706
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,546
a thing that you keep thinking about,

707
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:21,689
what's that one thing that you would give to that group

708
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:24,071
who is thinking about that four-day work week shift?

709
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:34,350
Every single time that I run a postmortem in life, the one issue that keeps coming back in again and again is communication.

710
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:44,140
There's always issues with communication in some form. And so I think that's one thing that you really, really need to work on. So, you know, optimizing meetings and making sure the

711
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:55,551
There's a flow of communications from when things get decided to whoever needs to know those things, and not necessarily monopolizing everyone's time for meetings is something that's really important.

712
00:47:56,752 --> 00:48:02,277
Also, you know, going into a meeting with a schedule instead of just with already talking points that are pre planned.

713
00:48:02,935 --> 00:48:04,237
instead of kind of just winging it.

714
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:05,519
That's a big one.

715
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:09,644
Which was what we used to do, I think is really, really important because in the

716
00:48:09,724 --> 00:48:14,790
end you, you realize that on a five day week, you were, you were kind of already

717
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:18,314
cheating on a lot of stuff, like, you know, cheating hours here and there with, you

718
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:18,455
know,

719
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:30,674
I'm going to attend this meeting, even though I have nothing to do with it, just because I wanted to see or understand what's going on, knowing that it was kind of going to be like a more relaxed hour where you might not need to have a brain as focused as you usually do.

720
00:48:31,394 --> 00:48:39,180
So that's the kind of stuff that I think really needs to get worked on the asynchronous communication also like as Tanya mentioned, it can be an issue of.

721
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,042
someone's not there on a certain day or all that stuff are the things that we need to figure out.

722
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:48,204
But if you if you do put the time in that and you can fix that part of it,

723
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:53,207
the rest comes a lot much more naturally and easier than you might think to implement.

724
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,290
Salim, Tanya.

725
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:04,990
Yeah, I would say if you're a team considering the four day work week,

726
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,453
the most important thing I would suggest to you is to consider unionizing.

727
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:11,416
If you're a group of team members, you should

728
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:16,080
build collective power because you can't trust people like us

729
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,702
who are giving this talk right now as business owners.

730
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,406
You know, we might be nice bosses, we might be good people,

731
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,549
but there's nothing stopping us from reverting that or changing things

732
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:29,531
or exploiting in other ways. And so.

733
00:49:30,372 --> 00:49:32,453
The four day workweek is a great place

734
00:49:32,493 --> 00:49:34,593
to actually start organizing your workplace

735
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:39,335
because it's a really easy place to unify a lot of things

736
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:40,975
where you can be like, yeah, I would love that.

737
00:49:41,075 --> 00:49:42,115
And my team would love that.

738
00:49:42,135 --> 00:49:44,576
And that's a place where you find common ground

739
00:49:44,616 --> 00:49:46,057
to building solidarity.

740
00:49:46,077 --> 00:49:48,197
So I really recommend reaching out to organizations

741
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:50,938
like Game Workers Unite and other union organizations

742
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:54,159
on how to unionize, because then you can take some

743
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:58,280
of that power into the team's hand and enforce and ensure

744
00:49:59,758 --> 00:50:05,585
proper boundaries and good work life balance in a way that you can't by just trusting the owners of a studio.

745
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:15,926
Well put. My number one advice to both the bosses who are listening and the workers is to set a goal for yourself.

746
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:27,230
If you're a boss, like know what your goals are. Like for us, if our goals were mental health, that's something we can look at and measure whether or not we should continue and it was successful for us so we continued.

747
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:33,813
But if, and as a worker, like what are your goals for those Fridays? Are you going to use them to relax? Are you going to use them to have a side project?

748
00:50:33,913 --> 00:50:34,413
Like I think.

749
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:36,930
everybody feels better about it

750
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:39,912
when they know what their goals are for a change like this

751
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,954
and see the results through that lens

752
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:46,495
rather than after six weeks,

753
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:49,477
trying to look back and remember how it felt before.

754
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:54,220
Awesome, well, thank you all on the panel.

755
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,662
I think we have about nine minutes for Q&A.

756
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:01,244
Is there anyone who wants to ask any questions

757
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:01,724
for our panel?

758
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:12,726
Kit Fox might be hiring a programmer in the coming year

759
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:16,207
or so, if anyone wants to ask about that.

760
00:51:16,227 --> 00:51:19,069
I don't have any details yet, but keep an eye

761
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,950
on our Twitter and website.

762
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:25,191
It is hard to hire programmers, I hear.

763
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:29,834
So I'm hoping this will be a benefit.

764
00:51:30,894 --> 00:51:30,954
OK.

765
00:51:33,994 --> 00:51:35,974
You hear me, I think.

766
00:51:36,275 --> 00:51:38,716
I have actually a few questions.

767
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:40,556
First of all, it's about the leading people

768
00:51:41,657 --> 00:51:43,638
because there are usually people

769
00:51:43,658 --> 00:51:45,639
who are very focused and efficient,

770
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:48,860
and at the same time you work with people

771
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,200
who are not very efficient

772
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,681
and have some problems with time organization.

773
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:54,722
And how do you deal with that?

774
00:51:54,962 --> 00:51:55,763
Where are the traps?

775
00:51:56,903 --> 00:51:58,324
How do we deal with both attitudes?

776
00:51:58,404 --> 00:52:01,625
And how did the people switch to the four days a week?

777
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,970
I mean, I can say for us, I mean, that has always been the case, right?

778
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:12,093
Like on a five day week, there are some people who flail with their time

779
00:52:12,113 --> 00:52:13,794
and organization and other people who.

780
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:16,112
who are very good at it.

781
00:52:16,452 --> 00:52:18,774
And it's always a question of working with each person.

782
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:21,156
Like I'm not gonna have the same system

783
00:52:21,176 --> 00:52:22,116
that works for everybody.

784
00:52:22,196 --> 00:52:23,437
Some people I gotta remind them

785
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:24,798
of other timesheets every two days.

786
00:52:25,499 --> 00:52:27,520
And other people, I leave them alone for two weeks

787
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,263
and they come back with more spreadsheets

788
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:31,083
than I could have imagined.

789
00:52:32,204 --> 00:52:33,965
And this does make it more evident,

790
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:36,787
but I think if you're worried about someone

791
00:52:37,068 --> 00:52:38,409
not working hard enough,

792
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:40,190
like that's a separate conversation

793
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,131
from how many hours you expect them to work.

794
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:48,677
Yeah, something to add to that is you can always help enable people to be better with those things,

795
00:52:49,117 --> 00:52:54,639
but also production needs to also be flexible enough to not treat every person as one size fits all.

796
00:52:54,999 --> 00:53:00,062
And sometimes production actually has to just measure that different people have different outputs and you plan around that.

797
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:06,264
So yes, you give them support, you help them have the tools to improve where you think it's necessary,

798
00:53:06,545 --> 00:53:07,785
but also production.

799
00:53:09,122 --> 00:53:10,703
You can't just have like an artist and be like,

800
00:53:10,723 --> 00:53:13,484
well, I need you to make, you know, 15 assets a week.

801
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:15,886
And if the artist can only make seven assets a week,

802
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:16,866
that's their pace.

803
00:53:16,926 --> 00:53:18,347
You have to plan around that.

804
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:21,509
You know, I think it's very important to not treat people

805
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:26,631
as a, to just really not treat folks

806
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:27,972
with a one size fits all approach.

807
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,954
Yeah, and always giving feedback is also something

808
00:53:31,974 --> 00:53:33,775
that I think is super important

809
00:53:33,975 --> 00:53:35,836
and having that open conversation.

810
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:40,733
when you feel like someone might be underperforming or stuff like that are just like general things

811
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:45,655
but again that are those are issues that are as real on a five-day week than they are on a four-day week.

812
00:53:47,616 --> 00:53:54,439
Okay another question is about scaling it because you work in these studios do you think or do you

813
00:53:54,500 --> 00:54:00,562
feel that it can be scaled to bigger studios what are the possible traps there and do you have

814
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:01,363
anything to recommend?

815
00:54:04,751 --> 00:54:08,312
I guess I would recommend trialing it

816
00:54:08,432 --> 00:54:10,092
in the most isolated department.

817
00:54:10,172 --> 00:54:12,993
I worked at a large studio many years ago,

818
00:54:13,093 --> 00:54:14,133
so it's been a while,

819
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:17,873
but I imagine the more tightly integrated

820
00:54:17,973 --> 00:54:21,434
and the more cross collaborative they are,

821
00:54:21,494 --> 00:54:25,355
the harder that department will be to trial a four-day week

822
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:28,035
and doing it across the studio

823
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:30,876
would probably be a complete problem.

824
00:54:33,058 --> 00:54:40,721
So yeah, maybe there's a particularly segregated group that can do a milestone on 40 weeks

825
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:42,361
and then compare notes.

826
00:54:43,162 --> 00:54:44,322
What is the trial period?

827
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:50,165
For us, we started with six weeks and then we moved it to three months.

828
00:54:50,725 --> 00:54:53,346
So we doubled it after six weeks were successful.

829
00:54:55,667 --> 00:55:00,889
But I guess it would depend on the kind of milestones that that project has.

830
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:03,734
I'd be happy to talk with somebody in more depth.

831
00:55:03,774 --> 00:55:07,560
If you want to email me or tweet at me, we can organize a chat.

832
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:08,902
I can give some advice.

833
00:55:10,389 --> 00:55:14,331
I've never worked in a AAA studio, so I'm not really equipped to answer that question.

834
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:20,876
I know that in Montreal, Eidos Square Enix is looking at trying the four-day week or they're

835
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:26,840
implementing it in some form. So, you know, I would maybe reach out to them and see how they do it, but

836
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:32,463
I'm just, I don't have enough knowledge of the AAA space to be able to add anything.

837
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:39,873
Okay, and last question, I would like to ask about Agile. Do you work in Agile system? If so,

838
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:45,396
please elaborate on, did you squeeze all these meetings? This is pretty expensive,

839
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:50,319
you have planning, refinement, then you have to summarize all this up. And four-day weeks

840
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:55,502
seems to be pretty short to do all these things. How long your sprint lasts?

841
00:55:57,063 --> 00:56:00,024
So before you answer, we have three more people with questions.

842
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:00,985
This is the last one.

843
00:56:01,085 --> 00:56:03,406
So if you could keep the answer brief.

844
00:56:05,422 --> 00:56:05,803
Yeah.

845
00:56:05,843 --> 00:56:07,407
We can run over a little bit.

846
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:10,092
And hopefully, you were here at the beginning

847
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,395
to get their contact info.

848
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,099
And if not, we'll put it up at the end.

849
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,025
Can I take this one real quick?

850
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:21,169
I don't think Agile is designed for video games. I think you have to take Agile and make it work

851
00:56:21,249 --> 00:56:25,730
for video games. There are elements of Agile that you take and implement but you cannot get away

852
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:31,051
from waterfall elements as well. I think you design the systems for your particular games

853
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:37,393
and teams. You don't just adhere to Agile blindly or religiously and that's how you make it work

854
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:39,093
with the times and the constraints that you have.

855
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:41,358
For what it's worth, we do two week sprints.

856
00:56:41,678 --> 00:56:44,020
And yeah, Selim is correct, it's customized.

857
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,643
But we do cross department show off

858
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,925
and then sprint review and then sprint planning

859
00:56:50,026 --> 00:56:52,067
on Wednesday mornings, every two weeks.

860
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:54,409
And the total is about two hours.

861
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,332
It's very unusual that it lasts more than two hours total.

862
00:56:58,893 --> 00:56:59,113
Thank you.

863
00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:04,539
Hello. Thank you so much for the talk.

864
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,842
I wanted to come back to a point I think Salim, you mentioned.

865
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:14,067
You had to hire another person for your community manager because they were, you know,

866
00:57:14,528 --> 00:57:15,949
there was so much focus on that one person.

867
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:19,572
How do you have that conversation with that person without making them to feel…

868
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:25,119
Like they're not doing enough or like that you're trying to replace them because I can

869
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:27,321
see how that can easily feel like you're being replaced.

870
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,245
Like, oh, we're hiring another person just to help you with your work.

871
00:57:30,305 --> 00:57:31,206
Don't worry about it.

872
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:33,789
So how do you have that conversation that is meaningful?

873
00:57:34,853 --> 00:57:40,618
Yeah, well, so at Co-op, the core full-time team members are co-owners of the studio.

874
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:45,763
So there's a level of job security that that I think already kind of brings in.

875
00:57:46,723 --> 00:57:50,527
In our particular case, actually, our community manager was the person who was like,

876
00:57:50,687 --> 00:57:53,569
this is insane, this is not fair, and this is too much.

877
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:57,492
And so that was a reaction to them bringing up their need for help.

878
00:57:58,093 --> 00:58:01,215
But in other situations where we've noticed people need additional support,

879
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:03,958
it's kind of just like, hey, this is something we're noticing.

880
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:10,123
we think you need support. And if that's a threat or a problem or a fear for them then it's just a matter of having a

881
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:17,269
conversation being like let's lay it all down on the table and talk this out and just be mature about it. And I do think

882
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:24,375
being a co-op helps in a lot of ways towards that feeling of that fear of being replaced.

883
00:58:26,474 --> 00:58:31,017
Yeah, I know for us, one of the things that we do

884
00:58:31,097 --> 00:58:33,738
as a publisher is we do internal QA for our games

885
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:36,319
and we found that QA didn't kind of get the same kind

886
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:40,502
of productivity boost that some of the other pieces

887
00:58:40,522 --> 00:58:41,782
of our publishing program did.

888
00:58:42,043 --> 00:58:44,324
And so it became a conversation that got surfaced

889
00:58:44,364 --> 00:58:47,586
by the QA team that like, hey, like we're falling short.

890
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:49,687
We're not, you know, we're not falling short 20%

891
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,828
but we are definitely falling short on QA.

892
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:55,688
You need, your team needs to be trusted

893
00:58:55,729 --> 00:58:58,670
to bring those things up and be able to respond to it.

894
00:58:59,491 --> 00:59:01,292
In fact, if your team member

895
00:59:01,452 --> 00:59:03,273
is not highlighting those problems,

896
00:59:03,634 --> 00:59:05,875
I would want to ask why,

897
00:59:06,015 --> 00:59:08,457
I would dig into why that's not being surfaced to you.

898
00:59:08,557 --> 00:59:11,198
What is actually scaring them and solving for that.

899
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:16,962
Thank you so much.

900
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:22,645
Hi, I'm curious, some of you mentioned pushback

901
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,486
from your studio members about not wanting to go

902
00:59:25,506 --> 00:59:27,847
to four weeks, especially programmers.

903
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:30,267
Can you dive into some of the reasons they specified

904
00:59:30,307 --> 00:59:35,449
and how you mitigated?

905
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:38,149
I feel like I'm part of this crowd.

906
00:59:38,209 --> 00:59:40,470
So I'm gonna like venture a guess as to why,

907
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:43,230
like we didn't, you know, go delve into too much of it.

908
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,731
But my understanding is,

909
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:55,161
A lot of people come into the industry with a chip on their shoulder wanting to become the best at their craft, the best at what they do, and they understand that they need to put the practice hours in to be able to do that.

910
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:59,005
When you have that competitive mindset, or you have that

911
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:05,502
that drive, it's hard to stop someone from wanting to learn everything about the world, you know.

912
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:10,808
So I think it was mostly that kind of issue. I think programmers might be a more competitive

913
01:00:10,848 --> 01:00:17,135
field in particular. It's a, I don't know why, I don't know if it's ingrained at school,

914
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,257
I don't know where it comes from.

915
01:00:19,478 --> 01:00:21,441
But I think that's part of where it comes from.

916
01:00:21,962 --> 01:00:27,691
It's just that drive of wanting to be the best that made them want to work the extra time in.

917
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:32,098
And then it's just having a conversation with them of making sure that it's a healthy.

918
01:00:33,746 --> 01:00:36,828
it's a healthy thing that they're doing. You know, I was always that driven.

919
01:00:36,848 --> 01:00:41,452
I was always, I'm a very competitive person. So I have that instinct in me.

920
01:00:41,492 --> 01:00:45,435
And I understand that I do work more hours than a general person might in

921
01:00:45,495 --> 01:00:49,178
general. That's why I started my company and I decided to do what I did, but

922
01:00:52,078 --> 01:00:53,220
I'm very fulfilled in life.

923
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:53,921
I'm very happy.

924
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:54,562
I have a wife.

925
01:00:54,662 --> 01:00:57,045
I have a very balanced, you know, social life.

926
01:00:57,265 --> 01:00:58,867
And I think that's the important thing.

927
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,751
So you might want to, you know, you don't want to discourage necessarily

928
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:02,712
people from wanting to learn.

929
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:06,036
Um, but you do just need to track and make sure it's for the right reasons,

930
01:01:06,257 --> 01:01:08,319
though, it just be my, my take.

931
01:01:09,379 --> 01:01:16,407
In our situation, the pushback actually came from people who were using work as a coping mechanism for the pandemic.

932
01:01:17,268 --> 01:01:23,274
And so when that kind of feedback came back to us, it was like, well, let's discuss that.

933
01:01:23,374 --> 01:01:25,997
Is that really the best path forward for you?

934
01:01:26,217 --> 01:01:27,459
Are there other solutions to?

935
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:28,920
find other ways to cope.

936
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,660
Because I personally don't believe using work

937
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,881
as a coping mechanism for the pandemic is healthy,

938
01:01:32,941 --> 01:01:35,722
because in the long run, once things change,

939
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:38,063
if they change, you're left with nothing,

940
01:01:38,243 --> 01:01:39,183
no support network.

941
01:01:39,644 --> 01:01:41,084
You put all your resources into work

942
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:43,305
and you're kind of fucked and alone at the end

943
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:44,905
and have very little to show for it.

944
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:48,607
So it was a matter of just really pushing back

945
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:49,647
against that very strongly.

946
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:52,188
Got it.

947
01:01:52,448 --> 01:01:53,749
So people just need therapy.

948
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:54,409
Thanks.

949
01:01:55,528 --> 01:01:59,553
That's generally a very common piece of advice that we give our team.

950
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:04,804
Very quickly, so a lot of the criticism of the four-day workweek comes from the angle

951
01:02:04,824 --> 01:02:08,565
of sort of like, oh, like the benefits are temporary because once people become acclimated

952
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:11,786
to it, you know, they're less excited about it, like that sort of thing.

953
01:02:12,386 --> 01:02:17,027
I know stretching on two or three years, maybe some of your fears around that have been alleviated,

954
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:20,288
but could you talk a little bit about that and maybe some alternative schedules such

955
01:02:20,308 --> 01:02:26,070
as like summer hours, like three days a week during like the summer or taking August off

956
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:26,570
or things like that?

957
01:02:28,273 --> 01:02:31,594
Well, I can say that we also give five days a week,

958
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,854
five weeks a year of vacation.

959
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:37,395
If you've been at Kid Fox for at least a year

960
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:39,715
and four weeks for the first year.

961
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:43,316
So you can already take August off.

962
01:02:44,156 --> 01:02:48,497
But I mean, honestly, I went into this

963
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,918
with the full expectation that people would normalize to it.

964
01:02:52,258 --> 01:02:54,139
And I think that they have at this point,

965
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:55,219
like we're almost to one year.

966
01:02:55,991 --> 01:02:57,312
And I think that's OK.

967
01:02:57,492 --> 01:03:01,554
If this is their idea of normal, we've actually won.

968
01:03:01,854 --> 01:03:03,895
We've improved their expectations

969
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:05,856
of what work and life should feel like

970
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:08,437
and how happy they should be as a baseline,

971
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:10,478
even in a difficult world situation.

972
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:14,720
And so yes, I actually think that the biggest

973
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,001
problem with these bigger companies

974
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:19,562
is that because I think the benefits are immeasurable

975
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,203
and because they're human-oriented,

976
01:03:21,743 --> 01:03:25,046
And because maybe, yeah, it does mean that some departments,

977
01:03:25,106 --> 01:03:27,688
especially, are gonna be five to 10% less productive,

978
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:31,271
it really has to come from the workers

979
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:33,032
to fight for this kind of thing,

980
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:35,834
because in the long run, it is probably a profit loss,

981
01:03:36,155 --> 01:03:37,836
and somebody has to say that's okay.

982
01:03:38,877 --> 01:03:40,238
Yeah, I think it's a win-win,

983
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,920
because anything that challenges the dominance of work

984
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,102
in our lives is for the best.

985
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:47,984
So if that's being normalized and so on,

986
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:49,605
then I think that that's just a good thing.

987
01:03:51,213 --> 01:03:55,157
Might also be unique to Montreal, but there's a lot of video game studios as well.

988
01:03:55,337 --> 01:03:56,538
So, you know, people talk.

989
01:03:57,319 --> 01:04:00,822
So even though they might get acclimated to the four-day work week,

990
01:04:01,403 --> 01:04:04,025
I think, you know, speaking with other studios and understanding that

991
01:04:04,606 --> 01:04:08,129
they have something that other studios might not have that makes their life easier,

992
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,113
still makes it feel like it's something that's worthy or something that has value.

993
01:04:13,274 --> 01:04:16,356
It's not like they suddenly stop caring the fact that they have it today.

994
01:04:16,657 --> 01:04:23,939
I'm starting to hear about like board game meetings and D&D meetings and like moviegoers that are like all four day work week people.

995
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:25,939
And so I was like, maybe that will help.

996
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:34,242
Every, every single time I get to Thursday night or Friday, I'm just like, thank God.

997
01:04:34,902 --> 01:04:37,283
Like, thank God it never gets, it never gets old.

998
01:04:37,663 --> 01:04:38,823
It just never gets old.

999
01:04:38,923 --> 01:04:42,324
It always feels good to get to Thursday or sorry to get to Friday.

1000
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:43,745
So yeah, for sure.

1001
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:46,607
I think that's all the time we have for the panel.

1002
01:04:46,647 --> 01:04:49,609
Thank you, everyone in San Francisco who came to see us.

1003
01:04:49,649 --> 01:04:52,831
Or thank you if you're watching this on the vault or YouTube

1004
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:54,332
or wherever this video might be in the future.

1005
01:04:54,352 --> 01:04:55,753
Appreciate everyone's questions.

1006
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:58,195
Appreciate the panel being here and sharing their topics.

1007
01:04:58,255 --> 01:04:59,416
And thank you, everyone.

1008
01:04:59,636 --> 01:05:00,637
Hope you have a good rest of your day.

1009
01:05:00,657 --> 01:05:02,158
Thank you.

1010
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:02,798
Thank you very much.

1011
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:03,779
Thanks, everybody.
