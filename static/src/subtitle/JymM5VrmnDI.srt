1
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:07,097
I'm supposed to remind you that

2
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:12,138
you'll get an e-mail after this talk to rate me if you'd like

3
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:15,922
to. And please do take the time to do that. I would love to get

4
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:19,725
the feedback whether you like this kind of content, whether

5
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:23,868
you think this is useful. This is kind of a wacky, vaguely

6
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:27,652
personal subject to me. And I'm not really sure how much

7
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:31,195
interest there is in this sort of really to me special group of

8
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:34,137
players because we're not the biggest scene around. So the

9
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:36,859
feedback would really help me. So I'd appreciate it.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,383
So without further ado, let's see. Like I said, I'm Tom. I've

11
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:47,188
been involved in competitive gaming, eSports, for over 25

12
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:51,692
years now. First as a player, as what amounted to a pro back in

13
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:56,016
the early 90s. I was a fanatic street fighter player, traveled

14
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:59,139
the country, going to tournaments. My mains were

15
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,920
Chun-Li and Dhalsim, just in case you're curious.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,202
They're still my mains.

17
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:07,945
In 2011, I dove into the games industry as a developer,

18
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:10,547
co-founding a little startup called Radiant

19
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,608
with my twin brother and co-founder.

20
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:16,251
There we produced our own fighting game,

21
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,112
had a brief alpha for about six months.

22
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:19,393
That game was called Rising Thunder.

23
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:21,754
And we later sold that company to Riot Games.

24
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:28,300
But in the background for the past 15 years I've been sort of

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,904
developing this project called Evo with a couple of awesome

26
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,386
partners and that's really what I want to talk to you about

27
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,367
today.

28
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:36,938
And let's get to it.

29
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:39,300
So this is a really quick timeline.

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,743
I want to talk about a special group of players for me.

31
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,005
It's called the FGC, the fighting game community,

32
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,046
and talk about why I think they're

33
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,308
special in the world of esports.

34
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,610
I want to describe how they got that way

35
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,711
and describe most of my talk on that subject.

36
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,733
And then I'll contextualize it for how it matters

37
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,215
if you're building a game or if you want

38
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,636
to be involved in esports.

39
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:58,917
Okay, so, behold, this is the FGC.

40
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,298
How many people know what this is?

41
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:02,278
Show of hands.

42
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:03,099
Oh good, most of you.

43
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:05,260
Okay, so this can go fast.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,141
So, the FGC, for maybe those of you

45
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:09,962
who are seeing this for the first time,

46
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:13,103
is a group of really passionate fighting game fans

47
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:15,865
who have organized themselves

48
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:18,246
into basically a global collection

49
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:20,087
of grassroots tournaments.

50
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:22,588
So, on any given weekend throughout the year,

51
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:28,651
tournaments for street fighter, all kinds of fighting games

52
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:36,654
happening all over the world. The US, EU, Japan. And the

53
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:40,056
largest of these events is EVO. And this is the event.

54
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:44,826
that I help run. It's kind of the de facto annual championship

55
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:48,910
of fighting games. We hold nine tournaments throughout a

56
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,554
weekend. And players really show up to this thing. Last year we

57
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,677
had over 10,000 players show up from over 70 countries.

58
00:02:56,337 --> 00:03:03,099
And what's unique about this scene and Evo is that almost all of these tournaments are open.

59
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,860
They have open brackets.

60
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,001
Anyone who wants to come can play and compete against the best in the world,

61
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,922
regardless of your skill level.

62
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,963
Okay, so why is that important? Why does it matter?

63
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:19,004
Well, when we think about eSports events, we usually think about something like this.

64
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:20,845
And these are legitimately awesome.

65
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,445
I love going to these. I love watching them.

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,643
But the draw of this event is to watch the pros play at the very highest level.

67
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:33,245
It's that spectacle of seeing the best of the best of the best compete.

68
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:39,108
And most of the people in this stadium probably play this game.

69
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,450
Most of them are probably actually competitive players, right?

70
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,631
They play to win.

71
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,973
But in the context of this event, they're showing up as fans.

72
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,262
right, to watch the pros. So it's kind of like the NBA where

73
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,344
you may play basketball, you may be a diehard basketball fan, but

74
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:57,186
when you go to a Warriors game, you don't expect to like lace up

75
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,507
against Steph, right? That's just not why you're there. You

76
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,468
have to watch Steph do incredible things that you can't

77
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:05,230
do. Okay? But by contrast, this is the show floor at EVO and

78
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,152
this is what you see in all these fighting game community

79
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:12,775
events. What you're seeing are about 4 or 5,000 players all

80
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:15,337
competing at

81
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:21,380
30 or so playstations set up around the floor and it's so dense that you can't even see many of the playstations.

82
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,882
And this is about half of our show floor. Imagine like a whole monitor sort of next to this.

83
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:29,505
And that encompasses sort of what day one or day two of Evo looks like.

84
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:35,188
And so the draw of this event is not to sort of watch the pros, it's to compete against them.

85
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:42,031
It's to participate in an event which with a huge set of your peers and test yourself and see...

86
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:46,973
test your limits, see how far you can get into this event.

87
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:49,974
So it's a lot less like the NBA, and it's more like poker.

88
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:52,835
Where if you go to the World Series of Poker,

89
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,355
it doesn't matter if you're like a sponsored pro,

90
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:57,036
or if you're just sort of a casual player,

91
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:59,557
you go to this event with a winning mentality.

92
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,918
You're trying to get as far into the bracket as you can

93
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,778
to maybe make it money,

94
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:07,339
and then maybe if you're a long shot, even to win.

95
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,139
And so it's a different mentality.

96
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:16,113
So if you sum all that up, I think these are how our events

97
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,114
come together.

98
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:19,797
And it's a stadium setting in the end.

99
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:22,220
But all the people that you see in the stands

100
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,683
are basically kind of dead bodies, right?

101
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:27,446
Almost all of them were players who

102
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:28,947
got knocked out of this event.

103
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:31,210
And they stick around, and they watch the conclusion

104
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,271
because they love their sport.

105
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,590
and they're invested.

106
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,211
In fact, many of them probably got knocked out

107
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,932
by the two players who were left

108
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:39,133
playing for the ultimate championship.

109
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,494
Like they have skin in the game.

110
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:41,815
Like this is personal for them.

111
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:44,817
Okay, and so these are the three key values

112
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:47,459
that I attribute to the fighting game player, right?

113
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,042
There's competition and especially the spirit that.

114
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:58,627
competitors are all equal and every player deserves a shot at the best in the world.

115
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:05,731
There's the concept of hype. Fighting games are a 1v1 action genre. It's super emotional

116
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:11,355
and players love to see what happens to that dude when he's in that chair in the moment

117
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:13,076
up against the wall and he has to perform.

118
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:18,420
There's a whole lexicon of terms describing hype,

119
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,122
like there's salt, the pop-off, right?

120
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:24,444
Players really have almost like a WWE mentality

121
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:26,246
to seeing the action unfold on screen

122
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:28,968
and seeing the personal drama of human beings, right?

123
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,749
And then there's, this is related to competition,

124
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:34,412
there's the struggle, the idea that every single player

125
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:36,733
is always in a personal journey to get stronger,

126
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,395
and even if you're a bad player.

127
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:44,197
or a mediocre player, you earn respect for sort of putting your hand to the rig and testing yourself.

128
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:46,398
Okay, so, part one, over.

129
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:49,059
So, how did the scene get this way?

130
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:53,281
Why is the scene value those three values so highly?

131
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:58,343
And part of it is probably that this is a genre that embraces the warrior's fantasy.

132
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:02,845
So many of these games are tied up into martial arts themes and players are probably...

133
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:05,446
consciously or subconsciously sort of bind into that,

134
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:07,786
and so they tend to value these things.

135
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,987
And I think there's some truth to that,

136
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:11,767
but I don't think that's the major factor.

137
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,168
I think there's something much deeper

138
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:14,608
and fundamental at play,

139
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:17,429
which is that this is a genre that grew up in the arcades.

140
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:21,230
And that was a very specific moment in time

141
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,770
that probably won't happen again.

142
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,491
And that arcade had a very specific set of rules.

143
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:28,331
And that arena...

144
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,624
taught players what to value. It shaped their motivations.

145
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:37,088
And once those players had those motivations set,

146
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,211
they passed them down to future generations of players.

147
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:41,974
So then now you have younger players who have never

148
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:44,016
stepped foot in an arcade, never had that experience,

149
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:45,118
but they value the same things.

150
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,100
They learn that from sort of their ancestors.

151
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,101
And I guess I'm one of the ancestors,

152
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,584
which doesn't make me feel great.

153
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,005
But what was this experience?

154
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,067
What was so special about arcades?

155
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,629
Why was it different?

156
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,133
I want you to rewind your mental stack

157
00:07:58,133 --> 00:07:59,074
all the way back to 1991,

158
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,137
which is the heyday of the arcades.

159
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:04,061
So this was a full 20 years before watching video games

160
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:05,864
of the internet was a thing, right,

161
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:07,266
with Twitch and with YouTube.

162
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,547
This was a long time before the birth of eSports,

163
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,949
at least for me personally, which was StarCraft.

164
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,931
And this was a full five years before multiplayer gaming

165
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,393
on PC was a thing with the original Doom.

166
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:21,775
So this was a lifetime ago in our industry.

167
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:22,755
This was a long time ago.

168
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:29,238
none of these things were around. But what was happening was a vibrant competitive scene

169
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:36,241
happening in arcades all over the world. Okay? Players were organizing into tournaments, the

170
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:42,483
companies themselves were sponsoring big tournaments. And if you were into competitive

171
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:46,825
gaming, if that was your thing, back then odds are you were playing a fighting game because it

172
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:47,925
was kind of the best game in town.

173
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:56,237
Okay, so this is a really old photo of Southern Hills Golf Land, which is a now dead arcade

174
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,378
that was in Orange County, California.

175
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:01,100
In the US at least, this was the place to play. This was kind of like the Mecca.

176
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,322
This was known to have the best players in the country.

177
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:07,324
They would hold regular tournaments, and if you were a street fighter player,

178
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:10,266
you would come to this place. People would travel from New York, from the Midwest,

179
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,187
to play against these players.

180
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:12,988
And when you did that...

181
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:14,608
Here's what the experience was.

182
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,409
First, obviously, this was a public place,

183
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,270
so you had to physically go there.

184
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,110
And then you show up with whoever happens to be

185
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,391
in the arcade at the time.

186
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:24,052
And when you wanted to play,

187
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,853
you'd walk up to one of these cabinets

188
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:26,953
and put your quarter up.

189
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:30,394
Literally put your quarter up on the sill of the machine.

190
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:32,335
And that reserved your spot in queue.

191
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:35,816
Reserved, I say, in giant air quotes.

192
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:37,857
But right now you can see there are four people

193
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:38,638
who are waiting to play.

194
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:40,978
This person is putting their turn up

195
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:42,239
and you'd wait in line.

196
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,785
it was your turn, you take your quarter, put it in the machine and you play. You play against

197
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:51,452
whoever happens to be there at the time next to you. It could be like the best dude in the

198
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:57,281
arcade or the country or it could be just a random person. And the key thing about this,

199
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:03,067
is that we didn't have things like matchmakers.

200
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,848
It was all sort of house rules

201
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:07,430
to determine how you got to play.

202
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,953
And so what is on the line for these players

203
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,834
when they're going through this experience?

204
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,116
Because that's really what shaped their values.

205
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:18,278
And I want to talk about this in terms of three stakes,

206
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:19,759
three primary stakes, right?

207
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,841
There's time, there's money, and there's face.

208
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,422
When I say face, I mean respect.

209
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,724
Respect and admiration of your peers, okay?

210
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:27,045
So let's talk about time and money.

211
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:32,089
And I want to tell you a story, real briefly, about how I got involved with fighting games

212
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:36,472
with the original Street Fighter 2 and a putt-putt golf arcade near my house.

213
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:43,670
I was in high school. I did not have a car. I did not have a driver's license. So merely

214
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:51,593
getting to the game was kind of an ordeal. I had to either persuade my mom or bribe like a kid

215
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:57,415
with a car to get me to that arcade. The game itself was a scarce resource. You couldn't just

216
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:00,336
sit down at your computer or whip out your phone and play this thing. It took effort to get

217
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:02,096
there. And once I was there...

218
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:05,543
I had maybe like six to eight hours a week

219
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:07,823
that I could devote to playing games in the arcade,

220
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:08,583
and I had probably $20, right?

221
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:13,725
Those dollars and those hours were my lifeblood.

222
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:16,585
They determined how much I would get to play

223
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:19,206
this game this week, and how much I got to play the game

224
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:20,766
determined how much better I would get.

225
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,527
That was my practice time, right?

226
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,167
So in a very real sense, I had limited lives.

227
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:27,249
and as I'm going through this experience I'm burning lives at

228
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:29,671
the same time. If I put in a quarter I lose a little money.

229
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,072
If I lose I go to the back of the line so I lose maybe a lot

230
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:35,514
of time. That time gap could be 20 or 30 minutes before you get

231
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:37,376
to play again. So it's super sharp.

232
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,501
And the final factor was that the only way that I could get better,

233
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,483
the only way to stretch out those lives, was to win.

234
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:48,185
That's the only way you're going to get to play for free.

235
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:51,207
That's the only way you're going to get to play even two times in a row, is win.

236
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,647
Beat that person who's next to you.

237
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,209
And what I learned going through this experience,

238
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,270
what everyone around me learned really quickly,

239
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,071
was that...

240
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:01,774
everyone is a competitor. It doesn't matter if you are playing

241
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:03,936
this game for the first time this week or if you've been

242
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:07,038
playing for years. When you step into this arcade and you step

243
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:09,881
up to a machine, you have to go in with a winning mindset. You

244
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,704
have to try to win. It's sort of a no excuses environment, right?

245
00:12:13,704 --> 00:12:17,167
And winning like freaking matters, okay? There wasn't such

246
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:20,930
a thing as like a moral victory if you did your best and you

247
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,713
almost won and that guy is better than you anyway. So it

248
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:25,234
doesn't matter. You're still going to the back of the line.

249
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:30,438
right? So there's a premium on winning like every single time.

250
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:34,782
And so this was like illuminating and like crack for

251
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:40,547
me and I just really got into it and got involved with it and as

252
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:40,988
time went by.

253
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:47,420
I moved out of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where I was, and school brought me to California.

254
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,687
At the time I didn't know, but I was being dropped into one of the most hyper-competitive

255
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:56,171
hottest spots for fighting games in the US at the time.

256
00:12:56,171 --> 00:13:01,257
I learned a ton about face and how you earn respect.

257
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:08,709
right? How you earn respect among your peers in this kind of an environment. So I want to

258
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:15,511
remind you that these arcades were public places. Which meant that anyone could go and the

259
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:20,572
geographical reality of this was that the usual players tended to congregate in the same

260
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:25,254
arcade. So people would go to the arcade in their neighborhood. So you were always fighting

261
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:28,735
with a group of familiar peers. And in this peer group,

262
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:34,336
everyone had a role to play. There was like the alpha, the dude who everyone knew was the best.

263
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:39,377
There were sort of the upper comers who were trying to like unseat the alpha. There were

264
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:43,357
the regulars who were neither good nor bad but they all just showed up because maybe they liked

265
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:48,378
it. And then there was kind of the fish. The person who had a bottomless supply of quarters

266
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:51,759
but they always lost but they always seemed to keep putting them up. And they were kind of like

267
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,900
the break where you're like, okay, I'm fighting the fish, I can take it easy for a bit and rest up.

268
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:59,467
unfortunately like local boy from Albuquerque moving up to

269
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:04,014
California full of killers I was like the fish initially. And so

270
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:10,472
I lost a lot trying to like razor up my skills to be able to

271
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:14,856
compete with these guys. And an interesting thing happens to you

272
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:17,358
when you're in the back of that queue. The first thing is

273
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:20,140
remember your quarter is up on the machine. You can't really go

274
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,364
anywhere because if you go off and like try to come back in ten

275
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,945
minutes, your quarter will be gone.

276
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:27,948
and no one will know what happened to it.

277
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:30,511
And the thing is, if you're smart,

278
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:32,152
you don't want to go anywhere.

279
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,854
You want to have laser eyes on that screen

280
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:36,296
so you can watch that dude who just beat you

281
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:37,597
and maybe learn something,

282
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:39,218
or at least study up on his pattern

283
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:41,580
so you'll have a better chance of beating him next time.

284
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,862
And so around this arcade cabinet,

285
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:45,944
you have a captive attentive audience.

286
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,266
They're captive because they can't go anywhere,

287
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,166
they'll lose their quarter.

288
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,268
And they're attentive because they want to learn this game

289
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,069
and the only way you can learn if you're not playing

290
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,150
is by watching and watching really closely

291
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,870
about the action that's happening on screen.

292
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,633
And this produced a quality of play as performance.

293
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,113
It wasn't just about winning,

294
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,434
it was about playing for the crowd

295
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:09,796
and being kind of a little celebrity

296
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,396
around that arcade cabinet.

297
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:13,277
Excellence in play was always respected,

298
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:14,238
but players who were

299
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,964
big personalities or could win with style were celebrated.

300
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:21,828
Those were the people that players really looked up to.

301
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:23,049
That's how you earned respect.

302
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:27,214
And there were a lot of players who would.

303
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:32,325
embrace this deeply. There are players who love being the hero. There are players who love

304
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:38,271
being the heel. That guy who you just could not stand and he knew you could not stand him.

305
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:44,777
There was one player in particular who he was strong but he wasn't the best. But he would

306
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,642
gain notoriety being the most annoying dude you have ever met. And when he played you in a

307
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:50,503
tournament and beat you.

308
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,514
business cards printed and he would hand it to you and the

309
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,838
business card said congratulations you've just been

310
00:15:57,838 --> 00:16:05,649
beaten by Jeff Schaefer. Yeah. So I'm going to talk about

311
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,533
this builds a sense of hype. You have this familiar group of

312
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,295
players. You know these guys. Maybe you don't know them

313
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:17,396
personally, but you've seen them every week or every day in this

314
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,877
arcade. Everyone knows their spot in the social hierarchy.

315
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:24,159
And their little mini dramas and stories unfold day by day, week

316
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,960
by week on this cabinet. Like who's going to beat the alpha?

317
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,421
Hey, this dude was terrible a month ago. Now he's beating me.

318
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,063
What's going on? Am I a bad player too? And so, um,

319
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,214
the familiarity of this builds sort of a sense of drama and hype as you're playing.

320
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:42,336
And like I said, in this environment I started off at the very bottom of the

321
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:47,680
toting pole and I lost a lot. And losing in any competitive game kind of stings.

322
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,322
I still rage when I lose in Hearthstone.

323
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,441
But in this environment it was particularly nasty because your

324
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:59,205
losses were public. Everybody who was paying close attention

325
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:03,810
to what's going on just saw you lose. And you can't like rage

326
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,814
out, you can't steam or say that's cheap because you're

327
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:10,036
just going to lose everyone's respect. You just have to hold

328
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:13,660
that out. Keep it inside, put your quarter up and get to the

329
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,341
back of the line.

330
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:19,104
don't have that ability, you're just not gonna last long in the scene. You're gonna get kind of like

331
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:27,049
roasted out of the scene. And so what that taught me was that there's a continual struggle to get

332
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:32,532
stronger and you have to be able to absorb losses as like the way you win. The way you win is losing

333
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:35,234
and learning from losses and then gradually getting better.

334
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,342
And the thing is, eventually you see everyone lose. Even that

335
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:44,605
alpha eventually makes a mistake or the dude next to him gets

336
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,667
lucky and he loses. So it becomes very easy to understand

337
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,410
that everybody loses and you just have to learn to suck up

338
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,911
and level up from your losses.

339
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:57,029
So I learned a lot, I lost a lot, I gradually leveled up in

340
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:00,732
this hyper competitive group and there was for me a sweet, sweet

341
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:05,335
payoff when four years later work took me up to Seattle where

342
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,737
I was suddenly in a different environment with a bunch of

343
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:10,158
strong players but not the world class killers that I've been

344
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:13,160
competing against for the last four years. And so all of a

345
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,543
sudden I was the alpha. Which, let me tell you, was a pretty

346
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,203
awesome feeling.

347
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:22,675
and there's this thing where like you're in this arcade and

348
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:25,517
there may be five to eight to 15 people who are all at the same

349
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:29,600
cabinet. If you can potentially beat all of them, maybe not

350
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,782
consistently, but if you are good enough to beat every other

351
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:35,245
person in that arcade, you can potentially like go infinite.

352
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,866
Right? You can cycle the queue.

353
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:40,625
everyone puts their card up again. You can cycle it again and you can play for hours and

354
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:45,850
hours and hours off of one quarter. I actually did this a few times. My longest winning

355
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:52,117
streak ever was 73 wins and it lasted six hours. It was just a very, very different feeling.

356
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:55,520
from every other competitive experience I've had,

357
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,202
especially in the world we have now

358
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,724
of automated matchmakers with ELO ratings,

359
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:01,526
where the system's always trying to match you up

360
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:03,908
with a fair opponent, which means almost every player

361
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,130
kind of has roughly a 50% win rate.

362
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,532
Like, this was a very, very different feeling,

363
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:09,254
where even as like a good player,

364
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:10,975
not a pro, but a good player,

365
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,117
you could have like ridiculous win streaks.

366
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,800
You could be like the lord of this arcade, right?

367
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,765
it's the feeling of being the top dog in the moment.

368
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:23,069
Like, yeah, I'm not the best, but today, right here,

369
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,112
I actually am the best, and none of you can beat me,

370
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:25,753
and you all know it.

371
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:29,578
So that's super awesome and unique,

372
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:31,961
and I don't think it has happened since,

373
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:33,703
and I'm not sure if it'll ever happen again.

374
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:37,046
So if you sum all that up, you get a culture

375
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:40,688
that is hyper-competitive, but it's also really close-knit.

376
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:41,849
It's social, right?

377
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,792
There's trash talking and money matches,

378
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:49,375
but there's mutual respect between players as adversaries,

379
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,876
even for players who maybe are not nearly as good as you.

380
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,540
And the only way to earn respect in this peer group is to play.

381
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,625
It's to play and demonstrate excellence or it's to play and continue to play even though

382
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,186
maybe you're not the top dog.

383
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:04,569
But you're willing to put yourself into that cauldron.

384
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,254
So this lasted for like 10 years.

385
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:11,276
And it was growing gradually, but steady growth,

386
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,157
10 years of growth.

387
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:13,378
Tournaments were getting bigger.

388
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,800
We were starting to have international events.

389
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,721
And it was awesome, it was really awesome.

390
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:19,542
And then there was a problem,

391
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:23,505
which was the arcade started going down, right?

392
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:26,487
We were sort of a budding, growing, competitive community.

393
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:27,488
It was on a sinking ship.

394
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:32,260
when some of the very best, most popular arcades

395
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,061
for this scene started to go under,

396
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:35,503
like Southern Hills Golf Land in 2002,

397
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:38,605
the writing was on the wall that this was a genre

398
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,948
that was just gonna be dead if something didn't happen.

399
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:45,371
We had to jettison ourselves from the arcades.

400
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:46,892
We had to decide what to do.

401
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:52,197
And at this time, there was a resurgence on the PC

402
00:20:52,197 --> 00:20:55,139
of eSports events like I talked about

403
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:56,080
in the beginning of the talk.

404
00:20:57,273 --> 00:21:01,134
And I personally took a good hard look at these,

405
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,194
and they weren't really compelling for me personally

406
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,234
as a player.

407
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,375
Even though what they were doing is awesome,

408
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,675
they weren't for me.

409
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:10,336
And it goes back to the core value proposition

410
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:10,976
of these events.

411
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:12,616
Are you there?

412
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:13,877
Why are you there?

413
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:15,977
Are you there to watch the pros playing

414
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:17,397
at the very highest level,

415
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:20,918
or do you want an arena where you can struggle

416
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:22,699
and compete and test your limits

417
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,179
against the best players around?

418
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,219
And it was just way more of the right for me

419
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,020
and less of the left.

420
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,526
And so that was where the idea for Evo came along, right?

421
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:32,009
Evo for me was literally.

422
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:36,294
kind of the escape pod that we would use

423
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,814
to save ourselves from the dying planet of the arcades.

424
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,935
Our mission right from the beginning

425
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:43,895
was to preserve and grow the arcade competitive culture.

426
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:47,396
Can we take what's awesome about this arcade experience

427
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:50,957
and put it in a form that can outlive the actual arcades?

428
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:53,297
And our values were all competitors are equal,

429
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:55,958
support every player's personal journey to get stronger,

430
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,438
and showcase the drama of humans under pressure,

431
00:21:58,438 --> 00:22:00,499
restated as competition, struggle, and hype.

432
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:05,947
So we tried, and it was a rocky road.

433
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:10,170
It's been like, gosh, 15 years now, trying to build Evo.

434
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,833
And we were faced with a lot of hard choices

435
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,594
when we were crafting this event.

436
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:17,715
From day one, we decided this was

437
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:18,696
going to be an open tournament.

438
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:20,698
No matter how big we got, we were always

439
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:21,658
going to let every player play.

440
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,820
And we're going to put them in the same pool.

441
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,923
And that was easy at first, because we were tiny.

442
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:29,245
But as we grew, how do you run an event

443
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:30,426
with 1,000 players?

444
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:31,546
How about 10,000?

445
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:35,930
We had to invest in new systems, new equipment,

446
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,172
new staffing solutions to make sure that every player

447
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:39,753
who wanted to play got to play.

448
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:40,734
And that came at a cost.

449
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,598
We chose to do that instead of doing other things.

450
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:47,200
When it comes to the dollars we spend,

451
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,041
we have to choose, are we going to invest

452
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,302
in more ways to play?

453
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:53,086
free-to-play areas, exhibition, things like that,

454
00:22:53,086 --> 00:22:56,551
verse staging, lighting, things that make the event

455
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:59,055
more attractive and feel like more professional.

456
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:01,098
And we've chosen largely to invest

457
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:03,281
in widening the arena for play,

458
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,943
because that's what we value.

459
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:07,567
And then finally when it comes to our stream production.

460
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,823
This one is a really close case and I go back and forth on this,

461
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,105
but do we focus on as much content as we can?

462
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:17,187
Gameplay, show more matches, more matches,

463
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,530
verse context, showing players' backstories,

464
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,753
giving you the knowledge you need to sort of understand what's going on

465
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:26,154
and care about these players.

466
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,717
And we've biased a lot of our production towards content.

467
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:32,540
And the reason why is because these...

468
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:39,244
is the only opportunity where you get to see a wide variety of play styles from players from all over the world

469
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:42,566
and people really want to see that diversity of play.

470
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:47,108
And so when we ask players in our sort of audience online...

471
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:50,365
do you want to see more matches or do you want to see like,

472
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:52,006
you know, mini documentaries or Q&A after?

473
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:54,507
They consistently tell us, show us more matches, right?

474
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:57,148
And so we try to get creative and find ways

475
00:23:57,148 --> 00:24:00,390
to tell that story and the natural downtime

476
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,211
between matches or over the course of the match.

477
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:04,752
Like I said, that one is a,

478
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,673
I go back and forth on that all the time,

479
00:24:06,673 --> 00:24:08,554
but it's a tough choice that we constantly have to make.

480
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,337
And I think, you know, we've made some mistakes,

481
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:13,898
certainly we've made our share of mistakes,

482
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:16,440
but I do think we've largely been successful.

483
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,603
We have a scene now that genuinely captures

484
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,684
what was awesome about that arcade culture.

485
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:24,387
These players are hyper-invested,

486
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:26,288
there's just a ton of passion.

487
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,620
And the feelings that these guys have for their scene

488
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,801
and the competition has nothing to do

489
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:35,523
with the amount of prize money, right?

490
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,584
We're not the biggest scene around.

491
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,386
It's about the authenticity and the value

492
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:42,927
that these guys put on being able to come together

493
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:44,888
and compete and ultimately crown that winner.

494
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:49,911
So, why does this matter for your game?

495
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:56,498
I think it's clear that esports are here to stay, and this is actually me personally,

496
00:24:56,498 --> 00:25:00,701
this is one of the first times where I'm willing to stand up in front of a crowd and say that.

497
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:03,643
Anyone who's been around esports for a while knows it's been kind of a rocky road, it's

498
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:05,564
been up and down, up and down.

499
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:06,985
But I really feel like...

500
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:12,630
the notion of competitive gaming as incredible content

501
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,274
and an incredible experience for gamers is here to stay.

502
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:18,115
And I think in five to 10 years,

503
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:22,700
we're gonna see a much wider variety of formats,

504
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,703
both in broadcast and in eSport than what we see today.

505
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:27,645
We're really at the very beginning of this journey.

506
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:33,773
If you're building a game or an e-sport or experimenting in

507
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:37,418
e-sports, I want to encourage you to choose a model for your

508
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:38,200
e-sport.

509
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,780
Don't inherit one.

510
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:43,057
blindly look at what's going on in another game

511
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:44,037
and sort of copy paste it.

512
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,518
If you're a game developer, try to spend

513
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:49,559
the same kind of effort in crafting your eSport

514
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,899
that you spend in crafting your game.

515
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:53,380
And when you do that,

516
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,221
think about what you want your players to value,

517
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,641
both from the competition

518
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,362
and how they should think about competition,

519
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:01,842
and what you want their players to value from each other.

520
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:04,823
Right, and that can help you decide

521
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:07,764
what kinds of, you know, rule sets and formats

522
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:09,265
and things like that you want for your eSport.

523
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:22,676
Okay, that's it. Thanks. Any questions? Hi, Dave Schwartz from RIT. We now have an e-sports

524
00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:22,976
program there.

525
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,997
As we were building our program, one of the things that

526
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:37,278
we're concerned about is diversity.

527
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:39,759
And I know it was a phenomenal talk.

528
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,179
I loved your presentation.

529
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:44,880
But I was sitting there hitting Google Women in Evo,

530
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,101
and I was curious if you could respond to that.

531
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:51,382
Yeah, that's a great question.

532
00:26:51,382 --> 00:26:51,662
Thanks.

533
00:26:53,541 --> 00:27:01,649
So the FGC, I think, is one of the most diverse group of players in esports, except for when it comes to women.

534
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:09,796
And there are a lot of theories about how we got to be so diverse along some lines and not that particular line.

535
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,998
My personal feeling is that it comes to...

536
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:18,379
leadership and role models. For whatever reason, the leadership in the FGC, the tournament

537
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:22,340
organizers, the people who are out front sort of evangelizing the FGC, are pretty diverse.

538
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,361
There's a lot of black and brown people who are doing that. And there are no women. And

539
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:32,343
I think when other women see that, it makes it feel like this is not the right place for

540
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:34,644
me and they go and look at other games.

541
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:42,523
there's hope here. What's going on with Smash Sisters in particular is super awesome and I'm

542
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:44,405
really glad to see that they have some success there.

543
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,192
Yeah, they're cool.

544
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:55,797
Um, no, but what I want to say is like, if we want to solve this problem, then I really

545
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:56,378
want to solve it.

546
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:58,059
Not just for the FGC, but for all of esports.

547
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:04,203
I think we have to look at getting diverse leaders and diverse representatives from esport.

548
00:28:04,203 --> 00:28:07,946
And once we solve that problem at the top, it'll become a more welcoming place for all

549
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:08,927
kinds of players.

550
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,008
Thank you.

551
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:10,168
Yep.

552
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:10,308
Hi.

553
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:19,865
So I'm curious, what do you think games of other genres can do to kind of encourage that

554
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,889
competitor mindset and not just the spectator mindset more?

555
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:23,009
Oh boy.

556
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:29,817
So the question was, what can other genres do to encourage the competitive mindset and

557
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:31,038
not just the fan mindset?

558
00:28:32,915 --> 00:28:36,577
Right. So there's this paradox in eSports and the models that we're pursuing,

559
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:40,480
which is a lot of these games are pursuing sports-based models,

560
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,181
but they only look at the very top of the pyramid.

561
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:45,663
And if you look at a sport like basketball, okay,

562
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:46,904
yes, there's the NBA,

563
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:50,546
but there's a whole pyramid of engagement in competitive formats

564
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:53,148
to nurture a player up to the very highest level.

565
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,369
There's like the D League,

566
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:57,171
and then there's like all the way down to like YMCA and youth leagues.

567
00:28:57,491 --> 00:28:59,633
And so you can have success as a competitor

568
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,655
when you were young and when you were bad

569
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:02,776
and when you were growing.

570
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:04,678
And that doesn't exist for eSports.

571
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:07,782
And so if you're a giant eSport

572
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:09,523
and you want to help support

573
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,605
the competitive mindset in players,

574
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:16,490
I would say add formats for young and budding players.

575
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,491
Collegiate formats are great.

576
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:19,253
Some of that is happening.

577
00:29:19,253 --> 00:29:20,675
How about like, you know.

578
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,458
youth formats, just open tournaments where you maybe

579
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,759
explicitly carve off the pros, because we know they crush

580
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,520
everybody, but say, hey, if you want to get to know what it

581
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,842
feels like to be a competitive player, here's an event for

582
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:33,062
you.

583
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,284
So looking at the whole top to bottom solution, not just top.

584
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:36,524
Hi there.

585
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,824
It was a great presentation, by the way.

586
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:38,045
Thank you.

587
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:38,265
Thank you.

588
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,204
As an event organizer myself that runs a lot of tournaments, I'm always looking forward to

589
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:52,528
seeing where everything is going. And Evo has been one of those things, saying, what is Evo

590
00:29:52,528 --> 00:29:57,253
doing? What games are they focused on? I'm curious on a two‑part question, which is, first

591
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:02,478
off, how do you guys try to be thought leaders in the space? What do you do to try to be thought

592
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:06,903
leaders in the space, more specifically, to keep on the edge leading across all the other

593
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,004
tournament organizers in the country?

594
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:14,206
And secondarily, where do you see other events needing to be better in order to escalate the

595
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:17,687
major level to bring it up to better for the entire FGC community?

596
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:24,589
Thanks. So if I understand the question, it's what are we doing at EVO to try to stay ahead

597
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,350
of the game? And then what's my advice to other tournament organizers?

598
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,830
Basically.

599
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,611
Right. So we don't really try to stay ahead of the game in terms of competing with other

600
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:33,071
tournaments.

601
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:45,603
But what we do try to do is always push the envelope on pursuing risky projects that are in line with our values.

602
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:48,247
For instance, we've...

603
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:51,310
done things like the Evo Scholarship

604
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,271
to try to support the idea of indie game developer

605
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:55,692
and support our players' dreams

606
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,493
of ultimately entering the game industry.

607
00:30:58,493 --> 00:30:59,914
We now have an indie showcase

608
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:02,755
where we show competitive games that aren't fighting games

609
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:05,657
to try to get, again, support for developers.

610
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:09,178
And so it's really, we're not trying to like,

611
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:12,943
make a million dollars, we're not trying to even be

612
00:31:12,943 --> 00:31:14,464
the biggest tournament.

613
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:16,485
There's a lot of interesting stuff happening

614
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:19,487
on the more, I guess, professional, traditional

615
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:20,928
eSports side of fighting games,

616
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:23,910
with the Capcom Cup and with E-League.

617
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,232
Those are awesome, and I think there's a great space

618
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:28,413
for them, and we're just trying to focus on our area,

619
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:30,074
which is giant open tournament,

620
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:31,976
sort of like the World Series of Poker.

621
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:34,797
And I guess my advice to other fighting game tournaments is

622
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:42,663
to take the same approach. Find something that you can do better than anybody else

623
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:48,007
and then just go hard on that. I think Combo Breaker is a great example of an event that's doing that

624
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:53,692
where they have their own cool quirky feel in different emphasis than other fighting game tournaments.

625
00:31:53,832 --> 00:31:56,814
Because when you do that, I think you have a great chance

626
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:00,957
of stumbling on something that is awesome and can explode.

627
00:32:00,957 --> 00:32:02,438
Whereas if you're always following behind

628
00:32:02,438 --> 00:32:04,840
someone else's footsteps, you're not gonna

629
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,301
really have that opportunity.

630
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,423
Okay, do I have time for one more question or no?

631
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:09,323
Nope, I'm done.

632
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:10,244
Okay, thanks everyone.
