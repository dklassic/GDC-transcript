1
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,372
What is it that makes some games super replayable over time?

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,720
I think it's all about offering.

3
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:11,678
Your player is a consistent challenge that's going to grow with them

4
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:12,878
as their skill level grows.

5
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,960
And one way you can do that is by offering a really competitive AI.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,981
Race for the Galaxy is a digital game

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,022
based on the original tabletop board game.

8
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:22,803
And it integrates a neural network driven AI

9
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:24,384
originally developed by Keldon Jones.

10
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:26,685
And what's really special about this AI

11
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:30,827
is that it doesn't use any human generated training data.

12
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:33,048
It generates all of its training data by itself,

13
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:35,029
which frees it from human bias, which is great

14
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,130
because human generated strategies can be fallible.

15
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:40,808
Now, not all games are going to be good candidates for a neural network like this.

16
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:45,194
You're going to want a game with high stochasticity, meaning lots of random space for a neural network to explore.

17
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:49,740
Games with a fixed number of inputs, so you're solving a very specialized problem with your neural network.

18
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:53,445
And games where canonical configurations of pieces and space...

19
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,809
It is not critical to determining who's going to win your game.

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,613
And I'll get into some of the math on that at the upcoming GDC talk,

21
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,735
Race for the Galaxy, a neural network in production.

22
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:03,137
So you should come check it out if you're

23
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:05,860
interested in learning a little bit more about temporal difference

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,262
learning for board game AI.
