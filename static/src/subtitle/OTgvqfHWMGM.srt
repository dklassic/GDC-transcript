1
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:04,374
If we could have everybody's attention.

2
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:09,259
Thank you for joining us today to learn a little bit

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,983
about raw data and early access and what

4
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:15,866
we did to accomplish the great things that we have.

5
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:18,909
Before we get started, though, I would like to remind everybody,

6
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,851
please turn down your cell phones.

7
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:24,515
Put them on vibrate just so that we don't get interrupted.

8
00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:28,856
And also I would be remiss if I did not remind everybody to fill

9
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:32,738
out their electronic review forms. It's very important to

10
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:36,699
GDC and it also really helps us in our presentations so that we

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,260
can do better again and again. So without further ado, I would

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,661
like to introduce Mike McTire, our director of design for

13
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:44,141
Servios.

14
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,286
And my name is Chris Hewish.

15
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,307
I'm head of studio, lucky enough to work

16
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:56,708
with this talented gentleman as well as a few talented people

17
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,429
in the front second row here.

18
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:02,450
We have Nathan Berber and Alex Silken, founders of Servios.

19
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:09,453
And then also Terrence, Roger, and Megan,

20
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,954
who are part of the team really helping us out as well as John.

21
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:15,936
So you can corner them later for questions if you can't find us.

22
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:17,240
You're welcome.

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,762
So I would like to get started.

24
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:22,304
First things first, for those of you

25
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:25,347
who may not have seen a whole lot of raw data

26
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:26,888
or would like a refresher, I'd like

27
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:28,490
to kick off with a little trailer

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,752
that our marketing team has put together.

29
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,034
It's a fantastic new trailer to give a little insight

30
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:34,996
into what the game is and where it's going.

31
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:54,436
Stop. Do you even know why you're really here?

32
00:01:56,757 --> 00:02:02,099
You call yourselves a resistance. But what are you resisting?

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,683
Advancement. Evolution. Immortality.

34
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:17,126
You think you're free. But you're not.

35
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:23,981
You are simply...

36
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:36,432
...a weapon.

37
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:42,837
Catastrophic data breach detected.

38
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:45,639
Initiating facility meltdown.

39
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:21,060
The game is based on a true story.

40
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,621
Oh my god!

41
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,622
Make the meat puppets pay.

42
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:37,975
Yeah, alright.

43
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,158
So for those of you who are watching,

44
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:47,640
you may have noticed the co-op online piece that

45
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,461
was tagged in there.

46
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:52,084
So we are very happy to announce that we have co-op cross

47
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:57,368
platform play with Oculus Store and Steam users.

48
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:58,970
Come by our booth to check it out.

49
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,191
We can talk more about that later.

50
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:03,313
But just to jump right into it, why are we here today?

51
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,755
We're here to share some insights into raw data.

52
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:07,337
I'd like to start off by.

53
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:12,102
Pointing out that this was the first VR game to generate over

54
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:14,985
a million dollars of revenue in its first 30 days.

55
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:18,408
An amazing accomplishment and great validation that there is

56
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:21,832
revenue to be made in the VR market with the right content.

57
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:25,956
What was the next slide?

58
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:34,629
Yes, so this is another big part of that too is, you know, we weren't exactly sure how raw data was going to perform right away, right?

59
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:45,638
The team had its aspirations and was working, you know, incredibly hard on the product and we were just so excited that we were able to be the number one title to top the Steam charts when we released the early access of raw data.

60
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:48,660
So that was a huge accomplishment for the entire team working on the product.

61
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,982
And a great accomplishment for the industry.

62
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:54,827
So we're here to tell you a little bit about how we got

63
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:58,330
there. But I'll start off with a little bit of the evolution of

64
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:04,416
what led up to raw data. In 2013, Servios was founded and it

65
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:09,280
was founded to further research on immersion and new forms of

66
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,222
VR gaming. The founders, the developers, the developers,

67
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,323
Nate and Alex and James.

68
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:16,124
I think James is here too, somewhere.

69
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:16,624
Somewhere there.

70
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:17,084
There he is.

71
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:18,005
James.

72
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,906
So the founders got together at USC

73
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:24,827
and really learned a lot and pioneered a lot about VR.

74
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:27,608
And they wanted to bring that into the commercial space.

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,989
And part of that was they wanted players to really feel the rush of battle,

76
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,391
the awe of exploration, the exhilaration of imagining the future,

77
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:40,072
and doing all of this in a highly immersive way.

78
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:44,794
So hopefully our insights and anecdotes today can really provide some learnings

79
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,455
that will help you on your path to VR greatness.

80
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,160
This clicker seems to need a double click.

81
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,661
So Mike, if you talk about.

82
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:55,263
Yeah, so talk about some of the early developments

83
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:56,204
that the studio made.

84
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:59,046
One of the first projects or prototypes

85
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,847
they had led up to creating raw data

86
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:02,928
was actually a product called Bullet Time Apex.

87
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,590
I wouldn't necessarily expect everybody to know what that is,

88
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,932
and this is actually before my time with the team.

89
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:11,314
But this really was a pretty amazing time

90
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:12,935
for the studio itself.

91
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:16,898
They were really exploring a lot of the boundaries, the early boundaries, right?

92
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,139
The hardware is not out at this point. People don't have it, right?

93
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,241
So figuring out what can they do with it.

94
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:24,884
How do you handle just the basic things from interacting with objects

95
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:28,306
to using weapons within the world, dealing with enemies within an environment

96
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:29,527
that you actually travel through.

97
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:33,250
And there were so many important VR lessons learned from that

98
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,631
that fed directly into the design of raw data.

99
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:41,397
So that was a really important project for the team internally

100
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:44,098
because it laid the foundation with the core mechanics,

101
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,399
as Mike said, of what led to raw data.

102
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,440
And it really highlights one of the things

103
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,901
that Servios holds true to its development, which

104
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:55,543
is, especially for VR, is to focus on the core mechanics

105
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:59,805
first, get something that feels really, really good for VR

106
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,566
before you start to expand beyond that with your game.

107
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:08,408
And that's something that in other forms of game development

108
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:11,769
is kind of taken for granted because the mechanics are

109
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,850
fairly well established.

110
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,271
And you can kind of just brute force everything

111
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,551
at once to a degree.

112
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:21,193
But in VR, there's so many new areas to design and explore,

113
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:23,154
so many new technologies that you have to create,

114
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,415
that taking the time to really focus on that core mechanic

115
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,576
before you start to put a metagame around it

116
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,557
is particularly important.

117
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,957
And it served us very, very well.

118
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,991
So then some of the lessons in particular that the team

119
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,673
learned from these early prototypes that we were just

120
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:41,234
talking about.

121
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,537
One of those big lessons is the difference between realism

122
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:46,439
versus usability.

123
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:49,081
So a lot of people, in particular in the early days,

124
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:52,124
and even now, still in VR, one of their major focuses is I

125
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:55,668
want to recreate real life verbatim exactly in VR.

126
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,151
And sometimes that works well, and a lot of times it doesn't.

127
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:01,795
Because at the end of the day, at least, what we're trying to

128
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,538
do is make great game experiences.

129
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:07,723
So one great example here that we have up on the screen is,

130
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:10,126
again, going back to Bullet Time Apex, the team initially

131
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,769
made a shotgun amongst many of the other weapons that they

132
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,873
made, and they had stock on the shotgun and on the other

133
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:16,594
weapons and such.

134
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:19,616
trying to create that impression of reality.

135
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,738
But actually once we got that into the game

136
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:24,019
and players were actually holding the weapons in their hands,

137
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:27,321
they realized that because you don't have anything physically pushing against you,

138
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,283
this is actually causing a problem.

139
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,264
This actually wasn't helping gameplay, it was hindering it.

140
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,006
Because already just having to hold a weapon with two hands,

141
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:36,907
there's already a slight disconnect there.

142
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,469
Especially with a two-handed weapon like a shotgun.

143
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:42,431
Adding the third element of something that you're supposed to brace against yourself,

144
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:43,572
it just didn't work out.

145
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:47,494
And you can see how that evolved in our raw data picture of Boss,

146
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,555
that he no longer has a stock on the shotgun.

147
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,717
Specifically, we redesigned the weapon.

148
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:55,699
We really enjoyed the weapon, but we took that off of it to make it more friendly to gameplay.

149
00:08:55,719 --> 00:09:00,042
Because at the end of the day, that's what we're trying to create, is amazing gameplay experiences.

150
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,993
And you'll notice with all of the weapons in raw data, they are a little bit larger than life.

151
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:08,155
And again, this goes to the usability factor.

152
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:14,278
We really wanted it to feel good, to be just really slick to use,

153
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:19,882
and to really get into using the weapon and not have to fumble with the realities of using a weapon.

154
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:24,925
So this is one of the early key learnings that really influenced the rest of our development.

155
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:37,156
So then probably the next biggest pillar that as a studio, in particular on raw data, the team really focused on was the concept of active VR.

156
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:42,322
And we were constantly asking ourselves, what is active VR? What are we trying to do here? What are we trying to accomplish?

157
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,244
And with our products, our experiences,

158
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:46,326
We really don't want to just sell immersion.

159
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:50,550
Immersion is great, but we also want to sell that active experience.

160
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:54,054
Because we find, for the most part, there's a lot of great VR other products out there.

161
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:54,855
Fantastic stuff.

162
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,437
But we find the VR products that get you to move your body.

163
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,938
To get you to move around.

164
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:02,041
Whether you're using two guns pointing in different directions.

165
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:04,344
Whether you're having to dodge enemies trying to hit you.

166
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,626
Whether you're having to physically interact with objects.

167
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,288
The more we can get the player to move into VR,

168
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,970
the more physically active we can get,

169
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,412
for the most part we find players have more fun.

170
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:16,595
So as much as possible, a big focus for raw data

171
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:20,138
was get players moving, make it an active VR experience.

172
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:22,200
Because to us, that really was the dream,

173
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,661
that's what we were focusing on,

174
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:26,964
is really what Active Bring Art sucks you into that experience.

175
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:34,506
So, and part of this was just getting the closer that we could get the world to the player, the better.

176
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:38,389
So enemies are a little bit larger and imposing, they get right up in your face.

177
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:41,331
We spent time with the robot enemies in the game.

178
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,493
You know, we really get them up close and personal with you,

179
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:48,095
just so that you can really get a sense of that immersion and being part of the world.

180
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:52,598
As opposed to having them stay far back and do long-range kind of interactions.

181
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:54,840
We certainly have some of that, but...

182
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,803
But we did, we toned that down. That's an excellent point.

183
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:00,806
In particular, I don't know how you have played the game or have noticed,

184
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:04,529
but another example of that, besides enemies shooting at you far away,

185
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,012
again, we find the closer we bring the enemies to you,

186
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:10,315
the more in your space they are, the more fun it becomes, the more real it becomes.

187
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:11,596
The more immersive it is.

188
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:14,477
And we do that across the board with having less enemies

189
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:15,337
firing far away.

190
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,578
Even if they fire far away, they're constantly

191
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:18,338
moving toward you.

192
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:20,379
But even other things, like the drones.

193
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,299
We have flying drones in the game.

194
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:25,280
And initially, when the coders put those in, they had them

195
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,221
working just great.

196
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:27,381
But they were really high up.

197
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,102
And you were having to fight these battles with these

198
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,842
drones really high above you.

199
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,003
And I'm like, well, that's great.

200
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:34,523
But it's really not that much fun, because

201
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:35,364
they're so far away.

202
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:38,185
And it's not as much fun to be looking directly up at them.

203
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:42,367
So what we ended up doing was taking the volume in which they could fly and just bringing it down

204
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,808
to the point where the drones will actually buzz the player by their head.

205
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:50,030
And there's a lot of people now who just, I don't know, we've seen a lot of posts of people breaking their lamps

206
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,852
or ceiling fans of various things, in particular when they're playing Saija and using her sword,

207
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,414
specifically the drone buzzing by and whacking it out of the air.

208
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,995
And they couldn't do that if the drones were really high up.

209
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:05,918
So again, that's another example where the closer we bring the action to the player, just the more immersive it is.

210
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,056
Okay, next slide.

211
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:16,884
So here we also want to talk about not only are we pursuing

212
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:20,204
active VR and making the player active and all the things that

213
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:23,665
Mike just spoke about, but the social side of VR we are true

214
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:26,965
believers in. There's been certainly a lot of talk at

215
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:30,866
least early on about how VR is isolating and all of this. Well,

216
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,947
we don't believe that whatsoever. And in fact, we

217
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:39,568
found quite the opposite. Co-op play was really central to our

218
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:40,888
approach from the very beginning.

219
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:46,552
You can almost call it a core mechanic of ours. We've always really been into a shared experience.

220
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:51,816
Not only do you get these great up close immersive experiences on your own,

221
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:57,580
but the value of that, the excitement of that is exponentially increased when you can share that with a friend.

222
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:03,805
So co-op has been really important. You'll see that continue in things that Servios does.

223
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:09,329
We even have some great social interactions in our showroom.

224
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,532
where you can communicate with other players before you actually get into matches. And

225
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:17,615
it's something that we will continue to build around. It's something that really shouldn't

226
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:24,739
be overlooked because with VR especially, the market is so new and growing that if you can

227
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,342
bring people together in any way, whether it's co-op or through other types of social

228
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:33,605
interactions, it only helps the entire industry and it helps with word of mouth for your game.

229
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:38,429
For anybody who's done work in the mobile space and the social mobile space,

230
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,775
you may be familiar with the K-factor equation and how if you get somebody in your game

231
00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:48,480
and they're talking about it and they can share it with friends, that then increases your reach.

232
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,662
And we're finding the same type of thing here.

233
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:56,928
So social VR, active VR, both were very important early core tenets for Servios and raw data.

234
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:00,431
Yeah, definitely. And you can see that in the way people play the game in particular.

235
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:06,214
As Chris said, we didn't shy away from it early on. We believed, we still truly believe,

236
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:11,438
social experiences in VR can be greater than any other game or platform that's out there right now.

237
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:17,021
As much as it's really fun, whether you're sitting on the couch with a friend, or you're on the internet and talking to them,

238
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:19,043
or typing with them, whether it's on a headset or not,

239
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:22,445
There's just something magical about being in VR,

240
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,488
and when you're playing a game and the person materializes in front of you,

241
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,790
and he's moving his arms, and he's talking to you,

242
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,551
and you're looking at him and he's looking at you.

243
00:14:29,932 --> 00:14:32,394
There's just no other experience like that in other games.

244
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:36,637
So we actually, we're firm believers that having that full avatar embodiment

245
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:40,000
is a much more social experience than in any other platform to date.

246
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:40,581
Great.

247
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,743
So what happened next? Around this time we showed the game off at VRLA and GDC last year,

248
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:54,628
got tremendous feedback, and realized that we really had a strong core game to build upon.

249
00:14:55,008 --> 00:15:00,011
But we also realized that we needed something more than what was just a set of core mechanics,

250
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:05,736
right? As great as they were, we needed more than what could be labeled a sort of a demo experience.

251
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:06,696
We wanted something that

252
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:11,478
Really did embrace the AAA premium game sort of moniker

253
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:14,298
that we could go with premium pricing on and all these things

254
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:17,539
and something that would provide a full gameplay loop for the players.

255
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:22,560
So, this is the time when the metagame sort of made its way into the game.

256
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:26,501
Mike did a great job with several elements as did James,

257
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:30,562
putting in a strong narrative, you got a sense of that in the trailer.

258
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:33,903
Can't understate how important that is to bringing the world to life.

259
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,267
Also introducing things like a nexus and tower defense.

260
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:39,709
If you want to talk about any of that.

261
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:41,651
Other mechanics, I think that's a good point too.

262
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,916
There are fantastic other VR experiences out there.

263
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:49,720
I mean, we download them and play them all just like everybody else and have a great time with them.

264
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,665
But a lot of the experiences, while they're a lot of fun, they're short experiences, right?

265
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:55,586
They'll last a good, you know,

266
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,567
15, 20 minutes, maybe an hour.

267
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,688
And we knew with raw data that wasn't enough for us.

268
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,848
We didn't want people just playing once, twice,

269
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,228
or for two hours.

270
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:06,269
We wanted them to get a full eight, 10 plus.

271
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:09,029
I mean, hell, we have some people that have 50 plus hours

272
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:09,629
on raw data.

273
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:10,249
It's incredible.

274
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,690
But that was a big focus for us, is

275
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,010
to make sure we had an experience that players could

276
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,691
keep coming back to in VR.

277
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:18,751
And that every time we release new content,

278
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,792
there's always a reason for them to keep coming back,

279
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:23,592
to try it out, try something new, and experience something

280
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:27,213
A lot of replay value that you don't typically get a lot of the other experiences right now.

281
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,644
Then, so, moving on to locomotion.

282
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:34,606
That was another big thing we had to figure out from the beginning.

283
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,588
So, for those of you who have played Raw Data,

284
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:38,509
or for those of you who haven't, we have a slide here

285
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:40,831
showing you the concept of what we call tele-shifting.

286
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,552
So, we knew from the beginning,

287
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:45,774
actually the very first demo the team had of Raw Data,

288
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:47,576
characters were stationary.

289
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:51,578
Not that they couldn't move, but you had your platform in the center

290
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,420
and you had your both characters in co-op,

291
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,661
but you were kind of stuck to wherever you could physically walk to.

292
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:59,724
And that was a really fun starting experience, a great prototype.

293
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:04,028
We were really focused on the gameplay, the guns, the shooting, the melee and all that.

294
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,430
We just felt it was too limiting.

295
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,231
We knew from the beginning this was just too limiting.

296
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:10,113
We wanted players to explore the environment.

297
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:14,616
We have these amazing artists who are making all these fantastic props and models and everything

298
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:15,837
in these incredible environments.

299
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,639
And you were restricted, you couldn't see them.

300
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,121
And it also really hampered gameplay.

301
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:24,703
I mean, the fact that an enemy would back up or you want to

302
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:26,444
run to him rather than wait for him to come to you.

303
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:28,865
So we knew from the beginning we really needed to have

304
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,225
locomotion as part of that.

305
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:31,866
We couldn't accept stationary.

306
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:34,687
We didn't see a full game coming out of just stationary.

307
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:37,348
So that's when we focused on the solution for

308
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:37,988
tele-shifting.

309
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:41,029
The reason why we went this route for raw data, at least

310
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,231
our first product released, is that we wanted to ensure there

311
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:44,811
was no nausea.

312
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,752
That was a big belief from the beginning.

313
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:50,033
We make experiences that do not make people sick in any capacity.

314
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:52,734
Everyone should be able to enjoy it and have an amazing time.

315
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:55,275
So this is where we're working with a lot of coders,

316
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:58,576
working with Alex in particular as a tech lead on the project,

317
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:01,697
really hammering down how we make this teleshifting experience work.

318
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:03,338
One, it doesn't make players sick.

319
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:06,179
Two, it's very rapid, it's very easy to use.

320
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,240
And then three, it allows you to feel like you're in the environment.

321
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,321
Too many of the earlier...

322
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:14,707
VR experiences we've played with the teleporting experiences,

323
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:16,691
it felt like you were kind of blinking in and out of existence.

324
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:19,776
And we wanted to make it feel like you were actually moving from one location to another.

325
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:23,082
So all of those reasons we spent a lot of time focusing on this feature.

326
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:28,368
And then moving on to the next big pillar.

327
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:32,732
So this is actually a lot of the conversations to define what raw data was from the beginning.

328
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,756
So going back to Bullet Time Apex, the early prototype the team had,

329
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:41,340
they solved great mechanics for how to interact with things, how to use weapons,

330
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,323
how to be in the VR space, solved so many problems.

331
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:48,205
But the early prototypes we had when we were playing,

332
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,346
it was like, well, this is fun.

333
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,447
I can use a shotgun, I can use a bow, I can use a pistol.

334
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:53,808
But I can go do that in real life, right?

335
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:56,170
I can go do a shooting range or experience those things.

336
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,471
I can't fight robots in real life.

337
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:58,171
That's unfortunate.

338
00:18:58,831 --> 00:18:59,472
Maybe in the future.

339
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:03,334
But that was the big thing for myself joining the team early

340
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:06,316
on is making sure, well, this is cool, but I want more, right?

341
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:11,881
I'm in VR to do something that I just can't experience in real life, that promise of VR, right?

342
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:16,085
And to me, for Raw Data, that means being that hero, being that badass character.

343
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:23,211
We all have our favorite heroes or superheroes, whether it's the Avengers or someone from a sci-fi movie, or aliens, or any of these things.

344
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:26,695
And we wanted you to live that experience, right?

345
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:31,838
the movie, you're in your favorite book, you're in your favorite TV show. So that was a huge

346
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:36,620
focus from the beginning to adding powers, adding abilities, amping it up, taking this

347
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,261
above and beyond just the basic weapons which are already very fun.

348
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:48,145
So that gave us an incredibly rich full game with which to work on and in order to get

349
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:52,707
there, to accomplish all of these things, we really had to step back while the team,

350
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:56,908
the majority of the team was off at GDC, showing off the game.

351
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:02,609
The production team stayed back and really dug through the scope of the game.

352
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,090
We did that with the leads as well.

353
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:10,851
And we took the time, we took a couple of weeks to really hone down what the scope and the schedule was

354
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:15,692
with the goal of as soon as the team was back from GDC and had settled back in

355
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:19,053
that we had an entire road map that would get us to early access

356
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:24,134
and would really encompass all of these core mechanics and the metagame features

357
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:25,914
in a way that we could get there.

358
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:29,777
So that was pretty important for us. Up until this point raw

359
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:32,961
data had been in production for about two years. So we had

360
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,502
eight months or so, I would say. We were about a year altogether before we went into early

361
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:43,005
access. So this was just good in getting the team on the same page. Sort of the takeaway

362
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:50,188
here is that we used GDC, the time that most of the team was away, as an opportunity to

363
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:55,631
hunker down and do some of the more production wonky stuff and build out the schedule. And

364
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,272
that way the team was able to come back and hit the ground running.

365
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:02,138
So being able to find those natural breaks that your team

366
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,223
is already focused on something else is a great way to keep the

367
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,549
momentum going where you don't have to sit idle while you're

368
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,312
re-scoping or figuring out schedules.

369
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,614
So we had our schedule.

370
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:16,755
We were on track.

371
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:19,977
We got ready to launch the game into early access.

372
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:23,320
And we then had to decide what would our launch timing be.

373
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,882
So sounds like a simple question.

374
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:26,462
The game's ready.

375
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:27,303
You just launch it.

376
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,124
Well, we could have done that.

377
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:32,847
We also could have launched it over 4th of July weekend,

378
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:33,908
a long weekend.

379
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:35,289
Seems like that might make sense.

380
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,790
People have extra time to play games if they're not

381
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:38,551
with their families.

382
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:45,177
Or we could try to do something else. So one of the things that we really believe in at

383
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:51,804
Servios as well is not only do you look inward, but you can look outward for guidance. So

384
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:57,029
what does that mean? In this case we reached out to our platform partners and we reached

385
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:59,511
out to hardware partners that we had been working with.

386
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:02,533
And we involved them in the conversation around launch timing.

387
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:05,634
And, you know, why would you do that, you may ask?

388
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:14,559
Well, it was really helpful for us because we were advised that our existing plans would have had us come out during the middle of the Steam summer sale.

389
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:22,563
And if we were to do that, there is no way that we could have received any sort of support from the Steam store around launch.

390
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:26,205
Not that there was any guarantee that we would get support if we launched later.

391
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:31,009
But there was definitely a guarantee we would get nothing if we launched during the summer sale.

392
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,493
So we would have walked right into a situation where we just would have shot ourselves in the foot

393
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:39,637
in the sense of partners being able to help promote for us.

394
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:42,780
So I really recommend whenever you're looking to launch...

395
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,864
Not only look inwardly, but talk to your partners, your platform partners in particular.

396
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,767
And develop that relationship.

397
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:52,908
Don't just speak with them.

398
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:57,992
When you're ready to launch, we tend to visit with our partners at least once a quarter,

399
00:22:58,392 --> 00:22:59,053
if not more.

400
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:00,234
Get some face time.

401
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:03,457
No one ever wants to see you only when you're asking for something.

402
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:06,520
So I probably belabored that point.

403
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,162
Yeah, but I think that's the important thing to acknowledge,

404
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,083
that VR in particular right now,

405
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,906
it's not as mainstream as giant console games

406
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:17,147
with enormous budgets that are going to be at Walmart

407
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:19,249
and Target, and to not fight that,

408
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,510
to just embrace it and accept it

409
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,492
as a much more of an indie atmosphere and mindset.

410
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:26,994
So having those relationships with your partners,

411
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:30,237
whether it's on Steam or the Oculus Store or PlayStation,

412
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:31,958
however, whatever approach that you're going,

413
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:33,699
it's very important you acknowledge

414
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,300
how your users are going to find you.

415
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,942
And making sure that there's a time window where your partners can help them find you.

416
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:43,923
Because it's very much an explorative driven system at this point.

417
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,043
Well said. Well said.

418
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:49,264
So now that we had our launch timing we had to figure out what price should we sell the game at.

419
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,385
And again we had several options here.

420
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:54,706
We looked around at what was happening in the market.

421
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:56,586
We could price at the same...

422
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,929
the sort of range that most of the other games were priced at.

423
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,752
We could go for something lower, we could go for something higher.

424
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,434
We had a lot of debate and discussion internally.

425
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:10,818
We also enlisted the aid of our partners and decided in the end

426
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:14,341
to pursue a premium pricing model because we,

427
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,262
not only did we really believe in the product.

428
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:18,905
that we had a premium level product.

429
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,167
We saw some of the supply and demand

430
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:23,709
that was playing out within the marketplace,

431
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,051
that there was a vacuum for the premium content pricing.

432
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,275
But if you looked at the demographics of the users,

433
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:31,216
they tended to be on the higher end,

434
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:32,878
people that could afford premium pricing

435
00:24:32,998 --> 00:24:34,019
for the right product.

436
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,022
And you can never raise your price once you've set it.

437
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:42,804
It's just a simple pricing dynamic, but you can always come down, you can do sales.

438
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:47,127
So it gave us room to work in case the market did not respond the way that we thought it would.

439
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:51,729
Fortunately it did, and not only did it respond as we thought,

440
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,251
it responded much better than we could have hoped for.

441
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:57,793
And I think that's also just a choice internally we made is we

442
00:24:57,893 --> 00:25:00,915
wanted to make a premium product, right? It's us. We

443
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:03,938
could have made smaller, bite-sized products, right? But

444
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,359
we specifically were acknowledging we wanted to make

445
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,481
a full game for our users, right? Something that they would

446
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:13,204
cherish. And clearly the market wants this content. They want

447
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:16,806
premium content. So you want to talk quickly about updates?

448
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:20,152
Yeah, so just to talk a little bit about this, I know we're

449
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:23,212
running short on time here. So starting at the beginning we

450
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,493
knew we made the conscious choice as a team. We wanted to

451
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,394
do early access. A lot of this is because we just didn't know

452
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:31,034
how the community was going to respond, just to be totally

453
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:35,255
honest. Brand new hardware, brand new systems for everybody.

454
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:38,016
We had to figure that out. So we released early and then

455
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:41,958
We started getting feedback right away from the community, which is fantastic.

456
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:48,182
And let me tell you, the team bent over backwards to respond to the community as fast as it possibly could.

457
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:52,285
Not just with hot fixes for bugs, but for additional features, little tweaks here and there.

458
00:25:52,846 --> 00:25:57,409
Our coders, our artists, our designers all stayed really late and worked their butts off.

459
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:01,271
And then we quickly realized we were burning the team out, responding too rapidly to consumers.

460
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:06,355
And while we were making a few people here and there really happy, it was hurting the longevity of the product.

461
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:10,097
And we knew we wanted to, again, premium content, premium product.

462
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:11,878
So we had to space that out.

463
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:16,020
Instead of going from releasing every two weeks to at some point releasing once a month,

464
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,862
to eventually we realized we wanted to put a bulk of the content together and release it every three months.

465
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:23,504
Because no matter how we did it, every time you release there's a price you have to pay,

466
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:24,965
an internal production price, right?

467
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:27,326
Fixing bugs, stabilizing, optimizing.

468
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:29,147
So the further we could space that out,

469
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,488
the more efficient the team became.

470
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,349
And honestly, the bigger bang of content releases

471
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:34,910
is actually better for the consumers

472
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,731
we find at the end of the day.

473
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:36,791
They're far more interested when you

474
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:38,352
release a whole bunch of content at once,

475
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:40,093
rather than just streaming it out.

476
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,775
So quarterly updates, they've worked great for us.

477
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:46,557
And in addition, community.

478
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:49,198
The community has been fantastic for raw data.

479
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:55,503
Part of that is, or at least, we can't take credit for a great community, they're awesome people.

480
00:26:56,224 --> 00:27:00,528
But from very early on it was important that we engage with our community.

481
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:06,333
So some of the decisions that we made from the beginning, and this isn't lip service, we really bought into this early.

482
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:09,416
We resourced up properly for it, have community managers.

483
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:15,660
right out of the get-go. One of the key decisions we made, I think, that helped us is we resisted

484
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,043
the urge to sort of build our own set of forums and try to drive people to a new place. We

485
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:26,967
went to where the fans already were, and we actually tailored that down just to two channels.

486
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:32,270
We focused on driving people to our Steam page and the forums that are there, and we

487
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,753
also engaged on Reddit, because that's where the two most active communities were. It makes

488
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:39,534
no sense to try to move people off of that.

489
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:43,542
And that proved to be a big, big success for us.

490
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:50,497
Another thing to talk about coming up for raw data,

491
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:51,718
for those of you who haven't heard already,

492
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:54,700
we have a new content release coming out in March.

493
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,741
Very excited about that.

494
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:57,303
We're going to have a new mission.

495
00:27:58,203 --> 00:27:59,865
Our two characters, Sayaja and Bosser,

496
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:01,426
are going to have a whole bunch of new powers,

497
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,307
which we're very excited about

498
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,288
because they weren't previously finished.

499
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:05,910
But probably one of the bigger things

500
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,792
is we are not just supporting The Rift completely.

501
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:11,554
We are actually fully cross-platform play compatible.

502
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:15,077
So now all users, whatever platform they're on, of those two platforms,

503
00:28:15,097 --> 00:28:17,518
they'll be able to go online, play Call up with their friends.

504
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:20,580
It doesn't matter what system they're on, the community is just going to grow larger and larger.

505
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,742
As these, it's one community, not two separate ones.

506
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:26,363
Yeah, again, the social aspects of VR,

507
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:30,406
we want to try to bring all the VR players together into the same ecosystem,

508
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:33,568
so that you don't have to worry about trying to find friends to play with,

509
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:36,049
and you can really build things up, get word of mouth.

510
00:28:38,164 --> 00:28:42,366
And that's pretty much it. So I think we have a couple of minutes to take some questions

511
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:48,389
afterwards. I know Mike and I will be out in the little reception lounge area outside to take

512
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:54,073
further questions. And we also have our booth for you, those unaware, it's number 944. So

513
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:57,875
Wednesday through Friday we'll have our booth. Please swing by. We'll be there. Happy to

514
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:02,778
answer any other questions you might have. Yes, on raw data and we also are showing a sneak

515
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:07,420
peek at another upcoming game. All right. That's it. Thank you.

516
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:09,586
Thanks a lot, Mike.

517
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:10,666
Thank you.

518
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:10,887
Thank you.

519
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:13,709
Thank you.

520
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:15,370
I think we literally have one minute, so.

521
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,171
Yeah, we can stretch.

522
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,272
Hello?

523
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:18,952
Hi.

524
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:19,713
Quick question.

525
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:22,615
Are you going to have like a least common denominator play

526
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,596
space, or are you going to adapt to the different?

527
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,080
No. So basically on either platforms you can play full 360

528
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,721
but we made specific developments for those users who

529
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:37,842
only have two cameras if they're on the RIF system. So we built

530
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:40,783
a new tech to support that. So it won't matter which one you're

531
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:41,003
using.

532
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:47,398
So what was the biggest challenge you had in terms of limiting the player from trying

533
00:29:47,438 --> 00:29:51,041
to physically move around the room versus actually teleporting?

534
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:54,624
And before you answer the question, I have to tell you my college-age daughter who came

535
00:29:54,664 --> 00:29:59,649
home, her comment and her boyfriend's comment playing it was, holy shit, science has gone

536
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:01,411
way too far, this is ridiculous.

537
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:03,571
Thank you.

538
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:06,172
Well, that's thanks to our brilliant team.

539
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:07,452
Our coders and designers and artists

540
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:09,513
have just done a phenomenal job on the product.

541
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:12,194
So yes, players walking into the environment,

542
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:14,334
using the environment was a big debate internally.

543
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:18,155
Initially, we had some systems that were preventing the player

544
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:20,076
from physically putting their arms into things

545
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:21,896
or physically walking into a wall that would stop them.

546
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:25,137
We had to reverse course and go a different direction

547
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,238
than that because we found that it would cause nausea

548
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,618
for some people stopping at a wall.

549
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:30,459
Again, no nausea policy.

550
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,181
We're not gonna let players get sick.

551
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:34,923
So instead, what we ended up doing is we realized

552
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,764
once players, if they stick their head in the wall

553
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:38,525
or something, we just turn the screen red,

554
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,587
we start damaging them after a few seconds.

555
00:30:40,707 --> 00:30:42,669
Once they realize, oh, and we turn, disable their buttons.

556
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,770
So they realize, oh, I can't actually walk in a wall,

557
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,752
nothing works, they just stop doing it almost immediately.

558
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:48,773
They don't do it more than once.

559
00:30:50,554 --> 00:30:53,397
I wanted to know what are some specific things you did

560
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:56,319
to drive community engagement to Steam

561
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,880
and in Reddit that really worked?

562
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,132
So we've done a number of things.

563
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:04,173
We've done some great cross promotions with other VR titles.

564
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:07,074
And we're going to look for Roger right there.

565
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:09,154
What was the cross?

566
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,655
We did the cross promotions with?

567
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,535
Yeah, it's called Freepeat Friday.

568
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:15,136
And we've done really fun things like Rec Room.

569
00:31:15,316 --> 00:31:16,996
We're doing an experiment.

570
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,056
OK, cool.

571
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:20,337
I would say talk to Roger, who's up front here.

572
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:22,017
And he's part of our marketing team.

573
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:23,018
They're a fantastic group.

574
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:24,018
He'll be happy to help you with that.

575
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:26,479
But the free key Fridays have been really, really good,

576
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,882
where we actually have skimmed raw data avatars in Rec Room.

577
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:33,663
We've done some other things, and we'll give away free keys

578
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:34,224
to the game.

579
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,306
Constantly, our marketing team is online,

580
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:42,889
calling out either raw data players or different events

581
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:43,749
that are happening.

582
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,652
Just a constant social media marketing, basically.

583
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:50,754
So just a constant, constant flow of engagement

584
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:51,674
with the fans.

585
00:31:51,714 --> 00:31:52,274
And on Reddit.

586
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:59,804
One of our engineers internally is just like a super Reddit fanatic and he's just on there all the time.

587
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:05,111
As you know with Reddit you need authenticity to really connect with that audience and he already had a voice.

588
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:07,874
So he was able to really be our point person there.

589
00:32:10,753 --> 00:32:16,098
So Raw Data was pretty successful in 2016 because it kind of stood out quality wise

590
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,500
among the other experiences out there.

591
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:24,106
What do you think a VR experience or a VR game has to do in 2017 to stand out now?

592
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:31,494
I would say, again, going back to what we said before, it's premium content.

593
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:37,236
There are so many fantastic experiences out there, but some of them can be, you know,

594
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:40,857
sometimes derivative or, you know, too similar to other stuff.

595
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:44,658
Players love VR, the VR community. They're super excited.

596
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:46,639
They're super enthusiastic. We see it all the time.

597
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:49,880
If you make something great, they're going to flock to it,

598
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,660
is at least our observations, right?

599
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,361
So players really want high-quality products.

600
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,782
Again, it's also going back to one of the other points before.

601
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:59,223
One of the pillars of raw data was be that superhero,

602
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,243
be that badass, right?

603
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:02,484
Do something, have all these powers and abilities

604
00:33:02,504 --> 00:33:03,644
that you can't do in real life.

605
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:05,365
So I would encourage other developers out there,

606
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:08,947
besides making premium content, give users an experience

607
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,227
that they can't have in real life.

608
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:12,608
Do something that they can only do when they're in VR.

609
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:14,209
And I think the players are there,

610
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:15,489
and they're just waiting for that content.

611
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:16,990
Thanks.

612
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:17,490
Thank you.

613
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,751
All right, I think that's it.

614
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:20,551
Great.

615
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:21,151
Thanks, everybody.

616
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:21,571
Thank you.
