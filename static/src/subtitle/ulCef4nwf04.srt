1
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:13,424
My name is Patrik Rosander.

2
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:15,585
I'm a senior concept artist.

3
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:21,167
I worked in the games industry and entertainment industry as a whole for 12 years.

4
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:30,691
And I started out working in small studios and eventually I worked myself up to bigger AAA studios as more of a specialist.

5
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,732
I'm currently at Remedy Entertainment.

6
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,440
and I've always been a big fan of vistas in games.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:52,588
You know those moments where you just like take a moment and enjoy the view and get transported into another world and creating those kind of moments have been a driving force in my concept art career and then trying to get those moments into every single game that I work on.

8
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,752
but there's very little information on how to create those vistas and those moments.

9
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,814
So today I'm gonna present my approach focused on matte painting.

10
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:17,001
And there are many other techniques different from matte painting that you can use and different workflows you can use to create large vistas but this is like another tool that you can have in your toolbox.

11
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:22,504
So what you see here, what you see here is the result that we're going for.

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:30,100
And the example that I'm going to be showing today is not connected to any Remedy projects, current or future.

13
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:31,762
It's just made for this talk.

14
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:39,288
So first I'm going to cover the background and the core concepts of a matte painting.

15
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:51,178
And in my view, the different components you need to pay attention to is the camera placement, the geometry placement, and where the matte painting lives in the world.

16
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:57,328
that I'm going to go through a quick creation process where we create the example that I just showed you guys.

17
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:08,535
So math painting has a long history from painting on glass back in the day to digital math painting and slowly evolving to full 3D environments.

18
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:20,242
And according to Wikipedia, a math painting is a representation of a landscape set to a distant location that allows filmmakers to create an illusion of an environment

19
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,513
that is not present at the filming location.

20
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:31,546
For me, it's a way to show a larger world and to inform the player of the bigger universe that they're a part of.

21
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:40,650
And it's usually way beyond the scope of a game production to create spectacles like that that are actually playable.

22
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,651
So I find that it's a technique that is as powerful in games as it is in movies.

23
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:53,973
And just like in movies, matte paintings and vistas help you show the world outside of the game space.

24
00:02:54,793 --> 00:03:04,897
You might be walking on a very constricted street area, but a matte painting and a good vista gives you the feeling that you're in an epic hive city, for example, in this picture.

25
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:13,740
It's also a very important part of creating a suspension of disbelief for the player, making sure that they buy into the entire story and the premise of the game.

26
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,922
So the easiest way to describe a matte painting in a game is that it's an

27
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:26,665
Texture with baiting lighting on a low poly geometry with an unlit shader.

28
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,747
And texture is actually the big limiting factor of a matte painting in games.

29
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:40,992
You can push as much detail as you can possibly get into that texture, but the cost of a matte painting is generally extremely cheap and performant.

30
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:53,510
And the actual virtue of this technique that is a simple geometry and just a texture and an unlit shader makes the iteration time and the creation time extremely fast.

31
00:03:55,931 --> 00:04:00,115
So when it comes to creating our matte painting asset, there are a couple of elements to consider.

32
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:02,257
The first is the camera.

33
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:08,201
Second one is the placement of the matte painting and the projection geometry.

34
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,584
I'll go through what these are in further detail.

35
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:16,690
So a matte painting always looks best when it's viewed head on.

36
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:26,259
And the further the view angle strays from that head on position, the more the illusion will start to break and you'll get distortion in the actual matte painting.

37
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:30,983
And when it comes to placing the matte painting in a game,

38
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,810
I always think of a game level as having three layers.

39
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:40,434
You have the foreground geometry, you have the backdrop geometry and the skybox.

40
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:49,639
The foreground is the player interactable space, the backdrop is the jump towards the skydome, but you can never interact with it.

41
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,241
And the skydome, of course, is just the texture.

42
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:57,432
and you can basically place a matte painting as close to the player as you want.

43
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:04,265
The projection geometry and the texture resolution will be the limiting factor, but it usually holds up really close.

44
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:10,025
So this is a little formula I use.

45
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:13,228
Just keep it in the back of your head if you're going to do a matte painting.

46
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:25,060
So the distance to the camera and the view angle, for example, if you're going to view the matte painting from the start of the level and the end of the level, you'll have like a 90 degree change of angle of view.

47
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:30,545
That kind of dictates the complexity of your geometry that you're going to create.

48
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,317
So why use a matte painting in the first place?

49
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:43,042
You could just paint a detail in the information in the sky dome or make a 3D model.

50
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:56,513
I mean, every product is different and you kind of need to make your own judgment calls, but a sky dome most usually does not have the texture resolution for a good like detail backdrop.

51
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,356
And it also lacks parallax, which we'll talk on later on.

52
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:09,730
The 3D model approach is great and I would actually recommend it, but it takes a lot of time and it's really tough to iterate on.

53
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,911
But if you have the project and the timeline that allows it, go ahead, do it.

54
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,692
Yeah, let's get into the creation process.

55
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:27,654
So for this example, I'm going to create a matte painting for a level segment in a first-person shooter.

56
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,283
and it's a traversal area between two gameplay areas.

57
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:35,285
And this is the prime location for a matte painting.

58
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:41,870
Player has nothing to do except breathe out between two very intense, hopefully, encounters.

59
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,452
And they just can get a palette cleanser and enjoy the view.

60
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:50,676
And of course, it's a sci-fi universe because that's what I like doing.

61
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:56,221
So this is a brief kind of outline, the steps I have here.

62
00:06:57,102 --> 00:07:01,788
You can skip some, you can move them around a bit with experience, but it's good to have as a starting point.

63
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:08,878
So first up is selecting the camera location.

64
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:15,079
So I have a fly-through of the level example that we're going to be working with.

65
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,423
And as you can see, there are going to be a couple of instances where the camera looks kind of straight ahead into the void.

66
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:27,025
That is an ideal camera hero view, I like to call it.

67
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,806
Basically the reference point of our map painting.

68
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:40,592
Basically, when you're going to select a camera view, you want to have it in the middle point of the level.

69
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:45,393
For example, you see there's maybe a 50 meter segment that we're going to be walking through.

70
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:52,455
So we want to have it in a place that represents the best picture of those 50 meters of traversal.

71
00:07:54,955 --> 00:08:02,897
So here we see the critical path or the player path in a more overhead view with the dots representing the potential camera locations.

72
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:04,202
we have

73
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:20,297
for you.

74
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,627
the one in the middle is the selected hero location.

75
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:50,994
Looks straight out into the void like the matte painting territory and it's in the vertical middle of the level and the kind of horizontal middle as well.

76
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,597
So the next step is blocking it out.

77
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:07,044
I use Unreal in this example and using their brushes and 3D models I quickly kind of make a block out of the composition that I want to have.

78
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:25,165
and it's really important to work on it through the entire level segment, watching it from every single view and paying attention to both the scale cues and kind of the parallax you get and the distance and scale you get from the small objects next to the big ones.

79
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:31,869
Because in the end, if it doesn't look good in this state, there's no way to save it.

80
00:09:34,722 --> 00:10:03,410
and in this example as well we have a lighting setup which provides us with some nice specularity and some nice shadows and for a matte painting it is kind of a must to have some sort of basic lighting setup in the beginning because you will position your objects and your matte painting elements in order to catch that light to get the specularity to really communicate the materials of the objects that you have it's the main key ingredient of doing a good matte painting

81
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:07,955
So the more work you get done in this stage, the better.

82
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:13,198
And as I said before, this is like the defining point.

83
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,679
It might not look like much.

84
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,202
It's just a couple of boxes, but to me, it's the most important point.

85
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:20,363
Because if it doesn't work here, it will never work.

86
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:24,466
So the next step is creating the concept art.

87
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:26,907
You might already have a concept before starting.

88
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:28,308
I'm a concept artist.

89
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,970
I usually work on my own concepts for the math paintings.

90
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,391
Every studio is different.

91
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:41,144
but my process is to export the foreground geometry of the level, export the camera as well and the block out.

92
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:55,173
That way I have a one-to-one representation of the level but in my 3D package and I can confidently go forward and just flash the matte painting out without any kind of hesitation if it will work in game or not.

93
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:57,374
If it works here, it will work in game.

94
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:25,153
and don't be afraid to kind of go back switch up the camera angles and experiment because we only spent like a half a day maybe at this point with the finished concept maybe one day two days and the power of this technique is that it's so straightforward that you can just restart it restart it and restart it until you really get the good composition that sells the fantasy you're going for

95
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:31,616
But the downside of being a concept artist is you want to make a kick-ass concept.

96
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:35,618
And this is not the time to create a kick-ass concept necessarily.

97
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:37,059
It's a step in the process.

98
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,903
This is just a sketch in order for us to get information of what elements we want in the actual matte painting.

99
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,685
For example, how does the sky intersect with the space elevator that I made here?

100
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:51,166
How does the god rays look?

101
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:52,666
How does the fog interact?

102
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:58,908
I think I put, yeah, I put some red position lights, which are always a favorite thing of mine to put.

103
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:06,271
And all those elements need to be represented in the matte painting using additional geometry or shaders.

104
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:10,813
So even this concept for me is a way to plan out my coming workflow.

105
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:15,408
So once this is done, we're going to set up the projection.

106
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:21,092
And basically, we're using the concept art camera.

107
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:25,535
We're zooming it out to give us more screen real estate.

108
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:33,261
As you can see, there's kind of space for the mountains and space for the sky as well.

109
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:36,584
Because this is more like the player is going to see in game.

110
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:40,307
And the concept is always zoomed in to look awesome and sell stuff.

111
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:42,048
But this is the practical camera.

112
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:49,517
We have enough geometry and kind of space in the foreground to create the transition as well once we get to that stage.

113
00:12:54,762 --> 00:13:04,389
So in most cases, as I said before, you're going to need to reposition your camera and tweak it until you actually get a good matte painting render out of your 3D scene.

114
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,891
And once you've done that,

115
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:14,000
you're going to go ahead and basically duplicate the scene and delete all your beautiful geometry and add a plane instead.

116
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:22,006
And you can just map your plane to that, map your texture to that plane using a UV projection from the camera.

117
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:28,352
And then you should have basically the same result as your heavy 3D scene, but just on a flat plane.

118
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,917
And this is basically the setup that goes into the engine.

119
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:46,452
And as you can see here, we have, yeah, basically the matte painting concept, but just on a plane projected in the game world.

120
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:50,373
Yeah.

121
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:56,336
And the good part about it is the fact that even if it's just a plane, you get immense amount of detail.

122
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,437
And that's the power of this technique.

123
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:03,840
So thank you for coming to my talk and yeah, have a good afternoon.

124
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:05,194
I'm

125
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:29,440
you place the matte painting in the world and you create your projection geometry.

126
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,404
And it's never going to get better no matter how much painting time or rendering time you put into it.

127
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:42,268
So this is the next step in the process.

128
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:49,213
We have fleshed out the train and the actual 3D geometry of the main building.

129
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:54,817
And as you can see, the difference is not huge, but the detail is starting to get in there.

130
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,851
and the SkyDome is there as well.

131
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:05,635
It's just a 16-bit HDRI, but it's an important part to try to build up towards the concept that we did earlier.

132
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:12,538
And keeping the models at around 80% finished is kind of a core concept here.

133
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:16,700
You don't want to push it too far, because you still want to be able to go back and change things.

134
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:22,203
And there's a couple of more steps we're going to add on before we can pull the trigger and just go to town and paint.

135
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:31,348
So we also want to refine our plane or our projection geometry in order to get the most out of it in engine.

136
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:44,778
So just by adding depth into the projection geometry, we can create parallax and we can make the matte painting stand up much more to different view angles than just a flat plane.

137
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,463
And as you can see, we have the mountains moving in the back in relation to the sci-fi structure.

138
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:01,343
And that kind of illusion really helps set the tone of the matte painting and helps it integrate into the game world.

139
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:07,066
It's really easy to overdo it, but that kind of breaks the illusion as well.

140
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,847
So don't have too much fun with the parallax.

141
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:16,310
And the next step, when the parallax works, is to add dynamic elements.

142
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:20,637
So for me, I want to have the matte painting working in a static shot.

143
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:24,378
Here, I've added some simple sky animation using flow maps.

144
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:37,044
And to kind of integrate that into the painting, I also added cloud shadows, which is basically a noise texture that would just tile all over the matte painting, kind of match the speeds.

145
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:44,268
And it already makes it feel like it's kind of a part of the game lighting and game world instead of just a painting.

146
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:50,298
And as a cherry on top, I'm putting in my favorite signal lights as well.

147
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:50,998
Here they come.

148
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:52,199
Nice.

149
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,984
Which is basically just an additive plane that we make visible and hide with a looping script.

150
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:04,348
And just by adding these elements, you have something that looks like a, it could just be a 3D model, right?

151
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:05,029
In a game.

152
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:11,814
There's no real difference from the player's point of view, but it's just a very cheap asset and quick asset to make.

153
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:26,779
So at this point we have our projection geometry set up, we have our refined shapes, we have our dynamic elements, we know that this is going to work, right?

154
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,904
We can actually start enjoying the work process.

155
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:37,692
So for this stage what I've done here is I basically just improved on the train geometry, improved on the

156
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:56,877
The sci-fi asset geometry improved on the sky dome and the dynamic elements as well, making sure that the speeds of the animation is correct and also adding cloud planes and mist cloud cards to help the painting sit better into the actual environment.

157
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:05,258
And a key part of this part is actually to hide all the seams and make sure that it seamlessly integrates with the backdrop geometry.

158
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:10,719
In this case, I put the seams in the shadow areas, which is a cheap trick.

159
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:17,641
But if you can't do that, just make sure that the edges are high poly and that it intersects with the geometry in a nice way.

160
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,221
And there's always other tricks you can use.

161
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,402
Tree cards, et cetera.

162
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:24,462
Alpha blending.

163
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,982
So basically, this is the target that you want to reach.

164
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:37,566
You have a really detailed background that is basically almost a one man show.

165
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:43,811
It takes usually between one to two weeks to make, or even shorter if the brief is simpler.

166
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:51,825
And I mean, when we're at that stage with the refined 3D, we can just start painting.

167
00:18:52,166 --> 00:19:00,209
And I think that's the beauty, at least for me as a concept artist, of this technique is we have the texture set up so I can use whatever tool that I want.

168
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:08,293
Photos, photo bashing, just pushing the 3D more just to create the most kind of epic painting I could possibly create.

169
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:14,036
But the actual limiting factor is, as I said before, the texture, texture memory.

170
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:24,495
Yeah, and also a good point to think about is if you push the detail too much, you will eventually kind of overdo it.

171
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:31,197
Like you will have a map painted and it's more detailed than the game world and that kind of like ruins the entire thing.

172
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:36,899
You need to restrain yourself and remember that you're working on a game that needs to like look cohesive.

173
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,560
So what about performance, right?

174
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,581
It's always a big question in games.

175
00:19:43,960 --> 00:20:06,709
and like I said before this is an unlit asset it's low poly but it still has kind of a performance footprint even if it's really lightweight and of course the heaviest element is the texture size but it's also very scalable and it's a known quantity up front you know what you're going to aim for and it's going to be constant once you actually pay that cost

176
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:10,433
and the geometry should be super light.

177
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:16,357
You can go from a couple of hundred triangles to like a couple of thousand, depending on the complexity of your projection, et cetera.

178
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:20,020
And the shader setup, as I said, is extremely simple.

179
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:30,787
Alpha overdraw, like in this case, can be a factor, but you can also just cut off the geometry using the alpha channel and just remove all the alpha straight away.

180
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:39,045
So in my mind, this technique is really fast and efficient.

181
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,907
That's why I'm promoting it today.

182
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:50,754
And it's a good way to create awe-inspiring moments in games and just help your players get into that fantasy and enjoy the world.

183
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:55,398
And yeah, that's my approach to creating matte paintings in games.

184
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:57,420
And thank you guys for coming.

185
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:13,354
Also a shout out to Justin for mentoring the talk, and Johan Barek back at home, he's my shader guy who helped me with this workflow.

186
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:17,917
And Remedy is hiring, go in and check it out.

187
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,461
Looking for a lot of positions from all over the world.

188
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:26,364
And that's my socials if you want to get in touch or have any questions.

189
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:39,293
Okay, any questions?

190
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:46,558
Well, then I wish you a great afternoon and a good flight home.

191
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:48,119
Oh, we have one.

192
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,641
Yeah, cool.

193
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:57,125
I just wanted to ask you how much support you have from the 3D artists to create that structure?

194
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:58,426
Do you do it all yourself?

195
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:11,732
Yeah, I usually do it myself, but I'm a very 3D heavy concept artist nowadays, but I mean if we are in production and we actually have an asset library, then the work is already done, right?

196
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,513
So I'll just kitbash away.

197
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:17,594
So the actual design of that structure is yours as well?

198
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:18,535
Yeah.

199
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:19,775
Okay, cool.

200
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:20,976
Thanks.

201
00:22:21,196 --> 00:22:21,476
Thank you.

202
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:58,134
maybe one more question so of course um when you show the parallax effect that you just split up the plane as manual work into more vertices and then extrude it or is that an automatic process no since the geometry is so low poly i just do it manually and the uvs are projected from the camera so there's no work when it comes to remapping the uvs or anything it's just moving vertices into space yeah okay thank you

203
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:11,620
How much do you rely on, like what's your split between 2D and 3D, like how much are you doing hand painting versus the 3D rendering?

204
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:31,266
Nowadays I do like 70 to 90 percent 3D, but it all depends on the actual brief, for example train, mountains and stuff in this case, I almost always photos because it's not worth the time investment for me as a concept artist to do the high-end train stuff, not yet.

205
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:32,467
Thank you.

206
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:41,948
Okay, well thank you all and have a good afternoon.
