00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:04,330
Hello everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,453
I am your host, Brian Francis.

3
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:14,678
I am here today playing a neat little game, not that little, but a neat game called Age

4
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:16,279
of Wonders Planetfall.

5
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:19,802
Age of Wonders Planetfall comes to you from Triumph Studios and Paradox Interactive.

6
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:26,627
With me today, in the lower left hand corner of the screen, is Triumph Studios co-founder

7
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:27,227
Leonard Suss.

8
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,068
Leonard, how are you doing?

9
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:29,549
Hi, doing well.

10
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:29,909
How are you?

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,133
It's out in the world and people are not super angry and they seem to like it so that's great.

12
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,033
Nice.

13
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:45,998
And with me also, saying nice, is Alyssa McAloon, straight from Gamasutra.

14
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:46,838
How are you doing Alyssa?

15
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,840
I am doing well. Wide awake, wide awake.

16
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:50,467
White Awake.

17
00:00:50,987 --> 00:00:51,348
White Awake.

18
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:53,251
Any dogs hanging out there, Alyssa?

19
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:57,998
She has been bribed by a delicious lunch, so she is over there minding her own business.

20
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,900
You can also bribe me with a delicious lunch.

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,045
Readers at home, if you are, you can also bribe me, viewers at home, you can also bribe

22
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,128
me with a delicious lunch if you ever wish to play my ear.

23
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:08,809
We're here today with Lennart playing Age of Wonders Planetfall.

24
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:15,531
This is a 4X strategy game that has some turn-based 4X strategy game with another layer of turn-based

25
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,731
combat that debuted just a couple weeks ago.

26
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:22,872
It's the latest game in the Age of Wonders series, which if you're a strategy aficionado

27
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:23,933
you may have played before.

28
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:30,414
It's been in development since 1999 and Lennart, you've been working on this series for like

29
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:31,334
20 years, right?

30
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:33,155
Yeah, correct.

31
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:37,475
Yeah, we started this out in university.

32
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:41,939
We met with a couple of like-minded friends.

33
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:46,522
We thought to mix and match a bunch of genres together,

34
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:49,825
like strategy, RPG, even adventuring at first,

35
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:52,407
and that's when the Age of Wonders series started to emerge.

36
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,669
Of course, the first games were fantasy-based,

37
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:59,193
and Planetfall is our first venture into sci-fi.

38
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:02,235
And also, the first time we...

39
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:03,924
brought the game to consoles.

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,771
What, for you, has development been like?

41
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:38,112
And how has four years of development transitioned into making this game right here?

42
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:40,693
Yeah, it was an awful long while.

43
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:45,495
I think it's almost the longest that we spent on a game ever.

44
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:51,557
Maybe the very first one, but that's when we were working sort of like semi-professionally on it.

45
00:02:53,831 --> 00:03:00,093
We started off looking at how do we make a new turn-based strategy game.

46
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:09,935
The idea to make a sci-fi version came shortly after we'd done the fact that we wanted to keep on making turn-based games,

47
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,556
but we didn't want to make a direct sequel to Age of Wonders 3.

48
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:16,957
We thought it would be a great match to try a sci-fi universe.

49
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:20,158
Age of Wonders has always been a war-focused game,

50
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:22,638
with lots of knights and...

51
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:27,597
Castle sieges and medieval war equipment.

52
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:32,159
We thought it would be a great match if we try and model all those cool battles

53
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,820
and cool empire building in a sci-fi universe.

54
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,642
So replace archers with marines with machine guns and cavalry with tanks.

55
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,363
Spells with orbital laser cannons.

56
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:49,505
And we basically started there and soon after the idea started flowing.

57
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,846
But we wanted to do some radical...

58
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,070
shifts as well, including the way the economy works,

59
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,391
the way you basically conquer the map using sectors.

60
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:02,472
So there's been a very long prototyping phase,

61
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,974
perhaps one and a half year, I would say,

62
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:09,595
where we started experimenting with these new combat mechanics,

63
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:14,257
new diplomacy, new economic features.

64
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:18,499
And when that all was sorted, we went into production.

65
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:23,782
The game features six unique factions, all with their own tech trees.

66
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:29,404
So working that out with, you know, detailed units, detailed animations,

67
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:32,385
sound effects and everything, it's just a big amount of production.

68
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:37,626
And during the production period, we were acquired by Paradox Interactive,

69
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:42,588
which of course was a little bit of, I wouldn't say a distraction,

70
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:47,469
but I would say that it did prolong the development a little bit.

71
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:53,186
Of course, a lot of senior people during such a process are busy with other stuff.

72
00:04:54,267 --> 00:05:02,048
And then after that, when that acquisition process was completed, we started looking

73
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:06,949
into, okay, how can we see what can we do more with this type of game?

74
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,290
And soon the idea came along, like, let's try this on console.

75
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,750
It's a new IP as well.

76
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,971
It's not a fantasy IP.

77
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:14,951
It's called Planetfall.

78
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:15,991
It's not a sequel.

79
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:19,714
So we said, okay, let's see if we can transition this on console.

80
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:23,878
And that's when the entire interface had to be reworked

81
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,800
to be multi-platform friendly.

82
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,243
All those hundreds of windows, pop-ups, panels,

83
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:33,285
all needed to be changed.

84
00:05:34,806 --> 00:05:39,890
And, yeah, that was probably a year of work, I would say.

85
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,893
Of course, the port itself, multiplayer...

86
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:47,416
Working on all those different platforms too was a tremendous task.

87
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:50,576
And that's how those years fill up.

88
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:53,057
The time flies, right?

89
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:56,658
Yeah.

90
00:05:56,818 --> 00:06:01,218
With... because this is the first... you've brought games in Overlord to console before,

91
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:04,859
but this is the first in the Age of Wonders series to come to consoles too, right?

92
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,740
Yes, yeah. I can tell you that this was actually a lot more work

93
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,380
to bring to consoles than a game like Overlord.

94
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:20,004
The entire control scheme of Overlord was a lot more suited to, or easy to port.

95
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:24,907
I would say that a turn-based game is very much suited for a console game.

96
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,509
There's just more work involved in transferring all these interfaces.

97
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:35,173
Yeah, I was going to say, this is kind of like a, this whole genre, like both your

98
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:39,195
kind of duality genres you have here, they both are kind of synonymous with PC for me.

99
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:40,116
So it's interesting.

100
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,556
the decision to kind of like branch out into consoles.

101
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:45,538
And Brian's playing on PlayStation 4 right now, too.

102
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,400
So you can see that like it applies itself well

103
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,841
to the controller and everything, too.

104
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:52,123
Yeah.

105
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:56,586
Yeah, it is, you know, there are not many games out there.

106
00:06:56,746 --> 00:07:01,570
I mean, Paradox recently ported Stellaris,

107
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,392
a big Space 4X game to console.

108
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:09,575
And that, yeah, it was an experiment which turned out well.

109
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:15,172
Of course, in the past there was Civilization Revolutions on the previous generation of consoles.

110
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:20,017
And of course we have the very popular tactical turn-based games.

111
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:25,043
Of course, our game has a very large tactical component as well.

112
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:32,030
So games like XCOM or Fire Emblem do very well on consoles.

113
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:46,009
Right on. To move on into the next question, so you go from, you said you wanted to make a new game, a new Age of Wonders game after Age of Wonders 3.

114
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,234
What was kind of the foundation, like you made a sci-fi version of a series you already had.

115
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,718
What was the decision to sort of adapt the series you had for a...

116
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,263
as opposed to building a new IP ground up that would be like strictly science fiction only.

117
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:05,446
Which you've sort of halfway done, but there's still kind of a fantasy component to it, I guess?

118
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:13,954
Maybe a little bit, but the IPs are as different as, for example, Warcraft and Starcraft, or Warhammer and Warhammer 40k.

119
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:20,900
If there's any links, they're very subtle, but it's mainly the reason why we kept on calling it Age of Wonders was...

120
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,488
the gameplay formula is similar.

121
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:28,709
The split between the strategy and the tactical layer.

122
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,470
So just like you have like the Total War games

123
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,131
or StarCraft and WarCraft, you have the same sort of formula applied to

124
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:43,593
two different settings, which are not just reskins but actually

125
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:45,353
the large part of the gameplay

126
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:47,913
I think has fundamentally changed.

127
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:50,738
Right on.

128
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:55,861
Um, uh, what then was kind of your foundation for, I was reading some interviews where you

129
00:08:55,901 --> 00:09:01,624
and your teammates were talking about, um, with making, uh, making new factions.

130
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:05,606
One of your goals was to make sure that, uh, all the factions that every single unit within

131
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:10,108
each faction was unique from faction to faction, uh, by comparison in Age of Wonders 3, every

132
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,429
unit has a soldier, an archer, a...

133
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:17,752
a cavalry unit, kind of that. And then some unique disemerge from there. But that's obviously a big

134
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:24,836
design choice change to make instead of a top-down structure for your unit to make every single unit

135
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:33,561
unique. What was the process for executing that? Yeah, it was a bit of a long iterative process,

136
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,443
basically. He started off making

137
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:42,545
good rich gameplay mechanics that allow for these various play styles, especially when

138
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:44,246
you talk about units, you talk about combat.

139
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:53,232
To ensure that the core mechanics, the systems are diverse and rich enough that allow for

140
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:55,693
various combat roles.

141
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:04,078
Units that can have more of an assault range, weapons, support units.

142
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,844
units that use cover, units that can fly, units that can yield, units that have all

143
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:20,193
sorts of various areas of effect damage, units that can hop around the battlefield, units

144
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:25,197
that can dig, units that can stagger or be immune to stagger.

145
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:36,125
So it started basically with a mechanic and a radical upgrade of the combat mechanics that we had in Age of Unus 3.

146
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:44,752
Right on. Alyssa, I'm going to toss the question over to you because I'm trying to juggle a bunch of objectives that just popped up.

147
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:49,016
So unlike Brian, I haven't had hands-on time with your game quite yet.

148
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:52,919
So your campaigns, does each faction have their own campaign there?

149
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:53,880
Yeah.

150
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,260
Okay. So how...

151
00:10:57,872 --> 00:11:01,914
I'm trying to figure out how I want to word this, but with each of the factions being so different,

152
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:04,115
they're obviously going to appeal to different kind of players.

153
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:13,320
How do you kind of design those, I guess, to have kind of like mass appeal while also encouraging people to get out of their comfort zones,

154
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,682
while giving people more of what they want when they finish one campaign and going into the next?

155
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:24,446
I guess, how do you kind of like accomplish that entire beast of making each faction interesting but appealing to as many people as possible?

156
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:35,132
Well, we obviously have various factions that have a, like a, some of them are more mainstream

157
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:39,294
I would call, like sort of like a mainstream pop song that is, you know, sort of a friend

158
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:41,716
to everybody, not too complex, not too quirky.

159
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:47,099
Of course most games, most strategy games, have what we call the human faction, which

160
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:51,962
are easy to identify with and when you look at a unit, you sort of see its function.

161
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:56,559
You know a tank is a tank, a walker, an aircraft, or a ship.

162
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,084
You know maybe they wear, have different types of rifles.

163
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,687
But you know we just use what you get basically.

164
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:11,554
And you know from there you go into more extreme forms including like alien insectoids,

165
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:15,979
or you know sort of like cyborg trash assembly.

166
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:26,599
You can also click on the ability lists to see what they do.

167
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,883
We have a single player campaign, which is basically used as an introduction to the entire series.

168
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:40,647
Next to that we have the standalone scenarios, which is a lot more similar to your civilization.

169
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:48,765
open-ended type of gameplay where you choose your victory condition that you want to proceed

170
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:55,109
and it's sort of like a free-for-all and a lot of people actually skip the campaign and

171
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,151
just go straight into that, especially the more advanced players.

172
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,852
And of course you can also play these scenarios in multiplayer.

173
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:07,556
But yeah, if you're a beginner to this type of game, we encourage you to start playing the campaign.

174
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,285
Maybe start with human fashion first.

175
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:14,360
Which is exactly what we've done, as you've no doubt ascertained.

176
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:21,837
Just a quick reminder for chat, we are happily taking your questions if you've got any for Lennart, don't be shy.

177
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:27,159
We'd love to hear from you. There's like 20 folks out there, that's a good sign that some of you are interested in Age of Wonders.

178
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:33,023
I'm gonna go to my question pile. Lennart, what I would like to know...

179
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,965
There was something interesting that was pointed out in one interview,

180
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:41,767
is that compared to previous, unlike other strategy games, when a game of Age of Wonders starts...

181
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,208
Age of Wonders Plain and False starts...

182
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:53,537
You don't jump right into your research tree, your exploitation system, is what it's called in this game,

183
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:55,839
but just like telling your cities what to focus on producing.

184
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,662
You don't jump into those right away with this, it's deliberately staggered out.

185
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:06,888
Can you walk through the decision to sort of slightly tweak traditional conventions of the 4X genre

186
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:12,292
and what it means for players to not be diving into those choices right away or every single turn?

187
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:19,178
Right, okay. Now we have to go to the nature of Age of Wonders and how it differs from the other games.

188
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:25,583
And basically what, also I think one of the reviewers, I don't know if it was PC Gamer or IGN,

189
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:28,646
basically said that Age of Wonders is sort of like a fast-paced 4X.

190
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:34,391
The, what they call turn density, so the amount of things that you do in a single turn,

191
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:39,815
is higher than in other titles.

192
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:43,043
So you can fight multiple battles, multiple pickups.

193
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:46,283
Also, for example, the research times tend to be shorter.

194
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:47,884
So there's a lot going on.

195
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:53,185
And part of that comes from the sort of war game multiplayer like nature of the game.

196
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:58,886
So in this sense, so especially in those early terms, a lot could happen if you

197
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:03,607
basically open up research and open up the scouting, doing your first battle,

198
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,367
making, recruiting your first hero.

199
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:10,241
and doing everything in turn one, front-loading that entire turn

200
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,803
before you really get your bearing.

201
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:17,504
So at one point we said, there's so much happening in turn one,

202
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:19,906
let's delay research one turn

203
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:23,628
so you at least get to see the lay of the land a little bit.

204
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:26,749
Maybe spend your first turn scouting and

205
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:30,051
see whether or not you have water nearby

206
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:35,033
or what type of enemies you'll be facing in the first couple of rounds.

207
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:41,454
And then the turn after you can start making your research decisions based on that lay

208
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:42,014
of the land.

209
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:46,681
And the game is a little bit more welcoming to beginning players, so that they don't get

210
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:51,128
you know, that first turn isn't loaded with all sorts of decisions to make right away.

211
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:58,259
Right on. Um, what do you think, um, as far as acquiring like, like the forex

212
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,560
strategy genre has been around for a while and some of the games in it are

213
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,180
really popular. Some of them are a little more niche. Um, what do you think

214
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,641
is part of the, and this is sort of part of the paradoxes overall marketing

215
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:12,742
strategies. What do you think is essential for, for the strategy genre to

216
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:15,963
grow and to keep acquiring new players as opposed to just sort of, I mean,

217
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:18,223
like there's, there's obviously value in, in, in.

218
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:19,964
I'm not sure if that's a good thing.

219
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,745
Well, actually, we've seen quite some growth in the strategy genre over the years.

220
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:52,682
Mainly it is because gamers say they don't stop gaming when they're 20 years old.

221
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,466
They keep on gaming when they have kids or when they get to work.

222
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:06,092
A strategy game like Age of Wonders or Planetfall is very easy to wrap around your life because it's turn-based.

223
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:13,697
Also, for example, with the multiplayer options that we have, what we call the adaptive multiplayer system.

224
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,180
And basically you put your turns in the cloud,

225
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,541
and you can download the turns when you have time to play your turn,

226
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:22,981
and you can upload it again.

227
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,522
But if your friends are online at the same time,

228
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:29,423
you can switch that same session to sort of like a live session,

229
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:31,943
and this game switches to simultaneous turns.

230
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:32,303
Yeah.

231
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:33,543
All play at once.

232
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:36,764
And then say, okay, it's now late at night,

233
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:37,964
and I'm going to log off,

234
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:41,665
and the game switches back to the sort of round-robin turn system again.

235
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,585
So that's an innovation that we...

236
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:50,908
that is brought to by newer technology that allows this type of game to adapt to future

237
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:58,396
age and hopefully to a growing group of gamers who, you know, even when they become more

238
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:02,400
mature they keep on enjoying this medium.

239
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:08,876
That's wild. I remember back in when I was playing Civilization 3 back in ye olde days, when I was 8 years old.

240
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:14,941
That was the email, you emailed your turns to other players.

241
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,704
Yeah, that was manual. We had to system up well and have things automated.

242
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,946
How did you, what did it take to implement a system like that?

243
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,469
Of course very good programmers with very good ideas.

244
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,332
An AVS cloud system.

245
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:31,093
Which wasn't around...

246
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:34,030
And CIF 3, I think.

247
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:39,433
And, yeah, of course, bandwidth has gotten a lot cheaper.

248
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:45,838
You know, just because basically we foot the bill for those transfers.

249
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:48,099
But, you know, like earlier on you paid per megabyte.

250
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,741
So now, you know, the same money buys you terabytes of data.

251
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:52,482
Mm-hmm.

252
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:54,463
Right on.

253
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:58,526
Alyssa, I'm going to toss the question ball to you while I move some tricks around.

254
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:05,146
I'm really curious about that feature because I wasn't quite the emailing turns to friends thing,

255
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,748
but my sister and I would hurry up and we'd be in the middle of a StarCraft match and have to like,

256
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,950
oh we gotta hurry up and finish this before dad comes in and yells at us to go to bed.

257
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:18,693
So that's really cool. I didn't know strategy games had that feature, this one particularly.

258
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:23,616
Oh where was I going to go with that? There was a thought there and it's gone.

259
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:28,388
I'll come back to it later, but it's really neat and it's really interesting.

260
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:33,231
Fishy, or sorry, Fish21 in chat wants to know what your favorite part of making a 4X or

261
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:36,293
strategy game has been after doing it for as long as you have been.

262
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:43,878
Ooh, well, I think my favorite part is with each iteration, is looking into how we can

263
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:45,119
like innovate.

264
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,403
Part of the work I enjoy is looking back at

265
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:54,491
a long-running series, not necessarily 4X series,

266
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,413
just long-running genres,

267
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:59,516
and to see how they try to survive

268
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:02,899
and how they evolve or fail to evolve over the years

269
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,901
and why genres or even individual game series

270
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:07,943
rise or fall.

271
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:10,346
And that is, of course,

272
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:14,870
that makes trying to walk the fine line between innovation

273
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,991
and not...

274
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:20,506
losing the connection with your fan base and trying to innovate.

275
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:26,729
And that's, I think, one of the main challenges that you have when running the series alone.

276
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:30,231
And when it comes to For X Design in itself,

277
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:38,815
it's just the enormous challenge of making a game that is so complex.

278
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:43,057
And so there's so many subsystems, you know, the economy, the diplomacy, the combat.

279
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,359
And that needs to play out over like...

280
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:50,697
session can last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours, a typical session.

281
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:53,678
And you can play it in so many different ways.

282
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:59,059
And the game needs to be stable and basically adapt to people playing in a particular way.

283
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,960
And that experience, a lot of people come into such a game also with

284
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,941
entire different expectations.

285
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:10,722
Some people just want to play very casually and do some empire building, build cities,

286
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:13,762
while others really are super aggressive, competitive players.

287
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:19,433
who like to digest every little unitability and see how they can use that in their favor.

288
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:24,475
And they play such a game very differently from the more casual empire builder.

289
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:29,797
But still, we need to appeal to both of these type of gamers and just having

290
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:36,839
a game that tries to do it all is a challenge and it's also a lot of fun to do.

291
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,140
And you're picking...

292
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,181
Go, no, you go for it, Alyssa.

293
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,682
I would say picking into that process a little bit.

294
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,440
What's like, obviously you were working on this game for four years,

295
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,262
what's kind of like the iteration, the trial and error process to making sure,

296
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:50,623
oh, this is leaning too heavy in one direction,

297
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,324
so it's not fun for players who play this way.

298
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:57,547
How do you make everyone happy without kind of like sacrificing the character of a game?

299
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,748
Yeah, that is very difficult.

300
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,749
I mean, during the process of prototyping,

301
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:05,412
we basically split the team up into various mini teams,

302
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:09,754
which all get assigned to work on a particular function.

303
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:10,955
And especially when.

304
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,860
At first, you don't have the full backbone of the full ecosystem of the game running.

305
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,681
Some of these features are created in a vacuum.

306
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:24,782
It is very hard to see if such a feature is fun or not.

307
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:35,584
So you try to simulate an environment and try to role play or maybe board game it or

308
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:37,985
something, if a feature will be fun or not.

309
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:44,214
Sometimes you just end up spending three months of a significant part of the team

310
00:22:44,254 --> 00:22:47,996
just throwing a feature away because it just didn't end up being fun.

311
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:54,640
One of the examples is a sort of large, sort of orbital system that we built,

312
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,062
like an entire sky layer around the planet,

313
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:05,125
where you could maneuver aircraft, death stars, and satellites and missiles

314
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:07,327
in order to influence the world below.

315
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,817
But that just didn't work.

316
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:13,360
It totally undermined what was happening below.

317
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,584
Because there were almost no obstacles there, it sort of turned into a game of its own,

318
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:20,166
which wasn't fun.

319
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:28,573
So you just had to bite the bullet and scrap those many man-months worth of work.

320
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:33,698
But that's all in the game, if you would try something new.

321
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,065
Right on. Fish21 just wants to thank you, Leonard, for answering their question.

322
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:49,131
And LordSloth jokes that people don't have the resurgence trait in real life.

323
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:54,476
Leonard, just shifting the line of questioning for a moment.

324
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,977
What would you say was kind of a...

325
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:08,664
Sorry, that was not a good way to start the sentence.

326
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:13,739
I was reading one interview that one of the re- another one of the reasons that you all transition to making

327
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:16,800
Age of Wonders the way- Planetfall the way you did was after Age of Wonders 3

328
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:20,643
There was kind of a criticism that people wanted more options across the gameplay

329
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:24,085
That's sort of broadly that builds off what we talked about before about making units unique

330
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:25,185
But like, you know

331
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:29,508
They- they're- they're 4x games can kind of get uh, no matter how great and varied they can get

332
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:33,950
They can also get a little similar you- you build your city, you colonize new cities, and then just kind of

333
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:35,555
The loop repeats.

334
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:39,038
What was your process for finding...

335
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:42,601
We just sort of talked about trying new ideas, but what was sort of your process for finding

336
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:45,223
new ways to play 4X games, I guess?

337
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:47,885
To look for new options and new ways to get people into gameplay?

338
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:56,412
Yeah, when you're talking purely about mechanics, the main criticism on Age of Wilderness 3

339
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:56,753
was...

340
00:24:57,699 --> 00:25:01,861
that people missed some sort of like, you know, a strict strategy layer depth,

341
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:05,543
including the economy and the cities.

342
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:09,986
Like, when you build cities, you sort of follow the same system

343
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,687
and the same strategy over and over again.

344
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:15,789
And, you know, there are very deep strategy games

345
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:20,552
where you, you know, intricately manage your cities,

346
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:23,433
like civilization, obviously, and you make a lot of,

347
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:25,054
like, little decisions that stack.

348
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,734
over a very long period of time.

349
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:36,279
And we said, well, the essence of our game is that it's a bit more wargaming.

350
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,101
So we didn't want to have that intricacy

351
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:42,542
and we didn't want to have too much micromanagement into the city.

352
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:47,505
So we started to look into a system where you could upgrade cities

353
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:51,647
and expand in a more sort of like broader strokes

354
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:53,568
and make very large decisions.

355
00:25:55,827 --> 00:26:03,474
So we thought into dividing the world up into sectors and cities expand by claiming new territories.

356
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:12,722
That sort of thing led to another, you could easily like on paper, sort of see that such a sector system would have like big ramifications for diplomacy.

357
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:21,590
So if you, you know, build up the world into these sectors, you can trade them, you can sort of plant a flag and this one is mine.

358
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,591
Instead of having a.

359
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:25,448
You know, like everything that's just done on a hex level.

360
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:31,529
So that's, um, that's, that's when the thing started rolling on the, on the world map game.

361
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:36,630
But it, it, it took a lot of iteration as well as to like how you upgrade all these

362
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,911
sectors, how you attach them to your main colony.

363
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:42,492
Uh, that took a lot of time and a lot of iteration.

364
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:46,913
Uh, but, uh, eventually we, uh, we saw, yeah, this, this really works.

365
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:48,953
And, uh, we hope that the people will.

366
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:56,745
will like this, although it's something entirely new for our series and I think also in the

367
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:57,525
genre as a whole.

368
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:02,308
So yeah, that sort of innovation isn't easy.

369
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:06,470
It's always easier to say, like, OK, let's take a look at how has another game done this

370
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:12,213
before and trying to do something different is always painful.

371
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,392
Right on, uh, don't mind me over here, I'm just trying to figure out...

372
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:19,413
I got a lot to juggle on my plate.

373
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,894
Alyssa, can I toss the question ball your way?

374
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:27,417
It's kind of enjoyable to watch you try to like, uh, talk and make complex decisions at the same time though.

375
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:30,238
Um...

376
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,092
This is a little more in the wheezy about strategy games that I don't understand.

377
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:41,015
Might not, might be a little over my head, but uh Satya in chat wants to know while we're talking

378
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:46,758
about play styles are there any plans to enable tall play styles? I'm not sure, that's lingo I'm

379
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,920
not familiar with there, so I don't know if you can talk around different play style implementation

380
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,143
there. Yeah going wide or tall is a strategy saying whether you're sort of like specialized

381
00:27:56,183 --> 00:28:01,246
like one city and build it up as big as you can.

382
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:08,894
Another one is wider by spreading yourself thin and claiming a lot of territory, for example.

383
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,294
That's the difference.

384
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:23,258
Currently our city upgrade tree is sort of capped with the number of provinces that you can attach to a colony,

385
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:24,498
the number of upgrades that you can build.

386
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,301
And obviously we're looking into expanding the game in the future.

387
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:32,562
A lot of these type of games, they are in development for years on their initial launch.

388
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:39,484
Adding additional options for city upgrades is absolutely something that we'll be looking into.

389
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:44,186
But first we need to digest and see how people are playing, what are people's wishes.

390
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:50,648
And getting very solid feedback from the community saying,

391
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:52,709
we'd like to have deeper city management.

392
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,654
It's something that we can do something with.

393
00:28:57,074 --> 00:28:58,455
And yeah.

394
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,577
I guess like one week now out from launch,

395
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:03,439
how has that initial feedback been?

396
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,080
How is the reception for the features

397
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,641
you have gone over so far?

398
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,903
I think overall very positive.

399
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:16,247
We are at around 80% positive user reviews.

400
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,108
I mean, there's some people.

401
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:20,439
Of course, if you compare it to Age of Enders 3,

402
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,480
and they miss a particular feature from that game,

403
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,001
then we'll say, like, we wish you would have this in this game as well,

404
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:31,842
or some people think that you might have strayed too far or not far enough.

405
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:36,483
It's a fine line that you need to walk.

406
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:41,644
But overall we are happy with the reception and we look at all feedback.

407
00:29:41,664 --> 00:29:46,325
Doesn't matter if it's just constructive or people aren't.

408
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:47,175
really

409
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:47,696
scary stuff.

410
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:16,858
I guess even going into like, I have on my notes here, I have 20 years like circled and underlined.

411
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:21,998
That's a long time for a studio to be making games and also for one particular series to keep going.

412
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:27,959
And especially with as much like the IP changes you've made this time around too.

413
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,021
And I guess how did you guys kind of, how did that conversation go over like, hey, what if we do like a slight reboot?

414
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:34,821
What if we go to space?

415
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:39,962
Like, how did you kind of worm your dev team into that idea as well as like warming the community up to it?

416
00:30:42,144 --> 00:30:47,007
Yeah, for the dev team, that's of course, you know, the dev team exists out of many individuals.

417
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:52,329
Some people have, you know, like hopes, maybe, you know, some of them want to go back to

418
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:54,170
like an Overlord style game.

419
00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:00,453
Others might want to try another genre and others say like, okay, we've invested so much

420
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:07,416
in this engine, this tool set and the experience from our people that it would be crazy to

421
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:11,294
to try and swap everything around.

422
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:14,415
I can tell you that when you make a drastic shift in genres,

423
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:18,977
going from 4X strategy to action RPGs and back,

424
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,978
it's not the wisest business decision that you can make.

425
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:29,360
It's fun, of course, but it's a very different type of game.

426
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,822
But it's not good for your sanity, on the other hand.

427
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:43,337
It's a process that you can, it's part of that, it's just a business decision.

428
00:31:44,017 --> 00:31:49,080
And another one is a decision of like, how do we play to our strength without keeping

429
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,082
things, you know, and keep things interesting for everybody.

430
00:31:54,102 --> 00:31:56,744
It's always very important for us.

431
00:31:56,964 --> 00:31:59,545
What do, you know.

432
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:05,075
us as a team. What's the level of buy-in for a particular project? We wouldn't want to make

433
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:08,738
a project where people say like, ah, this is really not my thing and I'm going to quit my job.

434
00:32:08,858 --> 00:32:11,380
Yeah, that's a, we'd be very bad. Yeah.

435
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:16,669
Let's see, uh, ooh, we got a good question from chat.

436
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:21,872
Uh, Winsley, I would like to know, uh, why sectors show the resource that can be exploited

437
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:23,913
instead of icons for the climate and terrain?

438
00:32:24,854 --> 00:32:30,877
Um, or, uh, they are concerned that players are confused when they see the icons on each

439
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:31,398
new sector.

440
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:36,280
Um, I kind of have no opinion about if it's confusing or not myself, because when I look

441
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,403
at a new sector, I'm looking at, say, this sector right here, I just see the world ceiling

442
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:42,304
and I'm like, oh, that's a really good name for a place.

443
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:54,373
When you click on it you see a couple of icons which indicate the resource potential of a sector, how it can be upgraded.

444
00:32:55,774 --> 00:33:00,616
It doesn't list the output, but it actually lists this particular section.

445
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:07,418
I've got a very small screen because I'm in Research, Production and 2 Energy.

446
00:33:07,478 --> 00:33:13,740
That one could be upgraded as an energy exportation and then you build energy stuff in order to...

447
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,326
use the natural occurring stuff.

448
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:20,789
So we basically took that, what is it?

449
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,872
That step that translates resource type

450
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,175
into what sort of resource,

451
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:31,378
so the client type or overlay type into resource out of it.

452
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:33,760
So people could immediately see, oh, this is energy

453
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,882
and I'm gonna choose my energy upgrade here.

454
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:39,384
Right on.

455
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:42,267
Let's see.

456
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:48,538
I was going to ask about, you touched briefly on porting this over to consoles,

457
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:51,740
which is a series first for you guys for this particular series.

458
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:57,765
And can you talk about maybe some of the UI changes and decisions that were made to kind

459
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:01,909
of make it more readable on consoles, or so it would work both on PCs and consoles equally,

460
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:04,351
without negatively affecting the other, I guess?

461
00:34:07,193 --> 00:34:10,456
So one of the first things that we did was

462
00:34:11,537 --> 00:34:12,017
basically

463
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:20,159
We took a look at all of the interfaces and which ones could be sort of like be the same

464
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:27,362
with slight modifications like swapping yes no buttons with A and B buttons or whatever.

465
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:35,625
And then interfaces which needed to have like a radical difference like adding a radial menu

466
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:37,245
as an example.

467
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:42,364
Then we started to look at readability and one of the things that we added was interface scaling.

468
00:34:42,524 --> 00:34:49,030
So you could scale the interface up and down relatively to how far you were from the screen

469
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:56,476
or your screen size. So that was another must-have in order for the conversion to start.

470
00:34:57,297 --> 00:35:01,260
And of course, it also benefits PC if you're playing on a small laptop screen versus a very

471
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,444
nice large 30-inch monitor. So that's another one.

472
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:19,544
One of the principles that we applied was that we wanted to make the people move the

473
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:22,605
map as little as possible manually.

474
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:28,908
So people would use the event list in order to take them to all key actions that needed

475
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:29,509
their attention.

476
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:36,212
So you don't need to order a sensor on it, you just select a new destination.

477
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,981
Research is ready, we just got taken to the interface, you can very quickly cycle through

478
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:49,123
these screens without having to do many manual mouse pointery things basically.

479
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:58,986
So those are a couple of the principles that we applied. Another thing is like in combat

480
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:04,367
you select units but then immediately you see highlighted which armies it can hit from a

481
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:05,367
particular location.

482
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:10,928
just to avoid the large number of manual movements.

483
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:17,733
And of course, consistency with other games, like, of course,

484
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,936
you have like mouse and keyboard conventions, you know, when you

485
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:27,281
scroll the map, you have WASD and left click to select, right

486
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:29,182
click to move, which is sort of like an RTS thing.

487
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:34,226
Same for console, you know, you try to use conventions.

488
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:37,689
You know, use the D-pad and the shoulders for the right type of stuff.

489
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:45,092
It's always interesting to hear how bringing a game to a new platform

490
00:36:45,232 --> 00:36:50,155
will result in these changes that actually benefit the entire thing as a whole

491
00:36:50,195 --> 00:36:51,535
and not just that new platform.

492
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:57,518
Oh yeah, I mean, I think there's been a tremendous benefit to the PC users as well.

493
00:36:57,998 --> 00:37:00,519
The amount of QA that we put into this game is massive.

494
00:37:03,198 --> 00:37:05,599
PC players would like to play using controller.

495
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:14,585
If they use a Steam Box or they just like sitting hanging on the couch.

496
00:37:15,726 --> 00:37:18,848
So we have that option available for PC players too.

497
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:22,771
The interface scaling is available for PC.

498
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:28,715
Right on, I'm diving into the turn-based kind of X-Commy combat right now.

499
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:33,900
One thing, I guess one thing that jumps to mind is that games like X, games that are

500
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:40,345
dedicated to sort of the turn-based tactical like this are often focused on, there's a

501
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:45,210
lot of fog of war concepts, like where is your enemy and how is this, but this game

502
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,872
is pretty, like these battles start out pretty out in the open and you're able to make...

503
00:37:48,492 --> 00:37:51,835
You're able to plan two or three steps ahead much easier than you are in those games.

504
00:37:52,155 --> 00:37:57,839
Could you sort of talk about your process for designing these sections of the game

505
00:37:57,879 --> 00:38:06,384
and really how you're able to balance it while still trying to make an overall overarching 4X game that still works?

506
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:11,408
Cool, yeah. So, one of the first starting points is that we create a war.

507
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:17,031
We don't create a skirmish between hero characters that you want to keep alive.

508
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:23,277
Of course, you obviously want to keep as much units alive as you can, but the combats tend

509
00:38:23,297 --> 00:38:26,360
to be a lot more lethal in a game like this.

510
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:32,404
We want them to be over quicker.

511
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:37,849
Our combats can involve a large number of units, not just infantry types, but also tanks

512
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:39,890
and aircraft and whatnot.

513
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,653
So the battles need to be, although superficially, might be a lot more lethal.

514
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:52,424
sort of looks the same, you've got some cover... you've got your overwatch, you've got grenades

515
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:59,470
and all that type of stuff, but generally they play faster and they're more deadly.

516
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:05,555
And that's why, for example, Fog of War doesn't really fit in that thing, because that would

517
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,457
really prolong the typical battle.

518
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:15,816
Although in earlier Age of Wonders games we did have single player dungeons, or PvE dungeons basically,

519
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:20,099
which had sort of a cover of darkness, which you needed to, sort of Diablo style,

520
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:25,824
you needed to go in and explore and find the baddies before you could close them.

521
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:27,845
Maybe we'll go back to that one day.

522
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:29,366
Right on.

523
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:35,491
Going to chat, TheCraftyDog has dropped by and is really impressed with the game.

524
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:38,653
They are asking about a possible Nintendo Switch port.

525
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:43,957
We sort of, we try not to, there's sort of, if a feature's not announced it's a little

526
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:46,078
hard to ask about from a dev perspective on this channel.

527
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:49,741
But I guess, you know, Leonard, the Nintendo Switch is out.

528
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:52,983
It's a new thing that people, even Paradox is shipping games on.

529
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:53,884
Yeah.

530
00:39:53,944 --> 00:39:57,506
Because they've got John Romero's game, Empire of Sin, coming out on Nintendo Switch.

531
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:01,708
Do you have a Switch? Are you enjoying the platform?

532
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:06,470
Yeah, I have a Switch. I play games myself, but also with my son.

533
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,413
So we play all the Nintendo titles.

534
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:14,234
We've got the Mario Rabbids game.

535
00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:19,216
It's like an XCOM Lite type of deal.

536
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:20,817
That game is so weird. It's great.

537
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,357
That game is so wild.

538
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:25,359
The XCOM devs were saying it's influencing how they make their next game

539
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:27,540
and the movement system in that game is really good.

540
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,127
So we see soldiers jumping on top of each other.

541
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:37,249
I'm curious, what do you think about developing for the Switch?

542
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:42,831
What do you think has to happen for your studio to be able to tackle that challenge?

543
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:52,034
First of course there is the overall business proposition.

544
00:40:52,114 --> 00:40:54,075
It makes sense, the cost versus the benefit.

545
00:40:56,668 --> 00:41:00,569
And in terms of cost, our game is quite demanding.

546
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:09,531
Of course, they can make the Witcher on Switch, but one of the key things is what's in our

547
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,992
game is the AIs would take a lot of time.

548
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:14,692
So CPU load.

549
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:21,634
So when you see one of these battles here, they can take up to half an hour or so to

550
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:23,294
play out a typical battle, or 50 minutes.

551
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:27,475
But the AI fights these battles as well.

552
00:41:28,895 --> 00:41:37,359
You know, when it's an AI turn and they take over a city of independents, or a little bit of loot that they capture.

553
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:45,863
The AI actually plays this entire battle using the exact same battle map.

554
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:51,326
With all of the abilities and everything, just in a fraction of a second.

555
00:41:52,946 --> 00:41:58,048
in hundreds of seconds actually, if you've got a fast CPU.

556
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:03,210
So, and a lot of these battles can spawn during a turn.

557
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:08,473
And we already have had to make optimizations

558
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,333
for lower spec CPU machines,

559
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:13,075
like lower spec laptops, for example,

560
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:15,436
to keep the speed up.

561
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,737
Well, the switches of course,

562
00:42:19,757 --> 00:42:29,039
In architecture, a handheld device, and the question whether or not we could get everything

563
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,480
like that on the Switch, that's one of the first questions we need to look at.

564
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:39,022
So ensuring that the CPU load would be manageable.

565
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:43,163
But the Switch is a beautiful machine, fast machine, maybe it works, but I can't answer

566
00:42:43,183 --> 00:42:43,263
that.

567
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:56,665
Of course, yeah. But it is interesting to know that the challenges aren't just, say, graphical or getting things running, but allowing the AI to properly do what it needs to do in the background and run simulations like this.

568
00:42:57,266 --> 00:43:12,599
And there's practical things as well, like screen size. If you play it undocked and just go on the screen, we might want to change some interfaces in order to make them clearer when seen on such a small screen.

569
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:19,185
That's a good point.

570
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:26,490
We are coming up at the end of our hour here as I try to make my way through

571
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,191
this battle, which he said he can take up to half an hours.

572
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,273
This might be, we might still be playing this battle by the time we're

573
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:32,113
over given the way I play games.

574
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:32,513
Oh, burning ground.

575
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:32,873
That's not good.

576
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:33,034
Okay.

577
00:43:33,054 --> 00:43:34,354
I think we should website Live Stream and I was like, all right,

578
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:35,555
you may be able to toggle that but come here, type in live.

579
00:43:35,595 --> 00:43:36,035
Hey, Shi def something,

580
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:41,261
If you've got questions for Leonard, we are still happy to ask them.

581
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:45,245
Leonard, I guess here's something interesting.

582
00:43:46,526 --> 00:43:50,951
We're talking, we're playing a turn-based, you know, like, tactical...

583
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:52,713
This is a tactical encounter.

584
00:43:55,535 --> 00:44:01,259
When you're playing Fire Emblem or XCOM, the percentage chance to hit is very important

585
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,322
because it sort of tells you whether it's a good idea to try this maneuver or not.

586
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:10,966
I'm still figuring out, in XCOM, you can have a 92% chance to hit and those misses feel

587
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:11,686
really sour.

588
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:14,368
In Fire Emblem, you can have a 92% chance to hit and...

589
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:22,674
Those misses don't really come like 92% fire emblem sort of means 100% like how do you accurately communicate to the player?

590
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:26,217
What that sort of means

591
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:29,720
What different hit chances mean? Yeah in a game like this?

592
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:33,923
Yeah, yeah, so we we don't really skew the numbers

593
00:44:34,764 --> 00:44:41,329
Maybe some games do I don't know so when you have C 90 92 percent is actually 100% Yeah

594
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:42,530
So we don't

595
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,972
We actually have a very clear rule and that is that

596
00:44:47,095 --> 00:44:48,995
Basically whenever you have a...

597
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:53,457
There's always a 25% chance to grace, and that starts over 100%.

598
00:44:53,737 --> 00:45:01,200
So if you have a 75% chance to hit, that basically means that you will always hit or grace.

599
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,241
So the 25% will be grace.

600
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:09,804
And then if you go lower than 75%, that's when the miss chances start to come in.

601
00:45:09,824 --> 00:45:12,245
So if you go to 70%, there's a 5% chance to miss.

602
00:45:14,817 --> 00:45:19,481
So you don't have the extremes that you have a 90% chance to hit or a 95% chance to miss

603
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:20,962
and you will totally miss the shot.

604
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:23,264
You will always do some damage.

605
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,187
That's how we solved it.

606
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:35,235
And of course, one other thing is that a lot of our units, especially when carrying assault

607
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:38,017
rifles and stuff, they fire multiple shots.

608
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:41,560
The number of shots depends on how far you move.

609
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,381
So if you stay in the green area for this unit.

610
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:47,068
A single shot unit.

611
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:53,694
But if that was a Marine or Trooper, you could have three shots when you stay in the green

612
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:53,994
area.

613
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:58,418
And that of course spreads out the damage more.

614
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:00,900
Right on.

615
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,684
I'm about to do my favorite thing in any science fiction game, which is drop a laser on someone's

616
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:05,864
head.

617
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:07,666
Alright.

618
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:08,306
Woo!

619
00:46:08,346 --> 00:46:08,446
Yeah.

620
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,128
I love doing that.

621
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:11,969
Yeah.

622
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:13,290
I love doing that.

623
00:46:15,345 --> 00:46:15,828
When's live?

624
00:46:15,848 --> 00:46:16,452
Hey guys.

625
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:17,216
Sorry.

626
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,632
I would like to know, are there any plans to get the AI to approach auto-combat carefully?

627
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:27,416
12 vs 4 quote-unquote should never result in a lost unit.

628
00:46:27,476 --> 00:46:31,579
I don't know if that's necessarily true from a how armies work perspective.

629
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,582
If you send 12 people in to fight 4, one of those people might get just totally wasted.

630
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:38,604
So from a game field perspective, I certainly think it's fine.

631
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:40,445
But I don't know, they're curious.

632
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:44,748
They would like to know if auto-battles, which I was using to get through most of the streams

633
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:46,009
we could keep on the top.

634
00:46:46,795 --> 00:46:47,636
Sort of the top layer.

635
00:46:48,877 --> 00:46:51,519
How do you feel you did with those? Do you think they're accurate?

636
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:56,603
Do you think it's okay for if you're overwhelmingly abusing the enemy's forces

637
00:46:56,623 --> 00:47:00,566
if you go auto battle to have to sacrifice a unit to speed up time?

638
00:47:00,586 --> 00:47:02,968
Because when you're in here you can make optimal decisions, obviously.

639
00:47:04,229 --> 00:47:07,252
Yeah, I mean, it's up to you if you want to take the risk.

640
00:47:07,332 --> 00:47:11,295
I mean, we gave some sort of prediction how the battle will end up.

641
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,056
I mean, it's purely...

642
00:47:15,687 --> 00:47:22,950
a value comparison, so it's not necessarily how well a particular stack of units is kitted

643
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,410
out to kill another stack.

644
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,912
It's just purely the value that these do, so that gives an indication.

645
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:36,875
But yeah, some people can't stand a loss, and we're looking into maybe for a future

646
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,736
update, and I can't really promise that yet, but we're looking into ways like if you press

647
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:42,537
auto and you don't like the results.

648
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:47,161
You can go back to manual, so you'll have an option to retry.

649
00:48:05,348 --> 00:48:10,571
You guys just shipped this game, we were talking before the stream, you're tossing your own update ideas.

650
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:15,913
Lots of other games have begun to adapt, everything from, you know, quote-unquote events,

651
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:20,915
where, you know, Apex Legends is having an event right now, obviously that's an always-live multiplayer game,

652
00:48:21,295 --> 00:48:25,677
but then there's Paradox's really good DLC model, where they sell individual DLC packs.

653
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:31,239
How have you thought, as a studio leader, even though obviously you've got Paradox sitting there,

654
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,260
coddling you in their great big publisher arms...

655
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:35,941
Sitting off screen.

656
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:02,544
keeping games afloat and keeping players interested.

657
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:07,567
What do you think is sort of the way strategy games can approach existing in a live games world?

658
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:14,030
Yeah, well, live games for us means interacting with the community, getting feedback and listening

659
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:19,933
to them and dropping new features both as free updates and as premium content. And

660
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:27,877
premium content, I mean, you know, not microtransactions. We prefer substantial updates.

661
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:34,985
We will make some new outfits for commanders, for example.

662
00:49:35,646 --> 00:49:43,109
But anything we do is all about improving the game for as many people and for as long as we can.

663
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:48,512
Like you say, making a game like this sort of a free-to-play...

664
00:49:56,673 --> 00:50:01,976
experience people have tried that with strategy games but none of us have succeeded in doing

665
00:50:02,016 --> 00:50:06,579
that unless you talk if you unless you consider something like class of clans a strategy game

666
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:12,362
i mean i do but not you know like it's not like it's different it's different yeah it's different

667
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:16,364
it's a it's a different type of strategy game there's just quite a few strategies

668
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:20,007
so i'm just going to relive my my x-wing night last night where i had to

669
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:24,429
basically even though i was ahead i had to give up a shot on it i may really need to get okay cool

670
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:25,090
yeah we're yeah

671
00:50:25,881 --> 00:50:31,643
Um, ba ba ba, um, oh, uh, Crafty Dog would like, would like, you know, this is just kind of a fun thing from chat.

672
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:37,004
They've pre-ordered, um, uh, top tier, uh, oh, geez, something got in the way.

673
00:50:37,224 --> 00:50:40,825
They, they bought the top tier when they pre-ordered and they're looking forward to what you are doing in the future.

674
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:44,006
In terms of the, uh, the expansions?

675
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:44,527
Yeah.

676
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,953
And Neoangelhelmet also says it's a wonderful game.

677
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:54,179
Um, uh, ooh! This is kind of a good question. They mentioned, you mentioned a, uh, the satellite

678
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:59,163
system that got cut, you know, kind of that atmosphere level. Um, uh, they would like to

679
00:50:59,183 --> 00:51:04,028
know what other kind of features got cut making this game. Uh, when you, like, what ideas were

680
00:51:04,088 --> 00:51:06,550
really good and, I don't know, like, that's something I'd like to know about too. Like,

681
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,312
what else did you have to cut to get this game out the door?

682
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:16,378
Which sounds grim, but it's always curious what good ideas this one is good.

683
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,544
Well, some ideas were cut and we might want to go back to, so I'm probably not going to talk about those.

684
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:29,028
Let's see. Well, we went through a couple of iterations of the sector system.

685
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:35,553
And one of them was that the actual colonists that you had in your colony were slotted into slots

686
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:37,154
that were actually living inside of the...

687
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:40,419
and inside of the sector.

688
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:44,202
So if you lost a particular sector,

689
00:51:44,222 --> 00:51:46,643
you could lose the colonists that were in that sector,

690
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:48,064
but it was quite a clumsy system.

691
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:51,046
So we decided to cut it.

692
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:56,169
Okay, I'm going-

693
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:57,790
I want, no, I want one.

694
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,171
You want one, you want one.

695
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:03,173
I want to, Mohammed Kapil in chat

696
00:52:03,213 --> 00:52:04,674
has a question that I wanted to ask earlier,

697
00:52:04,694 --> 00:52:05,935
but I forgot to follow up on.

698
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:13,525
They were asking about that AI system you said where two AI battles will just simulate the entire thing on the actual map.

699
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:26,469
What was the decision for doing a more resource heavy way of determining the outcome of the battle versus something like a statistical coin flip or something a lot less in depth but more light on the resources?

700
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:33,231
Yeah, we had such a system in the old Age of Wonders games because the computers weren't fast enough to do it.

701
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:38,146
But that led to all sorts of problems because you were basically creating two AIs which

702
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:41,788
had basically... because you weren't really simulating the battle, you were just like

703
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:43,068
subtracting army strength.

704
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:48,972
So you had like one particular unit which was immune to the effects of another type

705
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:51,313
of unit, but you couldn't really model that.

706
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:58,237
You know, so like when you played manually, you would get such very different results

707
00:52:58,357 --> 00:52:59,057
from a battle than...

708
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,126
when you played automatic.

709
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:04,508
And also you couldn't really go back and replay the battle

710
00:53:04,568 --> 00:53:06,509
and see the battle as it would unfold.

711
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:09,611
There was sort of a simulation without movements

712
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,392
that sort of approximated it.

713
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:15,895
But in the end, just totally simulating the battle,

714
00:53:15,915 --> 00:53:19,437
yeah, allows you to see a cool replace

715
00:53:19,718 --> 00:53:21,399
and immediately see how the AI did.

716
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:23,580
Maybe for a beginning player, learn the game

717
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:26,882
to see how the AI would move stuff.

718
00:53:27,523 --> 00:53:29,664
So basically you debug one thing.

719
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:32,757
And that's it, you don't have to work on two systems.

720
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:37,220
One of it is sort of an approximation, and the other is sort of the real AI.

721
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,221
So there's one AI that you write.

722
00:53:40,622 --> 00:53:43,564
So it stays true to the strategy genre versus just a numbers game.

723
00:53:45,085 --> 00:53:46,246
Yeah. That's interesting.

724
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,189
With that, I'm going to start wrapping things up.

725
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:52,230
Thank you, Alyssa, for jumping in with a good question.

726
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,391
That was actually good.

727
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:55,652
Thank you all for joining the GDC.

728
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:57,333
Thank you, Chad, for giving it to us.

729
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:02,478
I don't want to steal someone's good question. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You can wrap up now. Stop.

730
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,022
You can't see me. I'm glaring.

731
00:54:07,642 --> 00:54:08,343
Shaking your head.

732
00:54:08,363 --> 00:54:09,644
I'm just shaking my head.

733
00:54:09,764 --> 00:54:13,526
Alyssa, take... you asked it. You can take credit.

734
00:54:14,115 --> 00:54:15,215
It was worded in chat for... anyway.

735
00:54:15,235 --> 00:54:18,876
This is stuff we should not do live on camera. I'm sorry.

736
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:22,238
Anyway, thank you everyone in chat. You've been a great audience today.

737
00:54:22,298 --> 00:54:24,138
Thank you, Leonard, for dropping by.

738
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:26,259
Thank you all for watching the GDC Twitch channel.

739
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:30,141
This is a place where we talk to game developers about the making of their games,

740
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:35,743
how they get made, because that, sharing knowledge between game developers, is kind of our mission.

741
00:54:36,703 --> 00:54:42,208
Speaking of which, if you are at home and you are a game developer of any stripe or experience or background,

742
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,533
we would encourage you to check out the GDC call for submissions.

743
00:54:46,893 --> 00:54:49,296
The Core Concepts call for submissions closes tomorrow.

744
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:52,258
If you have a talk idea, if you're at home, if you're lurking out there,

745
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,101
I know some of you people are game devs,

746
00:54:56,422 --> 00:54:58,444
If you are the kind of person who has worked on a game

747
00:54:58,464 --> 00:54:59,364
and has something in the last year

748
00:54:59,384 --> 00:55:00,705
or something interesting to share about it,

749
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:02,186
we encourage you to submit a talk.

750
00:55:02,246 --> 00:55:03,687
If you do in the next 24 hours,

751
00:55:03,948 --> 00:55:05,869
it can go into the core concepts track.

752
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:09,792
We will be opening our summits, VRDC.

753
00:55:10,112 --> 00:55:13,154
No, it's all summits, but that includes our VR summit,

754
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:14,595
our narrative summit, our AI summit.

755
00:55:15,656 --> 00:55:25,543
Those call for submissions is going to open up later this month, so if you are a developer working on that kind of stuff, please submit a talk at the end of the month.

756
00:55:25,863 --> 00:55:30,106
If you're a VR or AR developer, join us in October for XRDC.

757
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:38,911
For more information on that, you can scroll down and check out GDCconf.com, which also you can use to get over to XRDC.

758
00:55:40,192 --> 00:55:46,316
If you're new to the channel, we would appreciate it if you clicked the follow button, because if you do, you'll get notifications when we go live.

759
00:55:46,336 --> 00:55:50,819
We're talking to a lot of developers, there's some really cool games out there that are coming out in the next few weeks.

760
00:55:50,919 --> 00:55:58,344
I wish I could confirm which ones we're getting, but I'm still working with some great PR folks to try and get those interviews to you.

761
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:04,654
But rest assured if you hit that follow button you will get a notification when we go live and when we go live we will

762
00:56:04,674 --> 00:56:08,219
Go live with someone who knows more about making games than we do and we know something

763
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,824
We know something about making games right Alyssa, you know about financials

764
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:13,701
Yeah, I have to write something.

765
00:56:13,821 --> 00:56:15,962
You have to write some financial slip. Yeah, exactly.

766
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:20,763
So we know something, but we just want you to talk to people who know more some things.

767
00:56:22,183 --> 00:56:28,204
With that, I'm going to resist the urge to just keep playing and just keep...

768
00:56:28,244 --> 00:56:31,005
Just one more turn, it's just scratching really hard right now.

769
00:56:31,705 --> 00:56:33,625
But I'm going to resist the urge to keep playing and sign off.

770
00:56:33,665 --> 00:56:34,585
Leonard, thank you so much.

771
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,346
Thank you for having me. Thanks, everybody, for your questions.

772
00:56:37,786 --> 00:56:38,406
Bye, folks.

773
00:56:39,006 --> 00:56:39,226
Bye.
