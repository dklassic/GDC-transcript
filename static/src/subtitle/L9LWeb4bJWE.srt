1
00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:08,197
One, two.

2
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:10,598
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,481
Everybody's sober from last night.

4
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,542
I see some tired faces, that's good.

5
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:22,444
So let me put you a little bit to sleep.

6
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,805
Listen to this relaxing music.

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,267
In your nightmares.

8
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:33,690
Hi, my name is Inan Zur.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,931
Welcome to my talk.

10
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:41,190
I have written here that I need to do an icebreaker.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:47,152
So here's my Donald Trump latest implementation.

12
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:52,414
This is a great and tremendous industry.

13
00:00:52,434 --> 00:01:01,078
Yeah, it's, and nobody, nobody is better than me

14
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,259
and this thing, and you guys are all fake composers.

15
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:06,757
But the rest of it is history.

16
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:09,398
So anyways, a little bit about myself.

17
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:12,559
I was born in Israel and raised in Israel.

18
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:15,099
Really liked music.

19
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,960
When I was 19, I recruited to the Israeli army

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,361
and I told them that I am a musician,

21
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,161
I am a composer.

22
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:33,637
Please, anywhere you put me, no loud noises and no dust and other things that could really

23
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:34,558
disrupt me.

24
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:41,403
Show the Israeli army with their famous sense of humor put me in the elite tank unit.

25
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:50,723
So basically, since then, four years later, I cannot hear a pitch higher than a cello.

26
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:57,548
And it's really interesting because, you know, like these people that are playing these silver sticks,

27
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,233
it's like, it's really great minds. I don't know what they're playing, but it's wonderful.

28
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:07,656
So I'm writing a lot of these things. I don't, you know, but anyways.

29
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,932
It's kind of like very interesting year for me this year

30
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:16,673
because I'm celebrating 20 years

31
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:19,275
of writing music for computer games.

32
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:23,357
My first computer games I wrote on 1997.

33
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,699
It was Klingon Academy.

34
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,581
And I'm really managed to survive, I think,

35
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:34,683
this harsh industry.

36
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:37,745
First, because I'm really good looking.

37
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,005
But other than this,

38
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:44,618
the competitive edge.

39
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:47,080
Like, I'm looking at each one of you.

40
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,503
I always look at them, it's like this guy probably, this guy

41
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:56,587
has to be much better than me. What can he come up with that I can't?

42
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:00,149
And this is basically what drives me. I love competition

43
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,692
and I always try to find something that will be

44
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:09,336
interesting and different. And first and foremost

45
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:10,276
you gotta love.

46
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:16,875
what you're doing. If you're not in love with what you're doing and if you're not in love

47
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:27,717
with the whole notion of writing music, then forget about it. It'll suck because this world

48
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:32,298
is full of disappointments and turn downs and

49
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:37,131
criticism, and a lot of harsh things.

50
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,373
And you know, every once in a while,

51
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:42,295
you get like, oh, that sounds great.

52
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,175
Oh, this is good.

53
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:47,518
But, Fallout main theme,

54
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,082
what you hear here is version 29.

55
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:58,026
So you could understand, I mean, this thing.

56
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:00,928
So let's start talking about it.

57
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,163
Originality and signature factor.

58
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:09,925
When we're basically talking about this thing,

59
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:15,487
we gotta really understand what is originality.

60
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:18,969
And I always would say to you one thing.

61
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,011
If you wanna be original, start with something

62
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:29,453
that is the less original thing you think about it, okay?

63
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,640
It has to be something that convey,

64
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:37,902
something that people know, that they recognize.

65
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:43,724
And only after that, insert just a little thing

66
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,585
that is different, okay?

67
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:50,187
After you did it and it's cool, repeat it.

68
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:54,648
Just repeat it a few times so it'll become the hook.

69
00:04:55,778 --> 00:05:02,622
If you manage to do this, your first layer will be something pretty known, pretty solid.

70
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:08,065
And on top of it, you did something that is a little different, then you got something

71
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,406
definitely going.

72
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:13,887
And I'll give you a little example.

73
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:15,568
All right.

74
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:18,230
Actually, I'm going to play you a cue now.

75
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,433
Nobody, seriously, except of myself and Mark Lampert,

76
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:29,357
the legendary Bethesda audio director, ever heard.

77
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,480
And this is the first cue ever to be written

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,602
for Fallout 4.

79
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,364
Never ended up on the game.

80
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,807
Nevertheless, it set up the tone

81
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,770
for the whole more action for the game.

82
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:06,739
You

83
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,149
And anyways, when I played this to Mark,

84
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,089
he said, what the hell is that?

85
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,052
And I said to him, well, this is me

86
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:46,695
playing, hitting my piano, scratching my guitar,

87
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,196
hitting, scratching, scratching, hitting,

88
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:52,738
taking some vase, bowing it, and doing all this stuff.

89
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:53,539
And he said, why?

90
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:59,322
And I said, because Fallout is all about alternate.

91
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:03,385
If you know Fallout, if this is reality,

92
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:05,327
This is another reality.

93
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:10,128
So basically, they probably think the same

94
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:14,249
but use different means to pronounce themselves

95
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:17,010
or to talk about or to do things

96
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,110
because it's a different reality.

97
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,091
So instead of drums, let's use piano.

98
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:26,152
Instead of whatever, I mean, any other,

99
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:29,293
like shaker, percussion, let's just hit on guitars.

100
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:31,533
Let's just throw in a junkyard.

101
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,614
And the way I did it is basically.

102
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:40,852
totally experimenting with my little Zoom instrument, like probably each one of you

103
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:47,196
have it and if you don't, please get it, because this is amazing, it's a $100 thing that it's

104
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:52,660
a lifesaver, because you're going about and then you could record anything and then you

105
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,522
turn it into your own sound machine.

106
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,443
And that basically brings me to this signature thing, okay?

107
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:58,364
And there you have it.

108
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:58,904
Thanks for watching.

109
00:07:58,924 --> 00:07:59,724
I'm Chris.

110
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:00,345
I'll talk to you soon.

111
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:00,445
Bye.

112
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:00,545
Bye.

113
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:00,625
Bye.

114
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:01,005
Bye.

115
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:01,125
Bye.

116
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:01,225
Bye.

117
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:01,306
Bye.

118
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:01,386
Bye.

119
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:01,466
Bye.

120
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:01,546
Bye.

121
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:01,626
Bye.

122
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:01,706
Bye.

123
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:01,806
Bye.

124
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:02,126
Bye.

125
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:02,246
Bye.

126
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:02,326
Bye.

127
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:02,406
Bye.

128
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:02,486
Bye.

129
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:02,566
Bye.

130
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:03,147
Bye.

131
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:03,267
Bye.

132
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:03,407
Bye.

133
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:03,487
Bye.

134
00:08:03,507 --> 00:08:03,627
Bye.

135
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:03,707
Bye.

136
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:13,080
the combination between something that you know and expect, in this case, rhythm and

137
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:21,602
rhythmical patterns, and then weird sounds that basically are not so common to hear.

138
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:29,165
This combination is a great start to create a signature touch.

139
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:31,585
Here's another little example.

140
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,226
I love cello.

141
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,465
I told you, I mean, this is the highest instrument I could hear.

142
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,388
So I really love cello.

143
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:43,391
But Fallout is such a lonely game.

144
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:46,814
You're wandering in the wilderness.

145
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:53,180
Okay, what could be better than play a cello with a fog horn?

146
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:57,852
I'll be back.

147
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:24,317
Thank you for watching!

148
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:56,389
And it's so cool because instead of using synth as my bottom pad, I use this fog horn.

149
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:03,632
And a little secret about it, Bethesda's not gonna be happy, but anyways, it's not only the fog horn.

150
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:10,350
I actually record myself also singing with my ugly voice with the fog horn.

151
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,492
So basically what you get, you create your own pad.

152
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:16,793
We all know what pad is.

153
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:18,633
If you're a composer, you put a pad.

154
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:19,194
Okay.

155
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:26,856
But what about if this pad could be something that somebody could recognize as something

156
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:29,037
that has nothing to do almost with music.

157
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:30,118
Okay.

158
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:31,838
It's a freaking fog horn.

159
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,894
Okay? But you use it as a musical pad.

160
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,675
With this you play the cello, there you go.

161
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:44,057
Okay, another thing is, it's a more musical term,

162
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:47,819
is actually introducing some rhythmical... ♪♪

163
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,863
Um, I'd say, uh, things that are not really clear.

164
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,104
Where is one here?

165
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,385
Where the hell is one here?

166
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:01,803
really great asset to have when you ship.

167
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:12,816
because a player and I'm sure most of you are playing games and you listen to

168
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:18,601
the music to me if you start doing this when you play a game it's not a good

169
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:25,067
thing at all because then you will start to recognize when the cue starts to loop

170
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,850
and after the third time you'll shut it down

171
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,762
Okay? But if you could just create something that is there, it's creating the tension,

172
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,803
but you don't really do this, or you don't know where it is.

173
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:43,024
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

174
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:49,846
You made something because it will keep you engaged, it will keep you interested in what you're doing.

175
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:52,167
Okay? Alright.

176
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,928
Just forget about everything I said so far.

177
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,128
You don't really need all this shit.

178
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:00,029
Sorry, I cannot swear.

179
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,329
All this thing.

180
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,970
Just look at Hollywood.

181
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,152
I think 80% or 70% of the music that is being written in Hollywood today

182
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:20,053
just bound, because of many considerations, to be what we call mainstream.

183
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:27,370
And mainstream is something that we'll expect and it will be there. It will do the job

184
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:30,793
But if you listen to it, it's not what we called

185
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:35,897
original because we heard it in some kind of versions before

186
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,859
but in games and

187
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:44,364
I must tell you and I'm really pride on our industry now jokes aside

188
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:50,428
People in games will always look for something different. They have more courage

189
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:59,728
And I am encouraging you and to encourage the audio director to go places.

190
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:03,129
All right. Just venture a little bit.

191
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,130
It will really make, you know, the whole thing stand out.

192
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:16,253
And we are pioneering today in many ways a lot in the music industry at large.

193
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:18,514
I'm serious about it. We are.

194
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:22,585
really doing a lot of pioneering and discovering,

195
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:25,186
sometimes more than movies,

196
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,708
because they have so many considerations,

197
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,450
and we could just open our wings and fly.

198
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:33,292
But, first we need to understand

199
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,855
that if we will do something more than 20% original,

200
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:39,015
forget it.

201
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,477
Nobody will listen to it,

202
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:44,459
because it will be just plain weird.

203
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,404
If we are able to get 80% something,

204
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:53,005
like let's take whatever, the cues that I played before.

205
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:58,507
Think about it, about 70 to 80% of the elements there

206
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,988
were not original.

207
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:05,189
It had rhythm, it had harmony, it had melody,

208
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,071
but it had a fog horn, it had a scratching chair.

209
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:13,212
It had something that was a little different.

210
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,786
Just this little thing is what's important.

211
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:21,327
And if you could find this thing and insert it

212
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:24,148
inside something that will be communicative,

213
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:27,089
then you got it.

214
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,630
By the way, it's a smaller room

215
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,851
and I really love conversation.

216
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:35,052
So if you really feel compelled to ask any question

217
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:37,293
during it, I'm not waiting for.

218
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,871
you know, the question session.

219
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:41,531
Just raise your hand and ask.

220
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,453
It's really important for me because I'm here to share a thing with you guys.

221
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:50,394
Okay, so let's go to work.

222
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:53,774
I got the gig.

223
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:58,236
I need to write the music for Fallout.

224
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,817
I need to learn and most importantly,

225
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,917
what do we want to say in the game.

226
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:06,498
What is the game all about?

227
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:12,898
Forget about originality, forget about all this music, forget about everything.

228
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,060
What is the actual game wants from me?

229
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,902
What do I want to tell the player?

230
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:22,344
That's the most important thing.

231
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:26,827
The rest of it, OK, I will deal with this.

232
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,669
But now I need really to learn.

233
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:34,892
And for that, I encourage each one of you, when you get a gig,

234
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:36,753
you go to the studio.

235
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:43,759
You really sit with the artist, you sit with the game designer, and you learn this thing.

236
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,759
I have a few people that I worked here before.

237
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,200
Andrew, for example, from Amazon.

238
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,101
He knows how many times I went down there and we worked together.

239
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:56,521
And other people here.

240
00:16:57,221 --> 00:17:01,242
It's just so important to learn about the game.

241
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:03,522
And only then you start.

242
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:04,543
Okay.

243
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:10,728
Fallout is a different animal altogether.

244
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:15,710
It's not that it's a post-apocalyptic world.

245
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,610
This is not what's important.

246
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:21,292
What's really important for me as a composer,

247
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:25,113
that it is a parallel reality.

248
00:17:26,194 --> 00:17:29,555
It's a reality that basically got conjured somehow

249
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,756
in the 50s, but right now we are in 2150.

250
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:37,305
So it had, whatever, 200 years to evolve.

251
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:40,467
So it's a parallel thing.

252
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:44,770
So everything I'm doing will be a little twisted,

253
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,492
a little out there.

254
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:53,176
It's going parallel to our reality,

255
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:54,797
but in a different way.

256
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,759
And it's all about choices.

257
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,161
The musical choice that you make should be based

258
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:07,000
on this premise that this is a parallel reality.

259
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,660
Okay?

260
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,701
So, let's hear some, you know, example.

261
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,781
Here, at Brightness Calling...

262
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:26,585
This is my vase in my living room.

263
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:29,685
And I'm basically...

264
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,007
playing it and bowing it

265
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:38,992
and record it and then layer some other stuff with it.

266
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:47,018
And basically you hear harmony

267
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,663
and you hear other elements

268
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:56,185
but you really can't tell

269
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:02,186
Is that a sin? Is that organic? Is that organic sin?

270
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,029
What the hell is it?

271
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:15,593
And this is sort of like the secret of the Fallout score.

272
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:20,276
That you create something that you definitely could connect with.

273
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:31,614
because it talks to you, but the way it's being created is just a little quirky, just a little different.

274
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:32,935
The elements are different.

275
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:43,163
I'm not using set libraries. I usually try to create my own libraries.

276
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:49,148
There are some companies like Umloud, for example, that helps you out.

277
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,262
manage the shit you're recording.

278
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,688
So, this is really helpful.

279
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:13,636
Now, in this one for example, using the orchestra.

280
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:19,601
I got the French horn Jews just to scream into their horns.

281
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:21,353
literally scream

282
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:26,515
and be banged on chairs.

283
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:34,038
So I did use traditional instruments

284
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,640
but in a little less traditional way

285
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,741
because when you play the horn

286
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,042
you have to also shout into it

287
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:48,484
and create some kind of like a different thing.

288
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:49,304
Let's try that again.

289
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:54,522
It's not about how you do it.

290
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:57,583
It's about your musical choices.

291
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,084
Today, everybody's doing crazy things,

292
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:05,925
but the choices you're making of how to use these things

293
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:15,388
is basically what create the special signature.

294
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:19,009
Or you could use untraditional instrument

295
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:20,549
in a traditional way.

296
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:31,447
And this is solo piano.

297
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:35,611
What you hear right now is only one instrument.

298
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:43,338
Everything I could take out of the piano,

299
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:49,444
basically, that is not playing the actual piano.

300
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,728
And it doesn't matter.

301
00:21:54,755 --> 00:22:01,960
how creative you get or how crazy. I don't care if you go to a cave in the Alps and play on a goat.

302
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:12,226
It, you know, it doesn't matter. What matters is that for the specific place in Fallout,

303
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:21,372
this piano craziness things really worked because the place there was some sort of like dilapidated

304
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:26,245
village with lots of metallic things.

305
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:29,506
So this is what worked for that.

306
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:33,909
I just didn't have it, so I created it.

307
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:38,251
And this is the thing, never just set back some time.

308
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:39,372
I don't have this sound.

309
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,293
You don't have this sound?

310
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:42,613
Create it.

311
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:43,454
Work.

312
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:45,495
For God's sake.

313
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:54,455
Okay, so, and here's another example.

314
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:58,036
Here, for example, I did the other way around.

315
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:05,938
This actually are tons of things.

316
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:10,320
If before we heard only one instrument,

317
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,341
this is about 20 instruments,

318
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:18,082
all played together and tried to do the same thing.

319
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:20,863
Again, in a non-traditional way.

320
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:32,827
So we have a guitar, we have a piano, we have a cello, we have an oil jack, we have a soundboard,

321
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:41,889
and other things, but they all try to basically mimic each other and really basically give you

322
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:47,331
the same element but each one in a different way. And this is what you get.

323
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:49,892
Again. Wow.

324
00:23:51,203 --> 00:23:51,904
That's because...

325
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:54,567
Ah, because I thought it's really clever.

326
00:23:55,308 --> 00:24:01,414
No, because I thought that this specific place in the game, it was really needed.

327
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:07,800
If I thought that a solo flute that I can't hear, well, is a good thing there,

328
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:09,762
then I would write a solo flute.

329
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:12,505
Again, it's about what the game wants to do.

330
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:27,570
All right, so basically, when we're choosing the palette,

331
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:30,351
and this is actually a really interesting thing,

332
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:38,274
we want to go and not listen to music at all.

333
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:40,294
And that's actually a really interesting thing

334
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,075
that I found really beneficial.

335
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:46,516
I sat with the audio director and told him,

336
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:50,798
what do you hear as far as the ambient?

337
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:53,204
Blame me the wind you hear.

338
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:55,907
It'll be a little different than a regular wind.

339
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:58,049
Blame me the thunders.

340
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,792
Blame me the animal calls.

341
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:02,854
Blame me everything.

342
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:04,395
Blame me the people.

343
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:06,117
How do you envision them?

344
00:25:06,597 --> 00:25:06,938
All right?

345
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:09,640
Only then, oops.

346
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:15,366
I think I crushed.

347
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:21,891
I'm good.

348
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:26,293
Only then we could get going.

349
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:34,096
After that, I started to try to mimic what he played me.

350
00:25:34,957 --> 00:25:39,179
And this is the first cue ever that actually found itself

351
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:44,921
inside Fallout.

352
00:25:45,582 --> 00:25:46,682
I tried to mimic.

353
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:54,264
A animal calls that he played me

354
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:58,230
With some wind and thunders

355
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:32,314
And this is only me trying to imitate a sound, pure sound design and sound effect that the

356
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:33,976
audio director gave me.

357
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:37,740
I didn't really try to create music.

358
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:43,045
I was thinking if we would kill all the sound effects.

359
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:53,269
and we'll play only that that could serve as some kind of your sound effect element

360
00:26:53,769 --> 00:27:06,053
and this is another way and it's very unique for Fallout

361
00:27:07,853 --> 00:27:08,713
by the way

362
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:17,831
This thing that he played that was basically some of the wolves that he played me

363
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:28,714
is a string quartet that I recorded in my studio, slowed them down about half tempo

364
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:36,737
and lowered them in one octave. And this is how it sounds. It sounded a little bit like a wolf to me.

365
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,871
It was really, really, really inspirational for me.

366
00:27:49,692 --> 00:27:51,513
Let's talk harmony a little bit.

367
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:02,015
Here I decided, okay, let's take piano.

368
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:16,431
Even when I'm using piano here, in its own sound,

369
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:23,975
I made sure that all the instruments behind the piano

370
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:28,877
are detuned, everything except of the piano.

371
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:32,999
And that's what created this mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo

372
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,921
kind of a thing, that you, you hear that?

373
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:38,782
Everything is detuned.

374
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:50,075
So when the piano plays its own regular harmony and everything is detuned, then you get this effect.

375
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:33,511
And here's another example of using only blowing instruments.

376
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:36,492
Didgeridoo and voice.

377
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:46,138
Do you see how many things you actually basically?

378
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:55,681
and how many tools but they're so simple you don't need to work hours and hours and hours of thinking

379
00:29:58,082 --> 00:30:08,307
but this is the singer Mimi Page singing along with myself blowing into a weird dj redo

380
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:15,350
um it doesn't really matter this is technical

381
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:25,502
But this music gives a certain feel that is so, so, so iconic to Fallout.

382
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:37,190
Because this combination between these instruments is what creates what we called the Fallout signature.

383
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:59,469
By the way, for this kind of weirdness I really recommend Valhalla.

384
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,551
You know, Valhalla is...

385
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:11,113
great plugin, gives you this huge reverb and I'm using it a lot when it comes to

386
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:15,818
these kind of things, so just a little technical thing. If you've noticed I

387
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:17,940
didn't get too much into technical

388
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:25,347
descriptions. I'm more into the content but even more

389
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:29,254
I'm more into the concept.

390
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,775
Each one of you has his or her own voice.

391
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:36,475
And the way you're gonna get it,

392
00:31:36,815 --> 00:31:38,556
I'm sure that there is a way.

393
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:42,196
But remember, as long as you're not being captured

394
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:46,977
and be pressured by, oh, I need to be clever.

395
00:31:46,997 --> 00:31:50,438
I need to find some kind of a thing that nobody ever found.

396
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,098
No, it's not about that.

397
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,639
It's about what you hear.

398
00:31:56,946 --> 00:32:01,987
As far as what works best for the game and then try to bring it to life

399
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:06,048
These things works great for fallout. So I did it

400
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:11,089
If I had to do a live orchestra for it, I would do live orchestra

401
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:14,209
It's not about

402
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,930
How sophisticated we are?

403
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,950
Is about how?

404
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,751
Committed we are to create what we believe can be the ultimate

405
00:32:26,602 --> 00:32:29,904
signature sound for the game.

406
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:35,828
Now let's get funny a little bit.

407
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,790
And I'll give you some secrets.

408
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:44,213
Not real secrets, but it's so primitive.

409
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:45,434
Really is.

410
00:32:47,495 --> 00:32:47,876
Okay.

411
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:52,258
I give you the Fallout Ensemble.

412
00:32:58,114 --> 00:32:59,415
Yeah, no joking.

413
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:02,517
And not only that, I prepared for you a little treat.

414
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:06,419
Again, nobody ever, I was not allowed up until today

415
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:13,463
to play it because Bethesda and rightfully so

416
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:19,787
are very, very protective on what we're allowed to say

417
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:21,608
and what we're not allowed to say.

418
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:26,871
So this is just the tip of the iceberg of things.

419
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:33,955
Alright. Raw material. Here is me playing bowed guitar.

420
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,284
If you didn't go to the dentist yesterday, then maybe tomorrow.

421
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:53,889
Here's another one.

422
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:01,264
Even I can hear that.

423
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:03,767
But here is this in a queue.

424
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:16,161
Here it is.

425
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:18,463
This is the bow guitar.

426
00:34:18,744 --> 00:34:19,945
And here is the other one.

427
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:47,410
And here's the thing, it's ugly, it's raw, but it's freaking fitting to what I want to say.

428
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:59,076
The rawness, the stupidness, the primitiveness of it is exactly what I wanted to say and thought.

429
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:05,565
And I didn't want to take a professional player.

430
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:07,546
If I wanted, I would take.

431
00:35:09,987 --> 00:35:12,948
Okay, but it's not what I wanted to say.

432
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:14,189
Here's another example.

433
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,771
Yes, this is me.

434
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:22,492
Singing into a ditch.

435
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:34,693
These sounds never heard before for live audience.

436
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:47,856
Monday morning.

437
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:48,956
In a queue.

438
00:35:52,937 --> 00:35:53,997
Remember what I told you?

439
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:56,198
Element

440
00:35:57,418 --> 00:35:57,958
like harp.

441
00:35:58,278 --> 00:35:58,858
Everybody knows.

442
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,342
get we get like synth pad we all know about it

443
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,190
and here's our friend

444
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:37,359
Spirit?

445
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:48,002
It's just sitting there and you don't know what exactly it is.

446
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:51,022
Because it's stupid.

447
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:53,063
But it works!

448
00:36:57,888 --> 00:36:58,129
Sorry.

449
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,413
Here's my famous...

450
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:06,573
You see this...

451
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:06,854
Thing?

452
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:08,254
I call her Uka.

453
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:36,187
in queue.

454
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:21,860
And again, the reason is this Ocarina was what I thought about when he played me the

455
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,660
Howling Wind.

456
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,656
It's not because I had a new career.

457
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:29,117
Well, actually, yeah, also because this is what I have.

458
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:34,018
But also, it was holy enough for me.

459
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,359
So what the hell, let's stick it in there.

460
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:38,880
And it just worked.

461
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:55,923
Harmony is so simple. Nothing, no, doesn't get any clever. Remember, always keep the 80% premise of

462
00:38:56,724 --> 00:39:08,309
known and acceptable and touchable concept that you could relate to and then give it to them.

463
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:12,451
How about percussions?

464
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:28,163
Somebody pissed me off.

465
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:28,403
But...

466
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:30,245
In cue.

467
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:10,001
Again, nothing sophisticated about the actual rhythmical pattern, nothing sophisticated

468
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:14,044
about the tempo, nothing sophisticated at all.

469
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:18,588
Still, you're using different elements for that.

470
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:29,455
And why? Not because we really want to outsmart somebody.

471
00:40:29,515 --> 00:40:30,896
This is not the purpose.

472
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:35,558
The purpose is, well, that a parallel reality,

473
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:40,460
these guys probably didn't have drums, didn't have anything like these things.

474
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,700
They had junkyard.

475
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,042
So probably that's what their, whatever, ensemble sounded like.

476
00:40:59,782 --> 00:41:01,043
Here's another little secret.

477
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,684
The low, we don't have, I think,

478
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:07,104
maybe we have a subwoofer here.

479
00:41:07,585 --> 00:41:10,745
Okay, so really, really cool from time to time

480
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:16,147
to have like a really low sub bass thing, okay?

481
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:20,088
And I tried to create it out of things

482
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:24,290
that I have in my studio rather than really go

483
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,551
and make like a synthetic sound or using whatever.

484
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,163
808 drum machine thing. Okay. The first thing is actually interesting. I don't think even if you could hear it, but

485
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:41,386
This is

486
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:45,309
Knocking with your finger on a bass trap

487
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:49,771
if you do it and then you amplify it and

488
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:55,129
This shit has so many loads you cannot even imagine.

489
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:56,949
It's crazy.

490
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:59,790
Some of it you just feel in your stomach.

491
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,690
And you don't really need to hit it hard.

492
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,731
Just do this.

493
00:42:05,311 --> 00:42:10,072
After sampling it and putting it as your oomph bass drum,

494
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:12,593
believe me, it's really effective.

495
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:15,433
But it's different.

496
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:19,714
Found oil jug that really.

497
00:42:20,677 --> 00:42:23,938
amazing has so many things in it. Listen to this.

498
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,180
That's a half full oil,

499
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,522
jag plastic that you hit with your finger

500
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:40,484
and it has so, so many lows, really. I mean,

501
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:45,165
and again in your soundscape, sometimes,

502
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:47,126
especially in the battles and stuff,

503
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:50,187
you really want to find something to support the whole thing.

504
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:51,533
Same thing.

505
00:42:52,193 --> 00:42:54,434
If we're talking alternate reality,

506
00:42:54,955 --> 00:42:58,517
we want to find an alternative instrument.

507
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:02,399
And basically, that's the whole thing, you know?

508
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:10,604
So here's basically, to sum it up a little bit,

509
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:14,607
because I want to give as much time as I can for questions.

510
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:15,507
I'm sure that there are a few.

511
00:43:19,868 --> 00:43:25,491
The most important thing to remember, and I know I'm repeating myself here, but it's

512
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:31,635
so important, and I feel that this is why I'm here to tell you, and I believe also

513
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:40,101
that this is what really helped me also survive these 20 years, is understand that you are

514
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:42,242
a part of a team.

515
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:45,004
You're not a composer.

516
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:46,685
You're a team player.

517
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:47,625
Okay?

518
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:51,010
I know that you have a lot of aspiration.

519
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:55,133
I know that you have a lot of great musical ideas.

520
00:43:56,154 --> 00:43:57,075
Forget about it.

521
00:43:57,895 --> 00:44:01,578
Come to the project as a blank page.

522
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:11,445
Soak in the project and let it basically inspire you before you try to inspire the project

523
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:12,346
with your ideas.

524
00:44:13,807 --> 00:44:14,367
Only then...

525
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:23,083
you could actually sort of like get the most immersive sound design and music into a project.

526
00:44:24,004 --> 00:44:30,309
If you don't force yourself into the project, if you don't really feel committed to say

527
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:36,854
what the project wants to say, you know, then just forget it.

528
00:44:37,395 --> 00:44:41,618
You could create a masterpiece musical, but it really will never...

529
00:44:42,491 --> 00:44:45,072
be as immersive as it could be.

530
00:44:45,692 --> 00:44:51,314
Music in games doesn't really need to be heard.

531
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:54,696
You don't hear a music in game,

532
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,337
you feel the music in the game.

533
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,698
You don't need to notice the music in the game,

534
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,919
you need to live the music in the game.

535
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,280
The music is basically something that drives you

536
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:10,402
without you really know what drives you.

537
00:45:11,688 --> 00:45:17,132
It's there, but it's in your imagination.

538
00:45:19,113 --> 00:45:20,694
And if you remember that,

539
00:45:22,315 --> 00:45:25,437
then it's really gonna help you

540
00:45:25,477 --> 00:45:28,639
to create successful scores.

541
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:33,783
I remember I just created a soundtrack,

542
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:38,826
my first VR game for Eagle Flight for Ubisoft.

543
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:45,095
And I was talking to Marty O'Donnell, you probably know who Marty is, he's like the famous Halo composer.

544
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:50,881
And I asked him like, so Marty, what do you think, you're really into VR,

545
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:56,747
what do you think, how the music should sound in a VR, because like it's everything, it's all around.

546
00:45:57,608 --> 00:46:01,712
And then he told me something that, and I was like, yeah, baby, this is it.

547
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:02,513
It's like.

548
00:46:03,231 --> 00:46:06,953
All right, the sound effects, the foley, the dialogue, yes, everything is around it.

549
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:09,514
But music actually doesn't really exist.

550
00:46:10,255 --> 00:46:11,815
Music is the emotional layer.

551
00:46:12,696 --> 00:46:17,999
So it's right here in your bald, ugly head.

552
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:19,800
Why?

553
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:29,905
In between those ears that can't hear anything because of the amount of shells that they

554
00:46:29,965 --> 00:46:30,725
saw and heard.

555
00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:32,787
So it's here.

556
00:46:33,487 --> 00:46:37,569
So you mix your VR score in stereo.

557
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:39,410
So simple.

558
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,191
Okay?

559
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:43,112
And we did it.

560
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:46,793
So all the sound effects is in 5.1, 7.1, 11.20.

561
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:49,294
I don't care.

562
00:46:50,735 --> 00:46:54,617
Music was mixed in hard stereo.

563
00:46:55,277 --> 00:46:57,138
And it worked like a charm.

564
00:46:58,146 --> 00:47:03,889
Because once everything else moved around and crazy and you're flying and everything,

565
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:05,989
music was just there.

566
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,712
And it stood out, but it was not in your way.

567
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:18,915
You heard it extremely well, but it didn't really interfere with the action.

568
00:47:20,276 --> 00:47:25,838
And this is almost summing up what I was telling you about today.

569
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:35,604
the way. You call it original, you call it signature, but more than anything, it's really

570
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:47,793
thinking what could be the one special thing that can give your project what it needs to be,

571
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:52,777
you know, what it really calls for from an emotional point of view.

572
00:47:54,778 --> 00:47:56,639
All right, great. Let's hear you guys.

573
00:48:08,272 --> 00:48:08,572
Hello.

574
00:48:09,613 --> 00:48:09,833
Hi.

575
00:48:10,953 --> 00:48:14,334
I was curious for a game as big as Fallout, you know,

576
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:20,416
hundreds of hours of gameplay, do you end up writing more music

577
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:24,597
than you need or is there, do you feel, was there any restriction

578
00:48:24,897 --> 00:48:28,258
on the amount of material that you're putting out?

579
00:48:28,378 --> 00:48:30,899
Is there something that ends up being cut?

580
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:37,140
Was there anything that you created that you wish was in the game?

581
00:48:37,975 --> 00:48:40,057
that didn't make it or is everything included?

582
00:48:40,077 --> 00:48:42,519
Okay, so here's my answer.

583
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:43,840
Yes.

584
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:46,642
Great.

585
00:48:48,664 --> 00:48:49,864
Yes to everything you said.

586
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:51,466
Do we need more music?

587
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:52,506
Definitely.

588
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:54,768
Did you create a lot of music

589
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:56,990
and some of it is not ending up in the game?

590
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,191
Totally.

591
00:48:58,211 --> 00:48:59,192
All right.

592
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:04,374
I mean, did you do stuff that you think you need to do

593
00:49:04,494 --> 00:49:05,315
and you didn't do?

594
00:49:06,195 --> 00:49:08,016
Always, you know?

595
00:49:08,216 --> 00:49:10,297
I mean, and basically you nailed it.

596
00:49:11,277 --> 00:49:13,018
This is the secret that specifically

597
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:16,780
for these kind of expansive games like Fallout,

598
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,982
the amount of material that can be put in is immense.

599
00:49:22,763 --> 00:49:25,284
But then also the choices,

600
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:27,525
and that's what I'm telling you all the time.

601
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:31,348
choices. It's all about the choice you make.

602
00:49:31,828 --> 00:49:36,151
Your artistic choice and what you really want to do.

603
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:39,613
This is the most important thing. So, as I said, yes.

604
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:44,756
Thank you. In addition to Valhalla Reverb,

605
00:49:44,876 --> 00:49:48,498
are there any software tools that you particularly like for processing the

606
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:49,719
household sounds you've recorded?

607
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,461
Oh, great question. So, um...

608
00:49:53,692 --> 00:49:56,935
I found that Soundtoys actually really works for me,

609
00:49:57,535 --> 00:49:58,716
if you guys are familiar.

610
00:49:58,736 --> 00:50:01,539
It has a lot of things, of course,

611
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:03,680
power plugins and everything.

612
00:50:04,141 --> 00:50:08,384
But the real secret, to me at least,

613
00:50:09,024 --> 00:50:12,867
is never use one plugin, A.

614
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:17,992
B, never use the same plugin again and again in the same queue.

615
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:22,623
Actually layering the plugins, and it almost doesn't matter.

616
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:23,864
Everybody's doing a great job.

617
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:25,204
Wave's doing a great job.

618
00:50:25,404 --> 00:50:28,484
I mean, I mean, I mean, everybody's doing a great job.

619
00:50:29,364 --> 00:50:31,605
But actually creating a layer,

620
00:50:31,785 --> 00:50:33,145
it's like layers of instruments.

621
00:50:33,225 --> 00:50:35,866
I never use the same, like, string patch.

622
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:39,966
I always layer at least three string patches

623
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,046
on top of each other,

624
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:44,347
and I'm playing each one of them separately,

625
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:47,768
so it'll have different dynamics, okay?

626
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:48,888
Only then.

627
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:55,883
this is kind of great. So I'm not like a big on one instrument, I'm really big on

628
00:50:56,463 --> 00:51:03,912
the enhancement of layering of elements and this is usually what creates what

629
00:51:03,952 --> 00:51:06,074
I'm looking for. Awesome, thanks.

630
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:09,903
Hey.

631
00:51:10,123 --> 00:51:12,564
Second time I hear you speak, last time was at MIGS.

632
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:14,444
Always inspiring as usual, thanks a lot.

633
00:51:14,464 --> 00:51:15,525
Thank you.

634
00:51:15,925 --> 00:51:18,125
The type of music that you're creating

635
00:51:18,786 --> 00:51:21,566
is seems to me like it's very well suited

636
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,787
for semi-generative applications

637
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:28,909
like live reassembling of textures and music

638
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:30,449
using middleware.

639
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:31,789
Is this something you're doing

640
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:35,510
or you always prefer to have hard-bounced loops

641
00:51:36,211 --> 00:51:36,911
that are already...

642
00:51:37,524 --> 00:51:43,248
assembled. Oh no, no, no, no, no. Let me stop you right here. And especially for Fallout,

643
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:54,516
every note is played. And if not in a real time, it was played, recorded, and then only then

644
00:51:54,636 --> 00:52:02,021
recorded and looped. I am very, very much hands-on when I'm composing. I never use sort of like

645
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:05,764
prepared loops or prepared... Oh no, that's not what I mean. I mean...

646
00:52:07,282 --> 00:52:10,885
for example, recording a bunch of piano cues

647
00:52:10,965 --> 00:52:13,747
and then recording a bunch of bowed guitar cues,

648
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:16,348
but having all of those randomly reassembled

649
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:19,510
in a wise, for example, software.

650
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,332
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, of course.

651
00:52:21,512 --> 00:52:22,753
I mean, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
00:52:22,793 --> 00:52:23,733
Is this something you're doing?

653
00:52:23,753 --> 00:52:26,335
Yeah, everything, actually, it's a good question

654
00:52:26,535 --> 00:52:28,537
and I hope I'm answering it correctly.

655
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:31,999
One thing that, I'm not really great at the technical thing,

656
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:34,400
but one of the things to being a successful composer

657
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:35,921
is really work with the right people.

658
00:52:36,462 --> 00:52:39,224
and I happen to have the right person

659
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:42,366
that is creating a lot of my contact instruments.

660
00:52:42,986 --> 00:52:44,868
First I use, as I said, Umlaut

661
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:48,550
to help me create great loops,

662
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,052
but also my assistant, Alex Ruger,

663
00:52:51,432 --> 00:52:54,474
is basically notoriously taking everything

664
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:55,654
I'm recording and playing

665
00:52:56,055 --> 00:53:01,698
and make it into a contact library on my own.

666
00:53:02,419 --> 00:53:04,600
And it is so freaking great.

667
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,861
All right, thanks a lot.

668
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:10,847
Hi Anon, really big fan.

669
00:53:11,707 --> 00:53:14,448
I just wanted to ask you kind of about your approach

670
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:16,388
to coming up with these cues.

671
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:20,009
Do you kind of get the inspiration

672
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:22,950
from the interesting sounds that you're creating

673
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,591
and then create the composition around those sounds

674
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:28,312
or do you have like a bed first?

675
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:31,973
Or so what, basically what's your process?

676
00:53:32,173 --> 00:53:33,013
Great question.

677
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:36,834
And basically,

678
00:53:39,143 --> 00:53:41,785
It's a great question and it's so hard to tell

679
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:45,868
because the way I'm working is so intuitive.

680
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:50,811
I could sit and before even play one note,

681
00:53:51,191 --> 00:53:53,533
I want to hear something.

682
00:53:54,914 --> 00:53:58,116
It all starting from me wanting to hear something.

683
00:53:59,077 --> 00:54:00,598
And then I'll start to experiment.

684
00:54:00,698 --> 00:54:02,659
And this something could be melody.

685
00:54:03,379 --> 00:54:06,760
This something could be, it doesn't have like a rules of,

686
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,782
oh, I lay out the chords, I lay out the melody,

687
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:12,742
I lay out this, and then, no, no, no,

688
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,263
it doesn't work this way, at least for me.

689
00:54:16,464 --> 00:54:18,624
I will try to listen to.

690
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:26,064
this thing before even starting and then if I got like an idea of

691
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:33,949
Okay, so it should be this kind of sound I'll play the sound or I'll look for this sound once I found the sound

692
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:39,873
Usually it will have inside of it already some kind of a melodic

693
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:42,415
gesture and

694
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:45,957
With all the anharmonics and stuff many many cases

695
00:54:46,498 --> 00:54:49,099
It's also starting to create the harmonic texture

696
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:58,445
So you first listen to something, you know, before playing, and then you start sort of

697
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,686
like the creative process.

698
00:54:59,706 --> 00:55:05,432
So it's no, I mean, it's not like, oh, melody, oh no, rhythm, oh no, harmony, no, no, no.

699
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:06,513
It's not like this.

700
00:55:07,953 --> 00:55:09,234
So it's more organic than that?

701
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:10,094
Exactly.

702
00:55:10,314 --> 00:55:10,754
Exactly.

703
00:55:10,854 --> 00:55:16,775
On that note, if you aren't finding good inspiration from that, do you have a process that you

704
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:20,796
like to go through that you can derive something from?

705
00:55:21,436 --> 00:55:22,796
Well, yes.

706
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:30,138
And again, I recommend each one of you to listen to other people.

707
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:34,799
I got a lot of inspiration from other composers.

708
00:55:36,593 --> 00:55:38,215
hate them because they're so good.

709
00:55:40,936 --> 00:55:47,040
But nevertheless, I mean, hate your competition, but respect them also.

710
00:55:48,281 --> 00:55:50,162
So listen to them, listen to what they do.

711
00:55:50,703 --> 00:55:53,084
And I will listen, okay?

712
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:57,407
If I really want to hear stuff that is interesting me, you know,

713
00:55:57,907 --> 00:55:59,268
like in games and stuff.

714
00:55:59,665 --> 00:56:04,727
plenty of great guys Austin Jason Graves Tom Salt I mean lots of people

715
00:56:05,148 --> 00:56:09,209
okay if I want to listen in movies I probably listen to Johan Jansson

716
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,331
that really creates interesting texture

717
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:16,252
and for me I get a lot of inspiration from this or Thomas Newman

718
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:20,514
okay so yes do recommend listen to other stuff

719
00:56:21,434 --> 00:56:26,596
thank you very much of course any more questions

720
00:56:27,737 --> 00:56:28,597
if no well then

721
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:29,854
Thank you very much.

722
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:30,375
It's time.

723
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:30,596
Thank you.

724
00:56:30,616 --> 00:56:30,796
Thank you.

725
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:33,363
Thank you.

726
00:56:33,383 --> 00:56:33,603
Thank you.

727
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:33,824
Thank you.
