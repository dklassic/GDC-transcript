1
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:07,230
I'm Michelle Silva.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,553
I hail from a two-person, two-cat, independent studio

3
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:13,633
called Ska Studios.

4
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:16,255
This is my partner James there in the middle,

5
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:17,936
husband and partner.

6
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:18,336
Hello.

7
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:21,458
Dressed up at the local Ren Faire a few years ago

8
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:22,298
when I had hair.

9
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:25,560
We're most known for Dishwasher, Charlie Murder,

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,101
and most recently Salt and Sanctuary.

11
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:30,483
So how do I tell you who I am and what I do?

12
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:33,005
It would be easier to tell you what I don't do,

13
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:35,027
but here's a few of the things.

14
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:39,150
Artist, designer, graphic designer, marketing person,

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,692
biz dev person, many, many things.

16
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:43,954
We wear many hats as indie developers.

17
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:46,496
So more on that in a minute.

18
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:47,857
But first, a little story.

19
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:50,760
Being a teenager is the worst.

20
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:53,642
But what's worse is when a teacher,

21
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,303
somebody who's supposed to tell you

22
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,645
that you can do anything, you can be anything,

23
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,628
tells you, no, no, you can only be good at one thing.

24
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:05,291
I remember when I was a teenager, a teacher suddenly quizzed me in front of a bunch of

25
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:08,494
elementary students and I couldn't respond.

26
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:10,976
I froze up, just that instinct to freeze up.

27
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:18,421
And he said, aha, you know those artsy types, because I couldn't answer his math question.

28
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:24,426
As a teenager, I was absolutely mortified, just mortified.

29
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:29,730
And now as an adult, I think back on this and I obviously it has stayed with me and

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,291
I'm angry.

31
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:34,006
because if meme culture was around back then,

32
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:35,649
I might have found solace in this tweet.

33
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:38,514
Hang on, I'm not dumb, I'm just panicking.

34
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:40,156
But hang on.

35
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,223
I am an artsy type, all right, we can see this.

36
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:47,346
But I was also an IB calculus, that's like AP in the US.

37
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:50,148
I still have the hoodie to prove it, it still fits me.

38
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:53,470
I was in warrior calculus at Edmonds-Woodway High.

39
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,793
So I may be artsy, but I'm good at other things.

40
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:02,357
I have a BA in fine arts, but I also minored in business.

41
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:03,918
I may not be good at reacting on the spot,

42
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,959
but I can be good at more than one thing.

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,161
So we know this phrase.

44
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,363
Jack of all trades, master of none.

45
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:15,924
But I want to introduce to you my idea of master of all trades.

46
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,265
And as a small studio, we are two people.

47
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:22,846
You have to be able to do this.

48
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,586
You have to be good at many things

49
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:28,347
to be able to make a game come together and to ship the game.

50
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:33,028
And it's OK to only want to focus on one thing.

51
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:35,689
If you want to focus on just art, that's great.

52
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:37,789
But it's not the only way.

53
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:40,245
It doesn't have to be the only way.

54
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:45,226
So just like when the teacher assumed I was the artsy type,

55
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,847
making these kind of assumptions can be really harmful.

56
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:51,808
When James and I meet new people, they often say,

57
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:54,269
oh, he's the programmer and she's the artist, right?

58
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,110
This is not super fair to us.

59
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:00,951
Yeah, he's the programmer,

60
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:02,491
but he does the bulk of the artwork.

61
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:04,732
He's a musician, he has so many more things.

62
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:08,969
And I am an artsy type, but I also run the dang business.

63
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:11,791
And I am not infallible.

64
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:14,753
I have been known to do things like joke about programmer art.

65
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:15,334
Ha ha ha.

66
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,757
But this is a disservice to both of us.

67
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:23,960
It's a disservice to assume these things.

68
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,402
And this starts early.

69
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:28,424
This starts young and is perpetuated to adulthood.

70
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:30,385
When I was a kid, I was gifted like.

71
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:35,720
girly things, arts and crafts and such, and I do love arts and crafts and such,

72
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,183
but I also love Legos and building toys and things that are considered boys toys.

73
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:47,127
But I would like to ask why not both? Why can't I like both things like I do?

74
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:53,331
So self-esteem is a thing. I will freely admit that I am not a very confident person

75
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:56,593
despite sitting here talking about mastery.

76
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:03,260
And James and I will often disparage ourselves and say,

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,202
we're OK enough at each thing to make a game,

78
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:08,983
but that's not fair.

79
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:13,466
Because taking the spark of an idea of a game

80
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,787
and developing into a fully fledged game

81
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:21,230
and releasing that game, navigating the hellscape that

82
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,972
is release, if that is not mastery, proof of mastery,

83
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:26,453
I don't know what is.

84
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:29,260
So celebrate your mastery.

85
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,921
We don't need to separate these things.

86
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,481
They are integrated.

87
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,442
Maths and sciences is so important to put these two

88
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:36,982
things together.

89
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:40,324
And especially in video games, this is what this is.

90
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:41,204
This is who we are.

91
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:51,008
There are jobs that work with knowledge and skills that span

92
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:51,708
multiple fields.

93
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:53,148
And these people are very valuable.

94
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:56,982
and broadening our horizons.

95
00:04:57,943 --> 00:05:00,004
So learning something in one field

96
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:01,305
can easily help you in another.

97
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:05,048
And best of all, we are in a golden age of learning.

98
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,610
Knowledge is at your fingertips, and there are more and more

99
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,550
masters every day.

100
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:13,293
So I just wanted to have a quick visual shout out

101
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:16,456
to some people that I know that are good at multiple things,

102
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,677
that maybe they started out in one field

103
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:21,739
and started learning another, or just have always

104
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,821
done many things.

105
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,294
And this is a few places you can find me.

106
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:32,177
Some of my Twitter and Facebook and a new Instagram account

107
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:34,359
that I've created called Real Alternate Cat Facts.

108
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,621
It presents very, very real cat facts, as you can see.

109
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:41,324
So you can be good at more than one thing.

110
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:42,144
Don't have to.

111
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,446
But your interests can improve each other

112
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:45,447
and build on each other.

113
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:48,469
And you can be a master of all trades.

114
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:57,216
I am a game creator based out of Osaka, Japan.

115
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:00,179
I've been making video games since 1996.

116
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,061
So this year is my 26th.

117
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,002
Yeah.

118
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:08,585
By the way, when you want to drink beer,

119
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:11,967
but you don't have a bottle opener, what do you do?

120
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:14,128
Try your teeth?

121
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,992
No, don't tell me you give up on the beer.

122
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:20,033
Don't tell me.

123
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,001
Yeah, there's no need for that.

124
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:26,782
There are many ways to open the bottle.

125
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:29,344
I recommend this.

126
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:33,706
A heart and a flat surface, it's super easy.

127
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:39,629
And this, use chopsticks, just like a real Japanese person.

128
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,951
Hashtag drinking.

129
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:48,053
When I talk about drinking, I always use this hashtag.

130
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:54,708
So when people come to visit my office, they always bring me alcohol.

131
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,629
Everyone.

132
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,973
Yes, I am a man who knows how to drink.

133
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:09,018
Now I'm going to teach you how to enjoy drinking in any situation.

134
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:16,883
For example, when you don't have a bottle opener, no problem.

135
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,784
Everyone has a key, right?

136
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,931
Yeah, so, drinking.

137
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:22,811
Yeah.

138
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:28,274
But you might not be able to use this in 10 years,

139
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:29,915
become digital or something.

140
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:32,096
What about this?

141
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:34,037
You drove to the place.

142
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:36,239
Simple.

143
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:37,599
We have Uber.

144
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,840
Yeah.

145
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,081
Yeah, drinking.

146
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:44,743
And what about this?

147
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:49,426
You don't speak the language and have no friends there.

148
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:53,216
Don't worry, drink in.

149
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,538
That's never a problem.

150
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,780
Just drink together and you are already friends, right?

151
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:02,623
You forgot your wallet.

152
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:07,507
You have friends, yeah, just pay back them next time.

153
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,030
And you forgot your ID.

154
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:15,233
Save as ID as a PDF in your phone.

155
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:17,215
Yeah, it doesn't work.

156
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:20,858
Yeah, try winking and blow in the kiss.

157
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:29,872
It's work. But there are worse situations. For example, when there's a manipulator at the event.

158
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:42,738
Or when someone wants to post everything. Or when there are crazy fans nearby. Don't think.

159
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,322
Drink King. Yeah. No one can defeat the King.

160
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,040
But I ordered an IPA and they brought me Bud Light.

161
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,280
Yeah.

162
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,281
Sorry, it's game over.

163
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:03,881
That's the one thing I can't do.

164
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:04,842
Yeah.

165
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:07,322
Never mind drinking.

166
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:11,423
Switch into a new gear and order a new drink.

167
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:15,424
This is three rules.

168
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,525
Getting around with alcohol.

169
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,624
Find a drink that fits you.

170
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:25,506
Wine or beer or whiskey, a lot of alcohols in the world.

171
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:29,987
Learn about types and makers.

172
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:33,589
Kind of baseball team or football team, like that.

173
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,651
Drink expensive alcohol.

174
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:39,571
This is important.

175
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:45,974
What if we can't even drink a drop of it?

176
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:55,127
drinking. That's okay. As long as you have friends, no problem. Even water can become

177
00:09:55,147 --> 00:10:03,910
the best drink with friends. Yeah. Yeah. Don't make alcohol itself your goal. This is important.

178
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:15,034
By the way, I have a Guinness World Record. Yeah. And yeah, and also I have a master's

179
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:17,555
license in Buddhism and I'm living in a temple.

180
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:19,818
Yeah, this is true.

181
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,901
And sometimes I cosplay, and sometimes I

182
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:26,602
cosplay as a pro wrestler.

183
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:32,726
And I've done three sessions at the GDC so far, three times.

184
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:37,228
And also, I have a session on this Friday.

185
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,650
Please come if you are interested in.

186
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:43,331
That's all.

187
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:44,172
I love you all.

188
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:44,452
Thank you.

189
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,373
Thank you.

190
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:54,362
you know, I've been a developer for a long time and uh, even when I was a young kid, I uh, when

191
00:10:54,382 --> 00:11:01,908
I was making games on the uh, ZX81, uh, the, I would be very critical about what I was doing

192
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:05,730
and try to polish it and try and get it into a really good state. So I'm going to talk a bit

193
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:13,576
about that and how I find that's really important now as well. A bit of history about myself. So

194
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:16,759
I started programming in 1981 on the ZX81. I started programming in 1981 on the ZX81. I

195
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:21,260
And then I was a programmer on Star Fox at age 19.

196
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,223
And, which is pretty young.

197
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:29,886
And then I worked at Sony Playstation for 6 years and worked on

198
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:33,249
like the Playstation 2 and did the rubber duck demo and all this kind of stuff back in the day.

199
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:37,512
And then I founded Q Games in 2001 because I always wanted to make a games company.

200
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:40,874
Ever since I was like, you know, 12.

201
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:45,998
I finally managed to do that and that's 18 years now. And then I launched the PixelJunk series

202
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:46,219
in 2007.

203
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:52,085
which was really in the early days of indie gaming.

204
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:59,007
Back then there really were only a few games on say PSN or on consoles I suppose.

205
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,129
And it was really kind of like the wilderness.

206
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:08,151
And I've developed and shipped over about 20 original games.

207
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,633
Okay, so the reasons to be a harshest critic.

208
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:20,774
there are tens of thousands of games that are just kind of good enough.

209
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,517
So they languish, you know, like on Steam and places like that.

210
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,882
And even after removing the games that have no hope at all of selling,

211
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:33,226
like just the stuff that really no one put any effort into.

212
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:37,446
Even then, the average income on one of these games is still pretty low.

213
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:40,708
I think there was a talk at GDC maybe last year or the year before about it,

214
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:45,390
where someone had calculated, but they said the average income was only about $30,000.

215
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,331
So if you spent, say, two years making a game,

216
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,653
you're not really earning much from that, and that's the average.

217
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,595
And it's no different in the non-indie world as well.

218
00:12:56,755 --> 00:13:00,636
I mean, in AAA games as well, there's a lot of stuff out there,

219
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,497
and not all of them make money.

220
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:07,365
And so what you make, I think, has to shine very brightly.

221
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:14,709
I mean, nowadays, because of Unity, Unreal, and everything,

222
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,810
pretty much anyone can knock off a regular game.

223
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,312
And with Unreal, you even get stuff like online multiplayer,

224
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,253
which used to be very hard to do back in the day.

225
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:26,395
And just this kind of stuff, this level of ease of entry

226
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:28,536
simply wasn't available just 10 years ago, even.

227
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:30,677
And this means.

228
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,927
you know, before you'd have to make your own engine

229
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,748
and develop things in that direction.

230
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:40,049
And that would help you kind of get above the crowd a bit

231
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,410
because you make like an original engine,

232
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,350
you make your stuff look different to everybody else,

233
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,211
and it's really good.

234
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:45,951
But nowadays, with Unity alone,

235
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,172
you can achieve a level of graphics

236
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,653
that would have required rolling your own engine

237
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:51,934
and, you know, just a few years back.

238
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,975
And for example, when we went to make Pixel Jump Monsters 2

239
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,016
last year, we decided to use Unity,

240
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,857
and we just put a lot of polish into it

241
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:01,377
to try and make it really stick out.

242
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:10,115
Um, and this is one of the really big reasons to be your own harshest critic. The internet, um, is

243
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:14,256
quite a horrible place out there sometimes and quite a good place, you know, sometimes it's

244
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:19,997
good, sometimes it's bad. It can be very bad. Uh, you know, I've been on the, the wrong end of

245
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:28,178
lots of comments. Um, and the internet is your harshest critic. And very quickly, you know, I

246
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:32,699
mean, Steam reviews can be very harsh. Uh, they'll focus on the, the, the, the, the, the

247
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:40,618
the slightest flaw in your game. And it's uh, this will just snowball out of control and

248
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:45,842
totally scupper your game before it even has a chance. And people who feel strongly about some

249
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:49,245
slightest problem in your game will try and get others to avoid your game so they can

250
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:54,649
self-justify their own mistake or so they believe in uh, you know, so they believe uh, so they

251
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,732
want to make sure that someone else doesn't purchase the game. And you need to beat the

252
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,053
internet.

253
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:08,884
So you need to be as critical about your own work as they are. Um, probably more so. So, you

254
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:11,725
have to criticize your own game as well as the internet does.

255
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:18,195
So I often see problems on teams where devs take things far too personally.

256
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:21,078
And it happens all the time, you know, because you love what you're doing.

257
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:25,602
For example, a piece of art might come up and it doesn't really match the vibe of the game.

258
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,845
And being polite and trying not to rub people up the wrong way, you know,

259
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:32,187
you might hint and say, this doesn't quite feel right.

260
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:34,549
But it's a bit too vague really.

261
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:38,552
And really everybody should be a bit more clear and more frank about what the ultimate

262
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:45,277
goals are and if things aren't matching you should be very clear and try and be as honest

263
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:45,717
as possible.

264
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:53,583
And the way, one way to do this is not to focus on the people involved so much and focus

265
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:54,443
on what you're making.

266
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:59,387
And I've been in, you know, I've been in a lot of games and quite often people get

267
00:15:59,407 --> 00:15:59,447
it.

268
00:15:59,847 --> 00:15:59,948
And...

269
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:06,688
you know, they kind of think that you're talking about them when you say, oh, this isn't quite

270
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:11,451
good enough. But what you're saying is just this particular thing that they're making isn't quite

271
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:16,554
good enough and it doesn't quite match the game. And the quicker you can get everybody to

272
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:21,397
understand that all the criticism is just about making what you're all making together a better

273
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:26,820
thing, that's when you start to make a really good thing, like a really good game, I think.

274
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:36,670
So addressing problems before other people do is important.

275
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,292
So if you're on a team, and you want to show things to other

276
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:43,153
people on the team, and you want to be very quick at doing

277
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:44,133
that, but.

278
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:51,666
you also don't want to show it too early. So I sort of, my suggestion or my advice is to hold

279
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:57,868
things in a little bit, have a little review by yourself of what you're making and just make

280
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:03,489
sure that you've kind of filled in all the little gaps that you can uh by yourself and then

281
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:07,249
take it to the team, take it to the other, the other, your friends or whoever and then get

282
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:11,870
their advice and then feed that back in as well. So it's like a, a multiple step uh kind of

283
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,270
process.

284
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:18,335
because obviously if you make stuff and quickly show it to people, then you're going to get

285
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:23,339
criticism and you're going to get a lot of criticism and that might demotivate you. And

286
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:34,649
it's always best to like try and make things as best as possible by yourself first. And so you

287
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:38,692
also have to criticize the right things. So on all teams, larger than just one person, it

288
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,154
gets more and more difficult to maintain

289
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,400
like overall vision.

290
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,901
And some people switch off and stop trying to understand.

291
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,262
And this leads to an inferior game.

292
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:48,803
And everyone needs to understand the vision.

293
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:51,564
And if you feel you don't need to discuss it with everyone

294
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:58,368
else until you do grasp it, you need to kind of understand.

295
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:01,189
Everybody needs to understand that vision and the sort of

296
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:02,890
fundamental side of things.

297
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,172
For example, on a game where the goal has always been to

298
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:09,153
create a game where the main character can't jump, then

299
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:10,854
criticizing the game for not having a jump.

300
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,570
will mean your opinions are kind of quickly rejected.

301
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,951
And so you have to kind of understand the situation,

302
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,673
like understand what you're aiming for

303
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:20,493
when you're making a game,

304
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,915
and make sure you criticize the right things in the game.

305
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,919
So the game is your legacy,

306
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:31,441
and a good game.

307
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:38,467
I mean this is kind of the last slide so it's just a small point from my perspective as an old bloke in games dev.

308
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:42,188
If you make a good game it will last forever and it will define your career.

309
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:48,110
You will always be able to look back on it and people will still remember it for a long time.

310
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,391
For a long long time. I mean even today you know people come up to me and say you know I love Star Fox or something.

311
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,952
And it's like that was you know for me it's like over 25 years ago.

312
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:01,133
So it's kind of a surprise you know that people still remember these sort of old games and stuff that I've made.

313
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:06,537
And I think every game you make is going to be, you know,

314
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,459
treat it as though it's going to be the most important game

315
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,680
that you'll ever make.

316
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,123
Because sometimes you might not even get a chance to make

317
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:16,448
another game, and you need to make sure this one counts, and

318
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,613
make sure you've made it the best thing you can ever make.

319
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:28,957
and uh and that's it so thanks for listening uh and I'm Dylan Cuthbert on Twitter so you can

320
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:32,922
always follow me or talk to me or whatever and I always try and respond to absolutely

321
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:38,988
everybody who messages me so uh you know uh just say hello and uh ask me anything you like.

322
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:40,590
So thank you.

323
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:48,058
So this picture is a representation of me and my work

324
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:50,420
and experiences that I've had at GDC.

325
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,622
I write stuff, but also do game design and music.

326
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,184
My name's Liz Ryerson.

327
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:06,854
Okay, so because of me feeling kind of deep despair about political realities here in America

328
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:11,818
and abroad, I went back to reading some great music, some books about how some great music

329
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:17,763
by freaks and outsiders and people who survived, like the 80s and the Reagan and Thatcher era,

330
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:20,085
and how they did it, so I read this book.

331
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:22,067
Our Band Could Be Your Life, great book.

332
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,068
Same, Rip It Up and Start Again,

333
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,791
about post-punk in the UK by Simon Reynolds.

334
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:29,453
So I was gonna do a talk about lessons I learned from that

335
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:32,335
and how we could sort of start a punk movement in games,

336
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:35,338
but it looks like someone already beat me to it.

337
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,664
Thank you, Amazon, you really know what the people want,

338
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,807
assuming they don't work in your warehouses.

339
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:56,687
Thank you.

340
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,510
But this underlies my point that punk

341
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,972
has sort of become a cliche.

342
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:04,236
It's become sort of an ironic marketing gimmick or a costume.

343
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:07,860
This is from, I think, Return of the Living Dead movie.

344
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,902
It's like Hollywood depiction of punks.

345
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:14,003
It's the same for words like disruption or resistance.

346
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:19,965
They start from a genuine place but gradually sort of become subsumed into this gimmick idea.

347
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:26,466
The context is removed and it becomes yet another image or place to position yourself and sell your stuff.

348
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:30,167
So the thing is that it meant something completely different in the 70s and the 80s.

349
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:34,929
For many people inside those communities, punk was about opening up the horizons of possibility

350
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:38,450
for people who would otherwise not have the resources to explore it.

351
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,872
So it was about sharing resources and it was about building sort of a solidarity among

352
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:48,855
freaks and outsiders in an increasingly sort of sanitized and hyper-capitalist world that

353
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:53,857
was taking investment and resources away from public spaces and leaving a lot of people

354
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,018
basically shit out of luck.

355
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:09,363
But thanks to some stuff that happened here in the U.S. in 1991, the culture shifted and the meaning of punk music, indie music, and DIY changed drastically from exploring ideas into sort of finding a business model and a brand.

356
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:21,547
This is a quote from Ian McKay, sort of relevant because we have a politician here in the U.S. named Beto O'Rourke who says he's a big fan of Ian McKay, although I'm not sure he would agree with some of his ideals.

357
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:28,469
But people who are committed to punk as a philosophy that carried through to all aspects of their work,

358
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:31,190
were like Ian McKay, were very bewildered by this.

359
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,792
There's also a quote from Steve Albini, who's like a producer and musician,

360
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:37,733
where he said,

361
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:40,614
I saw a lot of friends and acquaintances turn their bands,

362
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:44,195
which were previously something they did out of a passion, into a small business.

363
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:45,875
And then over the course of doing it,

364
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:48,857
they ended up hating their bands in the way I used to hate my job,

365
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:50,417
because it became an obligation.

366
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:57,921
If you hadn't guessed, the thing in 1991 that happened was Nirvana and grunge music breaking into the mainstream.

367
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:02,523
At the same time, at the time it seemed like this monumental shift in culture.

368
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:06,685
But bands like Nirvana were at a scale of success way larger than, like, Fugazi,

369
00:23:07,105 --> 00:23:09,106
or any of those big names in punk.

370
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:12,147
So it was actually kind of a weirdly tragic time for many people.

371
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:17,809
It destroyed thriving subcultures by helping sort of create these cults of celebrity and personality

372
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,570
around often very young...

373
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:27,853
and self-destructive, usually male figures who are not in any way equipped to deal with their newfound fame.

374
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:30,913
Does that sound familiar to you?

375
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:35,095
Does this sound familiar to you?

376
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:41,656
So video games are in the post-explosion world. Nirvana's happened. Now what?

377
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:48,954
Most kids watch video game youtubers and streamers than like network TV.

378
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,917
Digital marketplaces have erupted and finding visibility is incredibly difficult.

379
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:56,000
Here's a bunch of games that I like that many people probably haven't heard of.

380
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,802
Unfortunately, a lot of people out there haven't gotten the memo.

381
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:01,624
There's a lot of interesting and groundbreaking games coming out,

382
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:05,066
but very little to track any of it or embrace or appreciate it.

383
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:09,109
A lot of people doing groundbreaking stuff just burn out and never come back.

384
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,584
Also critics and publications who have attempted to track this new work in the past

385
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:18,448
have often stopped doing it because no one reads their articles. Here's a few

386
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:18,948
defunct

387
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:20,390
sites basically.

388
00:24:21,691 --> 00:24:25,275
Finding visibility as a critic also means building a business model, because

389
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:29,439
it means surviving, which means focusing on what's already a known quantity

390
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,042
to reach the widest possible audience.

391
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:36,347
So oftentimes that means not some new obscure thing that no one knows about.

392
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,431
So the little guy kind of gets lost in the shuffle yet again.

393
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,554
It's that never-ending cycle, the hand of the marketplace.

394
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:47,200
The big money makers sort of increasingly congeal around

395
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,245
this goal of short-term profit to maintain a larger overhead.

396
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:53,307
and expectations on the product they make.

397
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,870
And so the power that each individual has compared to a CEO

398
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,951
is extremely small.

399
00:24:58,071 --> 00:24:59,753
So we don't really have a situation

400
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:03,737
that fosters large-scale support of this kind of innovation

401
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:05,518
or challenging work within the industry.

402
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:08,481
So a lot of the lifeblood sort of gets squeezed out.

403
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:10,583
And a lot of people are just fed up.

404
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,245
The game industry oftentimes treats its employees

405
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,888
as expendable and replaceable by an infinite.

406
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:19,411
new stream of young eager kids because games are popular.

407
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:25,535
And by default, as a woman or another marginalized group in game industry, you're sort of automatically

408
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:29,539
expected to be an advocate on behalf of the industry, which is something I never really

409
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:30,199
signed up for.

410
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:32,461
I mean, I love a lot of games.

411
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,543
I'm interested in the potential of games.

412
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:36,684
But I didn't sign up to get death threats.

413
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:42,288
And to be honest, I never really cared about the mainstream industry as an entity.

414
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:47,131
And I felt like it was just kind of assumed that I had to do things in a certain way.

415
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:50,953
So last GDC, I helped co-found what became Game Workers Unite.

416
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:52,814
They're doing a lot of stuff this year.

417
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:54,655
I wrote the zine on the right here.

418
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:58,257
Thank you.

419
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,768
I don't want to take too much credit because I haven't been involved for a while, but to

420
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:06,313
Emma and all the other people who are doing stuff this GDC, thank you so much.

421
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:11,179
And you should absolutely get involved with them or other unionization efforts in other

422
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,682
fields as well if you have the energy to do so.

423
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:17,347
But this time I'm coming out with something a little more existential.

424
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:22,751
So what punk embraces is that being oppositional is not necessarily a bad thing.

425
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:29,797
And it's something that I think we need a lot more of and a lot less fear of offending X or Y person or X or Y career opportunity.

426
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:38,944
We need to be able to say what we believe and by being oppositional to the powers who are oppressing you, oftentimes, you find solidarity and you find your voice.

427
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,286
I love this picture, by the way.

428
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:47,677
Look, everything that is worth preserving about the game industry, in my opinion, does

429
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:53,001
not come from, as an entity, Nintendo or Sony or Valve or Blizzard, as a company.

430
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:59,526
We have to get outside of this fandom-for-companies mindset, because it's individual people who

431
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:02,268
make that stuff, and it doesn't come from game gods.

432
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:06,072
I had this PC gamer issue back in the day, by the way.

433
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:13,099
Or these boy genius entrepreneurs or big celebrity rock star CEOs and creative leads who drive

434
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:13,800
Ferraris.

435
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,963
That was a big thing for some reason in the 90s.

436
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,847
The lifeblood of the industry, like every industry, comes from the bottom up.

437
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:23,530
It comes from the average worker, average person.

438
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:29,393
I'm encouraged when I see stuff like gamedev.world, which is, I guess, happening next week, and

439
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:32,874
it has a global focus, especially when I think about San Francisco.

440
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:37,375
Inequality is a huge problem in San Francisco, in the U.S., and globally, and it's obvious

441
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:41,477
that a lot of people are underrepresented here at GDC because of the ticket price, because

442
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:44,738
of travel costs, or because they're literally banned from entering the country.

443
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:51,000
But often even the most well-intentioned stuff is kind of used to create new markets that

444
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,321
most people will fail in.

445
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:52,861
So I...

446
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:58,304
I kind of caution against that sort of aspirational model where it's just about creating a new

447
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:04,027
cult of personality around a new game god or someone like that who do achieve success

448
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:05,067
while most people don't.

449
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:10,590
So international outreach and solidarity has to be followed by sort of a larger and I think

450
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,831
more radical project.

451
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:15,753
So there's no reason game development should be a miserable process.

452
00:28:15,813 --> 00:28:17,053
It should be fun and rewarding.

453
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:21,435
We should be creating a space where exploring the boundaries of self-expression

454
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:24,035
beyond the whims of the market is rewarded and it's fun.

455
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:26,456
And we might have to start small, but we can do this.

456
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:30,338
We can help regular people find community and solidarity in the midst of,

457
00:28:30,598 --> 00:28:34,059
let's face it, our pretty hostile and bleak world

458
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:36,240
that doesn't want to give a lot of people anything.

459
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,522
So we might have to start small, but we can do that as well.

460
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:42,364
I am really inspired when I see stuff, I don't know,

461
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:45,167
obviously you're seeing my political beliefs,

462
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:48,509
but we're in a world where radical new projects,

463
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:51,672
like the Green New Deal, are widely popular in the US

464
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:53,213
and a political possibility.

465
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:57,376
And new paths are open for anyone who will put the time to build

466
00:28:58,257 --> 00:28:59,118
in the effort for them.

467
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:00,779
And I think we can all benefit from that.

468
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:05,741
So anyway, if you have any ideas on how to help do any of these things in the context of games,

469
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:09,462
please reach out to me. I sort of started a little Discord about this,

470
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:14,244
just like for friends and stuff, for sharing ideas. And anyway, thank you for your time.

471
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:19,926
I'm a senior product designer at Etsy.

472
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:21,027
Don't DM me.

473
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:22,868
And this really frustrates me to say out loud,

474
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:45,784
If you're on the internet, you know that they've had an array of problems recently, so data

475
00:29:45,804 --> 00:29:50,947
breaches, illegal practices, all kinds of misguided efforts in order to learn about

476
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,548
their customers so that they can better addict them to their products.

477
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:58,411
And this is caused by their participation in what we like to talk about as the attention

478
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:58,872
economy.

479
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:02,874
So that's an approach that treats human attention as a scarce commodity.

480
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:06,476
We are, we have so much content that's really available that...

481
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:12,201
we have to like actually fight for space in people's minds, right? Like we saw a bunch of content that

482
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:18,066
gets created, we don't have actual people who can actually consume it, so those content, that content

483
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:22,970
disappears. Um and these companies are trying to take up space in our lives to this point without

484
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,912
consent. Um so that they can actually find a way to profit.

485
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:32,313
And we do that a lot in games too. We are very guilty of participating in this economy. We need

486
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:37,099
and want attention. We want money. And I get that because we need to survive, right? Um, but I

487
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:39,221
want to talk about how this actually harms people.

488
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,983
So my friend Dennis, this is a picture of his hand.

489
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:44,884
He plays Pokemon Go all the time,

490
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,065
and I mean actually like all the time.

491
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:49,787
This is actually a shot of how he plays Pokemon Go

492
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,608
at dinner, he'll like, we'll be sitting together

493
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:53,909
and he'll just like go on his phone at the same time

494
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:55,630
as we're talking and it's really uncomfortable.

495
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,711
And he actually also even plays when he's driving

496
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:59,733
because of this wristband that you see on the right side.

497
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:02,274
And it's a little, it's terrifying honestly,

498
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:05,296
but I just have to remember that it's not his fault

499
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:07,017
because he's actually addicted to this game.

500
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:13,625
So we are very used to relying in the games industry on whales in some cases where it's

501
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:17,330
either a big spender of time or money, so it's people who pay for all the things or

502
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:23,098
spend a lot of time, you know, in the actual game and they really want the feeling of winning

503
00:31:23,178 --> 00:31:24,480
and they are willing to pay for it.

504
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:27,081
Maybe you think that whaling is a fine practice,

505
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:29,382
but it turns a lot of players off, actually.

506
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:32,783
So for example, my former co-worker Ben

507
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:36,063
really wanted to enjoy Harry Potter, Hogwarts Mystery,

508
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:38,224
but he could not just pay for the full game.

509
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:40,845
He had to keep spending a small amount of money at a time,

510
00:31:41,225 --> 00:31:42,165
and he ended up quitting it.

511
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:43,865
And I am so like this as well.

512
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,226
I hate playing games like that.

513
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:47,966
So if you're like, oh, it's fine.

514
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:50,247
I don't really make games that rely on whales.

515
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:52,407
Time is also money, it turns out.

516
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:58,349
So if you are trying to find a way to get someone to spend more time on your project, on your game,

517
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,310
you're participating in the attention economy.

518
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,611
And that is, as I said, the nature of games.

519
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:05,952
We make things to entertain people, to engage them.

520
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:10,793
But do we need to actually fall into attention economy practices is the question I'd like to bring to all of you.

521
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:16,438
I would say that participating in the attention economy without ethical standards often leads

522
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,100
to designers using dark patterns.

523
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,125
This is a common phrase that we use in the design industry to talk about interactions

524
00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:27,549
that are designed to trick users into things that they don't consent to actually doing.

525
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,014
And I am very, very guilty of being tempted to do this in my games as well.

526
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:35,716
So, for example, in 2013 I made a game with my friends

527
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,177
Chris Algu and Dennis Liao.

528
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:38,878
We were faced with a decision,

529
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,879
do we include microtransactions,

530
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:42,400
do we charge for the game up front,

531
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,120
do we annoy people into buying our game

532
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:45,901
by inundating them with ads?

533
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:48,603
And we decided that we were not gonna go

534
00:32:48,643 --> 00:32:51,304
the dark pattern route, so we decided to just charge

535
00:32:51,324 --> 00:32:52,765
a small amount of money for the game

536
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:55,106
and keep what we felt was our dignity.

537
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:58,208
And ever since that happened, I have personally felt

538
00:32:58,248 --> 00:32:59,709
really uncomfortable playing games

539
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:01,650
that have tried to nickel and dime me, as I said.

540
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,113
So, this experience opened my eyes and it made me ask myself,

541
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:08,854
how can we be better as people?

542
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:10,215
How can I be better as a designer?

543
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:13,117
So I'm going to share a couple of ways that I've pushed myself

544
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:15,298
to be more ethical in my practice.

545
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:18,250
Firstly, define your principles.

546
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:20,572
By creating standards for yourself up front,

547
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:22,754
you can avoid making evil decisions.

548
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:25,156
Experienced principles are something

549
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:27,097
that I use a lot in design as well as games

550
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:30,280
to express a core value behind my project.

551
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,262
So what I do is I write down principles

552
00:33:32,322 --> 00:33:34,223
so that my work has boundaries and guidelines,

553
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:37,085
and then I also make sure to actually do research

554
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,867
so that I understand who my audience is,

555
00:33:39,347 --> 00:33:42,089
understand how they think, and what they actually value.

556
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,351
And this actually helps me make sure that I'm working within the frame and the space

557
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:50,552
of what they want and need, not just what I need as the person who's building this game

558
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,513
to make money, ideally.

559
00:33:52,953 --> 00:33:54,794
Second method is to question everything.

560
00:33:54,914 --> 00:33:57,735
So it's not just a good idea because everyone else is doing it.

561
00:33:57,795 --> 00:34:01,276
I think this is a thing that we're very guilty of as human beings who love to follow each

562
00:34:01,316 --> 00:34:01,456
other.

563
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:05,539
But I think it's really important to ask yourself, why is this a good idea?

564
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:07,580
Why does this game need to be so long?

565
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,143
Why does replayability to this point have to be required?

566
00:34:11,503 --> 00:34:12,704
Why are we using this strategy?

567
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:15,966
Really ask yourself those questions and make sure that you have an answer.

568
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,729
Method number three is be intentional.

569
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:21,391
Design everything methodically and intentionally.

570
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:24,574
This is not just true for your game's experiences,

571
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:27,577
but also for your goals and your overall strategy.

572
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:29,538
So especially your success metrics,

573
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:30,939
it's really important to ask yourself,

574
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,521
what are you measuring and why does it matter?

575
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:35,723
Do you need to measure monthly active users?

576
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,324
What actually defines success?

577
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:42,087
Method number four is stop incentivizing addiction.

578
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:44,669
It's not healthy, literally unhealthy,

579
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,991
and it's not ethical to incentivize people

580
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:49,613
for giving your game a massive amount of their mindshare.

581
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:54,928
Game failure juice is one thing because we need to make games feel good, but employing

582
00:34:54,948 --> 00:34:57,329
dark patterns is another, and your games should not be a drug.

583
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,771
Method number five is get creative.

584
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:05,032
Instead of aiming for quick wins, can you find another way to be economically sustainable?

585
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:07,333
Again, we've talked a little bit about this today.

586
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:11,395
And I personally actually have a Patreon that I run, and I self-fund my work.

587
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:15,477
I don't know how to do this otherwise, but I think we need to ask ourselves these questions

588
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:17,478
so that we can help improve the industry.

589
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:19,918
Because rather than playing into old tropes,

590
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:22,299
I'm sure there have to be ways that we can create

591
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:26,360
new and less evil methods to participate in capitalism.

592
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,380
I don't know what those are yet.

593
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,660
Capitalism is really terrible,

594
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,661
but we need to figure out a way to do this better.

595
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,822
So overall, I am really excited to see us improve

596
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:36,342
and become a more ethical industry,

597
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,943
because we talk a lot about respecting the player

598
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:40,543
when it comes to things like tutorials.

599
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:42,523
We love to consider their intelligence

600
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:43,544
and treat them like adults

601
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:44,964
when it comes to the actual gameplay.

602
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:47,185
But how do we do the same when it comes to their time?

603
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:48,665
Thank you.

604
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:56,692
I'm Alan Hazelden and I'm going to talk about why I think all developers deserve to get

605
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:57,153
royalties.

606
00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:05,120
I am the co-designer of some cool puzzle games like Sokobond, a good snowman is hard to build,

607
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,726
and Cosmic Express, and I'm working on a new unannounced game, but enough about that.

608
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:17,506
So I really think that this is a moral issue.

609
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:21,430
If you worked on a game, then you

610
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,951
contributed to making it happen.

611
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:24,733
It would not exist without you.

612
00:36:25,494 --> 00:36:27,316
And if it becomes profitable, that's on you too.

613
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:29,198
And if it becomes very profitable,

614
00:36:29,498 --> 00:36:32,001
then you deserve to share in that success.

615
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:40,372
So, when I was starting to say to people, I'm thinking about talking about this, some

616
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:45,036
people told me this, they thought, well, Alan, aren't royalties kind of a scam?

617
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:49,419
And surprisingly, I don't actually disagree with this.

618
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:57,686
If you are given a choice between royalties or cash up front, you should almost always

619
00:36:58,126 --> 00:36:58,607
take the money.

620
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:04,604
And if you're in a position where you are offering somebody royalties and you're saying,

621
00:37:04,864 --> 00:37:09,606
hey, we can't really afford to pay you properly, but don't worry, you're going to get royalties

622
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:14,689
and it will be great, then you are probably asking that person to take on way more risk

623
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:15,589
than they should be.

624
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:22,333
But the reason I want to talk about this is because royalties should not replace being

625
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:22,733
paid well.

626
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:27,936
You should get royalties on top of whatever you're getting paid, not instead of.

627
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,854
And yes, sometimes if you're working on indie teams,

628
00:37:33,974 --> 00:37:36,556
people are not getting paid or getting paid friend rates.

629
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:40,680
But that doesn't mean that if that's not the case,

630
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,901
that you shouldn't get royalties.

631
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:44,624
That just means that if you're getting underpaid,

632
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:46,165
you should get more royalties.

633
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:53,145
So, specifically, this is what I decided to do for the game I'm working on now.

634
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:57,969
Jean-Marge Maivary, this is just an example of how you can do this.

635
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,173
So I want people to start earning royalties from the point the game becomes profitable.

636
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:06,836
I define profitability pretty simply.

637
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:09,499
We look at expenses for the game.

638
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,623
That's mostly just upfront team payments and some other mostly smaller costs.

639
00:38:15,644 --> 00:38:19,505
Crucially, for me, I define this only as those costs

640
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:21,585
that haven't been covered by external funding,

641
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:25,586
the period that my company has been covering costs.

642
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:27,707
From the moment we get external funding,

643
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:30,068
I'm not counting that as expenses to recoup.

644
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,509
And then profit is just once the income from the game

645
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:36,249
gets more than what my company has spent on the game,

646
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,590
and then everyone gets some percentage of the profit.

647
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:45,863
And this kind of should go without saying,

648
00:38:46,544 --> 00:38:47,806
but don't be a dick.

649
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:52,113
There are a lot of ways of defining expenses

650
00:38:52,473 --> 00:38:54,637
if you want to make your game look unprofitable.

651
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,700
Just don't do it.

652
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:04,042
Personally, my expenses don't include my travel costs.

653
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,462
I could justify going, because I'm going to places,

654
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:07,663
I'm meeting people, I'm networking,

655
00:39:07,683 --> 00:39:08,723
I'm making deals sometimes.

656
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,644
But it just feels weird and bad, and it's

657
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,964
not going to make that much difference

658
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:14,844
in the grand scheme of things.

659
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:17,305
I go a bit extreme.

660
00:39:17,465 --> 00:39:20,506
My expenses that I'm taking out of profit

661
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:23,326
don't include my salary, but that's just because I'm weird.

662
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:25,627
You shouldn't do that, probably, but that's what I do.

663
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:29,896
So there's lots of considerations

664
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:31,757
you have to take into account when you're working out

665
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:35,177
what percentage any individual should get on a project.

666
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:37,798
That's way too complicated for a five-minute talk.

667
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,799
If you have employees, then you should still

668
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:46,640
get people royalties, but the percentages

669
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,201
could be justifiably lower, and the point at which they kick in

670
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:52,581
could be justifiably higher.

671
00:39:53,621 --> 00:40:00,988
Whereas if you're a team of entirely contractors and after the game ships you'll move on then the royalties

672
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:02,569
Should be much much higher

673
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:09,075
if you've got a large team, then that's a lot of people to split between but that just means that

674
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:12,999
It might take longer before people a little bit before it adds up

675
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:17,074
people leaving mid-project is complicated,

676
00:40:18,035 --> 00:40:21,377
but there are plenty of teams who have successful games,

677
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:22,918
who have rev-share systems,

678
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,740
who have accounted for this, who have a system,

679
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,241
and they've sorted it out.

680
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:34,205
Obviously, some people will have different levels of contribution or different levels

681
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:40,070
of investment, but you just got to work out a plan for figuring that stuff out and balancing

682
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:40,690
all the factors.

683
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:44,694
None of these are really a reason not to do royalties.

684
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:50,078
It's just a reason to know how much royalties everyone should get and work it out in a way

685
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:50,539
that's fair.

686
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,941
So yeah, thanks for your time.

687
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:54,983
I'm Alan Hazelden and this is me.

688
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:03,059
I am Kelly Wallach and this is my talk called Get Me Out of This Hideous Box.

689
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:08,103
Why is this UI so ugly?

690
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:21,755
Why are beautiful games stuffed into a hideous box with tiny font and convoluted menus?

691
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,057
What in the world is this?

692
00:41:26,808 --> 00:41:29,109
Why would I think that I can discover something that I love

693
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:30,270
through this experience?

694
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:33,352
It honestly feels like no one could be bothered

695
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:34,453
to even try and market to me.

696
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:35,974
Why am I invisible?

697
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:38,676
Or worse yet, why am I treated like I'm some sort

698
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:39,817
of statistical anomaly?

699
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:42,999
I have money, I like video games,

700
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,540
I am desperate for content that speaks to me.

701
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:47,041
I am waiting to be seen.

702
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:50,244
Why is the mainstream gaming audience still treated

703
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:51,565
as if it's totally homogenous?

704
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:55,944
Of course you're going to keep ending up with the same audiences if you're only making the

705
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:57,205
same content over and over.

706
00:41:57,985 --> 00:42:01,926
It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle, and it's leaving a whole pile of folks out of

707
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:02,366
the picture.

708
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:09,008
If a new gamer's first experience is complicated, ugly, and careless, why would they think that

709
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,149
the games inside of it are going to be any different?

710
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:17,230
And, even if the content is out there, just getting to it feels like it requires a fucking

711
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,451
degree to figure it out.

712
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:20,991
And it is constantly updating.

713
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:26,258
If I don't play the same game every day, I'll get stuck in an update hell, which means that

714
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:31,419
I need to decide in the afternoon if I want to play a game in the evening, which means

715
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:35,881
I need to plan my entire day around the fact that I might want to play a game at some point,

716
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:40,642
which forces me into a hardcore gamer category when all I really wanted to do was to chill

717
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:42,822
and play my favorite game when I had a little bit of extra time.

718
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,820
Holy shit, the Wii sold.

719
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,140
The Switch sold.

720
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,621
Yes, of course it sold, because it looks like it wants to be your friend.

721
00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:55,782
It doesn't look like it's going to be some asshole who wants to quiz you on every member

722
00:42:55,822 --> 00:43:00,144
of the band and the first two albums that any real fan would totally know about that,

723
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:02,424
by the way, were not as good categorically.

724
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:04,705
Get over yourself.

725
00:43:05,425 --> 00:43:07,126
This is supposed to be fun, right?

726
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:09,567
Oh, I'm playing it wrong?

727
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:12,868
Oh, I'm a girl who likes video games?

728
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,523
Seriously, I've been hearing this same nonsense for 30 years.

729
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:18,885
It's old.

730
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:19,885
I'm old.

731
00:43:20,406 --> 00:43:21,107
I'm tired.

732
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:23,549
The Sims sold?

733
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:24,630
Yes, it sold.

734
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,252
The player base is like 70% women.

735
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,055
And what do I see when I log in when I want to play The Sims?

736
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:31,236
FIFA?

737
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:34,679
It is not rocket science.

738
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:39,223
People will listen to music that is made by people that they identify with.

739
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:43,762
They will watch movies with characters that look like them.

740
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:47,084
They will play a video game that appeals to them,

741
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,085
to their interests and to their identity.

742
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:54,008
They will play a video game that identifies with them.

743
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:56,610
It's allowing people to make content for their own audiences,

744
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,971
created by the people who actually understand

745
00:43:58,991 --> 00:43:59,772
what they're representing.

746
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:02,253
Stop letting men write female characters,

747
00:44:02,793 --> 00:44:04,354
and especially stop letting them say,

748
00:44:04,454 --> 00:44:05,415
well, I have a daughter.

749
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,456
Thank you.

750
00:44:07,496 --> 00:44:07,816
Thank you.

751
00:44:10,364 --> 00:44:12,146
Stop letting white people write people of color.

752
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:15,429
Hire the people who have these actual lived experiences

753
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:17,311
to write their own goddamn characters.

754
00:44:18,672 --> 00:44:21,295
And start giving money to a diverse set of creators

755
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:22,215
to make these games.

756
00:44:23,857 --> 00:44:25,178
We will all make more money.

757
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,581
It is really honestly stupid business sense to do otherwise.

758
00:44:29,342 --> 00:44:30,563
It makes no sense.

759
00:44:31,484 --> 00:44:34,327
The amount of effort that we're putting into keeping people out

760
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:35,228
is a wasted effort.

761
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,931
Imagine if all that effort was just putting into allowing everyone to contribute and participate.

762
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:41,972
How much further along we would all be.

763
00:44:42,332 --> 00:44:44,472
How much cooler all of the video games would be.

764
00:44:45,793 --> 00:44:49,074
So I don't know about you, but this is all making me feel a little bit stressed out.

765
00:44:49,574 --> 00:44:51,535
So how about we all take a quick wellness break here.

766
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,895
I'm going to ask everyone to close your eyes.

767
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:55,936
We're all going to take a deep breath in.

768
00:44:58,697 --> 00:44:59,497
And a deep breath out.

769
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:02,338
Let your jaw relax.

770
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:02,978
And enjoy the rest of your day.

771
00:45:05,165 --> 00:45:09,407
Create some space between your eyes, let your shoulders drop,

772
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:11,989
and picture a mountain.

773
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,191
The roots run deep into the earth.

774
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:18,493
It's solid and still.

775
00:45:19,854 --> 00:45:20,835
The clouds move past.

776
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:23,296
The wind blows across the peak.

777
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:26,218
But the mountain has been here for millions of years,

778
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:29,260
calm and still.

779
00:45:30,821 --> 00:45:34,663
Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out.

780
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,562
All right, let's get back into it.

781
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,048
The thing is, is that indies get this.

782
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:47,092
I get this.

783
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:48,373
You get this.

784
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:50,515
But we all struggle for funding.

785
00:45:50,775 --> 00:45:51,857
We struggle for attention.

786
00:45:52,657 --> 00:45:54,820
We create with little support or infrastructure.

787
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:57,963
For those of you with the funding, fund this content.

788
00:45:58,564 --> 00:45:59,585
Fund these creators.

789
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:04,600
Fun stuff that might not make sense to you, or better yet, that is not made specifically

790
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,100
for you.

791
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:07,903
Get a cultural and social lens and fucking use it.

792
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:11,668
Accept that a bunch of it might fail, and let that be okay.

793
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:15,973
We have to start looking at the long term, and stop reacting to the short term.

794
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:18,896
We have to create conditions for success and for failure.

795
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,701
You have to stop expecting a handful of diverse people

796
00:46:23,201 --> 00:46:26,722
to succeed as a representation of their entire gender, race,

797
00:46:27,082 --> 00:46:29,383
culture, or sexual identity the second

798
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:31,044
that you give them any ounce of opportunity.

799
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:32,744
It is an impossible standard.

800
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:35,045
It creates confirmation bias, and it is not

801
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,205
expected of anybody else.

802
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:39,066
Meet people who aren't you.

803
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:41,727
Stop doing business at 2 AM while you're drunk,

804
00:46:41,887 --> 00:46:43,428
so that more people feel safe doing it.

805
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:44,928
Work with us here.

806
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:48,069
You can't keep leaning on the people at the bottom

807
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:48,910
to fix your problems.

808
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:52,700
And you can't keep only paying attention to us when you need content for a new platform.

809
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,342
Think real change, real investment, real support, and real solutions.

810
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,423
Get us out of this hideous box.

811
00:47:03,723 --> 00:47:03,963
Thank you.

812
00:47:15,753 --> 00:47:16,233
So who am I?

813
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,394
Like I said, my name's Mwabalik Mugala.

814
00:47:18,854 --> 00:47:21,075
I'm the owner and co-founder of a studio called Epic Arts.

815
00:47:21,735 --> 00:47:24,216
I was one of the winners of the Digital Lab Africa competition

816
00:47:24,256 --> 00:47:25,817
last year, and I'm currently working

817
00:47:25,857 --> 00:47:28,338
on a psychological horror game called Project Lumpa, which

818
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:31,399
is based on Zambian mythology and lore.

819
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,121
That's the picture, and that's a random picture of a whale.

820
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:38,982
So why did I pick this topic?

821
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:42,164
In my years of playing video games,

822
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:44,545
I rarely saw my country or continent represented well.

823
00:47:45,786 --> 00:47:48,327
And it really bothered me for such a long time.

824
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:52,089
This was the first time I saw Zambia in a game.

825
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:54,870
And I won't even mention which game this is,

826
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,851
but yeah, we have guns like that.

827
00:47:57,691 --> 00:48:00,212
So most games we played and most movies we watched growing up

828
00:48:00,412 --> 00:48:02,953
were mostly American, British, or Japanese.

829
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:04,214
And we learned a lot from these,

830
00:48:04,734 --> 00:48:06,255
more than we learned about from our own country.

831
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:08,216
I remember seeing and learning

832
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:10,417
about Athena and Zeus from God of War.

833
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:16,229
The first time I knew about a Ford Mustang or Porsche GT, Porsche Carrera GT,

834
00:48:16,649 --> 00:48:19,954
was the car I wanted to own one day when I played Need for Speed with my friends.

835
00:48:21,256 --> 00:48:23,559
Most of these things were new to us and was so intriguing

836
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,702
because we learned so much from them growing up.

837
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,044
So my point is this. Video games have been able to give me an experience I would otherwise

838
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:36,708
have not had as a kid. They literally brought other parts of the world to my fingertips.

839
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:42,712
God of War had me reading about North Greek mythology. Need for Speed had me and my friends

840
00:48:42,792 --> 00:48:50,878
arguing about what's better between tuners and muscle cars. And the problem is this.

841
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,820
My country has 73 different tribes.

842
00:48:56,369 --> 00:49:00,651
73. I'm Zambian, born and bred, and I've never encountered most of these tribes.

843
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:07,295
Like, not even 20 percent. Each of these tribes have their own history, their own culture,

844
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:12,797
their own stories. And this is just one country out of the other 53 countries in the continent

845
00:49:12,837 --> 00:49:17,720
that's still yet to carve out its own narrative in a world that's becoming complacent to retreat

846
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,021
to older, already established narratives.

847
00:49:21,415 --> 00:49:26,097
And now because of its accessibility, one of the ways to get these stories out is through video games.

848
00:49:27,157 --> 00:49:32,719
It's one of the ways Zambians, Africans, you know, can bring the world to the fingertips of people

849
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:40,782
in other parts of the world the same way they brought their stories to our fingertips.

850
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:45,824
I want to see kids from other places like Norway or...

851
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:52,310
Argentina, talk about the Muela rock paintings, the dances of the Nyao, each mask, each feather,

852
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:58,397
telling a different story. And not seeing stories of people always shooting Africans

853
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:02,541
for some minerals that we've never heard of, but it applies because this game has to happen.

854
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:08,134
We need more of these type of stories in African video games.

855
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:10,416
We need more of these type of African games

856
00:50:10,976 --> 00:50:12,918
to tell stories in order to preserve our culture

857
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:15,920
because right now, video games are linked into our world

858
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,181
in a way that's irrevocable.

859
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:20,183
You just cannot deny how much of an influence

860
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:20,944
they have in our lives.

861
00:50:22,224 --> 00:50:28,967
which is why I'm very passionate about bringing more studios from Africa, from

862
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:34,429
Zambia, to the outside world because right now more of these games are

863
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:39,611
focused on bringing African mythology and stories to the outside world and

864
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:44,412
it's a great way to preserve our culture so that kids in our future, our future

865
00:50:44,453 --> 00:50:49,734
kids, our kids, kids, kids can also keep these stories and tell their friends

866
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:59,457
about what happened in the past, rather than focusing only on books, you know, books, movies.

867
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:07,400
So we also need video games to keep our stories intact. And yeah, that's my talk.

868
00:51:10,061 --> 00:51:14,642
I'm Kara Stone. I'll be talking today about mental illness and making games.

869
00:51:16,904 --> 00:51:19,590
There's three different entrances into this conversation,

870
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,354
and for each I'll talk about a game

871
00:51:21,474 --> 00:51:22,677
or an art piece that I've made.

872
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,903
The first is representation.

873
00:51:29,623 --> 00:51:32,504
In The Earth is a Better Person than Me, we follow Delphine,

874
00:51:32,824 --> 00:51:35,645
a young femme who is going through a crisis

875
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:38,706
and runs away from her problems and into a forest.

876
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:41,606
She finds that she can talk to the environment around her.

877
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:44,867
She talks to the moon about love and not understanding

878
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:49,228
the cycles of her emotion, to dirt about suicide

879
00:51:49,448 --> 00:51:52,189
and self-hate, and to the flower about perfectionism

880
00:51:52,269 --> 00:51:52,869
and self-harm.

881
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:56,370
I like to think that it shows a specific but dynamic

882
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,130
representation of a woman living with mental illness.

883
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:05,693
This is an example of how we represent mental illness in video games and those who are mentally ill.

884
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:11,835
It's also the most common way about thinking about mental illness in video games, but it's just one facet.

885
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:14,316
Another is process.

886
00:52:16,827 --> 00:52:22,992
This isn't a game, but the very first project I ever made where I was open about my experiences

887
00:52:23,032 --> 00:52:23,772
with mental illness.

888
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:25,213
It's called Polaroid Panic.

889
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:30,237
I carried a Polaroid camera with me for three months, everywhere, all the time, and took

890
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:32,959
a photo of my face each time I had a panic attack.

891
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,343
The pictures are material proof of a feeling, but a feeling that the viewer may not be able

892
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:39,784
to read onto my face.

893
00:52:41,265 --> 00:52:46,208
All this process took was to carry a small camera bag and to be in touch with my emotional state.

894
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:49,989
Of course, this is not how we're usually making media.

895
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,532
We're working in a culture that normalizes and valorizes overwork.

896
00:52:55,232 --> 00:53:00,335
I'm sure most of you are familiar with the term crunch, and you know not to do it, but you do it anyway.

897
00:53:01,305 --> 00:53:03,307
Sometimes our bosses say that we have to.

898
00:53:03,928 --> 00:53:06,209
Sometimes we feel like we have to.

899
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,232
Sometimes it even feels good, because we're performing

900
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:11,534
as good, productive citizens of capitalism.

901
00:53:12,414 --> 00:53:14,156
But overwork is bad for all of us,

902
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:16,138
and it's worse for some of us.

903
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:19,180
Those of us with certain mental illnesses,

904
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:23,704
psychosocial disability, mental and invisible disabilities,

905
00:53:23,884 --> 00:53:26,726
chronic conditions, may not be able to work like that.

906
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,708
The energy drain happens faster, the recovery is slower,

907
00:53:31,049 --> 00:53:32,890
and the repercussions more detrimental.

908
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,752
Big indie studios, small indie studios, co-ops, collectives,

909
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:40,754
and even individuals really need to check their expectations

910
00:53:40,874 --> 00:53:42,315
of labor and productivity.

911
00:53:43,035 --> 00:53:45,096
Productivity isn't worth the debilitation.

912
00:53:45,977 --> 00:53:48,759
and that means we need to create new models of game making.

913
00:53:49,419 --> 00:53:52,561
And I believe that we can create a process that actually benefits us,

914
00:53:53,282 --> 00:53:56,364
a reparative process like I did here in Polaroid Panic,

915
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:00,347
where the end result was me being more in touch with my feelings,

916
00:54:00,727 --> 00:54:03,689
open about sharing them, and not being able to disregard them.

917
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:06,811
The last is design.

918
00:54:08,951 --> 00:54:12,976
This is another piece that took me a long time to make, but I didn't mean it to.

919
00:54:13,776 --> 00:54:18,061
I've been working on Ritual of the Moon for over four years when I thought it would be one.

920
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:23,248
It's finally to be released on the full moon next month in April.

921
00:54:24,048 --> 00:54:25,750
The game takes place over 28 days,

922
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:26,271
real-time days,

923
00:54:28,994 --> 00:54:33,758
where the player plays for three minutes a day, where you arrange objects on an altar,

924
00:54:33,778 --> 00:54:38,401
receive a mantra for the day, and then you make a choice based on your personal emotional

925
00:54:38,461 --> 00:54:43,364
state at that moment, if you want to destroy or protect the earth from a comet that's about

926
00:54:43,384 --> 00:54:43,785
to hit it.

927
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:49,008
The game tracks your choices in a calendar, acting like a mood chart for the month.

928
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,863
I wanted to make space for ritual, for short plays that we can integrate into our lives,

929
00:54:55,503 --> 00:55:02,087
that's slow and meditative, that make us reflect on our emotional state and not cause anything

930
00:55:02,387 --> 00:55:03,648
frustrating or panicky.

931
00:55:04,588 --> 00:55:09,631
Many of us rightly are criticizing labor practices that expect us to work 80 hours a week, but

932
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:14,013
we want to make games that take 80 hours to play, straight, with no breaks.

933
00:55:14,534 --> 00:55:15,574
That's how they're designed.

934
00:55:16,295 --> 00:55:18,736
Many video games actually reinforce overwork.

935
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:24,039
We think of a good game as a game that you want to play all the time.

936
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:27,642
We design so there's a constant pull to keep playing.

937
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:34,508
This is done most often by activating panic and aggression, frustration, momentary gratification,

938
00:55:35,008 --> 00:55:37,090
and then looping this over and over and over.

939
00:55:37,631 --> 00:55:40,553
We try to emotionally manipulate the player so they play more.

940
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:44,396
But these are just a few of the emotional possibilities of games.

941
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:50,770
What if we made games that activated melancholy or self-reflection or tenderness?

942
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:56,095
I think that these need to be designed differently than the way that we designed for panic, aggression,

943
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:57,837
frustration and gratification.

944
00:55:58,518 --> 00:56:03,142
It's not as simple as making a game about a tender and soft person and expecting the

945
00:56:03,182 --> 00:56:08,608
player to feel the same, but designing mechanics and gameplay and even controllers differently . .

946
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:12,672
to bring out different feelings of tenderness and care,

947
00:56:13,172 --> 00:56:16,095
and using a process of game creation

948
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:18,258
that does the same for us, the makers.

949
00:56:19,038 --> 00:56:20,780
I think games are emotionally powerful,

950
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,822
and it's time we start channeling that power

951
00:56:22,942 --> 00:56:24,764
into a wider emotional landscape.

952
00:56:25,545 --> 00:56:27,186
We need to make reparative games,

953
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:28,708
games that help us heal.

954
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:29,689
Thank you.

955
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:34,979
I wanted to talk a little bit about deadlines.

956
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,642
And I actually did have a disclaimer already written

957
00:56:38,682 --> 00:56:40,103
in here, and now I need to make sure

958
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:41,143
that I'm very clear about it.

959
00:56:42,264 --> 00:56:45,146
This is not an advocate for working yourself

960
00:56:45,186 --> 00:56:48,028
into the ground or burnout or chronic systemic mismanagement.

961
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:50,490
I just want to reflect on the value of deadline

962
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,533
as something that furthers creative process

963
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,355
and moving a project forward.

964
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:00,197
So I think that.

965
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,567
Deadlines are generally reviled.

966
00:57:03,647 --> 00:57:05,748
I've certainly had my share of trouble with them.

967
00:57:06,968 --> 00:57:08,688
I think we look at them as a villain in the room.

968
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:10,869
They're something external that's imposed upon us.

969
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,229
They can sort of frustrate us, especially as creative people,

970
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:16,370
because we view them as things that limit us,

971
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,711
and that box us in, that prevent us from doing our best work,

972
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:24,452
or constrain us to a timeline that's uncomfortable.

973
00:57:25,152 --> 00:57:26,552
I think part of the problem, though,

974
00:57:27,432 --> 00:57:31,253
is that a deadline or a limitation is really...

975
00:57:32,936 --> 00:57:37,819
a reflection of our inability or our reluctance to take what is a perfect idea for a game

976
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,123
or an illustration or a piece of writing or music and make it imperfect by bringing it

977
00:57:42,163 --> 00:57:47,687
into the world. It's a messy, very, very difficult process. It's fraught with pitfalls. And

978
00:57:47,707 --> 00:57:53,571
I think having a timeline put on that inherently makes us uncomfortable. I think that we've

979
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:59,095
framed stress and anxiety as purely destructive things, and I'm not convinced that that's

980
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:02,237
actually correct. I think that...

981
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:09,373
Comfort as a pursuit, purely for its own sake, has become something in our North American

982
00:58:09,413 --> 00:58:11,435
culture anyway that's become a focus for us.

983
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:17,199
And as biological entities, we're actually not designed to be constantly comfortable.

984
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:25,227
It makes us slow. It puts us in this non-committal procrastination, which is almost what happened to me making this talk.

985
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:33,197
I'm very happy that Ryan said that Friday I had to get it all done, because I'm not sure that I would have had it all done on time if I didn't have a deadline.

986
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:35,059
Many times...

987
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:41,683
When I meet someone who's starting a project or fantasizing about leaving their super cushy job

988
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:47,826
at a large developer or publisher, I can tell if they're actually going to follow through with it

989
00:58:47,906 --> 00:58:51,128
or if their project is ever going to get done based on how they frame it. If they're looking

990
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:57,291
for escape, for a wide open field with no limits, constraints, nothing to drive them,

991
00:58:57,631 --> 00:59:00,533
I know that what they're doing is they're fantasizing because they're stressed at work,

992
00:59:00,573 --> 00:59:02,133
which is a destructive form of stress.

993
00:59:04,467 --> 00:59:07,444
This is a, I think Obi-Wan Kenobi said it, I'm not sure.

994
00:59:09,485 --> 00:59:14,126
It's one of my favorite quotes, and it resonates really powerfully with me, because certainly,

995
00:59:14,146 --> 00:59:18,027
I mean, this is a bit of a soapboxy rant, so I can only really speak about my own experience,

996
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:23,428
but I prefer some form of structure, and this quote has always really resonated with me,

997
00:59:24,129 --> 00:59:28,650
because I oftentimes consider what a world without limits would look like.

998
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:35,391
I worked at a large North American developer who also makes consoles.

999
00:59:36,391 --> 00:59:36,511
And...

1000
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:45,024
I did a stint doing character design there, and I had come in from freelance.

1001
00:59:45,084 --> 00:59:49,068
So I was like, I had a kid, I had like, I got laid off of my other AAA job a week before

1002
00:59:49,108 --> 00:59:52,050
my son was born, and I just immediately started freelancing.

1003
00:59:52,451 --> 00:59:56,394
And it's a very valid, like a validating experience to like catch and kill your own food.

1004
00:59:56,414 --> 00:59:58,116
Like I would start Monday, I'm like, we got no money.

1005
00:59:58,476 --> 00:59:59,277
And then I have to go out.

1006
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:05,681
you know, find a client, do the work, and it makes you feel like you're in shape, in a way,

1007
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:10,203
like, you know, you're kind of in fighting form. So I walked in my first day, and it was like

1008
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:16,147
these people were in molasses. They had a four-person standing meeting at a guy's desk

1009
01:00:16,187 --> 01:00:21,150
to discuss the level of specularity on mud for a prototype.

1010
01:00:22,807 --> 01:00:23,888
this game got canceled.

1011
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:25,549
They were surprised.

1012
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,671
I was there for six months and they were all like,

1013
01:00:27,731 --> 01:00:29,052
oh God, guys, what are we gonna do?

1014
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:29,752
They're gonna shut down.

1015
01:00:29,772 --> 01:00:30,453
I'm like, what did you?

1016
01:00:31,113 --> 01:00:32,674
The mud's still not done, you know?

1017
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:36,917
So imagine a world where you had limitless money.

1018
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:40,960
You had an army of people that would do whatever you say.

1019
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:43,122
You had limitless time.

1020
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:45,483
Would it really be your best work?

1021
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:48,065
I don't know that it would.

1022
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:57,471
I think a bit of discomfort, and again I want to really underscore this, I am not advocating

1023
01:00:57,491 --> 01:00:58,331
for death marches.

1024
01:00:58,431 --> 01:00:59,572
They have the opposite effect.

1025
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:00,332
They ruin people.

1026
01:01:00,372 --> 01:01:01,472
It's 100% true.

1027
01:01:02,012 --> 01:01:06,534
But a bit of stress, a bit of discomfort is important, I feel, for creative people because

1028
01:01:06,554 --> 01:01:07,594
there is power there.

1029
01:01:07,814 --> 01:01:08,534
It alerts us.

1030
01:01:08,694 --> 01:01:09,815
It excites our senses.

1031
01:01:10,195 --> 01:01:13,136
And it creates discomfort that forces decisive action.

1032
01:01:13,456 --> 01:01:20,358
Sometimes it's important to be put to a decision because that generates forward momentum on

1033
01:01:20,398 --> 01:01:20,658
a team.

1034
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:26,565
Stress is really a modern word for an ancient phenomenon that's related to evolved adaptations

1035
01:01:26,605 --> 01:01:31,751
that detect threat and damage to well-being, and it mobilizes us to respond to them.

1036
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:34,494
If we're never stressed, we're never mobilized.

1037
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:41,667
So I really encourage people to think about how they view deadlines and other limitations

1038
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:43,749
and learn maybe not to love them.

1039
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:48,912
I mean, Darth Vader is pretty ugly when you pop the mask off, but at least respect them.

1040
01:01:49,092 --> 01:01:55,796
I think momentum on a team, especially larger teams, is very, very difficult to generate

1041
01:01:55,856 --> 01:01:56,477
and sustain.

1042
01:01:56,957 --> 01:01:57,337
And I think...

1043
01:01:58,697 --> 01:02:02,141
Pushing people forward, creating responsible ethical limitations

1044
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:04,343
within which creative work can take place

1045
01:02:05,104 --> 01:02:07,286
is how we're going to get the very best out of ourselves

1046
01:02:08,387 --> 01:02:08,947
and our teams.

1047
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:13,892
Deadlines and limitations create necessity and urgency,

1048
01:02:13,932 --> 01:02:14,433
as I've said.

1049
01:02:14,793 --> 01:02:17,976
They're invaluable tools, and I hope

1050
01:02:18,016 --> 01:02:20,278
that they lead to a lot of great inventions for you.

1051
01:02:20,398 --> 01:02:22,000
But please don't kill your teams, and I mean that.

1052
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:23,421
That's my talk.
