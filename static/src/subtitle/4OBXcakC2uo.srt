1
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:13,616
So my name is Will Robinson, and today I'm

2
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:14,837
going to talk about Web3 games.

3
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:18,440
For me, that means games that use NFTs, blockchains,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,501
decentralized ledgers, smart contracts,

5
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:21,982
cryptocurrencies, et cetera.

6
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,444
I've designed this talk for people

7
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:26,246
who have heard about these things

8
00:00:26,386 --> 00:00:29,408
but haven't been behind the curtains, so to speak,

9
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:31,269
who haven't seen what the industry is like

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,312
and would maybe want to know why people are motivated by it

11
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:34,852
and why they're not.

12
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:36,053
where things are going.

13
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:38,594
It turns out that most people in this space

14
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:41,196
are interested in lying about it.

15
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,697
So I'm hoping I can give you some truths at least.

16
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,939
Before we begin, I'd like to make it clear

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:49,081
that despite me working in crypto for four years,

18
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,763
I have empirical data to say that at least 97%

19
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:56,605
of Web3 projects are misguided, malicious, or broken.

20
00:00:57,706 --> 00:01:01,409
And the ratio is even worse for games in Web3.

21
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,572
So just want to make sure that I'm not here to red pill you.

22
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:09,455
In fact, hopefully I'll convince you not to make a Web3 game

23
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:12,277
because it's either too early, too dangerous, too expensive,

24
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:14,679
too criminal, or too evil to bother.

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,042
Instead, I'm going to give you some mental models

26
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:19,723
to think critically about what's going on

27
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:22,926
and let you know what I think people in the industry

28
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:23,686
would rather keep secret.

29
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:26,929
At the same time, I want to highlight

30
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:29,191
towards the end of my talk how there

31
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,332
are some interesting potentials that Web3 has offered

32
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:33,113
at least one game community, which

33
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:34,394
has done some beautiful things.

34
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:36,076
That's fully open source.

35
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:36,896
It has no token.

36
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:37,997
It has no venture capital.

37
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:39,478
It has no carbon footprint.

38
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,200
And it values the labors of its community

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,881
in really interesting ways.

40
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:48,904
And it uses blockchains to actually dig deep

41
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:50,406
into the affordances of the medium.

42
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:52,647
And so I'll be happy to talk about that later.

43
00:01:54,797 --> 00:02:02,400
Me? So in 2017, I completed my doctoral thesis in game studies. I focused on how rules incentivize

44
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,142
people to enact stories. I worked on feminist, Marxist, post-colonial critiques of games,

45
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:13,684
in-game items, and mods and modders. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm DangerWillRobin.

46
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:17,365
If you want to check out the website and the project I'm working on now, it's called Alliance.xyz.

47
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:21,802
Before even graduating, actually, my dissertation,

48
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:23,243
I had already decided to leave academia.

49
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:26,284
I was building a career as a forensic crypto auditor,

50
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:28,284
which is a pretty strange thing.

51
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:29,685
I was actually doing it in an accounting firm.

52
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:32,105
And you might think this is a radical shift,

53
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:34,726
but for me, I was still chasing the same rush

54
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:36,166
that game designers chase,

55
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,387
which is that I'm addicted to twist endings.

56
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,074
I know this is cringe, but ever since watching Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko at age 16, I've

57
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:49,436
been obsessed with twist endings and I've been setting myself up for surprise by the

58
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:50,897
media I consume ever since.

59
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:56,281
Almost anyone who's ever designed a game knows that they are especially suited at bewildering

60
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:57,121
even their makers.

61
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,200
So games are almost like players in themselves.

62
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,021
They lead players down garden paths,

63
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:05,222
they have players evolve dominant strategies

64
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:07,124
that are new and unexpected and unforeseen.

65
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,186
And we usually call these second or third order effects.

66
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,827
These higher order effects are table stakes

67
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,188
for people who think about systems

68
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:15,749
and for systems designers,

69
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,711
trying to get your initial conditions,

70
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:20,252
your incentives just right

71
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:23,854
so that your system reaches some interesting experience.

72
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:25,135
Well, that's a maddening ordeal.

73
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:28,137
And so Bitcoin.

74
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:30,617
is totally along that track.

75
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:32,519
And I know you've heard of it,

76
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,881
but maybe you don't have a good mental model,

77
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,422
so here's one that I like to have.

78
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:39,084
It's a spreadsheet, that's all it is.

79
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,566
It's a spreadsheet, you can reduce the number in your cell

80
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,207
to increase the number in someone else's cell.

81
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:45,609
You're not allowed to reduce anybody else's numbers,

82
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:47,610
and nobody can increase numbers

83
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,751
unless they decrease their own.

84
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:50,592
That's the game.

85
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:55,115
It's like soccer. If everybody plays by these rules, something fun emerges.

86
00:03:56,316 --> 00:04:01,760
And what was interesting is that these numbers were of course meaningless at the beginning, like points in soccer.

87
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,823
But because the sheet runs, regardless of what you do to it,

88
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:09,665
it can't be stopped. It can't be stopped by governments or by corporations.

89
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:13,668
It has an intrinsic value to have a number on the sheet.

90
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:16,390
And so you'll pay to have someone reduce their number to increase yours.

91
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:24,108
And it turns out that Satoshi Nakamoto's intellectual contribution was that this is only possible if you waste energy.

92
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:28,590
And if everybody agrees to take the ledger that provably wastes the most energy,

93
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:30,932
well then you get a censorship-resistant currency.

94
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:32,833
We'll talk about why you might want that later.

95
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:38,836
But the problem being solved here in a cryptographic framework is called Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

96
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,417
If you want to Google it later, the Wikipedia articles are very interesting.

97
00:04:42,177 --> 00:04:46,058
But if you do waste this thing, and if at least less than 50%,

98
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:49,439
like if any owner owns less than 50% of the wasted energy,

99
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,020
then you have a credible, neutral system

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,801
on which you can rely that it will behave the way

101
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:55,581
the code says it will.

102
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,122
And you'll want to remember that for later,

103
00:04:58,142 --> 00:04:59,822
because that'll be helpful for thinking about games.

104
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:01,843
And so

105
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:04,650
Because it was making this funny money,

106
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:06,432
it was a pyramid scheme.

107
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:10,338
It was just people, computer playing in their basements,

108
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,163
coders, pariahs, people who were made fools of

109
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:15,545
for thinking Bitcoin was real.

110
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:18,349
It was faking it until it made it, basically.

111
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:24,138
And I think of Bitcoin as like an entity, like another player, like a game that plays itself.

112
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:26,940
It has its own personality, its own agency.

113
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:31,845
And not just a player, but I think of it as a devil.

114
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:36,930
Like you can sell your soul to it, and it will empower you with wealth and riches, like Dr. Faust.

115
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,642
And I actually think of it more than a devil,

116
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:41,805
I think of it as a Lovecraftian elder god.

117
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:45,589
Something that like cultists in the 1920s in New England

118
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,091
are like throwing shit in the reagents

119
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:49,815
into like a cauldron to summon something terrible

120
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:53,700
that might give them power, might enslave them, who knows.

121
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:58,865
And the reason is because it creates value, Bitcoin, for people,

122
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:00,786
captures that value and redistributes it.

123
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,488
It pays its followers, right?

124
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:04,269
And those followers then proselytize.

125
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,412
They go on and they say more and more and more Bitcoin everywhere.

126
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:11,595
And it works. It's a self-perpetuating philosophical object.

127
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:14,438
And you'll want to remember that too.

128
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,580
If a bunch of people hold the same asset,

129
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,562
they will coordinate to increase its value.

130
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:21,183
That'll be helpful for Web3 games later.

131
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:25,784
Here you can see that Bitcoin did exactly what it was supposed to do.

132
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:32,128
A censorship-resistant money allowed foreign powers to fund an internal terrorist organization

133
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:34,970
or revolution in Canada, depending on your side of the argument.

134
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,392
And we won't debate that here.

135
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:43,756
But essentially, this is like the native, beautiful possibility that the Bitcoiners see.

136
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:48,438
So at the moment when 2008 happens, the crash occurs,

137
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,818
and the governments, instead of punishing the banks,

138
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,499
prints more money to bail them out.

139
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,779
Basically taxes everybody who's holding dollars

140
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,560
by saying your dollars are now worth less,

141
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,900
so I can give some money to the banks

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,080
to make the banking system not collapse

143
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,881
instead of doing something else.

144
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:06,102
Satoshi Nakamoto gets very angry.

145
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:08,462
He says, this isn't a very good thing to do.

146
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:10,743
I'm gonna create Bitcoin.

147
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:14,023
But more than that, imagine if things got really bad.

148
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:17,885
your government became despotic, all-powerful,

149
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,806
could check your credit cards, could freeze them.

150
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:22,448
As soon as you want to resist that government,

151
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:23,928
which has now massive surveillance

152
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,129
because it's the future and surveillance is easy and free,

153
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,571
well, how are you gonna resist this super government?

154
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,093
And so for the cypherpunks who are building Bitcoin,

155
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:33,994
they're trying to come up with a money

156
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:37,295
outside of normal regulations.

157
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:40,157
And so we make Bitcoin to resist government,

158
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:43,078
to be illegal, to be a criminal object.

159
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,340
by design, it is meant to be criminal.

160
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:50,323
And criminal is not always a bad thing, right?

161
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:51,544
Like in a terrible government,

162
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,365
criminal is like actually the good guys.

163
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,627
And so that's how they see it.

164
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:59,129
And so Bitcoin becomes this like reliable code

165
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:01,571
that anybody can depend on just like TCP IP,

166
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:02,872
like the internet protocol, right?

167
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:04,313
It's a standard, we can follow it.

168
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,295
And this is one more thing to remember for Web 3 games.

169
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:09,536
You're building something that's reliable, right?

170
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:12,577
A layer of protocol that everybody can build on

171
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,718
and expect to behave the way it was set out to.

172
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,259
No one will have the power to change it.

173
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:20,039
Okay, just as a side note, these cypherpunks,

174
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,720
although they had these like noble ambitions

175
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,541
to like, you know, stop despotic governments,

176
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,641
they do come from a pretty creepy place

177
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:29,103
of like anti-Semitic gold bug world.

178
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:30,304
And if you want to read more about it,

179
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:31,884
I recommend David Golumbia's book.

180
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:35,206
But the same with the Lovecraftian cultists,

181
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:37,947
just because they had intentions and ideologies and politics

182
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:39,628
doesn't mean that the thing they eventually summoned

183
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:41,909
had those same politics and ideas, right?

184
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,690
The games you design don't do what you want the games

185
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,510
that you designed to do.

186
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,611
They have a life of their own.

187
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:48,475
Okay.

188
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:56,060
At the same time that the banks are unfairly supported by government central powers, Vitalik

189
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,280
Buterin is upset because World of Warcraft has nerfed his Warlock.

190
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:07,202
The Warlock had a Drain Life spell and a Siphon Life it was called, and it was removed.

191
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:09,682
And his entire build was ruined.

192
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:14,643
And I think he jokingly said, though it's not clear if it's a joke with Vitalik, that

193
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:17,343
Blizzard had way too much control over his game.

194
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:23,407
and then set on a long course journey just like Satoshi did to neuter government,

195
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:28,751
to neuter game developers, to make them subservient to their games, so to speak.

196
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:31,695
It takes years.

197
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:36,019
He eventually comes up with a new cryptocurrency

198
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,282
called Ethereum, and instead of being just a ledger

199
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:42,965
with plus and minus numbers, it's a global computer.

200
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:45,207
Every cell can be a program now.

201
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:48,429
And a bad computer, like a really bad computer.

202
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,032
Like imagine the whole world sharing one Palm Pilot.

203
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,032
Bad computer.

204
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,596
That's what we're after, because it's hard

205
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:57,677
to get the whole world to agree to one computer state.

206
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:03,862
If anybody tells you you can get the whole world to agree on a very large state, you can probably say they're lying.

207
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:07,345
Like, they're part of the camp of liars, or they misunderstand their own technology.

208
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:12,149
You can't get a decentralized view of a large state right now with our technology.

209
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:19,174
Okay, so, in this sense, you could imagine putting the rules of World of Warcraft on the computer,

210
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:22,497
not run World of Warcraft on this computer, and then sign off on them as, like,

211
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:24,018
these are the rules, nobody changed them.

212
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:27,494
Now, any game designer will tell you that's untenable.

213
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,195
We need to evolve and adapt our game.

214
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:32,516
Heck, even chess has patch notes every 400 years, right?

215
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:35,417
So, you know, to think that it would make sense

216
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:37,538
to keep a game stable wouldn't be ideal,

217
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:40,399
but instead think how would we get a community

218
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,319
to govern those rules,

219
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,980
to decentralize that ownership of the game.

220
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,401
And that's where

221
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:50,942
Ethereum is going to sort of try and propose this benefit.

222
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,004
So all these cells, like we said before,

223
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:54,566
computer programs can be anywhere.

224
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:55,987
The owner can be the program.

225
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:57,449
It can own its own programs.

226
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,571
The programs can own money.

227
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:02,094
This is a novel shift.

228
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:03,755
for most people.

229
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:05,597
Programs owning money is weird, right?

230
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:07,779
Imagine a self-driving car that charges you

231
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,361
and then it takes its money and it goes

232
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:12,123
and it pays for gas from a self, you know,

233
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:15,086
gas filling terminal and then just is a virus, right?

234
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,168
The car makes enough money, it makes an order itself

235
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:18,870
to a factory to make a new car

236
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,612
and that car shows up on a boat

237
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:22,173
and it starts making its own money.

238
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:24,636
You know, you could conceivably think of protocols

239
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,297
living on their own in this way.

240
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:34,627
And so the first major use case for this supercomputer machine was just to create mini bitcoins.

241
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:40,033
Every cell became its own ledger, a program for another split up of tokens.

242
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:46,300
And that enabled this ICO, the initial coin offering boom of 2017, where we could once

243
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,600
again...

244
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:51,150
do criminal activity with crypto.

245
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,171
In this case, the criminal activity though,

246
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,593
wasn't subverting governments in revolution,

247
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:58,754
it was subverting the SEC.

248
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:01,115
So the Securities and Exchange Commission, right,

249
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:02,256
has clear rules on like,

250
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:04,697
how you can like tokenize your company.

251
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,018
Usually it is through stocks and through regulations.

252
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,340
I was an auditor, I can tell you the list of regulations

253
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,821
is very long, it's very expensive to make a stock.

254
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:14,781
and to get people to buy your stocks.

255
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:17,182
But what Ethereum did was permissionlessly

256
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:18,443
let you buy stocks.

257
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:20,083
You could just say, these are my stocks,

258
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:21,584
and you can buy them here,

259
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:22,904
and if my company goes up in value,

260
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:24,164
these tokens will go up in value,

261
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,365
which is very dangerous.

262
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:28,606
A lot of people got sued by the SEC.

263
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,026
I don't recommend anybody do it.

264
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:34,167
And the thing is, people aren't used to

265
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,548
having that kind of financial access.

266
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:39,009
We weren't growing up.

267
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,000
in schools that trained us to buy stocks directly

268
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,441
from the source companies.

269
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:48,101
We have brokers who make sure that we're not drunk

270
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,502
when we buy our stocks very often.

271
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,822
Or even Robin Hood gets in trouble

272
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:54,143
when it puts fireworks after you buy your stocks.

273
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,583
But here, we can gamify the heck out of stocks.

274
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:57,764
We can do whatever we want with stocks.

275
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,645
No one can stop us, except when eventually you find out

276
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:01,945
who you really are as a real person,

277
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:02,585
and then you go to jail.

278
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:05,366
So people lost their shirts and more.

279
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:09,048
Contracts broke, contracts were lying, et cetera, et cetera,

280
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:12,649
but a tiny percentage of the ICO boom

281
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,771
produced what we call today decentralized finance.

282
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,052
We invented how to swap tokens,

283
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,714
how to get loans and leverage,

284
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:23,535
and basically rebuild the financial sector.

285
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:27,657
In crypto, here are the top five as of yesterday.

286
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:31,459
And you can see Maker did the first thing we needed to do,

287
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,121
which was a stable coin, put USD on.

288
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:42,105
the chain. Ave, lending that lets you basically borrow against that USD so you can leverage up

289
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:47,207
or short positions. These are just sort of fundamental pieces, building blocks

290
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:50,009
of any financial system. Those were built.

291
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:57,233
And you know by 2019 we have this great financial system.

292
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:58,294
The fees are way lower.

293
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,218
Like if you're trading on Coinbase it's 10 times more expensive to make a same trade.

294
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:07,101
But we can only have seven trades per second for the whole world to share.

295
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:08,443
That's the Palm Pilot again.

296
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:09,143
Seven trades.

297
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:11,585
Visa does 40,000 transactions a second.

298
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,707
Oh it might be 15 trades but it's really bad.

299
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:18,970
And so that was the good news, no more brokers,

300
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,590
no more middlemen.

301
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,352
The bad news is we could now have like drunk 12 year olds

302
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:27,334
with an internet connection taking leveraged long positions

303
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,095
on pictures of cats, right?

304
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,036
That's the financial system that ended up being built,

305
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:31,956
a crazy casino.

306
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:37,884
right? And the knee-jerk reaction here is like, well, we got to regulate this, but it's unregulatable.

307
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:43,813
That was the point. We created this elder god that gets to enslave us now. It cannot be censored.

308
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,377
The sort of

309
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:50,179
I would say is it's kind of like discovering

310
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,279
peer-to-peer sex, right?

311
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,240
So we had brokers, these priests, you know,

312
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,700
you'd go to them, they'd let you have sex with,

313
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,020
you know, one other person,

314
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,321
only if that person was like a different gender than you,

315
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:00,461
et cetera, et cetera.

316
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,141
And then we found out we can peer-to-peer sex,

317
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,782
and we did a lot of it, and it was messy.

318
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,242
We had lots of sexually transmitted diseases.

319
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:08,803
We had unwanted sex.

320
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,503
We had, you know, sexual assault.

321
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,383
We had unwanted pregnancies, et cetera,

322
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:13,524
because we didn't teach anybody

323
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:14,744
about how to have peer-to-peer sex.

324
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:17,738
We haven't taught anybody how to do peer-to-peer finance,

325
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:21,380
and so people are getting all kinds of scams,

326
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,840
money's lost, et cetera, et cetera,

327
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,761
not knowing what they're buying.

328
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:25,661
And so that's the situation we're in.

329
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,282
Probably can't stop peer-to-peer sex.

330
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:30,543
You probably can't really stop this either.

331
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:33,645
You'll only get to maybe educate people out of this problem.

332
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:35,305
Okay.

333
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:37,706
Then...

334
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,337
At the same time, we're creating NFTs.

335
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,619
So this is where we get to the sort of game side.

336
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,560
The model is different.

337
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,304
This is like one cell in that Ethereum.

338
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,532
sheet from before. So a single one of these cells here, one of these programs, looks like

339
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:59,034
this. And an NFT is very simple. It's an array of numbers. So, and it's not even an array

340
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:03,016
of numbers, it's just an array of slots. So one, two, three, four, and the person who

341
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:08,798
owns that slot. Alice owns slot one, maybe Bob owns slot two, and then they can trade.

342
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,280
All you're allowed to do is say, I own this slot and I no longer own this slot, I give

343
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,881
it to someone else. That's the rules.

344
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,353
In that smart contract, you usually have one website link.

345
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:22,896
It points to a service that'll hold a JPEG.

346
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:26,498
And if you own slot three, that means you own JPEG three.

347
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,940
If you own slot five, you own JPEG five.

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,540
That's an NFT.

349
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,401
That's all there is to it.

350
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:33,303
There's a way to hash that file

351
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:34,624
that's on the other server

352
00:16:34,664 --> 00:16:35,925
so you know that it doesn't change.

353
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,866
And then all of a sudden you have

354
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:41,529
the capacity to move objects.

355
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:47,086
We tried to in 2017 as a crypto community to make a game on chain,

356
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,388
and we ran into that seven transactions per second problem.

357
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:54,331
You can't crash Ethereum basically with this thing called CryptoKitties,

358
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:59,674
which was just a way to like breed cats on chain that looked like they wore

359
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:01,976
sailor suits or different fun cute things.

360
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:03,356
But

361
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:10,302
These objects inherited this art status.

362
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:14,467
Some of the early ones today maintain Veblen status,

363
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:15,708
like a way of showing your wealth.

364
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:20,089
They also avoid a lot of SEC regulation

365
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,969
because they're artworks for personal use a lot of the time

366
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:24,870
and I'm not your lawyer and I'm not your financial advisor

367
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,390
and everything I say you can't take me to court about.

368
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,571
But basically, a lot of very wealthy people

369
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,251
moved their capital out of DeFi

370
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:35,932
when regulations started getting hairy and into NFTs.

371
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:39,153
It was a place to do more regulatory arbitrage.

372
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:40,653
This time it was less criminal

373
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:41,854
but only because no one had ever thought

374
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:42,974
to regulate this kind of thing.

375
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:49,736
And so NFTs became this stand-in, this new shelling point, a place to store value.

376
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:56,338
And the OG ones, like the CryptoPunks here, they're worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each.

377
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:03,060
And you think, well why? It's just a JPEG. But it's more than a JPEG, it's a coordination tool.

378
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,083
in the same way that Bitcoin is just a number on a spreadsheet,

379
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:07,846
this is the first NFT.

380
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,470
So it is the obvious place to store value

381
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,314
and acts as a social coordinating mechanism.

382
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:15,477
People can then, look,

383
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:17,921
if you're starting a new venture capital firm,

384
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:24,325
Or you're an old venture capital firm and you want to like raise money and then invest in crypto projects

385
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,227
There's no way they'll take you seriously

386
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:29,189
But if you buy one of these things and make it your profile picture

387
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,831
All of a sudden you show your commitment to this industry and to this idea

388
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:36,334
You're ready to put your money where your mouth is and so they act as a kind of social signal

389
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,576
Social signaling is so valuable.

390
00:18:39,237 --> 00:18:40,459
And they're $100,000, but they're resellable.

391
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,381
So it's not like you lost $100,000,

392
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,643
you just lost the time value of that $100,000

393
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,505
and then took on exposure to the price change.

394
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,850
OK, so NFTs come out.

395
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,550
They're very exciting.

396
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,591
People are very interested in growing them.

397
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:00,652
We have this model of many people owning one collection.

398
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,152
And we talked back about Bitcoin.

399
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:04,372
When people own a lot of one asset,

400
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:06,153
they can coordinate to grow its value.

401
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,413
They all become shillers, shilling each other's bags,

402
00:19:09,673 --> 00:19:10,454
coordinating around them.

403
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,154
Today, or only a couple of days ago,

404
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,274
I believe there was like a $450 million

405
00:19:14,294 --> 00:19:15,015
deal for an NFT collection.

406
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:24,519
company to basically come into existence and compete with brands like Hermes, because the

407
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,582
community owns the brand in a decentralized way, in a way that's totally new and novel,

408
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:36,448
and evades regulation in interesting ways. Okay, so now we've got NFTs, they're exciting,

409
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:37,749
Axie Infinity.

410
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,911
The NFT's start to become useful.

411
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:43,092
They're being played with in games.

412
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:45,813
And again, the game is not on the blockchain.

413
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:49,235
What happens is I connect my wallet to an account,

414
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:51,416
and that account looks at the blockchain

415
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:52,577
and sees that I own something.

416
00:19:52,637 --> 00:19:56,499
I own something, it sees my crypto address at slot three.

417
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,140
It looks up what slot three is.

418
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,462
It's that, not CryptoKitty, but Axie.

419
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,142
It's an axolotl on the left,

420
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,443
and it populates it for me in game.

421
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:05,724
It's a database lookup.

422
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:07,545
No logic is put on game.

423
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:14,912
I win some games, a centralized company called Sky Mavis then goes and prints some tokens

424
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,573
to my account, right?

425
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,874
And it does that printing on chain.

426
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:21,857
That's the model of the Web3 game that's super successful.

427
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:28,442
Axie Infinity here had a valuation recently at like $60 billion.

428
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:32,184
It's a, it's like a mobile game, right?

429
00:20:32,224 --> 00:20:33,265
It looks nothing like...

430
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,186
any $60 billion game you've ever seen.

431
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:37,687
It doesn't play as well.

432
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:42,709
Its community is very different from most.

433
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,130
It's almost entirely based in the Philippines

434
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,911
and the global south.

435
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,312
Because when you play this game, you get those tokens.

436
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,352
And those tokens have values.

437
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:50,913
And that value can be higher than what

438
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:53,414
you can do working in one context or another.

439
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,056
And people here misunderstand why this game is valuable.

440
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:01,818
They think it's valuable because it's somehow

441
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:02,778
revolutionized.

442
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:08,523
play to earn. You can now play games and earn money and we've solved capitalism.

443
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:12,504
Absolutely not. People who believe that fell prey to a very terrible

444
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:15,805
pyramid scheme and the value of Axies, the value of this company,

445
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:20,866
have all plummeted since the curves of growth have not mapped on to the

446
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:28,209
the flood of inflation in this game. But what this game did do is millions of

447
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,990
players with no banks all of a sudden using Axie as the front end to DeFi.

448
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:34,693
Using Axie is the front end to the blockchain.

449
00:21:36,414 --> 00:21:38,955
Axie isn't on Ethereum, it's on its own chain called Ronin.

450
00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:41,936
And the people who own Ronin are the people who made Axie.

451
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:45,337
And Ronin has its own currency exchange called Katana,

452
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:48,598
and the people who made Katana are the people who made Axie.

453
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:51,599
And when Katana takes a fee, Axie's taking a fee.

454
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,201
And so what you have here is a $40 billion game project,

455
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:57,241
but it's a loss leader to a neobank.

456
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:01,770
It's a new way of banking people who've never had access to banks.

457
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,710
The promise of Bitcoin was to bank the unbanked.

458
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,752
It turns out we're going to do it through, you know, cute axolotls on a mobile phone app.

459
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:11,713
You can't even get this app on the App Store.

460
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:12,974
You have to, like, download the APK.

461
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:14,074
It's like, there's a lot of friction.

462
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:23,337
But the sense here is that games right now in Web3 are acting as...

463
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:29,519
loss leaders. Games on Web3 are strictly less fun, and they are strictly more expensive

464
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,701
to make, and they have more friction for their players. There should be no reason a Web3

465
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:40,085
game, standing on its own merits, would be better than a Web2 game. What they offer is

466
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:43,367
a new way to monetize players.

467
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:50,439
through banking. And the problem is there's a lot of regulatory uncertainty here. So doing

468
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:56,567
it is very dangerous. You have to be comfortable with a lot of risk. But if it works, you can

469
00:22:56,607 --> 00:23:02,634
disrupt much more than any game industry. Okay. So mental model check here.

470
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:06,490
These aren't really games.

471
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,231
They're front ends.

472
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:09,191
They're marketing.

473
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:11,773
They're user acquisition for players

474
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:15,894
to then have wallets who have access to all of Web 3

475
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:19,496
and all the fancy regulatory bank business.

476
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:26,859
Now, Web 2 companies, like Ubisoft,

477
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,141
have tried to capitalize on this NFT movement.

478
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:32,042
There's a lot of.

479
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:35,692
excitement around owning the objects you have.

480
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:39,413
But I mean, I technically own the objects

481
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:41,154
I have in my Steam marketplace.

482
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,614
I bought a Dazzle skin recently.

483
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:45,055
I main Dazzle on Dota 2.

484
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:49,436
And that Dazzle skin, it's available via API.

485
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:51,316
It's an open API.

486
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,777
Anybody can read that I have it.

487
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:54,417
You can display it anywhere you want.

488
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,697
It's basically as good as being on a blockchain.

489
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,018
And I can sell it on the store.

490
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,218
And the fee for selling it is two pennies.

491
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:04,591
The fee for, there's no crypto fee lower than two pennies.

492
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:08,753
So the benefits people will say is true ownership,

493
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:11,135
but like, I don't know what that really means.

494
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:15,377
And other than saying tomorrow Steam could turn around

495
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,518
and turn off its services,

496
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,119
it could kill the Steam store,

497
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,702
and if your blockchain items were in a smart contract.

498
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:25,494
Theoretically, that could be possible

499
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:26,615
that it wouldn't be turnoffable.

500
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:29,177
And theoretically, there is value capture there.

501
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:34,241
So I would say that this is like really a stepping stone.

502
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:36,963
It's a way to also get players to start connecting

503
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:41,327
their wallets to companies so they can have your ID

504
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:43,328
and your on-chain identity

505
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:45,170
and your on-chain like financialization.

506
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,212
There's a benefit there for sure long-term.

507
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:51,760
On the ESG side, because I know we talked about how you have to waste energy for Bitcoin,

508
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,883
I just want to be clear, this was on Tezos.

509
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:57,265
That's a different blockchain. It doesn't use proof-of-work.

510
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:59,127
It uses a totally different consensus model.

511
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,028
This did not cause any carbon footprint.

512
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,812
It was really annoying to see that that being the major critique against Ubisoft.

513
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:11,098
Also, the majority of blockchains today don't have proof of work.

514
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:12,900
It's too expensive for them to get proof of work.

515
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,522
Instead they use things like proof of stake.

516
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:18,066
Instead of wasting energy, because you have to waste something for your blockchain to

517
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:21,269
work, instead of wasting energy they waste the time value of money.

518
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:22,270
You lock up your money.

519
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,660
its time value is now in jeopardy.

520
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,243
That's what we're wasting, not energy anymore.

521
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:30,706
And Ethereum, which is proof of work,

522
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:33,829
will be merging to a non-proof of work system

523
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:34,910
very, very, very soon.

524
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,593
So I think that worrying about ESG

525
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:40,375
when there's all this other terrible shit going on

526
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:42,297
in Web3 would not worry about that.

527
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:46,381
And ESG is about the environment side, just to be clear.

528
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:49,985
So yeah, Celo, Algorand, Cosmos, Polkadot, Solana.

529
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:52,907
Don't worry about ESG, worry about other things.

530
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:58,950
Okay, so I promised I'd get to like why Web3 games are cool,

531
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:00,291
what I like about them,

532
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:03,894
and where there's some possibility for salvation.

533
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,616
This is a screenshot from my favorite Web3 game.

534
00:26:08,757 --> 00:26:11,498
In fact, I started an entire decentralized,

535
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:13,159
autonomous organization to play it.

536
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,021
It's called Dark Forest.

537
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:17,723
And it's an open source game.

538
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:23,947
And what I think is possible is that you can make open source a

539
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:29,270
profitable endeavor for all the people who want to contribute to the same code base, no matter who they are, where they are,

540
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:37,114
by paying them using Web3. And by making that copy of open source valuable. So in the same way that

541
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:42,377
Web3 made NFTs, JPEGs, not copy-pastable, created scarcity,

542
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,501
in a visual object, you can create scarcity

543
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:47,341
in a piece of code.

544
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:51,102
And that can let that piece of code get owned

545
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,923
by the people who contributed and built it

546
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:57,365
without having any need for venture funding or studios,

547
00:26:57,445 --> 00:26:59,485
just hobbyists building together.

548
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:02,086
And that's what's happening in Dark Forest.

549
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:03,807
And you likely haven't heard of it

550
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,848
because it is just hobbyists building it together, right?

551
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:07,068
They don't have a marketing budget.

552
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,249
The only people who hear about it are, you know,

553
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:11,810
crypto nerds who get nerd sniped by this thing.

554
00:27:12,228 --> 00:27:14,849
and who hear about other nerds, they respect getting nerds night by this thing.

555
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:25,474
So, unlike games like, and this is what I was studying in university, Skyrim or Little

556
00:27:25,494 --> 00:27:32,417
Big Planet, which depend on suckering players into building levels so that the value of

557
00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:37,259
the game can grow and then capturing that value and not redistributing it to the players

558
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,860
but to investors in the core dev team.

559
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:43,158
So it's not like that, right?

560
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:44,639
It's not an exploitation of playbirth.

561
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,961
Here we can have a game protocol

562
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:50,023
that depends on the players building it,

563
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:52,865
but where the proceeds can go back to those players.

564
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:55,747
That's an interesting switch, right?

565
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:57,408
Because we all love user-generated content.

566
00:27:57,768 --> 00:28:00,771
We just wish the generators of that content

567
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:03,272
could get fairly compensated for it.

568
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:04,714
And it does happen.

569
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:06,976
Again, Dota, I'm a big fan.

570
00:28:07,597 --> 00:28:09,058
The pros who play the international,

571
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:11,200
I pay $15 for a battle pass,

572
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,882
I get to watch them play professionally,

573
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:15,144
they get some amount of that $15,

574
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:16,866
the developers get some amount of that $15,

575
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:18,568
they're laborers, those pros.

576
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:20,089
And they labor for Dota.

577
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,532
They make the game more valuable by playing it.

578
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:26,716
And in the same way, Dark Force takes on that kind of role.

579
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:30,998
To give you a sense just before we go on a little bit more of what Dark Forest is,

580
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,419
it's basically Galcon, if you've ever played that.

581
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,840
Like, take over a planet, planet makes energy, send that energy to another planet,

582
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,241
now you've got two planets making energy.

583
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:41,502
Send those two planets to one bigger one, capture three planets,

584
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:45,884
exponential growth of just like moving across the map.

585
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:50,305
What's cool about Dark Forest, though, is it's played in zero knowledge.

586
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:53,991
What that means is every move you make in this giant world

587
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:57,193
is provably true in how you craft it

588
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:58,954
and present it to the blockchain,

589
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,255
but no one knows what you did.

590
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:01,917
It's like playing chess in the dark.

591
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:03,878
Only once you shine your light

592
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,480
on the spot where that move happened

593
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,841
can you see what happened there for real.

594
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:09,683
That's an interesting feature, right?

595
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:12,345
Because there's no central server to handle fog of war.

596
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:14,446
It's a decentralized on-chain game.

597
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:17,207
No one owns the protocol, so there's

598
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:18,808
no database where I can look up, hey,

599
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:19,948
what's under this fog of war?

600
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:23,869
You have to create fog of war in totally new ways, which

601
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:26,250
is very interesting to see cryptographic primitives do

602
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:26,470
that.

603
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:31,052
And what that means is because there's no central database,

604
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:35,014
there's no core team with superior powers over the game

605
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:42,537
like any other competitive video game where devs can have like a back-end access and knowledge,

606
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:50,983
winning in this game is fair. It's provably fair, right? You just followed the protocol's rules.

607
00:29:51,843 --> 00:29:58,067
And so what the game community does is it awards prizes to the winners.

608
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:06,352
And those prizes are just like NFTs, just like commemorative badges, and they're commemorative NFTs on no syschain.

609
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:10,477
So again, no environmental impact on this chain.

610
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:13,480
And it gets into the top 63.

611
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:17,883
We've never seen a level five, six, or seven planet,

612
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,225
which are the biggest ones, get sold.

613
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:24,469
But they sell for about $15,000 to $40,000, the smaller ones.

614
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,252
I think a big one would sell for a million today,

615
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:30,974
because they're really hard to win at this game.

616
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:33,436
This is an enormous amount of engineering power

617
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:33,997
to come first.

618
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,659
You need to have a good team working

619
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:37,840
around the clock for weeks.

620
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:40,142
And it's sort of like a nerd competition.

621
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:43,525
It's a little like a math Olympiad winning this game.

622
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:45,207
which I think is kind of cool.

623
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:47,510
Provable credentials for the team that wins.

624
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,834
They're able to solve a bunch of cryptographic problems

625
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:51,036
and think deeply about it.

626
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:53,640
At the same time, it's still very playable

627
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,464
for any novice who wants to just struggle

628
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:58,487
through a bit of crypto learning.

629
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:00,169
Okay, so.

630
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,601
In addition to these players winning planets for winning the game,

631
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:12,105
they'll also get rewarded planets for revealing their strategies for how they won.

632
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:14,987
Because often players do crazy things.

633
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:18,350
The winner in round one rewrote the client of the game.

634
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,792
So the whole front end, like they took the open source code

635
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:26,215
and then found the places where there were awaits in move making

636
00:31:26,255 --> 00:31:28,877
and instead of serializing the moves, just parallelized them

637
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:30,158
and was able to just...

638
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:35,125
make more moves faster in changing the code.

639
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:42,251
In round two, the team that won, we don't know what they did.

640
00:31:42,992 --> 00:31:46,755
But in round one, four having revealed the new client,

641
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,217
they won an additional planet.

642
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:58,980
And that's really cool because now you're paying your players to share their improvements on the game with everyone else as a community.

643
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:04,682
So in round three we made like a marketplace so that in-game you could trade your like strategic weapons.

644
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:06,823
There was no marketplace in the game before.

645
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:10,325
The community made the marketplace, the people who made the community, they got a commemorative NFT.

646
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,486
NFTs have no value, right?

647
00:32:12,526 --> 00:32:15,548
They're freely given, but the community ascribes them value

648
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:17,109
through their cachet.

649
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:18,910
Like if you have one of these planets,

650
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,671
it's because you were pretty cool

651
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,072
and did something pretty cool at some point.

652
00:32:22,812 --> 00:32:24,273
And I would like to buy it from you,

653
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,834
not only because I think it's a valuable planet,

654
00:32:25,854 --> 00:32:28,816
but I know I'm funding someone who's building in web three

655
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:30,297
at the cutting edge, right?

656
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:31,818
I feel good about what I'm buying

657
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:34,099
because the people making this game

658
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,841
are like only working on donations.

659
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:43,384
right? They're like A, 16, Z will come up to them at dinner with like a $10 million check at any

660
00:32:43,424 --> 00:32:48,066
valuation they want. And there's like, no, like this is, this belongs to the community. And that's

661
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:53,428
a very different approach, right? In thinking about this. Um, okay. So.

662
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:56,963
Where does this take us, right?

663
00:32:57,003 --> 00:33:01,108
What is the point of Web3 games from this angle?

664
00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:03,650
Because it's hard to make money with it,

665
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:06,033
it's hard to build a new community,

666
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,776
there's no way you can scale this, right?

667
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:11,659
Like these players, these players here,

668
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,082
like you can only handle about 1,000 players at a time,

669
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:15,183
maybe 2,000 at best.

670
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:18,305
And then you'd have to work on new blockchains.

671
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:21,006
And when this game does play, the entire blockchain shuts

672
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:21,226
down.

673
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:22,667
There's no way to use it.

674
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:26,769
You have to pay huge fees to get past the game in order

675
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:28,129
to get your transactions through.

676
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,571
And that's one of the fundamental problems

677
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:31,891
with Web3 games.

678
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:34,432
So it won't be a retail sensation.

679
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:37,234
It'll be a niche community of super engineers

680
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:39,935
who maybe are building up their CVs in the way

681
00:33:39,975 --> 00:33:41,896
that people build their CVs with GitHub repos.

682
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,240
So not thoroughly exciting in that way.

683
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:48,942
If they're gonna be valuable, these kinds of games,

684
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,203
they're gonna do different things

685
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:52,784
than what normal games do.

686
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,785
They're gonna stress test new blockchains.

687
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:58,327
They're going to be training grounds for new engineers.

688
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:01,728
They're going to be credentials for CVs.

689
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:06,091
They're not going to be these new fun times

690
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,291
that reach 40 million players.

691
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:09,873
It's just like not possible to put on-chain games

692
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:10,953
to 40 million players.

693
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:17,808
which is sad. It's like a sad truth, like really a big bummer. I'm sad about it every day, actually.

694
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:25,736
Instead, we're going to see a lot more of this, right? A lot more games that rely on some

695
00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:33,984
centralized organization, running a normal web2 game, and then pushing some data to the

696
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:36,566
chain to get some financialization of players.

697
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:40,116
That's the that's the fundamental premise here

698
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:44,401
this is just way more popular we get way more of it and

699
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:47,806
these games are

700
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,930
Serving as user acquisition to their underlying blockchains

701
00:34:52,692 --> 00:34:56,677
So what's good for Axie is they own the blockchain they're acquiring users to

702
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:00,947
But when I go downstairs and look at all the booths of all the people who are making games

703
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:03,288
on someone else's blockchain, I get really worried.

704
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:07,609
Because I don't know how you're going to capture the value.

705
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,091
Maybe through a wallet that will start taking fees at the wallet level.

706
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:16,293
But certainly the people who are going to capture the value are the blockchains that

707
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:17,694
are under that level, right?

708
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:21,456
And so if you are making one of these games, make sure you talk to that blockchain and

709
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:24,018
you ask for a lot of money because you're doing them a huge service.

710
00:35:24,638 --> 00:35:28,881
And well, that's something that I do for the companies I help, right?

711
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,402
So this is me again.

712
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:35,004
What I do in real life is I run an accelerator for Web3 games.

713
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:38,086
I help game companies stop making games on Web3

714
00:35:38,126 --> 00:35:40,387
or help Web2 companies start making games in Web3,

715
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,508
depending on the use cases and what they need.

716
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:43,468
So the

717
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:51,802
You know, it's so hard to get it through in one chat,

718
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:54,083
but basically we have guilds

719
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:56,965
who are managing thousands of players now

720
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:58,846
because those players are playing to earn

721
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,307
in these sort of pyramid schemes

722
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:01,908
and they're able to take wealth out.

723
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:04,169
Those guilds help connect them to players,

724
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:06,570
and sorry, to game makers.

725
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,772
I maintain a large collection of those.

726
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:11,954
Also the studios that are in charge of game making.

727
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:15,917
or the entities in Metro Engagemaking at all the layer ones,

728
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:17,839
so like Solana, Celo, Algorand, whatever,

729
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:21,342
the whole list, Terra, maintain relations with those,

730
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:25,325
trying to get people who are in this space to safely

731
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,970
and not scammily, hopefully, as best as we can,

732
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,293
try and make things like this.

733
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,876
That's the sort of state of the industry for now.

734
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:41,022
Look, I want to leave a lot of room for questions.

735
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,003
The sort of possibility space of where this talk can go

736
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:46,464
will be very long, and I'll give really long-winded answers

737
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:47,564
to your questions, hopefully.

738
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:53,026
So if you do have any, please feel free to ask.

739
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:55,727
Yeah, that's my talk.

740
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:56,387
Thanks.

741
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:09,193
Test, test, all right, hey.

742
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:11,476
Thanks, this was a really insightful talk.

743
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:12,397
It helped me a lot.

744
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:15,139
One of the things that I've been trying

745
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,961
to wrap my head around is...

746
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:23,126
whether blockchain offers something that databases don't,

747
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:25,828
like a standard database doesn't offer,

748
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:29,691
to a company like Microsoft or a major game publisher.

749
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:32,693
Why would they choose, for example,

750
00:37:32,773 --> 00:37:36,916
to try to, I don't know, put the Arbiter's Sword

751
00:37:37,076 --> 00:37:39,018
in the hands of a Call of Duty player

752
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:42,941
using blockchain as opposed to a database of some sort?

753
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,899
It doesn't seem to me like it makes any sense.

754
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:48,919
Like, why would you do that?

755
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,260
But anyway, that's my question.

756
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,701
That's an excellent question.

757
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:53,441
And the reason it doesn't make sense

758
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:56,323
is because it doesn't make sense for the most part.

759
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:59,244
So there've been a lot of attempts

760
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:01,366
to make centralized blockchains

761
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:03,627
over the last seven or eight years.

762
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:06,288
Enterprise blockchains, we call them.

763
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:09,190
It's sort of ridiculous

764
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,531
because the point of a blockchain, right,

765
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:14,632
was to make a uncensorable

766
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,957
Right? Like, government fighting machine.

767
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:20,301
And as soon as you centralize it,

768
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:23,467
then the government can just lean on the company that's centralizedly owning it

769
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,890
and say, stop. And it's over.

770
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:36,717
So as soon as you centralize a blockchain, there's every benefit that it could have had from, you know, allowing people to, you know, guarantee certain things about their NFTs not moving or changing.

771
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:37,978
Gone, out the window.

772
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:42,299
So there's literally zero reason for a centralized blockchain, like none.

773
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:50,823
If Microsoft can somehow get a decentralized consortium of people that's so decentralized that a government couldn't stop it,

774
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:54,784
Then you enable regulation circumvention.

775
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,626
You enable things like what we call regulatory arbitrage,

776
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:01,448
finding opportunities against Web 2.0 companies

777
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,929
because they have to follow the rules that Web 3.0 companies don't.

778
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,350
But the thing is, Microsoft is a publicly traded company.

779
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:08,552
If it starts to break any kind of rules,

780
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:12,193
it's going to be in deep trouble and it has a lot of money to pay fines.

781
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:14,134
And so it's a good target to go after.

782
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,576
So I would be very nervous.

783
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:22,957
about seeing as something like that. I do think that the disruptors in this industry will not be

784
00:39:23,617 --> 00:39:27,698
like classic web 2 companies. They'll be companies that can take a lot more regulatory risk,

785
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:32,899
at least for the near foreseeable future. And then, so then a normal database is great.

786
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,941
Take that sword from this dragon game and put it in this gun game. Like, that's cool.

787
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:44,819
And make your database publicly available and open API

788
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:46,759
and let people come in and use it

789
00:39:46,939 --> 00:39:49,160
and have other people use that item

790
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,682
and build a marketplace in web two.

791
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:52,882
Like you can build all these normal things.

792
00:39:52,942 --> 00:40:00,125
So the only other real reason is that it might be cheaper.

793
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:03,627
Like there's so much free work being done in web three,

794
00:40:03,827 --> 00:40:05,928
so much open source code available.

795
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,412
you can just use that infrastructure,

796
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,713
even though it's like fundamentally worse

797
00:40:09,753 --> 00:40:10,954
and wasn't made for this purpose,

798
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:14,317
as a sort of leapfrog cheat

799
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:15,618
and not have to build anything yourself.

800
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:18,260
I can see sometimes like a really operational reason

801
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,821
like that be there.

802
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:27,713
Hey. Yes, I'm honestly still kind of confused on the value of like some of these NFTs. Just

803
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:35,401
taking the example up here. Oh yeah. So you own these characters on that particular blockchain,

804
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,804
which sounds like the blockchain itself is owned by a company.

805
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:38,785
Yeah.

806
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:45,427
Even if the blockchain survives, if the game were to shut down, right, where does the value

807
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:46,407
come from?

808
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:49,509
The fact that you own these characters, but the game itself is gone.

809
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:50,109
Sure, sure, sure.

810
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:54,010
So my argument is that the company has value, not these assets.

811
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,471
These assets actually have gone down in value dramatically.

812
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:02,533
I bought these with company dollars, sorry, company, for $2,000, I think.

813
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:04,934
I think they're worth like $300 today.

814
00:41:07,475 --> 00:41:18,455
These objects are loss leaders to getting more players onto a platform that can do all of this.

815
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:24,637
If you get players to use your app as the front end to finance,

816
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:29,338
especially when those players come from a world where they don't have access to

817
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:34,499
banking, lending, trading, swapping, leveraging, shorting,

818
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:37,540
you get to be the owner of all the fees they're going to pay.

819
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,780
The lifetime value of your players is huge.

820
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,281
And so the company that made this game owns those players,

821
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:46,101
owns the front end those players have to this unregulated financial sector,

822
00:41:46,822 --> 00:41:48,862
and those players don't live in the USA.

823
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:51,084
where there's an enormous amount of regulation.

824
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,205
They live in places where you can actually get around a lot of these problems.

825
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:58,507
And so that's why there's a lot of value that can be captured.

826
00:41:59,087 --> 00:41:59,287
Right?

827
00:41:59,928 --> 00:42:01,128
When people valued these...

828
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:06,689
at $2,000. The reason was really weird. So you'll have to bear with me as I do with my hands.

829
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:11,351
So imagine a world where there's three Axies only. That's what you need to field a team.

830
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:16,873
Okay, but we'll call those three Axies one Axie for the sake of my model. There's one Axie. And

831
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:22,376
this Axie makes SLP, smooth love potions. That's the currency in the game. If it plays the single

832
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:26,618
player campaign, it gets some smooth love potions. If you want to make another Axie,

833
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:29,239
you'll need a certain amount of smooth love potions and breed your Axie.

834
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,695
If I want my friend to play, I need to give them smooth love potions or breed them an exe.

835
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:39,178
They're scarce. They're a limited number. The protocol sort of limits the number.

836
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,447
So that smooth love potion scarcity leads to an increase in value of smooth love potion.

837
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:51,831
And my friend doesn't want to play that badly. Maybe he'll buy it for $2.

838
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,874
But someone hears, wait a second, you played this game for a day and made two bucks, right, playing?

839
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:00,595
That's crazy, I want an Axie too.

840
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:04,818
But now, okay, two or three people want to do this, the price has gone up.

841
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:08,020
Because demand has gone up and the supply of Axies is still really constrained.

842
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:10,923
So now there's, you know, three dollars for an Axie.

843
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:14,854
Some new people here, $3 a day, that's 50% better.

844
00:43:15,514 --> 00:43:16,314
10 people want to play now.

845
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,656
Because there's 10, demand spikes,

846
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,057
value of an axie spikes in the market.

847
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:25,919
And what happens is this crazy funnel problem

848
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:29,901
happens where these things spike to hundreds or thousands

849
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:32,182
of dollars as there was not enough supply to meet demand.

850
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:33,343
And because they were so expensive,

851
00:43:33,763 --> 00:43:35,764
demand grew because people thought you could

852
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:36,544
make more money with them.

853
00:43:37,185 --> 00:43:42,230
But like a pyramid scheme, eventually you reach a point where the number of axes is growing exponentially,

854
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,512
because each one you make can make more.

855
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:47,756
And the number of players coming in isn't growing as exponentially.

856
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:53,102
There's a sort of stop where we have huge amounts of inflation of axes,

857
00:43:53,222 --> 00:43:55,965
and then the price just goes as close to zero as it can.

858
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:59,950
over time. So they don't have value.

859
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:04,255
Right. They have a limited value through people who miscalculate

860
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:07,618
where they are in the pyramid. Right. That's and that's very

861
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,200
dangerous. Right. And you want to protect players and kids

862
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:13,924
from like huge mistakes in their financial decision making.

863
00:44:16,264 --> 00:44:18,726
So yeah, no value in owning the front end.

864
00:44:18,746 --> 00:44:20,948
In the same way that Facebook is like the internet

865
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:22,109
for many people, right?

866
00:44:22,149 --> 00:44:25,231
Where the Facebook app is their interface to the internet,

867
00:44:25,591 --> 00:44:27,653
Facebook owns those people, owns their marketplace,

868
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:32,036
or the way WeChat in China owns all the marketplaces

869
00:44:32,176 --> 00:44:34,598
of the people using it, Axie will be a super app.

870
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,039
It'll be your social media network,

871
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:37,540
it'll be your bank, et cetera.

872
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:39,722
And so this is a loss leader Ponzi scheme

873
00:44:39,782 --> 00:44:40,943
that attracts lots of players.

874
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:43,485
I think that's the way to have the mental model.

875
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:44,266
Does that make sense?

876
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:44,926
Yep.

877
00:44:45,326 --> 00:44:45,446
Great.

878
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:47,448
Hey, over here.

879
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:50,771
Sorry, I just wanted to clarify what you said earlier.

880
00:44:50,871 --> 00:44:58,679
So you're saying that the value of these NFTs or these tokens in general are basically they

881
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,239
don't exist.

882
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,024
And the only value is to the company who initially started it and fronted the whole thing because

883
00:45:04,044 --> 00:45:05,245
they got the profit immediately.

884
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:05,546
And then it.

885
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:11,212
eventually all of this. Oh, no. Yeah, sorry. I'll clarify that. So the company actually made no

886
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:16,974
money off these NFTs almost. These NFTs, when you make the SLP and create the Axie and sell it,

887
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:21,775
you get 95% of the profits for what you sold it for. And the players were the ones creating them.

888
00:45:22,335 --> 00:45:25,616
That's what created the economic flywheel and the incentive to play in the first place. They

889
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:31,078
just took a 5% cut of the sale. Sure. OK. So then my follow up would be like, so then what is...

890
00:45:33,037 --> 00:45:37,420
I guess the overall purpose of adding these in the first place is just like artificially,

891
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,203
essentially generating like a small amount of income before it disseminates again

892
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:42,964
and there was no point in the first place.

893
00:45:43,722 --> 00:45:45,922
Sorry, I didn't understand the question. Can you repeat it again?

894
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:50,044
So the way it sounded like was, and maybe I misunderstood, was

895
00:45:51,004 --> 00:45:54,265
the value you're getting from these tokens that you made

896
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:56,926
are like very small and then

897
00:45:57,706 --> 00:46:01,048
it's only given to like, you know, set amount of players at the beginning or something

898
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:04,169
and then slowly over time, you know, even these don't have value anymore.

899
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:08,810
So then what was the purpose of like adding this extra, like a lot of effort actually, to like

900
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:10,811
integrating this into your game?

901
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:17,598
Right. So the reason was it was like a multi-level marketing scheme.

902
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:21,399
So it's a go to market user acquisition strategy.

903
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,440
So if I tell you you can play this game and make $100 a day,

904
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,641
you will download this app and you will play it for $100 a day.

905
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:31,762
Almost like a huge number of people or $300 a month.

906
00:46:31,862 --> 00:46:33,142
I think that's what it was at its maximum.

907
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:39,534
And so people actually weren't buying the Axies, it turns out,

908
00:46:39,554 --> 00:46:40,395
because they couldn't afford them.

909
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:41,255
They were too expensive.

910
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:43,716
So these organizations called guilds went out,

911
00:46:43,856 --> 00:46:47,037
bought the Axies, and then lent them to players

912
00:46:47,097 --> 00:46:51,518
to play for money, and took a cut of that money

913
00:46:52,198 --> 00:46:53,299
and gave the rest to the players.

914
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:54,979
And the players just made money playing,

915
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,000
money that was brought in from new players coming in

916
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,681
wanting to play.

917
00:46:58,921 --> 00:46:59,021
But.

918
00:47:00,021 --> 00:47:01,182
At a certain point, they weren't new players,

919
00:47:01,202 --> 00:47:02,182
they were just new businesses.

920
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:04,304
Like taxi cab medallions.

921
00:47:04,384 --> 00:47:05,765
Like I'm a company that owns medallions,

922
00:47:06,245 --> 00:47:07,766
I lend the medallions out to my drivers

923
00:47:08,146 --> 00:47:10,088
who go and drive for money, and then I take a cut.

924
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,850
Now, those guilds ended up holding a lot of Axies

925
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,151
that dropped a lot in value, especially the later ones.

926
00:47:16,332 --> 00:47:18,793
They sort of got, you know, cleaned out.

927
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:21,995
But what happened is those guilds were like,

928
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:23,336
oh my god, this is profitable.

929
00:47:23,576 --> 00:47:26,158
Like I buy an Axie, I get a player to play this game,

930
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:28,179
and now I make money and that player makes money.

931
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:34,470
And all of a sudden you have a company that didn't have a marketing team,

932
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,453
didn't need a marketing team to acquire new players, right?

933
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:40,376
Cottage industries emerged to acquire new players for them.

934
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:44,860
So they went from having like 200,000 players

935
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,702
to like 5 million players in the span of a month.

936
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:52,346
on this kind of model. So why user acquisition? That's the why.

937
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:59,371
Because the pyramid entices people to come join thinking they're going to make money. And the same reason why do people join

938
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:02,753
normal pyramid schemes? They think they're going to make money. And in this case

939
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:07,977
they did because the people who lost the money weren't the players for the most part. They were these guilds. I did it.

940
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:09,558
I hope that makes sense.

941
00:48:10,843 --> 00:48:11,864
Over here, and we'll go over here.

942
00:48:11,884 --> 00:48:16,426
A few of the things I've been hearing over this week as the benefits of building on a

943
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:19,848
blockchain are the interoperability and the ownership components.

944
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:25,711
I was just wondering how you factor interoperability into your mental model, thinking about these

945
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:27,411
as funneling users to DeFi.

946
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:33,494
Sure, that's a great question. So just to clarify, interoperability is this powerful concept, right?

947
00:48:33,554 --> 00:48:43,017
Because this ledger is open, right, anybody can read what you're holding as assets, right?

948
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:47,579
And, you know, the Steam Marketplace is interoperable. For a while, you could even,

949
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:51,080
like, gamble with your, like, CSGO skins on, like, gambling websites

950
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:53,881
because the API was so interoperable and powerful.

951
00:48:55,104 --> 00:48:59,668
So the improbability isn't novel to crypto.

952
00:49:00,048 --> 00:49:01,309
We can have it anywhere we want.

953
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:05,713
It's default in crypto, so that's one thing.

954
00:49:07,095 --> 00:49:14,421
The other thing is interoperability is also a promise

955
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:16,023
that keeps getting unfulfilled.

956
00:49:16,643 --> 00:49:19,966
So if I'm a game developer that makes money selling NFTs,

957
00:49:22,144 --> 00:49:23,325
and now I've made that money,

958
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:26,347
it's strange to think there'll be another game developer

959
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:29,410
who will use the NFTs I made the money on, right?

960
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,251
Like, they make them passes to their game.

961
00:49:32,232 --> 00:49:36,195
The answer could be they wanna siphon off my players, right?

962
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,456
Say, hey, if you hold this NFT,

963
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,891
Here's a cool perk in this other game.

964
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:42,732
And so it can be a way to user acquire.

965
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:44,092
Say people who own this asset,

966
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:45,753
come to me, I'll give you a reward.

967
00:49:46,614 --> 00:49:47,274
That might be why.

968
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:50,596
The other cool thing though, beyond interoperability,

969
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:54,798
and this is a big part of DeFi, is composability.

970
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:58,140
So I like to think of interoperability as

971
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,861
you can read data,

972
00:50:02,022 --> 00:50:03,963
but composability is you can activate logic.

973
00:50:04,787 --> 00:50:09,590
So when you use Aave to borrow Maker,

974
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:13,813
what you're doing is actually asking one program

975
00:50:14,493 --> 00:50:16,514
to activate the code in another program.

976
00:50:17,355 --> 00:50:19,716
And when programs start not just interoperating

977
00:50:19,756 --> 00:50:20,557
by reading their data,

978
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:22,418
but using their logic across themselves,

979
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:24,740
you might get an explosion of value.

980
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,882
And that is what's happening in Dark Forest, right?

981
00:50:28,963 --> 00:50:31,544
The composability here, as with,

982
00:50:31,664 --> 00:50:32,685
like for instance in round,

983
00:50:33,977 --> 00:50:36,722
Four, we made a smart contract player in our guild.

984
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:39,206
The player was just a piece of code.

985
00:50:39,386 --> 00:50:40,508
It couldn't really play the game,

986
00:50:40,608 --> 00:50:42,371
but what it could do is if you gave it a planet,

987
00:50:42,391 --> 00:50:44,274
it would cash out its points and give the planet back.

988
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:47,664
And we had like 54 strangers, I think,

989
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:51,606
like give this planet, this smart contract, their planets.

990
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:53,227
It cashed out their points,

991
00:50:53,788 --> 00:50:55,949
then kept track of how many points they each gave it.

992
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:59,211
And then when it came 33rd on its own,

993
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,072
with the help of these other players,

994
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:03,493
it could then like give that NFT to them pro rata

995
00:51:03,533 --> 00:51:04,594
for the points they gave, right?

996
00:51:04,634 --> 00:51:06,755
So that's really powerful, composability.

997
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:08,075
Interoperability.

998
00:51:09,116 --> 00:51:12,640
is less interesting and also more possible.

999
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,523
Whereas composability is really hard in Web 2.0.

1000
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:17,746
Like, it's hard to use the logic of Dota in another game.

1001
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,249
Like, I don't know how you would get past the walled garden,

1002
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:21,351
if that makes sense.

1003
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:23,153
Yeah, thank you.

1004
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:23,974
Over here.

1005
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,886
Yeah, thank you for the great talk.

1006
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:29,608
So it sounds like you've described this life cycle

1007
00:51:29,668 --> 00:51:34,552
of those games like Axie, where everything's great

1008
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,034
at the beginning, more and people start joining, joining,

1009
00:51:37,114 --> 00:51:38,475
and eventually it collapses, right?

1010
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:40,557
Do you think that's just like forever what's gonna be,

1011
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:42,178
or do you think there's a way out of this cycle?

1012
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:43,559
Great question.

1013
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,123
There's a way to make your pyramid longer

1014
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:50,225
so it explodes later.

1015
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,926
You can tweak the economics that way.

1016
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:53,827
It means giving up less money earlier.

1017
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:57,023
There are ways to...

1018
00:52:00,926 --> 00:52:02,107
Look, here's what it is.

1019
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:06,751
Axie was paying players to play alone in their basements.

1020
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:08,832
That makes no sense.

1021
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,194
Because you're not creating value when you play alone in your basement.

1022
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:13,758
or outside.

1023
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:16,180
You create value when you bring new players in.

1024
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,341
You create value when you Twitch stream.

1025
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:21,063
You create new value when you run an e-sports tournament

1026
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,805
and people pay to watch it.

1027
00:52:23,825 --> 00:52:25,306
You create value when you build a mod

1028
00:52:25,546 --> 00:52:26,607
and people like to play with it.

1029
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:29,929
And if you create value, Web3 can capture it

1030
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:30,629
and redistribute it.

1031
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,531
That's a powerful feature of Web3.

1032
00:52:34,657 --> 00:52:39,340
In the case of Axie, by giving out value for things that weren't creating, it's an unsustainable model.

1033
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,223
It's like Uber paying you every time you take a cab ride.

1034
00:52:43,444 --> 00:52:46,246
Doesn't make sense, but Uber did pay you when you brought a new user onto the platform.

1035
00:52:46,686 --> 00:52:47,427
That does make sense.

1036
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:54,873
So as long as you can make sure that the value coming in is greater than the value going out,

1037
00:52:56,074 --> 00:52:59,496
then you can maybe guess that it's a sustainable model.

1038
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:01,698
I think that's a fair way to think about it.

1039
00:53:02,419 --> 00:53:02,619
Thanks.

1040
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:06,729
But, just real quick, but eventually you're going to run out of users, right?

1041
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:07,209
What?

1042
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,391
Eventually you're going to run out of new users, right?

1043
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:12,114
Yeah, yeah, you eventually run out of new users, so what you need is those users to

1044
00:53:12,154 --> 00:53:14,536
start paying money, right?

1045
00:53:14,576 --> 00:53:19,060
Like I pay $15 to Dota to watch the International, right?

1046
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,362
Dota isn't paying me, it's paying the pros, right?

1047
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:25,185
So they keep getting paid money as long as new players are bringing in money.

1048
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,686
You have to capture value eventually.

1049
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:29,928
What's interesting about Axie is it can start capturing value

1050
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:33,451
in the financial instrument side and funnel that to the game

1051
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:33,711
side.

1052
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:36,073
The game could be the loss leader

1053
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:39,335
that you keep funding through other ways of capturing value

1054
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:42,417
because it's part of a rich ecosystem that

1055
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:44,619
boggles the mind of a normal game maker, right?

1056
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,800
Because you're never a game maker and a bank.

1057
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,682
And then all of a sudden, that's what we're expecting you to be.

1058
00:53:49,882 --> 00:53:50,163
Awesome.

1059
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:50,863
Thank you so much.

1060
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:51,484
Hey, my pleasure.

1061
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:54,906
Hello.

1062
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:55,406
Hi.

1063
00:53:56,888 --> 00:54:01,290
In terms of the con, the overall con that you're describing that, you know, these are

1064
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:07,091
games are UA to be on these blockchains and then you essentially people that don't have banks have

1065
00:54:07,131 --> 00:54:12,792
banks. So the overall con about you building Web3 games that I understood from your talk,

1066
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:18,794
isn't that how technology in general is in terms of the business? For example, Facebook,

1067
00:54:19,254 --> 00:54:21,215
they provide this value to users.

1068
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,898
But they want your data, that's how they make their money.

1069
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:26,702
They're not expecting you to pay and get you to make money.

1070
00:54:27,203 --> 00:54:30,167
Amazon, you can buy things really easily from them.

1071
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,741
and it's convenient and so you use them primarily for how you consume and make your shops.

1072
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:41,722
But they're not making money from the products you're purchasing, they're gathering your

1073
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:46,723
data and then using that data to feed all of the side businesses that they create.

1074
00:54:47,443 --> 00:54:55,285
It just seems that it's expected that blockchains will have this secondary value which is the

1075
00:54:55,365 --> 00:55:00,566
primary value for them by having games being, well, using their blockchain.

1076
00:55:01,347 --> 00:55:05,671
Right. So, and so that's, that's, that's exactly what I'm saying.

1077
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:06,112
Okay.

1078
00:55:06,312 --> 00:55:11,978
Like, I think, I think you've got it. So if you're just making the game part, that's like just making

1079
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:19,426
the social media platform without any of the ads part, right? Like, you'll, that's unsustainable.

1080
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:23,029
you need to have a second source of revenue.

1081
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:27,331
Otherwise, there's no reason to make it on-chain anyway in the first place.

1082
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:30,653
Like, you should just make a Web2 game and create value just through fun.

1083
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:35,737
What's happening here is Axie's creating value by doing user acquisition.

1084
00:55:36,437 --> 00:55:41,319
So it's not about data here, it's about, it could eventually be about data, but it's really

1085
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:45,541
about this huge friction barrier of getting people into Web3.

1086
00:55:46,101 --> 00:55:48,902
Because once you get a Web3 user, they're worth so much money.

1087
00:55:50,002 --> 00:55:54,844
So yeah, I think it's expected when you think critically, but people aren't thinking critically

1088
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:55,244
about this.

1089
00:55:55,444 --> 00:55:59,286
People really thought, like you could read these articles, they really thought Axie had

1090
00:55:59,346 --> 00:56:00,206
solved the problem.

1091
00:56:00,532 --> 00:56:06,882
Universal basic income like the entire global south was just gonna play video games and make a living for the rest of their lives

1092
00:56:06,962 --> 00:56:09,386
I seriously like non-stop could hear this and I was just like this

1093
00:56:10,028 --> 00:56:14,775
Why do you believe this the laws of physics can't allow for this and yet like that's so that's that's what I'm iterating here

1094
00:56:14,816 --> 00:56:14,996
I guess

1095
00:56:15,274 --> 00:56:18,496
Yeah, I think Axie is one of the examples in the space.

1096
00:56:18,596 --> 00:56:23,659
And, you know, I think there is a difference when you have game designers

1097
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,762
who are experienced in building game economies, that they could find a way

1098
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:32,325
to make it where the financial play of it is just another aspect of fun and not.

1099
00:56:33,225 --> 00:56:37,648
I don't think everyone believe that play to earn is just a thing

1100
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:38,909
and you can live off making games.

1101
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:41,351
I think there's a percentage that believe that.

1102
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:41,931
I don't know.

1103
00:56:41,991 --> 00:56:44,272
Do you think that everyone's just expected to?

1104
00:56:45,687 --> 00:56:52,054
During the hype phase it was pretty intense and then it went from play to earn to play and earn and like people are on

1105
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:56,039
You know changing the message as they learn it and figure out what works. But yeah, like

1106
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,763
There are games where the economy is the fun

1107
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:03,353
for sure, like EVE Online. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I was thinking that.

1108
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:08,277
Yeah. And there's a great book, by the way, called Virtual Economies by Vili Ladanvirta.

1109
00:57:09,237 --> 00:57:14,060
It's so good. And he talks about this, right, and that often game makers are going to give

1110
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,641
a little bit of currency to their players.

1111
00:57:16,442 --> 00:57:20,745
just so they can see the economic engine that's there and how enticing it is.

1112
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:23,487
So certainly there are blockchain games doing that.

1113
00:57:24,327 --> 00:57:27,750
And as long as the loop is closed and there's no value bleeding out,

1114
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:29,311
like that can keep happening.

1115
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:31,853
But what's happening is these blockchain games, because they're on-chain

1116
00:57:31,893 --> 00:57:34,695
and they're interoperable and composable with all of DeFi,

1117
00:57:34,855 --> 00:57:36,396
the tokens in that game are sellable.

1118
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:42,036
And if people are selling tokens, that means someone else is buying.

1119
00:57:42,236 --> 00:57:43,896
And if they're buying because they want to make more money,

1120
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:48,518
in the way that I buy milkshakes from the milkshake person above me in the pyramid,

1121
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,879
so I can sell more milkshakes to the people below me, that will collapse.

1122
00:57:52,179 --> 00:57:55,540
And so, yes, there's definitely a way to make a more sustainable economy.

1123
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,521
And hopefully we'll see them soon.

1124
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,922
But when you do, those sustainable economies are less viral.

1125
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:07,767
So they don't satisfy that purpose of loss leader for user acquisition.

1126
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:09,168
Thank you.

1127
00:58:09,348 --> 00:58:10,189
Thank you so much for your questions.

1128
00:58:13,131 --> 00:58:13,251
Hi.

1129
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:21,178
I want to ask if blockchain games could be a good solution to have people play PVP for

1130
00:58:21,238 --> 00:58:21,938
money basically.

1131
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:27,723
So let's suppose Clash Royale, you go in and you bet $1 before the match and the winner

1132
00:58:27,763 --> 00:58:28,043
takes $1.9.

1133
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,587
Yeah, that is a good use case.

1134
00:58:32,328 --> 00:58:33,930
Because the game isn't unchained.

1135
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:36,732
The thing is, that's...

1136
00:58:38,296 --> 00:58:38,736
Gambling.

1137
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:42,538
So there's a lot of laws you got to worry about.

1138
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:45,420
Even if it's like an entirely skill-based game,

1139
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,840
there are probably laws you have to worry about.

1140
00:58:47,381 --> 00:58:49,862
Also, there's KYC problems.

1141
00:58:50,062 --> 00:58:50,802
So you're not used to it.

1142
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:53,243
But you don't want to fund terrorism

1143
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,964
through this channel of moving money.

1144
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,266
So you become like a virtual asset service provider

1145
00:58:58,366 --> 00:58:59,527
or a money service business.

1146
00:58:59,547 --> 00:59:01,167
So it is doable.

1147
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:03,349
It's just.

1148
00:59:04,509 --> 00:59:07,772
you have to figure out what you're gaining over just a dollar, right?

1149
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:10,534
Like, why not just put a dollar in the account and move the dollar over?

1150
00:59:11,294 --> 00:59:13,957
And if what you think you're gaining is regulatory arbitrage,

1151
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,097
the answer is probably no.

1152
00:59:15,157 --> 00:59:18,320
You're probably not gaining much because you're exposing yourself.

1153
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:22,143
So to regulatory scrutiny.

1154
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:28,328
Right, because I was thinking of building that in our PvP game, adding the ability to play.

1155
00:59:29,147 --> 00:59:34,429
entering the room with tokens, then the winner takes like 90% of the tokens. The other 10%

1156
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:41,933
goes to fund eSports tournaments and also the dev team and the expenses. But you say it's going to

1157
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:46,035
be a regulatory problem. Yeah, I would say you're going to have a lot of regulatory problems.

1158
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:51,178
What about skills? What? Skills is basically doing the cash-based tournaments.

1159
00:59:52,787 --> 00:59:54,807
Yeah, look, I mean, I'm not your lawyer.

1160
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:57,788
I can't tell you, but I'd be worried.

1161
00:59:58,029 --> 00:59:59,169
I would just like, it raises,

1162
00:59:59,249 --> 01:00:00,969
I think it's cool to explore it.

1163
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:02,670
I think it might be more efficient,

1164
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,971
especially if you want that gambling to use in-game tokens

1165
01:00:06,631 --> 01:00:07,912
that are usable in your own economy,

1166
01:00:08,312 --> 01:00:09,712
and a more smooth thing,

1167
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:11,533
but particularly more efficient

1168
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:13,594
if that's gonna be your way of onboarding users

1169
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:15,114
to financializing them.

1170
01:00:15,854 --> 01:00:17,155
If on top of letting them gamble,

1171
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:18,555
you also let them swap assets,

1172
01:00:18,855 --> 01:00:21,136
and then take fees on that, make more money that way.

1173
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:22,097
Okay.

1174
01:00:22,294 --> 01:00:27,778
Yeah. Thank you. Okay. That's all we got for today, everybody. Thank you so much for attending.
