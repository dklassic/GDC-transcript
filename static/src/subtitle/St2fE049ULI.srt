1
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:11,198
stuff. So, and we're just going to kick this off and this is going to go pretty quickly.

2
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:16,502
So yeah, thanks for coming. My name is Clint Hocking and today's talk is about dynamics.

3
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,285
But before we get started, I feel it's important to warn you that by the time this talk is

4
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:23,627
over, everyone in this room is going to think I'm a communist. So we might as well get that

5
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:27,930
out of the way right now. Over the course of this talk, I'm going to espouse to you

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,594
the virtues of contemporary Cuban urban agriculture. I'm going to mesmerize you with images from

7
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:33,955
the proud history of Soviet cinema.

8
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:37,289
and I'm going to convince you that some of the most beloved American heroes, guys like

9
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:42,631
Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Edison, are also communists. I might even talk about some communist

10
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:46,552
games, like Tetris, and by the time I'm finished, you're all going to be signing up to join

11
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:50,794
the party and await the reanimation of our once and future leader in revolution. You've

12
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:56,116
been warned. I'm also going to talk a lot about elephants for some reason. Dynamics.

13
00:00:56,436 --> 00:01:00,498
Why do I want to talk about dynamics? Well, mostly, this is a talk that I've been wanting

14
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,759
to give and actually trying to give for a long time, but it's a really difficult talk.

15
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:10,127
Also because dynamics are pretty central to games, I really wanted to make sure I was going to have the time to do it right.

16
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:13,029
And the last few years have been kind of mental for me.

17
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:18,952
I got married, I shipped Far Cry 2, I went on honeymoon in Africa, where I had absolutely no problem with responding guard posts,

18
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:21,094
but I did almost get killed by a rampaging elephant.

19
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:28,138
I fucked up my back, I got better, I lost 50 pounds, I left my job at Ubisoft, I took a job at LucasArts, I immigrated to the US, and I had a kid all in two years.

20
00:01:29,178 --> 00:01:30,539
So, the good news is that...

21
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,593
Now that I have like 15 years worth of like crazy life changes, all packaged up and out of the way,

22
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,916
I finally feel like I have the time to give this talk the rigor it deserves.

23
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:44,000
The bad news is, my son must be part hobbit or something, because he has these really big feet,

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,903
and I have all these jammies with feet in them that don't fit, and little baby shoes that he's never worn,

25
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:51,505
and so if you're looking for baby shoes, check on Craigslist.

26
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:57,330
Anyway, the thing that really kicked my ass to buckle down and tackle this talk finally was,

27
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,152
back in 2009, Chris Hecker gave a GDC talk.

28
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,234
and that picture's not actually from there, but,

29
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:04,816
where he said he felt one of the most important

30
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:06,637
near-term questions for game development

31
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,278
and for game researchers

32
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:09,900
was to answer the question,

33
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,601
how do games mean, right?

34
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:14,123
And I'm not a game researcher guy,

35
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:15,524
but I'm gonna give that a shot anyway.

36
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:19,086
When trying to understand games as a cultural form,

37
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:21,708
we often talk about the meaning of specific games.

38
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:23,510
We ask, like, what does Thief mean?

39
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,730
Or what does Go mean?

40
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,191
Or what does Far Cry 2 mean?

41
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,033
And, you know, putting aside for a moment the fact that...

42
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,830
The answers to those questions are definitely subjective.

43
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:34,753
The problem with even asking them is that we haven't even come close to agreement on

44
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:39,435
what the sort of power plant of meaning generation is in games in general, right?

45
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,638
Some people will say thief is about territory control or domination or collection.

46
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:48,720
Others will say it's about a thief named Garrett caught in the midst of a conflict between

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,402
like progressive industrialists and like anarcho-naturalists or something.

48
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:54,363
Some will say it's both and some will say neither.

49
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:55,844
And until we have some kind of consensus...

50
00:02:56,431 --> 00:03:02,274
on how games can even be about anything at all, we're kind of wasting words, right? We

51
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:07,336
need to understand how games mean before we can really talk in a sophisticated way about

52
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:14,539
what a specific game means. So this is Topsy the Elephant. Back in 1903, Topsy got in some

53
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:18,721
trouble for, like, trampling to death a bunch of trainers, you know, at Four Paws Circus

54
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:19,522
out on Coney Island.

55
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:25,989
This was right around the time that Thomas Edison was leveraging sort of his many patents to try and push through this

56
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:33,894
national infrastructure that would see a network of DC power distribution bring electricity on demand into every home in America.

57
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:39,098
Unfortunately for Edison, Nikola Tesla, who is the dude who invented the fucking Tesla coil,

58
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:46,262
had patented a polyphase system and was doing some work on rotary magnetic fields and AC transformers and was promoting this system of

59
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:49,645
national infrastructure for AC power transmission.

60
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:51,201
that rivaled Edison's.

61
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:54,082
So this boiled over into what we now call the War of Currents,

62
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,323
or the AC-DC war.

63
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,664
And the long and short of it was that although Edison had a head

64
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:02,245
start, because sort of all the core technology that his system

65
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:07,046
required was sort of proven, the infrastructure demand that

66
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:11,347
would have called for a DC power station every three to five

67
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:14,308
kilometers was due to the sort of extreme power loss that's

68
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:16,369
incurred when you try to transmit DC power over long

69
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:16,769
distances.

70
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:23,701
Tesla's system, on the other hand, required some sort of fancy mapeteering and some new inventions like step-up and step-down transformers and all this stuff.

71
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:32,804
But once that was all figured out, the ability to centralize electrical power generation at coal-fired plants and massive hydroelectric dams like the one at Niagara Falls,

72
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:38,386
to transmit energy over long distances with little to no loss, kind of tipped the scales in Tesla's favor.

73
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,784
So Edison sort of fought back by launching this smear campaign against AC Current.

74
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:47,147
He even went so far as to sort of covertly fund the invention of the electric chair

75
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:51,171
and, you know, see it brought into use for the meeting out of capital punishment, like here in the US.

76
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:56,016
His goal was actually to just terrify people about the dangers of AC Current

77
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:57,778
and show them how dangerous it was.

78
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,141
So Portofcy the Elephant was a casualty in this war.

79
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:02,663
Once it was basically over...

80
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:06,915
and the push towards sort of a national AC distribution system was underway,

81
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:10,457
Edison presided over and filmed the execution of Topsy the Elephant,

82
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:14,318
which is performed by coursing like 6,600 volts of AC current through her body.

83
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm not going to roll the film electrocuting an elephant 1903,

84
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,581
because it's kind of gross,

85
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:24,183
but I will point out the irony that the laptop that's displaying this image

86
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,204
and the projector over there and, you know,

87
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:29,905
the speakers that are amplifying my voice and the mixing board at the back and...

88
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:33,640
and the lights and the heat and everything in this convention center, everything in this city,

89
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:38,325
everything in this country, basically, is running off of Tesla's AC power distribution system.

90
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:41,848
So, even though Edison's film was seen by like thousands of Americans,

91
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,790
it didn't have the horrifying effect that he had hoped.

92
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:46,792
It basically didn't work, right?

93
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:51,696
So, about a decade after Portopsy was executed in the 19-teens,

94
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:56,000
Russian filmmaker Lev Kuleshov conducted an experiment where he filmed...

95
00:05:56,407 --> 00:06:02,130
matinee idol Ivan Mazookin staring into a camera looking intense. He also filmed a bowl

96
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,712
of soup being eaten and a dead child in an open coffin and an attractive scantily clad

97
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:10,954
woman. He then sort of popped up in Final Cut Pro and he added together his footage

98
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:16,096
and cut back and forth between the actor and the soup and the child and the woman. This

99
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,057
is the final film that he showed to audiences.

100
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:32,021
have to do it the clumsy way. Where did it go? Sorry. Why is

101
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,764
it not working? I tried it before and it worked. Now it's

102
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:45,591
not working. There we go. That sucks, I'm sorry. It's over

103
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:52,537
here. Yeah, I should have just acted out. And I can't find the

104
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,258
fucking button. Okay, well...

105
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:08,991
Okay, it cuts back and forth from his face to the woman, to the soup, to the child, to

106
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:09,412
his face.

107
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:10,693
Okay, that's how it goes.

108
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:13,776
Come on.

109
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:17,839
I can't hit the space bar.

110
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,684
So that was the final film he showed to audiences.

111
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:28,944
After seeing the film, he sort of polled audiences about how Mazookian was feeling in each shot.

112
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:33,085
And the audiences reported that he appeared hungry when he was looking at the bowl of soup,

113
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:36,006
and he appeared sad when he was looking at the dead child in the coffin,

114
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,746
and he appeared lustful when he was looking at slave Leia.

115
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:43,107
Um, Mazookian was even praised for his acting ability and probably nominated for an Oscar or whatever.

116
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,768
Um, what's awesome though, and so that's the film, right?

117
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:48,749
It goes from there to there to there to there to there to there in like 15 seconds.

118
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:49,309
That's the whole film.

119
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,989
Um...

120
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:56,162
So what's awesome though is that not only was Mazookian not looking at the soup or the dead child or the hot chick,

121
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:59,765
as actors aren't often looking at the things that they're acting to when they're being filmed,

122
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,367
it wasn't even three pieces of footage, right?

123
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:07,551
Kuleshov was actually cutting back to the exact same frames of the exact same footage of Mazookian after each shot.

124
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:13,556
So what the audiences were reading as emotional responses from this actor to these things he was looking at

125
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,257
actually just didn't even exist.

126
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:21,722
We call this the Kuleshov effect, and we interpret it to imply that at the lowest and most fundamental meaning in film,

127
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:29,546
at the lowest most fundamental level, meaning in film is generated not by the moving picture itself, really,

128
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:32,667
but by the juxtaposition of the images, in fact, by the editing.

129
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,572
Thomas Edison did not understand the importance of editing to generate meaning and thereby move his audience.

130
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,852
Had he intercut the footage of Topsy the Elephant's execution

131
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:46,393
with, like, footage of a little girl crying,

132
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:48,854
I pretty much guarantee you that instead of, like,

133
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,054
an ice rink down the street right now,

134
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,495
we'd have, like, a solar power station.

135
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:52,695
So...

136
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:57,737
what's interesting is that I want to point out

137
00:08:57,857 --> 00:09:00,098
that sort of how the moving recorded image

138
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:01,519
generates meaning at its lowest level

139
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:05,060
still leaves us sort of miles away from, you know,

140
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,742
between Ivan Muzukin and feeling lustful, sad, or hungry

141
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:11,663
and the sort of complex layering of images and emotions that we get.

142
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,901
and that intertwine and evolve over the course of a film like, like Tampopo, for example.

143
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:22,522
Tampopo, or indeed sort of any modern film, has a meaning that arises out of the harmony

144
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:25,763
of many different techniques sort of all acting in concert, right?

145
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:30,144
The lowest level meaning of the edit gives us the sort of raw emotional sense of the

146
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:34,025
adoration and compulsion shared by the gangster and his young lover while they're playing

147
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:35,725
lossfully with their food and each other, right?

148
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:39,466
The music and the lighting and the staging kind of all work together.

149
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:49,662
to give these extra layers of meaning and make the scenes sort of more meaningful and give us a sense of how the raw emotions develop and interconnect over time.

150
00:09:50,162 --> 00:10:04,327
And at the highest level, the story and plot kind of ties these actions together, allowing us to witness the sort of profound evolution of that relationship and experience the sort of beautiful tragedy of its conclusion in the end.

151
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:08,587
But let's imagine for a second that instead of traveling back in time and killing Hitler

152
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:12,509
so that Tesla could rise to power, Albert Einstein instead went back in time and killed

153
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:13,229
Kuleshov, right?

154
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,431
And as a consequence, we never really figured out how film meant at its lowest level.

155
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:23,074
There would be sort of no method underlying how we edit together film and no way to generate

156
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:28,896
that lowest level meaning, that sort of core meaning generation that happens in film that

157
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:32,858
acts as a foundation upon which the sort of rest of these higher level meanings are synthesized

158
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:33,678
and put together.

159
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,366
So our films might have these great high-level stories,

160
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,747
but these stories would effectively be sort of

161
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:41,247
randomly in harmony or discord

162
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,088
with the emotional noise,

163
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:44,808
which is effectively what it would be,

164
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,489
being generated at the level of the edit,

165
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,090
because editing wouldn't have any sense to it.

166
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,631
If we were even able to identify this effect,

167
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:55,171
we might begin to think that filmic meaning

168
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,892
and narrative meaning were somehow irreconcilable, right?

169
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,393
We would say that film as a median

170
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,333
suffered from a dissonance.

171
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,381
between its narrative and its editing.

172
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:05,481
If we wanted to be pretentious,

173
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:07,302
we could even take the Greek word for cut,

174
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:08,522
which is temenos,

175
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,142
and the Latin word for narrative,

176
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:11,063
which is narrativus,

177
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:14,243
and name this inherent defect of the undeveloped medium

178
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:16,164
temnonarrative dissonance, right?

179
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:19,845
And, oops, got a slide ahead here.

180
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:21,285
And then we could sort of

181
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:23,426
try and figure out ways to fix that problem, right?

182
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:29,290
One way would be to sort of minimize the ways in which accidental and poorly understood meanings

183
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,133
generated by cutting and editing interfered with the meaning of the narrative.

184
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:38,738
We could take movies where the high-level story and plot was where all the meaning lay,

185
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:42,741
and we could reduce or eliminate camera cuts that seemed to make people feel something

186
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:44,442
that didn't reinforce the story.

187
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:46,844
For example, we would probably shoot everything wide.

188
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:48,806
We'd never show character faces in close-up.

189
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:55,461
We wouldn't want to cut between character reaction shots and actions or objects because we wouldn't know what those cuts were meant, right?

190
00:11:55,501 --> 00:12:03,164
We wouldn't understand why people felt sad when we were trying to tell a joke because we were cutting to like a corpse and back to someone's face, right?

191
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:08,025
We'd probably also try to avoid opening and closing scenes on a character, right?

192
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:13,807
We'd have characters sort of exit frame and then we'd cut from establishing shots of environments to establishing shots of new settings.

193
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:14,767
Scenes would get longer.

194
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:19,960
they would get more stagey. In fact, what we're really talking about is making movies that are essentially like stage plays, right?

195
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:26,566
You would strip away all the inherent meaning generation elements that are native to the medium of film

196
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:31,630
and rely on the meaning of generating elements of tools from a different medium.

197
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:35,273
The problem with this approach, I think, is obvious, right? I mean, I hope.

198
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,256
If you make a movie by pointing a camera at the stage play, right,

199
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:41,058
the resulting work is going to be less good than a stage play and it's going to be...

200
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:45,252
less good than a movie because it's missing something fundamental about both of those

201
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:51,614
sort of experiences. Once upon a time, it must have been an amazing feeling to go to

202
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:57,215
the World's Fair and watch like Edward Maybridge's or Maybridge's Running Horses or Fred Ott's

203
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:01,035
Knees and see poor old Topsy the Elephant being electrocuted and marvel at the cool

204
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:05,956
things that this new medium of film could make us feel, right? But eventually those

205
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:09,577
like simple random snippets of decontextualized feeling

206
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,268
must have began to feel hollow and weird, right?

207
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,528
And people began to look for the bigger picture, right?

208
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:17,649
And laying the foundation for understanding how film means,

209
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,469
Kuleshov enabled us to kind of step forward

210
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,510
from the early days of film as curiosity

211
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,870
into the 20th century, where film would become, sort of,

212
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,331
possibly the most important medium in human culture, right?

213
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:34,532
So, sadly, I think this is more or less where we're at

214
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,672
in terms of the development of our own medium today.

215
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,499
An entire generation of people who have grown up alongside games as curiosity

216
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,640
are now starting to sort of look for the bigger picture.

217
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,661
And in order to do that, the very first thing we have to do

218
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:52,023
is understand what that core meaning generation element of video games is

219
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:53,103
and how it works.

220
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:57,925
And in order to do that, we have to answer Chekhov's question, right?

221
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:04,447
Fortunately, I happen to think the answer is really easy and obvious, okay?

222
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:08,197
I think the answer is that games mean via their dynamics.

223
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:09,798
So, thanks for coming.

224
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:10,679
Who's got questions?

225
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,802
No.

226
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:19,186
Asserting that games mean via their dynamics is like asserting that film means through

227
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:19,686
editing, right?

228
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:21,027
We need to go a lot deeper than that.

229
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:24,090
And, you know, while I believe that games do mean via their dynamics, the rest of this

230
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,833
talk is going to be about sort of how games mean via their dynamics and why it matters

231
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:30,615
to you with examples.

232
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:31,275
Yay.

233
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:36,459
First of all, what are dynamics? So in like 60 slides or less, here's the 101 part of the lecture.

234
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,522
Back in 2004, Robin Honecke and Marc LeBlanc and Bob Zubek published a paper called MDA,

235
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:46,044
Formal Approach to Game Design Research. MDA stands for Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics.

236
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:50,266
Mechanics is defined as the particular components of the game. Sorry, I'm just spewing this out.

237
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:53,608
You should know this. At the level of data representation and algorithms,

238
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:57,470
dynamics is defined as the run-time behavior of mechanics acting on player inputs

239
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,970
and each other's outputs over time.

240
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:04,207
Aesthetics is defined as the desirable emotional responses evoked in the player when he or

241
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:05,628
she interacts with the game system.

242
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,892
To make that clearer, I like to think of MDA as being RBF, because those are better letters.

243
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:14,415
Mechanics are the rules of the game, dynamics are the run-time behaviors of the game player

244
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,538
system, and aesthetics are the feelings that the game evokes.

245
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:18,979
So that's enough theory.

246
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:20,540
How about some examples, finally?

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,061
So this is Spelunky.

248
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:27,425
So Steven Lavelle, also known as Increpare, and I'm not sure if that's Greek or Latin,

249
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:27,986
but it doesn't matter.

250
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:31,813
because the dude has made over like a hundred games in the last three years, okay?

251
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:35,474
Um, you know, he said this, um, at one point.

252
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:36,314
Um, he said,

253
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:41,735
As with using a whip in real life, attacking with a whip in Spelunky is not an immediate action.

254
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,576
It has to be raised before you can hit.

255
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:47,497
This slows the game and makes hitting airborne creatures harder, and thus deadlier,

256
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:49,057
than if whip strikes were immediate.

257
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:53,819
The extra layer of timing you must factor in the game makes it less pew-pew

258
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:57,220
and more dash deliberately in, whack, and dash out.

259
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:02,419
It encourages a certain degree of premeditation and creates an overall atmosphere of deliberation.

260
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:07,002
So what's interesting here is that even though he's not talking about the NBA framework specifically,

261
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:11,566
his natural discussion of Spelunky draws him to point out that the rule that the whip animation

262
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:16,350
must be played before it can do damage makes the game slower, harder, and deadlier and

263
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,914
causes the player to adopt certain ways of playing, thus giving Spelunky the unique aesthetic

264
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:25,098
signatures of being premeditative and having an atmosphere of deliberation.

265
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:28,478
Ultimately, I think that's the question

266
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:30,319
when we're asking, how do games mean?

267
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,080
I think we're asking...

268
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:34,543
from where do aesthetics,

269
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:37,766
such as premeditative and premeditative

270
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:40,108
and deliberate, originate in games?

271
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,129
And I think it's a tricky and elusive question.

272
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,731
Does the meaning of Spelunky, right,

273
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:47,233
come from the rules governing the whip

274
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:50,776
or from the way the player uses the whip, right?

275
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:53,979
In the end, I think the question is difficult

276
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,161
because there's a really ambiguous verb.

277
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,885
that lives at the center of this debate, at least in English.

278
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:02,067
Maybe if you speak another language, games are way easier to understand.

279
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:04,889
That verb is play.

280
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,492
It seems fairly clear that at the most fundamental level,

281
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:13,054
the aesthetics of film come from editing.

282
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:16,056
But the verb edit only has one meaning, right?

283
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,117
And play has several meanings, right?

284
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:19,978
For example, instead of saying...

285
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,900
If instead of playing Spelunky, Stephen Lavelle played piano...

286
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:27,145
and created a piece of music, there would be no argument about where that meaning came

287
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:31,767
from, right? It comes from Stephen playing the piano, right? From the dynamics. If, however,

288
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:35,668
I came along and recorded that music and burned a CD and gave it to Checker, and Checker played

289
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:40,449
the CD and appre- and Checker played, there's the other play, the CD, and appreciated the

290
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:44,470
aesthetics of the music, there would again be no argument about where the meaning comes

291
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,011
from, right? Whoops.

292
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,972
But it doesn't come from the act of playing the CD, right, from the dynamics.

293
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:54,954
It comes from the data on the CD, which is like the mechanics in this system, right?

294
00:17:55,014 --> 00:17:57,396
It's like the code that's embedded in the system.

295
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:02,498
So, you know, games are not like pianos, right?

296
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:05,159
And they're not like CD players either, right?

297
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:11,683
They're a thing that you play, but also a thing that you play, used to play things.

298
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,244
Games are actually kind of both at once.

299
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:15,805
They're kind of actually...

300
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,515
like player pianos. Does everybody know what a player piano is?

301
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,975
Player pianos are basically...

302
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:27,137
The player piano was to 1905 what Guitar Hero was to 2005.

303
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:33,318
I love these two pictures, they're like identical.

304
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:37,039
The chick on the left even looks like the chick on the left.

305
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:43,749
The player piano is a piano that has a machine in it that you wind up, right?

306
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:48,810
And it unrolls this giant punch card kind of thing across, like a music box,

307
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,151
across the inner workings of the thing, and the piano plays itself, right?

308
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,511
So it just plays its little music.

309
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:54,491
You wind it up and let it play.

310
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:57,472
However, you can also play along with it, right?

311
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:00,592
So you can obviously get, like, different kinds of player piano rolls to, like,

312
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:03,993
you know, play part of a duet or play, you know, things that help you learn how

313
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:06,974
to play piano better or, you know, things that make you look like you're

314
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,954
Rachmaninoff or something.

315
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:15,643
The only real difference between a player piano and a game is that the player piano can play by itself, while a game cannot.

316
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:21,566
And of course if you say, yeah, but you could make like two chess bots play each other, that's not a game playing itself, that's two AIs.

317
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,127
That's a different situation.

318
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:28,189
Dynamic interaction is a requirement for anything that we define as a game.

319
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:35,153
And because of this fact, we have a very important distinction to make when we kind of author our equivalent of these piano rules.

320
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:37,394
Speaking of Rachmaninoff...

321
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,311
who apparently wrote compositions so complex

322
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:42,132
that they could only be played by people with 12 fingers.

323
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:43,932
That's not actually true, by the way.

324
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,093
He just had really big hands.

325
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,334
I kind of wonder sometimes if his parents

326
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:50,675
had to sell his cute little baby to design a big Craigslist.

327
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,016
Anyway, the point is that game designers

328
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:54,736
have this really important choice to make

329
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:56,557
when they're authoring their games, right?

330
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:57,957
We can choose to subscribe

331
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,558
to the sort of message model of meaning.

332
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:00,758
And if we do that,

333
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,319
we can attempt to sort of heavily author

334
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,020
the meaning of our game by putting...

335
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:11,149
say, ten fingers worth of meaning into the piano roll of our mechanics, and leaving only

336
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:16,512
two fingers worth of room in the dynamics, whoops, like that, for the player to play

337
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:22,054
the piano and sort of contribute to the overall meaning of the music. Conversely, we can kind

338
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:25,736
of abdicate our authorship of meaning to the player, putting two fingers worth of meaning

339
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:29,558
in the piano roll of our mechanics and leaving ten fingers worth of room in the dynamics

340
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:33,199
for the player to make his own music. So, I mean, certainly there's no right way to

341
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:33,680
make games.

342
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:38,249
I personally have a strong preference, both as a designer and a player, for games that

343
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:42,791
advocate as much authorship as possible to the player. But no matter how much authorship

344
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:48,554
I advocate, my authoring of the mechanics will always yield some kind of influence over

345
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:53,557
the dynamics. In fact, this is a road that I've been down a couple times already, and

346
00:20:53,597 --> 00:20:58,500
in order to talk about sort of range of possible authorial control that we can attempt to exert

347
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,162
over the dynamical meaning of a game by the mechanics that we author.

348
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:03,918
I'm going to look at three different games

349
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,160
that live at different places along this spectrum.

350
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,961
And there happens to be an interesting set of games

351
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,462
that I'm highly qualified to talk about

352
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:13,603
that provide a fairly good coverage of this spectrum,

353
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:15,184
and that's the three games that I've shipped.

354
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:17,325
The first two, the original Splinter Cell

355
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:18,465
and Splinter Cell Chaos Theory,

356
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:19,966
live over there on the left side,

357
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:22,147
where the meaning is fairly heavily authored.

358
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:23,988
My most recent game, Far Cry 2,

359
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:25,909
is quite a distance over on the right side,

360
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:28,110
where sort of a great deal of authorship

361
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,390
has been advocated to the player.

362
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:34,106
You could go farther out that side easily, just as you can go farther down to the other

363
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:40,430
side. And there's, it's a complete analog range. Games live all across this band. But

364
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,613
how do each of these games mean in their dynamics? And how is that meaning influenced by the

365
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:50,857
authored mechanics in the game? So back at the Montreal Game Summit in 2005, actually,

366
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:54,659
I gave a design talk where I spoke a little bit about the meaning of Splinter Cell Chaos

367
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,640
Theory. I talked about how it wasn't really a game about

368
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,123
international espionage and covert operations and all that stuff. I said Chaos Theory is

369
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:05,967
actually a game about chaos theory. It's a game about the sensitivity of complex dynamic

370
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:10,691
systems to minor perturbations. It's about the fragility of, you know, a security system

371
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:14,794
like a simple lock and the uneasy timers that are sort of counting down under the hood as

372
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:18,257
you're trying to pick that lock before a light comes back on or something. It's about being

373
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:23,301
in close proximity to like aware and dangerous guards who can detect you and react.

374
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,565
performing these sort of complex and challenging tasks in close proximity to fragile systems

375
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:32,828
that, if they're disrupted, can spread their information to other nearby systems and kind

376
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:35,711
of cause cascading problems that are difficult to recover from.

377
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:38,573
And that's what Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is about.

378
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:41,255
In fact, it's not just Splinter Cell Chaos Theory that's about that.

379
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:44,478
The original Splinter Cell is also about chaos theory.

380
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:51,023
And these ideas of sensitivity and proximity and fragility are actually central to what

381
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:52,885
the series was about in the beginning.

382
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:57,190
So it's illuminating to kind of look at how the meaning changes

383
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,931
between these two, frankly, extremely similar games

384
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:05,413
based on only a very slight change in the balance of authorship

385
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,094
that's exerted into the mechanics.

386
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:12,296
In the notorious example from the original Splinter Cell,

387
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:15,337
the player was sort of tasked with getting through a series of keypad-locked doors

388
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:18,138
by closely following a patrolling guard.

389
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:20,199
And in each door, he would have to use his thermal vision.

390
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:24,441
to like read the warm fingerprints on the keypad that the guard would enter before he

391
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:30,264
went through the door. That would give the player the code and then he could enter. But

392
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:33,906
this was sort of forced, right? If the player was good enough that he could get up behind

393
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:38,329
this guard and follow the guard into the room without being detected, you would actually

394
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:42,011
get a game over because you were being forced to use your goggles to read the keypad. It

395
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:45,153
was just completely arbitrary and stupid, actually.

396
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,580
But it put the player in fragile proximity, right, to this sensitive guard, and by forcing

397
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,822
you to do the sequence this way and gating these other behaviors with mission fails,

398
00:23:56,122 --> 00:24:00,103
you know, we can say that the mechanics of the game that we authored forced a set of

399
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:05,245
dynamics that ensured the game was about this designer-authored meaning of sensitivity,

400
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:06,365
proximity, and fragility.

401
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,485
It's forced in the dynamics.

402
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:09,606
You can't not have that experience.

403
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:13,087
You can have the experience of that, or you can have the experience of turning your console

404
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:13,907
off and doing something else.

405
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:18,258
In chaos theory, we kind of loosened up some of these pressures, right?

406
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,058
The player was never forced to tackle specific challenges using specific tools, right?

407
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:26,399
For example, he could still read thermal fingerprints off of keypads if he wanted to.

408
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:28,299
If he sees a guard going through a door, he can go,

409
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,440
well, that's a good way to- I'm gonna go use my goggles and read his thing

410
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,580
and get the code and go through the door.

411
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,360
Pretty cool.

412
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,501
But he could also just sort of follow the guard through the keypad-locked door,

413
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:39,141
you know, before it closed behind him.

414
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,942
Or he could interrogate the guard and find out the code,

415
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,942
because the guard, if he knows the code, he knows the code.

416
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:46,794
Or he could find the code on a computer and open the door that way.

417
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:50,956
Or he could just hack the door with his little remote hacking device and open the door that way.

418
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:57,180
So by removing sort of a bunch of the mechanics that were enforcing certain dynamics,

419
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,402
and by adding mechanics that allowed other dynamics,

420
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:05,665
and then letting the player sort of choose which set of dynamics become the backbone of his play experience,

421
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:06,606
what happens?

422
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:10,028
Well, obviously, I mean, the meaning of the game changes, right?

423
00:25:10,388 --> 00:25:12,269
Depending on how you play as a player...

424
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:16,431
Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is sort of only probabilistically about Chaos Theory.

425
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:18,553
It could be about Chaos Theory, right?

426
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:21,855
It could be about sensitivity and proximity and fragility if you play a certain way.

427
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:24,977
But if you play another way, it could be about the same things as Quake, right?

428
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:28,019
And I think that, you know, while most players would still say

429
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,701
that despite the range of possible meanings,

430
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:34,884
Chaos Theory is still mostly about Chaos Theory.

431
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,826
What happens if you abdicate authorship even more

432
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:40,648
and you move much, much further down this axis towards...

433
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:45,689
towards having sort of less authorship in the mechanics

434
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:47,070
that are impacting your dynamic meaning.

435
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:49,672
So, what is Far Cry 2 about?

436
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:54,055
Well, in our original pitch,

437
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:56,898
the meaning of the game was supposed to be

438
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:59,800
that human social savagery is more disturbing

439
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,961
than the simple savagery of teeth and claws.

440
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:05,044
That's literal block of text from a very ancient document.

441
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,427
We often use the example that a bunch of schoolgirls

442
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,048
had a greater capacity to be cruel

443
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,149
than something like a crocodile.

444
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,390
And that capacity for social cruelty

445
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,592
is what makes us the most terrible creature on Earth.

446
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,713
So basically, like, Far Cry 2 is supposed to be, like,

447
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:19,894
sissy fight with flamethrowers.

448
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:20,794
Um...

449
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:24,296
We embedded this sort of message in the game

450
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:27,178
with mechanics that encourage dynamics

451
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,239
like shooting to wound,

452
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,300
executing people in cold blood,

453
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,921
euthanizing your friends.

454
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:34,743
You know, in the end, Far Cry 2, I guess,

455
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:36,644
is a little bit about some of these things.

456
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,003
Tom Bissell in his book Extra Lives says at one point,

457
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:44,925
Far Cry 2 is a game about chaos, which you enable, abet,

458
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,386
and are at constant risk of being consumed by.

459
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:49,507
He goes on to tell the story of...

460
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:51,908
Whoops.

461
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:56,510
He goes on to tell the story of a skirmish that ended with, like, a wounded enemy

462
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,450
that was lying in the grass and calling out,

463
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,091
but he couldn't see the guy in the grass,

464
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,892
and so the guy's taking pot shots at him,

465
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:03,132
and he's getting all freaked out.

466
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:03,933
So he says...

467
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:11,829
When I had put enough distance between us, I lobbed a Molotov cocktail into the general area where the supine dying man lay.

468
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,231
Within seconds, I could hear him screaming amid the twiggy crackle of the grass catching fire.

469
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:22,853
Sitting before my television, I felt a kind of horridly unreciprocated intimacy with the man I had just burned to death.

470
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:27,635
Far Cry 2 may reward your murderous actions, but you never feel as though it approves of them,

471
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:31,516
and it reminds you again and again that you are no better than the people that you kill.

472
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,737
In fact, you may be much worse.

473
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:42,055
So maybe Tom was, maybe for Tom it was kind of about these ideas that we were trying to author, right?

474
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:50,119
Maybe it's the case that, you know, one day we're going to look on Wikipedia and see that the early games of Clint Hawking or something explored themes of chaos, right?

475
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:52,200
Like, you know, maybe it's a game about chaos.

476
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,922
But in the end, it wasn't me that burned that, you know, poor bastard to death in that field.

477
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:56,762
It was Tom, right?

478
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,923
And maybe the chaos that he was struggling with was...

479
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:03,053
you know, some kind of, like, inner chaos that's in him,

480
00:28:03,153 --> 00:28:06,174
and it's not a chaos that I authored, you know, who knows?

481
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,795
Well, I suspect this guy maybe knows.

482
00:28:09,915 --> 00:28:12,837
Blogger Ben Abraham played the game several times.

483
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:15,278
One of those times he played the game using Iron Man rules,

484
00:28:15,658 --> 00:28:17,378
and he wrote a 300-page journal about it

485
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:18,619
called The Permadeath Experience.

486
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,560
In an interview with Justin Caburn,

487
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,041
I think that's how you pronounce his name,

488
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:24,921
on the Groping the Elephant blog,

489
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:26,902
Ben said this about Far Cry 2.

490
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:27,422
He said,

491
00:28:28,143 --> 00:28:29,743
I guess my approach reflected my desire.

492
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:34,669
to have a fun experience, so I played it quite safe at first. When the initial sense of tension

493
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:38,990
and danger wore off, I experimented and I courted danger a bit. When playing normally,

494
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,671
I would stride right up and punch danger in the face, trusting luck and skill to get me

495
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:48,413
by. But by prioritizing my survival, I became much more reserved and cautious. Kind of boring,

496
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:53,615
really. Practical things that changed how I played include, you know, picking safe options

497
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:57,296
and utilizing optimal killing strategies. Basically, any time there was a dangerous

498
00:28:57,376 --> 00:29:00,057
option and a boring safe option, I took the safe one.

499
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,041
So, and that's an instance I guess like, no.

500
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:06,242
The authored meaning that we were sort of going for

501
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:07,982
didn't really come through so much.

502
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,583
So does this mean that in the end,

503
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:11,803
that sort of the more authorship we advocate,

504
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,844
the more we leave our game open to being what Ebert called

505
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:16,345
a smorgasbord of meaning?

506
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:18,645
Let's talk about elephants.

507
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:22,226
So in 1927, Ernest Hemingway wrote a short story

508
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:23,607
called, Hails Like White Elephants,

509
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,367
which is the story of a man and a woman

510
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:27,168
sitting in a bar in a train station in Spain,

511
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,828
having a drink, talking.

512
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,068
It's a pretty slow story.

513
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,820
Pretty short, feels long.

514
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,441
A lot of people would say that it would be a better story if it at least had some elephants

515
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:36,041
in it or something.

516
00:29:37,202 --> 00:29:41,443
As Ben said about Far Cry 2, Hills Like White Elephants is actually kind of boring, really.

517
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,564
But it does have an elephant in it in a sense.

518
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:47,225
At least it has what we call an elephant in the room, right?

519
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:52,286
Even though what the story is about is never explicitly stated by the author, it is entirely

520
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:53,967
obvious to the reader what it's about.

521
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:59,330
Although short, it feels like White Elephants is probably too long for us to sort of read

522
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,412
together in the middle of this lecture, so we can examine how it means at runtime, the

523
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:10,414
way we did with Tetris. We didn't do that with Tetris yet.

524
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:16,537
Oh, well. So let's look at another Hemingway short story that's sort of similarly powerful.

525
00:30:18,037 --> 00:30:20,858
So that's the whole story.

526
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:25,998
There's some question about the attribution of this story to Hemingway, but one thing is clear.

527
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:30,360
The story is like a 40-ounce overproof of Hemingway's sauce, right?

528
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,441
Absolutely every single extraneous thing has been stripped from it,

529
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:39,804
and nothing at all remains except for this sort of sinking realization of what that story is about.

530
00:30:40,164 --> 00:30:42,585
On the one hand, the meaning of the story is sort of irrefutable,

531
00:30:43,025 --> 00:30:46,007
and on the other hand, Hemingway did not put the meaning there, right?

532
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:48,648
The audience brings the meaning to this story.

533
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:54,591
Hemingway has sort of abdicated every last possible inch of authorship to the audience.

534
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:59,635
He couldn't have given you more freedom to write the meaning yourself if he gave you a moleskin and a pencil.

535
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:04,198
And there is absolutely nothing else that this story could be about than what it's about.

536
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,302
In my mind, this kind of goes beyond what we would call sort of minimalism in literature, right?

537
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:14,025
This isn't sort of the art of removing everything unnecessary.

538
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:18,048
This is the art of showing your audience that they are, in fact, artists themselves.

539
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
With Far Cry 2, I think our push to achieve

540
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:23,141
our originally intended meaning

541
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:26,862
caused us to kind of lose sight of an irrefutable meaning

542
00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:28,003
that lives in the dynamics.

543
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:30,643
In the end, I think Tom may have had it right

544
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,004
when he said Far Cry 2 is a game about chaos.

545
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:36,345
He was embracing it when he threw the Molotov

546
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:38,886
into that field, while Ben's boredom,

547
00:31:39,286 --> 00:31:41,187
I think, was probably his refusal

548
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:44,108
to be seduced by the danger of it, right?

549
00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:46,089
On the dev team, we were trying to somehow

550
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:47,509
tie the meaning we found.

551
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:50,317
and we were finding in our dynamics

552
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:52,198
a sort of overarching narrative concept

553
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:55,060
in order to make sure it was being experienced and understood.

554
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,801
But in reality, the meaning was already living and breathing

555
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:00,243
in the dynamics, and our sort of direct efforts

556
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:01,843
may have only confused things.

557
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:04,985
Now, that's gonna get me to talking about narrative

558
00:32:05,205 --> 00:32:08,467
and, you know, about that highly narrative game, Tetris,

559
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:11,288
which I guess we're all familiar with.

560
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,129
You know, show of hands, how many people in this room

561
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:13,810
have played Tetris?

562
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,451
Yeah.

563
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,031
Actually...

564
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:21,009
Stupid question, how many people in this room have played so much Tetris that they can close

565
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:23,591
their eyes and hum and play Tetris in their heads?

566
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,694
Yeah, that's a pretty good ratio.

567
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:29,776
Tetris is really simple, right?

568
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:34,180
Pieces fall, you rotate them around and fit them in among other pieces and if you complete

569
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,882
a row with no holes in it, the row disappears.

570
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:38,464
If the rows stack up to the top of the screen, you lose.

571
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,086
If these are the basic mechanics...

572
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:43,749
What are the dynamics of Tetris, right?

573
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:46,470
What does Tetris mean in its dynamics?

574
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,871
Well, there's a certain amount of dexterity and precision,

575
00:32:49,991 --> 00:32:50,331
obviously.

576
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:52,252
You have to be able to effectively put the pieces

577
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:54,033
where you want them, right?

578
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:55,993
Beyond that, there's this sort of great deal

579
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:57,594
of strategy in terms of how you deal

580
00:32:57,634 --> 00:33:00,475
with the random chain of pieces being thrown at you.

581
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,916
You need to anticipate and weigh the probability

582
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:04,316
of different configurations that you're

583
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:05,657
creating to get them to pay off.

584
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:10,167
you need to be removing rows in the short term while at the same time sort of keeping

585
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:15,590
opportunities alive for like multi-row completions in Tetris's, right?

586
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,812
In fact, Tetris is about a lot of really interesting things, but because of its abstract nature,

587
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:25,534
it's very hard for us to talk about what Tetris is about in any kind of larger sense.

588
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:26,155
And that's okay.

589
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:31,117
By that I mean, you know, Tetris isn't really able to comment on the world at large,

590
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:33,918
or on people, or on their emotional or psychological reality.

591
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:39,717
It's very hard for us to imagine, though not impossible, how Tetris informs our perspective

592
00:33:39,777 --> 00:33:40,518
on the world, right?

593
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,579
Tetris is able to be about itself, right?

594
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,059
And it's able to be about who is playing it.

595
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:52,421
But you would never, for example, say that Tetris is immoral or evil because it de-responsibilizes

596
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:56,822
you for participating in a system of institutionalized discrimination, right?

597
00:33:57,823 --> 00:34:01,023
You know, once again, I'm not saying Tetris should do any of those things.

598
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:02,224
I love Tetris the way it is.

599
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:03,064
I'm just using Tetris.

600
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:03,284
I love it.

601
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:12,723
because in its abstract nature, I want to elaborate on it and talk about how narrative can be used to influence dynamic meaning, or dynamical meaning.

602
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:14,624
This is Rod Humble's game, The Marriage.

603
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:21,029
The game is also very abstract, right? It also requires a certain amount of dexterity and precision.

604
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:26,672
You also need to have strategy, you need to anticipate weight probabilities, keep opportunities alive, all that stuff.

605
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:29,074
But The Marriage is not completely abstract.

606
00:34:29,474 --> 00:34:31,635
The Marriage is about marriage.

607
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,397
It says so right in the title, right?

608
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:40,165
And more than that, the blue piece sort of represents the man in this particular marriage,

609
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:44,588
and the pink piece represents the woman, right? In effect, the title, the marriage, and a

610
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:50,553
couple of the sort of tiny little decisions about RGB values have a massive impact on

611
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:55,657
the way the dynamics of this game unfold and consequently what it means or the way it means.

612
00:34:56,377 --> 00:35:00,220
So what if we decided to add a kind of thin fictional layer to Tetris, not with the aim

613
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,081
of trying to make a better game, that's not what this sort of...

614
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:07,750
thought exercises about, that's absurd, right? It's with the aim of observing how adding

615
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:13,414
or changing a narrative layer to a game can impact the dynamics and thus the meaning,

616
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:21,039
even if the underlying mechanics do not change, right? Is Brenda here? No? Okay. So this is

617
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,522
Brenda Brathwaite. For the last several years, she's been working on a series of art games

618
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:28,243
that she calls the Mechanic is the Message series.

619
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:33,571
Perhaps the most renowned work in the series is a game that you've probably all heard of

620
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:38,654
called Train. How many people have played Train? More than I thought, but very, very

621
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:43,496
few, right? This is largely because of the game's nature as an artifact. Very few people

622
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:46,718
have actually played it. I haven't played it either, so I can't talk about it specifically.

623
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:53,762
I'm just going to borrow from it thematically. In our new version of Tetris, we're going

624
00:35:53,802 --> 00:35:56,323
to say that the field on which the pieces fall...

625
00:35:56,847 --> 00:36:01,450
is a train yard on the edge of the Warsaw Ghetto in like, yeah, back then.

626
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,332
And the objective of the game is to pack people into the boxcars and ship them off to camps.

627
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:11,755
Of course, the people that you're grabbing are scared and are themselves clinging to their family members

628
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:15,737
and all that kind of stuff, which rationalizes the fiction of why you get these pieces in different shapes

629
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:16,917
that you have to deal with.

630
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:21,479
Of course, the trains are under orders not to leave the station unless the cars are completely full.

631
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,522
So if you leave too many trains partially full, the train yard will overflow.

632
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:30,701
with non-optimally filled train cars and stop the Nazi war effort. Game over.

633
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:35,165
Now to be clear, I'm not changing any of the rules of Tetris.

634
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:38,127
It's exactly the same game, except now under this narrative,

635
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:43,090
every line you clear is a boxcar full of innocent people that you are sending away to a concentration camp.

636
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:48,774
So, with that in mind, and the reason I chose Tetris is that we can now close all our eyes

637
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,596
and evaluate the changes that have been made to the game.

638
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:53,996
by playing the game in our head, right?

639
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:56,698
We can emulate Tetris and think about what we would do

640
00:36:57,418 --> 00:36:59,199
if this was the game we were playing, right?

641
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,020
What would you do?

642
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,961
Well, there's a couple of options.

643
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:03,942
You can play the dutiful servant of the Reich

644
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:06,544
and play the game exactly the way you played Tetris before.

645
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:08,104
You can try and pack each row full,

646
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,466
clearing out full rows and preventing the field

647
00:37:10,566 --> 00:37:11,406
from getting jammed up

648
00:37:11,426 --> 00:37:13,027
so you can get the highest score possible.

649
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:13,888
What a wonderful game.

650
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:16,710
You can take on the kind of Schindler role.

651
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:20,637
which is to kind of back up the system as slowly as possible

652
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:23,339
by optimizing the way you lose the game.

653
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:27,302
By leaving one and only one spot empty in each and every box car,

654
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:30,365
you can maximize the number of people that get pushed through the system

655
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:33,607
while minimizing the number of people that get sent to concentration camps.

656
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,289
That's an interesting way to play the game.

657
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:37,570
Or you could play the saboteur if you want,

658
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,473
and you could immediately just stack up pieces as aggressively as possible

659
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:41,974
and try to get to the game over state

660
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:43,916
without sending anyone to a concentration camp.

661
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:48,525
Of course, if you stack pieces up like this in the real Tetris,

662
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:52,508
and claim that the game was about sabotaging and attempting to...

663
00:37:52,528 --> 00:37:57,392
a game that attempted to de-responsibilize,

664
00:37:57,412 --> 00:38:01,656
what did I say before, its participants for a system of institutional discrimination

665
00:38:01,676 --> 00:38:02,957
that was bent on genocide, right?

666
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:06,360
I think any sane person would laugh at you and think that you just sucked at Tetris, right?

667
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,943
But in this game, this approach is actually really meaningful.

668
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:11,644
It's a meaningful and important way to play.

669
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,726
And that's the point that I'm sort of trying to make, right?

670
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:19,738
By changing the fictional skin, the game has new potential meanings that Tetris didn't

671
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:25,118
really have before, right? These meanings don't come from the mechanics. They come from

672
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:29,879
the behavior of the game player system acting under the influences of the narrative, right?

673
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,240
My point here is not just to show that narrative can sort of powerfully influence dynamics,

674
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,361
but it's also to point out that the claim that sort of a game's fiction is only and

675
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:41,981
exclusively a skin, it's kind of a greedy reduction.

676
00:38:44,603 --> 00:38:47,185
A game's fiction might not touch the mechanics at all,

677
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:49,967
but it still strongly influences how we evaluate the field,

678
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:53,029
how we value game pieces and optimize their interactions.

679
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,751
Regardless of the explicit value we give these things

680
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,552
in mechanics, right?

681
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:58,673
The fictional skin, excuse me,

682
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:03,597
can lead to changes in the way the game is played,

683
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:06,419
which fundamentally is how the game means.

684
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:07,400
So it's important.

685
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:10,922
Now that we've looked at a couple different ways

686
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:12,203
that dynamical meaning of a game

687
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:13,985
can be influenced by the designer.

688
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:18,301
or in the fiction case, a writer or writer-designer,

689
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:18,941
whatever, whoever,

690
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:23,583
and can sort of modify the dynamical meaning of a game

691
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:24,663
to a greater or lesser extent,

692
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:26,724
depending on how much authorial influence

693
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:30,105
we sort of try to exert over those parts of the game.

694
00:39:31,226 --> 00:39:32,646
There's another really important factor

695
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:34,567
that can influence how games mean,

696
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:36,328
and this one is really, really different

697
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:37,348
than the other two.

698
00:39:38,568 --> 00:39:39,089
Street Fighter is...

699
00:39:42,035 --> 00:39:45,256
Very obviously, a game about reflexes, precision, timing,

700
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:48,217
pattern recognition, anticipation, et cetera.

701
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:51,578
But what's critically important to understand is that it's

702
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:54,539
fundamentally not about a battle between Ken and Ryu.

703
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:57,059
It's about a battle between two players, right?

704
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:01,601
And more importantly, between their perspectives on what the

705
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:02,441
game is about.

706
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:06,382
Competitive pressure has a massive impact on how games

707
00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:10,063
mean in general, and also on how a specific game means.

708
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:12,824
And a close examination of competition

709
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,104
also reveals that unique meaning

710
00:40:15,364 --> 00:40:18,165
also exists within specific instances of a game.

711
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:20,246
When two players sit around and talk about

712
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:22,667
their beliefs about what a game means,

713
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,187
that's sort of one thing, right?

714
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,068
But when they test their perspectives

715
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:28,128
against one another in direct competition,

716
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:31,709
their ideas enter into a kind of literalized debate

717
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,610
over what the game means.

718
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,032
In 1938, the respected Go master Honinbo Shusai...

719
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:43,626
played a retirement game against up-and-coming star Minoru Kitani.

720
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:47,809
The match was covered for the Japanese press by Yasunori Kawabata,

721
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:50,651
who would later go on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature

722
00:40:50,691 --> 00:40:52,693
and be recognized as one of the greatest Japanese authors.

723
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:56,396
Taking his reportage of the game and other notes,

724
00:40:56,496 --> 00:41:00,619
in 1951 Kawabata published a chronicle novel of the match titled Meijin.

725
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,181
The English title of the book is The Master of Go.

726
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,525
At the heart of the story, and at the heart of the match that the story is about,

727
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:25,154
The expression of these two players' personalities and their embodiment of a sort of shift in Japanese culture from the conservative, honorable, and sort of artistic, classical, imperial Japan to the sort of, you know, progressive, pragmatic, and industrious culture of modern Japan.

728
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:34,181
Admittedly, these ideas are kind of pretty cliched now, but when you take into account the historical context, the match itself was sort of played just before World War II or at the very start.

729
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,622
and that the novel was written after, these kinds of ideas are the real deal.

730
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:45,045
It's not sort of like tacky, you know, the tacky cyberpunk version of those concepts, right?

731
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:49,907
Now, Go is actually a really simple game in one sense.

732
00:41:49,947 --> 00:41:51,248
It has only nine mechanics.

733
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:52,929
That's them. I'm not going to read them.

734
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:56,731
Because Go games can reasonably last for dozens of hours, however,

735
00:41:56,771 --> 00:42:00,793
there are also rules for tournaments that govern how long each player is allowed to play.

736
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:05,555
consider his move and rules for how moves are sealed prior to the adjournment of a play

737
00:42:05,575 --> 00:42:09,417
session just like you would have in chess or whatever, right? In the case of the match

738
00:42:09,437 --> 00:42:14,560
in question, the way the rules worked was, you know, sealing a movement, writing it down,

739
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,762
and then giving that move to a judge so that neither side would have the advantage of having

740
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:24,024
hours or days to think about what their next move would be, right? My move would be determined

741
00:42:24,304 --> 00:42:27,446
and the other player wouldn't be able to know my move until the play started, so he wouldn't

742
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:30,747
be able to think about his next move for days or weeks.

743
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:37,172
So the question is, how do we get from a few very simple and abstract rules to a game about

744
00:42:37,192 --> 00:42:41,414
the shift of cultural values that took place in 20th century Japan? I mean, that's a pretty

745
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:45,756
monumental theme, right? And in order to answer that question, we have to, again, like we

746
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:50,259
tried to do in the Tetris example, we have to observe the game at runtime, right? So

747
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:55,401
here's how the game unfolded. I'm sorry if you don't understand Go at all, but we're

748
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:57,322
going to go a bit deep into it.

749
00:42:58,602 --> 00:43:02,185
Although I don't think an understanding, a deep appreciation of the rules is that necessary

750
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:03,045
for me to get you through this.

751
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:07,488
Around the middle of the game at the 120th move, the board looked like this.

752
00:43:08,249 --> 00:43:11,271
The master was playing white and it was the master's turn, right?

753
00:43:11,311 --> 00:43:12,572
So he moved right there.

754
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:19,276
Now, what's important here, and I'm not a great Go player, really, but my understanding

755
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:25,200
is that this sort of formation of white pieces is sort of offensively aggressive, but it's

756
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:25,961
defensively weak.

757
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:29,158
and as a consequence, it sets a tone for a skirmish

758
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:32,319
that is gonna happen in this area of the board, right?

759
00:43:32,439 --> 00:43:34,320
This move is effectively the master saying,

760
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,481
all right, we've now sort of gotten to the midgame,

761
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:38,542
if you want, and we're entering into the battle

762
00:43:38,862 --> 00:43:40,323
that's gonna determine the outcome

763
00:43:40,423 --> 00:43:41,583
of the entire rest of this game.

764
00:43:41,943 --> 00:43:43,164
It's a really important move

765
00:43:43,264 --> 00:43:45,945
because he's sort of making a claim

766
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:48,686
about what territory he thinks he's gonna be able to grab

767
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:51,267
in this middle part of the game,

768
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:53,769
and it's gonna determine how the rest of the game goes.

769
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:59,324
how the challenger is going to respond to this move is just as important.

770
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:02,506
And the challenger thought about his move for over an hour and a half

771
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:04,387
until that day was done.

772
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:08,129
And so he sealed his move and they adjourned.

773
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,391
So two days later, when they returned to the match,

774
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:13,833
the judge unsealed the move, and to everyone's surprise,

775
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:17,035
the judge had a really hard time finding where the move was, right?

776
00:44:17,775 --> 00:44:20,397
That's because instead of moving in this really important battleground

777
00:44:20,497 --> 00:44:22,778
where, you know, the guy was supposed to move

778
00:44:23,298 --> 00:44:24,399
and everyone thought he was going to move,

779
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,363
and where everyone sort of knows that the climactic moves of the game are about to take place,

780
00:44:29,763 --> 00:44:32,305
he actually moved up here. See that black stone there?

781
00:44:34,026 --> 00:44:36,267
At first blush, this is a strange move.

782
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:39,790
Not because it's a bad move, but because it's a bookkeeping move.

783
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,352
It's kind of like, you know, when Tiger misses a putt,

784
00:44:43,452 --> 00:44:45,914
and then just walks up and taps the ball into the cup,

785
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,095
and we don't worry about the fact that it wasn't his turn,

786
00:44:48,135 --> 00:44:49,736
and it's just a little tap-in, and we're done.

787
00:44:49,776 --> 00:44:52,678
It's a bookkeeping move. It just gets things moving along.

788
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,031
The point is that these eight stones, eight white stones up here belonging to the master,

789
00:44:58,111 --> 00:44:59,832
are not technically safe from capture.

790
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:04,333
But practically speaking, any threat to these stones is immediately answered with another

791
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:10,395
necessary and mandatory bookkeeping move from the master that guarantees their survival.

792
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:12,016
The master moved there.

793
00:45:13,976 --> 00:45:20,599
So, essentially what was happening is that by making that bookkeeping move in the sealed play,

794
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:23,440
he was forcing the master to make his own bookkeeping move.

795
00:45:23,896 --> 00:45:28,598
heaping move in response, giving him two days to think about what he was going to do when

796
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:33,200
he moved in that big open battlefield in the middle. Now, because the move was sealed,

797
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:39,883
yeah, he bought himself two days. And to us today, right, we look at that and we go, oh,

798
00:45:40,064 --> 00:45:45,226
yeah, very clever, you know, good move, dude. This is what the master had to say, though,

799
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:50,709
in 1938. He said, the match is over. Kitani ruined it with that sealed play. It was like

800
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:52,990
smearing ink over the picture we had painted.

801
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:57,418
The minute I saw it, I felt like forfeiting the match, like telling them that was the last straw.

802
00:45:58,018 --> 00:46:01,241
I really thought I should forfeit, but I hesitated, and that was that."

803
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:04,543
To the master, the move is ugly, right?

804
00:46:04,884 --> 00:46:10,128
The master values these conservative, honorable, artistic, cultural ideals of classical Japan.

805
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:16,853
And his play style, and consequently the way he expresses himself through play, reflects these ideals, right?

806
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:22,217
He sees the game not only as a competition, but as a work of art that the two men are creating together.

807
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:28,080
Calabada, the author, sort of restated this point, and you have to take this as editorializing

808
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,824
anyways, but he said, that play of black upon white, white upon black, has the intent and

809
00:46:33,844 --> 00:46:38,387
makes the form of creative, and takes the form of creative art. It has in it a flow

810
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:42,850
of the spirit and a harmony of music, as of music. Everything is lost when suddenly a

811
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,653
false note is struck, or one party in a duet suddenly launches forth on an eccentric flight

812
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:48,333
on his own.

813
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:53,697
A masterpiece of a game can be ruined by insensitivity to the feelings of an adversary.

814
00:46:55,777 --> 00:46:59,719
The challenger, by contrast, is progressive and pragmatic and industrious.

815
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:02,420
He takes a pragmatic approach to a fairly obvious problem.

816
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,580
He does not violate any rules, right?

817
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,421
In fact, he doesn't even think that what he has done is in any way wrong, right?

818
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,822
This is just the way he sees the game.

819
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:15,063
The way the game player system behaves at run time for the challenger.

820
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:19,722
is different from the way the game player system behaves at runtime for the master.

821
00:47:20,942 --> 00:47:23,963
Consequently, the master lost the match by five points and was dead a year later.

822
00:47:28,644 --> 00:47:34,165
Now let me be clear. Go is not about the conflict between conservative, honorable, artistic,

823
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:41,107
cultural, classical Japan, right? And progressive, pragmatic, industrious culture of modern

824
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:45,348
Japan, right? This one game of Go, however, this instance of Go...

825
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:49,997
was about that. And this leads me to make sort of three points about meaning in competitive

826
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:57,040
play. First, meaning is synthetic. And by synthetic, I don't mean artificial like polyester,

827
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,142
right? I mean it's created by the synthesis of two players' perspectives on the game's

828
00:48:01,162 --> 00:48:05,263
dynamical meaning. I mean it in the dialectic sense, right? One player's perspective on

829
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:09,425
the meaning is a sort of thesis. The other player's is the antithesis. And the resultant

830
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:14,507
meaning is the negotiated meaning that is synthesized in the dynamics at runtime.

831
00:48:15,948 --> 00:48:17,509
Second, meaning is rigorous.

832
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:24,713
By this I mean that how seriously the two players invest in the ludic contract determines the rigor of that synthesis, right?

833
00:48:25,294 --> 00:48:29,997
In a sense, the two conceptions of meaning are competing for survival, I think is a way of looking at it.

834
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:34,160
If the two players are like kids playing badminton in grandma's backyard on the 4th of July,

835
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,182
then the synthesis is really not very rigorous and the meaning is not very important.

836
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:43,303
If the two players are Djokovic and Federer, then a single shot has the capability to literally

837
00:48:43,343 --> 00:48:46,184
make nations question their very cultural identity.

838
00:48:48,365 --> 00:48:50,706
Finally, meaning in competitive play is instantial.

839
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:55,468
By this I mean that the dynamical meaning of a competitive game is not inherent to the

840
00:48:55,508 --> 00:48:59,109
game necessarily, but to the instance of the game being played.

841
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:03,551
So while it's hard to talk about how Go means for the same reason it's hard to talk about

842
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:08,293
how Tetris means, we can talk about how a specific game of Go means.

843
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:11,626
based on how the game is played by its participants.

844
00:49:13,107 --> 00:49:13,367
All right.

845
00:49:14,448 --> 00:49:16,870
So over the last, what, I don't know, seven or eight minutes,

846
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,312
I've talked about how meaning is generated in dynamics

847
00:49:19,472 --> 00:49:21,313
and about a few ways we can influence

848
00:49:21,353 --> 00:49:22,614
that meaning as designers.

849
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:27,298
Now, I'm going to be the first to admit that this stuff is

850
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:29,319
neither incredibly mind-blowing, and it's not really

851
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,761
all that useful in a practical sense.

852
00:49:30,841 --> 00:49:32,662
But neither is long division, and I

853
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:33,803
think both are really important.

854
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:35,184
Understanding long division.

855
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,964
is important because it helps establish a framework in the developing brains of kids

856
00:49:40,004 --> 00:49:43,908
in like grade three or whatever that they will build on for the rest of their lives.

857
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:48,432
It's the same with understanding how games mean because that framework is going to shape

858
00:49:48,472 --> 00:49:53,116
our industry and our medium and the psychological and possibly neurological structures that

859
00:49:53,136 --> 00:49:59,121
we develop to parse it for decades or centuries to come. In 1991, following the collapse of

860
00:49:59,181 --> 00:50:01,403
its primary trade partner, the Soviet Union,

861
00:50:02,422 --> 00:50:06,446
Cuba lost 80% of its imports and exports and its GDP dropped by a third.

862
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:10,951
Even worse, because they were energy dependent on the Soviets, their oil imports dropped by 90%.

863
00:50:12,773 --> 00:50:16,797
We now refer to this period euphemistically as the Special Period.

864
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:22,443
Without fuel for farm vehicles or access to petroleum-based fertilizers or pesticides,

865
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:25,065
Cuba's entire food production industry completely collapsed.

866
00:50:25,894 --> 00:50:30,157
Now, since that industry was basically entirely based on growing sugar to trade for Soviet

867
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,441
oil, it didn't really matter that much because the oil wasn't coming anyway and you can't

868
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:40,686
fuel cars with sugar and you can't eat it either, contrary to popular belief. But between

869
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:45,270
1991, when food shortages began, and 1995, when they sort of started to come under control,

870
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:50,854
the average Cuban lost over 20 pounds. This was probably the best thing to happen to Cuba

871
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:51,455
ever.

872
00:50:52,556 --> 00:51:00,664
The Cuban people adapted and overcame most of the difficulties, but by far the most important adaptation was the invention of the organoponikos.

873
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:12,855
Organoponikos are a system of organic urban agriculture that arose from the bottom up when individuals and communities in the urban areas started reclaiming land for use, growing food in response to the food shortages.

874
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:17,178
Today, there are over 7,000 organoponikos in Cuba.

875
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:21,462
And in Havana alone, over 200 such urban organic gardens

876
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:24,124
provide 90% of the fruit and vegetables consumed

877
00:51:24,144 --> 00:51:26,086
by the population of 2 and 1 half million people.

878
00:51:27,427 --> 00:51:30,369
This is what happens when massive industrial era

879
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:31,390
networks fail.

880
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:34,372
Their former customers reappropriate

881
00:51:34,412 --> 00:51:36,734
the abandoned networks and start pushing value back up

882
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:37,155
into them.

883
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:39,857
This is what happened in Cuba, and it

884
00:51:40,237 --> 00:51:43,320
is what would be happening here now if time traveling Einstein

885
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,341
hadn't thwarted Edison's plan to put a power

886
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:46,602
station every three kilometers.

887
00:51:46,928 --> 00:51:55,374
so that pushing energy back up into the grid from solar, wind, or community bike programs

888
00:51:55,414 --> 00:52:00,718
or whatever would actually be sort of a normal situation. And, you know, maybe you're sitting

889
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:04,541
there saying, you know, this dude's been living in San Francisco for too long, but just as

890
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:08,644
Organic Pornicos and distributed energy grids force us to question our aging paradigms of

891
00:52:08,684 --> 00:52:13,467
industry and energy and agriculture by showing us the power of bottom-up systems.

892
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:17,492
Games are also forcing us to question our aging concept of art.

893
00:52:19,093 --> 00:52:20,233
And it turns out that's okay,

894
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:23,474
because apparently we're all really good at making art.

895
00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:28,295
Dynamism in art and entertainment is not a feature, right?

896
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:30,936
It's not something that you add to a game.

897
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:35,798
Dynamism is the fundamental driver of how games mean and why they matter.

898
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:38,999
It is the reactor core of what we do,

899
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:42,600
and it is already changing the world faster than we can keep up with it.

900
00:52:43,878 --> 00:52:45,279
Dynamism is revolution.

901
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:46,940
Thanks.

902
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:05,432
So I have more time than I thought I would have for questions.

903
00:53:05,592 --> 00:53:10,595
So I guess you guys can nail me to the wall now.

904
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:13,855
Are there mics?

905
00:53:14,115 --> 00:53:16,376
There's mics there and there.

906
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:16,616
Yeah.

907
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:21,318
So Clint, great talk.

908
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:22,638
I'm just interested.

909
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,979
Your Tetris example was really striking,

910
00:53:25,259 --> 00:53:29,381
and yet it seems in some ways to sort of undermine your point,

911
00:53:29,421 --> 00:53:32,883
as I understand it, in that the story shows

912
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:37,525
that the dynamics of the game actually

913
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,386
can be subjugated by the story and not, you know,

914
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:43,490
be the direct meaning of the game.

915
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,831
I'm not phrasing that well, but I think you see where I'm going.

916
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,152
Yeah, no, I don't feel that using the narrative layer

917
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:56,675
is necessarily subjugating the dynamics in the way you say.

918
00:53:57,295 --> 00:54:01,737
I'm trying to draw a parallel between the kinds

919
00:54:01,757 --> 00:54:05,478
of authorial control we have to influence dynamics.

920
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:08,019
One of those ways is by

921
00:54:08,562 --> 00:54:14,803
more heavily authoring into our mechanics by authoring rules that constrain the dynamics

922
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:21,944
into a certain set or only allow certain dynamical things to happen. Another way you can do it

923
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:28,346
is by putting things into the narrative that constrain the likely behaviors of the player.

924
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:32,907
So I guess what I'm saying overall is that, you know, we have this core meaning generation

925
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:37,368
mechanism which is dynamics and like in film you have

926
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:43,603
different elements that you can leverage to change the way that lowest level thing generates

927
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:48,406
meaning that resonates outward. One of those things is mechanics and how you offer them.

928
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:54,991
Another of those things is narrative. And a third thing that actually you have absolutely

929
00:54:55,011 --> 00:55:00,935
no control over is when dynamics are being generated between two players or multiple

930
00:55:00,955 --> 00:55:02,316
players. Does that clarify that for you?

931
00:55:02,336 --> 00:55:03,277
Yeah, absolutely. Thanks.

932
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:04,138
Okay. Yep.

933
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:13,614
Hey Clint, Trent Custers. I was just got a question about Far Cry 2 and the dynamics in multiplayer that arise from the mechanics as opposed to the single player experience.

934
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:23,236
And how do you, I guess, control or track how much the dynamics of the experience from the competitive side, because as you've just said, it's a much different experience.

935
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:28,018
And how do you make sure that you're not just creating a completely different game?

936
00:55:28,098 --> 00:55:32,319
Far Cry 2 was something that I absolutely loved and played to death, but multiplayer.

937
00:55:32,915 --> 00:55:36,116
didn't appeal to me because I felt that those dynamics didn't carry across.

938
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:39,938
So, unfortunately, the answer... So, for those who didn't quite hear the question...

939
00:55:40,118 --> 00:55:41,899
Did people over here hear the question or...

940
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:44,300
Okay, because I didn't hear it super well.

941
00:55:46,381 --> 00:55:50,963
Unfortunately, the answer to your question isn't an interesting theoretical answer

942
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:57,085
about how we should balance, you know, ways competitive meaning

943
00:55:57,345 --> 00:56:01,287
and ways, you know, narrative-influenced and mechanically-influenced meaning connect.

944
00:56:01,808 --> 00:56:07,671
The answer to your question is, do a better job of managing your multiplayer dev in parallel

945
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:11,874
with your single player dev. And I actually, I wish I could give you a better answer, and

946
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:17,757
probably there is a better answer. We just completely failed to do that well. So I didn't,

947
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:21,640
I don't understand the problem well enough to answer the question in the way I would

948
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,480
like. I apologize.

949
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,121
I appreciate it. Thanks, Clint.

950
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:30,245
And I apologize that it wasn't better. You can blame me. Yeah.

951
00:56:30,813 --> 00:56:35,935
Hey, my name is Eric. I'm an MFA Game Design student and researcher at Parsons in New York.

952
00:56:35,995 --> 00:56:42,317
Just to clarify about your manifesto, is this a call to arms to games researchers to forge the new way,

953
00:56:42,377 --> 00:56:47,299
or is this a call to arms for the industry to change the way, or is it sort of a mix and match of both?

954
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:51,040
I don't think there's a call to arms here. I just think we need to...

955
00:56:52,281 --> 00:56:58,443
I think we don't understand the way Kuleshov understood or the way a modern...

956
00:56:58,823 --> 00:57:00,403
Like, Kuleshov figured out.

957
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:04,393
how film means in its most fundamental way.

958
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:07,356
There's some probably debate about different flavors of that,

959
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:08,036
whatever, that's fine.

960
00:57:09,557 --> 00:57:11,219
We haven't had our Kuleshov yet.

961
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:13,641
No one has really figured out how,

962
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:16,343
at the lowest level, dynamics generate meaning.

963
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:18,324
I'm trying to touch on some of that stuff here

964
00:57:18,404 --> 00:57:21,366
and get people to think about framing the problem in the right way

965
00:57:21,427 --> 00:57:23,648
so we can try to understand it better

966
00:57:23,968 --> 00:57:26,190
and literalize it a little more and learn from it.

967
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:29,633
As a consequence, though, of Kuleshov figuring it out,

968
00:57:30,762 --> 00:57:37,767
We now live in a world where, like, I guarantee you when, I don't know, famous, when George

969
00:57:37,827 --> 00:57:43,831
Lucas makes a movie, my boss, right, I guarantee you when he makes a movie, he isn't thinking

970
00:57:43,971 --> 00:57:49,935
about low-level editing in this kind of abstract sense as being meaning generating.

971
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:52,377
He has completely internalized that process.

972
00:57:52,437 --> 00:57:57,160
The same way when you see footage that's being cut back and forth and edited on a screen,

973
00:57:57,461 --> 00:57:59,782
you read it and you understand it, right?

974
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:05,919
So there's an entire universe of people who have internalized how film editing generates

975
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:10,922
meaning and it's just part of our understanding of the world. We don't even realize we speak

976
00:58:10,962 --> 00:58:16,286
this language. We haven't arrived there yet for games. There are people who are, I think,

977
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,429
starting to figure it out and who are starting to experiment with it and illustrate some

978
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:25,393
things that are very interesting. But even as professional developers, we have a hard

979
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:29,837
time reading this language. We have a hard time writing in this language.

980
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:40,857
And, you know, it's not a call to arms, it's just a here's the domain of this problem that we need to look carefully at from all kinds of different directions, I think, over the next few years.

981
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:46,842
Right. So the chance to define this vocabulary, there's an opportunity and potential to, and that's pretty much what you're saying, right?

982
00:58:47,363 --> 00:58:48,063
Sorry, I couldn't hear.

983
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:53,668
There's still a potential and the opportunity to define these vocabulary.

984
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:58,583
that kind of show. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, this is, it's still very largely undefined.

985
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:02,486
Most of the terrain is unexplored and I think we need to keep exploring. Great, thanks.

986
00:59:02,526 --> 00:59:07,711
Good. There's a guy here who's been there for a while. Hey, uh, great lecture. Um, I

987
00:59:07,931 --> 00:59:13,216
uh, I may just have not gotten the Kuselov thing. I understood and really appreciated

988
00:59:13,276 --> 00:59:19,041
the um, the, the, for game, uh, for game design, the narrative being the skin and the mechanics

989
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:20,162
being underneath. I thought that was...

990
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:23,365
I think that was the whole point for me for this lecture.

991
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:29,206
But I didn't quite get the narrative versus editing for film, because it seems to me that

992
00:59:29,606 --> 00:59:31,846
the editing is kind of a tool of the narrative.

993
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:37,227
So I was just wondering if you could maybe re-explain exactly what the relationship was

994
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,588
between narrative and editing in film?

995
00:59:39,648 --> 00:59:39,908
Okay.

996
00:59:40,768 --> 00:59:46,589
Yeah, I'm not a film theorist deeply, but I don't believe that editing is a tool of

997
00:59:46,609 --> 00:59:47,729
the narrative.

998
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:48,830
I believe that editing...

999
00:59:49,693 --> 00:59:57,879
I think it's like, that would be like saying that the Lego pieces are tools of the Lego spaceship, right?

1000
00:59:58,459 --> 01:00:05,745
I think that editing, when you cut a person's face looking at a flower and it creates some kind of feeling,

1001
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:10,749
that is a building block which we then piece together to create something larger.

1002
01:00:11,229 --> 01:00:15,733
And we can, when an editor sits down, yes he has a map which is the narrative,

1003
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:17,854
but I don't believe that, I don't believe that...

1004
01:00:19,303 --> 01:00:24,025
I don't believe that the meaning comes from the narrative down into the low level editing.

1005
01:00:24,065 --> 01:00:29,227
I believe that there are these raw elemental chunks of meaning and feeling that we sequence

1006
01:00:29,267 --> 01:00:32,788
together and then we put into an overarching framework.

1007
01:00:32,948 --> 01:00:37,509
So yeah, I just don't believe that that's the case.

1008
01:00:37,549 --> 01:00:44,872
I think editing by itself makes people feel things in interesting ways and having an overarching

1009
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:48,213
story and scenes and stuff like that that we plug this stuff into.

1010
01:00:49,086 --> 01:00:53,148
allows us to sustain having these kinds of feelings

1011
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:56,129
in a meaningful way for a long enough period of time

1012
01:00:56,449 --> 01:00:58,570
that we can call that a whole experience.

1013
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,031
That kind of answer your question?

1014
01:01:00,611 --> 01:01:03,432
Well, so wouldn't you determine how to edit a film

1015
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:04,853
based on kind of the narrative and the,

1016
01:01:05,013 --> 01:01:06,073
like, what would you call then

1017
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:09,615
what drives the way that you edit the film

1018
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:10,935
if it's not the narrative?

1019
01:01:11,175 --> 01:01:12,356
It would be, I guess, the vision,

1020
01:01:13,096 --> 01:01:14,497
some sort of thing like that, right?

1021
01:01:14,877 --> 01:01:15,737
Yeah, I mean, I don't.

1022
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,023
Obviously there's a director who has a vision who's trying to make something meaningful.

1023
01:01:21,483 --> 01:01:24,986
I don't think that you... I've never edited a film.

1024
01:01:25,146 --> 01:01:28,448
I don't think that you... Yeah, I'm just not an expert on this.

1025
01:01:28,488 --> 01:01:31,351
I can't really speak to your point. Sorry.

1026
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:32,671
Okay. Thanks, though.

1027
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:34,893
Yeah.

1028
01:01:35,313 --> 01:01:36,714
Yeah.

1029
01:01:36,775 --> 01:01:38,156
Good talk.

1030
01:01:39,256 --> 01:01:45,321
So I'm wondering, do you have, like, an understanding of a generalized way to go from...

1031
01:01:46,297 --> 01:01:49,518
Like, so you know what the purpose of the game is that you're trying to make, but you

1032
01:01:49,538 --> 01:01:52,899
want to know where on that scale of authorship you want to place it.

1033
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,879
How do you decide that?

1034
01:01:54,899 --> 01:01:57,960
Do you have, like, an optimal way of deciding that?

1035
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:00,521
There is no optimal way.

1036
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:03,342
It's a personal decision, I think, for any developer.

1037
01:02:03,382 --> 01:02:09,784
Like, if you're the kind of developer who wants to really heavily author an experience,

1038
01:02:09,824 --> 01:02:10,945
you have the tools to do that.

1039
01:02:12,585 --> 01:02:14,906
And certainly we're actually quite good at that.

1040
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:25,700
Um, that's not the approach I prefer to take. You may be the kind of developer who likes to give away as much of the meaning generating stuff to the player as possible.

1041
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:31,643
Um, that's the approach I, I, I, I like in the games I make and in the games I play.

1042
01:02:32,324 --> 01:02:38,507
Um, how do you do it? Um, so I can only speak to how I do it, but I mean, you...

1043
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,750
OK, to answer the question kind of quickly,

1044
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:48,651
you give away as much autonomy to the people who work under you

1045
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:51,752
and with you on your team, and you encourage them to give away

1046
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:54,033
as much autonomy to the people who work around them

1047
01:02:54,073 --> 01:02:56,513
and with them on the larger part of the team.

1048
01:02:56,953 --> 01:02:59,054
And then you encourage that philosophy

1049
01:02:59,094 --> 01:03:01,254
to spread outward until it encompasses players.

1050
01:03:01,794 --> 01:03:05,415
It really sounds like a Hallmark card or something,

1051
01:03:05,435 --> 01:03:09,176
but it's like, in my perspective and what I believe,

1052
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:13,527
And what I feel in my experience is that the more you give, the more you get back.

1053
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,809
Um, and I just try to give away as much as I can.

1054
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:17,929
All right. Thanks.

1055
01:03:18,289 --> 01:03:18,469
Yeah.

1056
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,510
Don't do that if you want to control everything, though,

1057
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,711
because that would... then you would fail.

1058
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:24,211
Ha!

1059
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:24,391
Yeah.

1060
01:03:25,512 --> 01:03:26,992
Um...

1061
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:27,653
Uh, I guess...

1062
01:03:28,313 --> 01:03:28,953
I guess we're done.

1063
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:31,494
Okay, go have lunch.

1064
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:32,875
I'll take your question.
