1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,322
to designing over the top, Saints Row the Third post-mortem.

2
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:14,525
Thank you. A couple reminders, fill out your surveys.

3
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,447
They probably got sent to your spam folder like

4
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:20,108
they did to mine. So, you know, take a

5
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:21,549
look at them. Please fill them out. Send them

6
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:24,491
that, send that feedback in. That's helpful for us

7
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:24,871
speakers.

8
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,660
All right, so we'll start off with me.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,120
My name is Scott Phillips.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
I've been with Volition for 10 years.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,701
Worked on several titles.

12
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:37,881
I was the design director on Saints Row the Third.

13
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:41,862
Basically what that meant was I was in charge of the high

14
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:45,263
level concept on the design side, the tone and the feeling

15
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:48,684
of the game, the overall experience, and basically the

16
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:50,244
quality bar of that gameplay.

17
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,605
I also did staffing and scheduling, so I spent a lot of

18
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,385
time in Excel and HandSoft and all those

19
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,286
joyous design tools.

20
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:04,030
I did some minor camera work, stuff like that, but in general I tried to stay out of that

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:10,454
work because I would generally break something and nobody wants their director in there messing

22
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:11,614
up with stuff they just finished.

23
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:20,160
Now Saints Row the Third, we started in 2008, just after Saints Row 2 had finished, the

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,682
directors of Saints Row 2 moved directly on to Saints Row the Third.

25
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:28,626
We had about a hundred and twenty-five people peak at

26
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,688
the end of the project, plus QA and outsourcers.

27
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:37,631
So needless to say, this was Volition and THQ's largest

28
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:39,972
project to date. So there was a lot riding

29
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,974
on it for both us and for THQ.

30
00:01:45,776 --> 00:01:47,036
Now what does this talk about?

31
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,588
The postmortem is looking at what went right, what went wrong.

32
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:56,150
I'm going to talk about some of the really great moments that we had on the project,

33
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,171
some of the really painful ones that we had on the project.

34
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:05,553
I'm going to cover what we tried to do, what things worked, what didn't work, and my hope

35
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:11,156
is that you'll learn something from our pain and be able to use that on your future projects

36
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:11,636
as well.

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,560
You may have already known a lot of the stuff that I'm going to talk about.

38
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,641
You may know some of the ideas that we're going to do, that we're going to talk about.

39
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:26,122
But you'll at least see how we implemented them and, you know, where things went right

40
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:27,383
and where they went horribly wrong.

41
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:30,824
So I'm going to cover three main areas in this postmortem.

42
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:35,525
The first one is, why was the franchise successful?

43
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:41,071
Saints Row 1 and Saints Row 2 had both sold about 4 to 5 million units.

44
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:44,717
Saints Row 2 was just coming out when we started Saints Row 3.

45
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,060
It went on to sell 4 to 5 million units.

46
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:51,106
Both received relatively good review scores in the 80s.

47
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:56,951
But success wasn't certain. It's not certain with any sequel, and I think

48
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:02,495
some of the talks I saw yesterday put a nice point on this. I think the Portal 2 guys said,

49
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:08,339
you know, a new franchise is much easier, because you're breaking new ground, and people

50
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,962
don't know what to expect. With a sequel, there is a built-in set of expectations of,

51
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:16,724
you know, what is that game going to be, and what is the sequel going to be? How are you

52
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:18,426
going to change it? How are you going to keep it the same?

53
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,892
So for us, one of the biggest elements of that

54
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:24,876
was the over-the-top feeling, the tone of the game,

55
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,358
as I'm going to go on to talk about.

56
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:32,327
There's a great quote from Walt Disney about sequels.

57
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:34,730
He said, you can't top pigs with pigs.

58
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:38,620
Basically, he was talking about, they had done a

59
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,981
three blind pig short that had won an Oscar.

60
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,502
It was a huge success. And they were convinced

61
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,804
to continue making more of them. So they made

62
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:49,626
several more, and each was less and less successful.

63
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,067
Basically what he was saying is you can't give

64
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,828
people the same thing. And it's, it's not really

65
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,749
a problem that's new, but it's also not a

66
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:59,351
problem that has been solved, or can be solved,

67
00:03:59,571 --> 00:03:59,831
really.

68
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,613
The second thing I'm gonna talk about is raising

69
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:04,233
the quality bar.

70
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:09,848
Visual and quality issues were the number one cited issues in reviews for Saints Row 2.

71
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:15,213
We got hit on things like inconsistent or repetitive missions and lack of creativity.

72
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:20,758
On the other side, we were praised for their fun factor, no holds barred action, and the

73
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:22,359
over the top crazy gameplay.

74
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,303
So we knew in three years when Saints Row the third was going to come out that we were

75
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:29,265
going to have to raise that bar to compete.

76
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,781
So I'm going to touch on three things here.

77
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:35,811
There's holy shit moments, our pacing, and our playtesting.

78
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,917
I'll get into those more a little later.

79
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:45,666
The third one is scope control. Now this is a really difficult issue to deal with. It's

80
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:48,947
really hard to define, you know, what's the right amount of stuff to have in the game.

81
00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:54,948
We had just come off of Saints Row 2 where the mentality was, you know, let's put every

82
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:58,549
single feature we can possibly think of in the game. You know, if that game had it, well,

83
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,930
we need to put it in our game and we'll do it this slightly different way.

84
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:06,053
What ended up is that we wasted a lot of time near the end of the project adding in features

85
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:07,094
that we shouldn't have.

86
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:12,601
And because of this, we shipped with more bugs than we wanted, and we shipped with a

87
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:14,403
lower quality across the board than we wanted.

88
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:18,568
So at Saints Row the Third, we wanted to focus on fewer, better features.

89
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:27,376
So setting the tone. Tone is a pretty nebulous term. I think if you look at different mediums,

90
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:33,279
how they describe tone, how they talk about it, is not very specific. It's tough to define

91
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:40,982
what that feeling is. I think one of the best ways to talk about it is this quote. Tone

92
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:44,764
can be as important as text. Basically, what you're saying

93
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:50,031
what you're saying, how you're going to say something, is more

94
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:53,013
important, or can be more important than what you're saying.

95
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:56,236
Now I'm not really going to try and define what

96
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:59,758
tone is, but I'm going to use some descriptions and

97
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:03,161
then walk into how we use tone and how we

98
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:03,601
define it.

99
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:08,305
Let's look at an example of tone. Batman.

100
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:10,875
Now Batman's been around for 70 years.

101
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:13,517
He's been through numerous incarnations.

102
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:17,060
There's been, but there's always, you know, the Batsuit.

103
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,181
There's always Gotham City.

104
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:19,141
There's always the Joker.

105
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,744
Now when I said Batman, which one did you picture?

106
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:25,586
Did you picture the 1960s Batman?

107
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:26,967
Michael Keaton?

108
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:28,368
Val Kilmer?

109
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,229
George Clooney?

110
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,550
I always forget his name.

111
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,431
Christian Bale, that's it.

112
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,894
Or one of these many, many other types.

113
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:41,951
or incarnations of Batman. Now if you look at it, the 1960s Batman versus the Dark Knight,

114
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:49,138
they're incredibly different emotional experiences. But why? They cover the same characters, same

115
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:51,180
content, same general storylines.

116
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:55,835
they're different in the emotional impact that they have on on the viewer

117
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,777
you know the nineteen sixties batman was goofy was ridiculous you shark

118
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:00,557
repellent and

119
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:03,458
all these you know running around with bombs over his head

120
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,220
uh... the dark knight is a very serious very realistic movie

121
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:17,803
Now tone, for me, has two primary elements. There's the creative boundaries, and then

122
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:20,885
there's the emotional experience, or what you could also call the player experience

123
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:27,150
for us in games. And what you want is you want the team to be like Goldilocks. You want

124
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,493
everyone to be able to say, you know, no, that's too crazy, or no, that's too tame.

125
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:37,096
You know, let's find something right in the middle that's just right for what we're trying

126
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:37,877
to do with this game.

127
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:47,292
Now we had just come off of Saints Row 2, and Saints Row 2, we had a very difficult

128
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:50,416
time coming up with what is that creative box?

129
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:51,517
What are we going to fit into?

130
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:59,045
In a game where you go from running around nude, vehicle surfing on top of a car, to

131
00:07:59,085 --> 00:07:59,686
the next minute.

132
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:07,175
you're chasing a lieutenant who's being dragged behind a car, mercilessly bloodied

133
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,419
and then you mercy kill him in order to put him out of his misery.

134
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,921
Now those are very, very different emotions.

135
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:16,865
The tone was not well defined in Saints Row 2.

136
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:20,649
We refined it through trial and error. We tried a bunch of different things. We

137
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,051
would throw out ideas. We would see what stuck.

138
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:28,952
The problem was that inconsistencies were all over the place, just as I mentioned there

139
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:29,772
with those examples.

140
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:33,496
Now, with Saints Row the Third, we wanted to have a cohesive experience.

141
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:39,381
That was one of our main goals, was the whole experience should feel like it's one note.

142
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:42,264
It's the same feeling you get throughout the entire game.

143
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:49,375
but that's difficult especially when you you want to have these crazy experiences

144
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:52,657
so we had uh... uh... fart in a jar was one of our weapons

145
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:53,657
initially

146
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:57,419
you know i thought this weapon was was ridiculous i thought there was no you

147
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,679
know it didn't make sense in the game

148
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,480
it didn't really make sense as a combat effective

149
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,461
uh... tool

150
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:05,182
but in the end we we put it in because well

151
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:08,243
partially because fans asked for it and partially because it's it's just a

152
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:10,284
pretty funny weapon it's it's it's enjoyable

153
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,005
as a player you're gonna have fun with it

154
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,131
Now if the tone is solid, everybody's going in the same direction.

155
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:19,733
You're all working towards the same goal.

156
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:23,074
If the tone is confused, you're constantly fighting each other.

157
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:24,135
You're going nowhere.

158
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:29,077
So our question was, what should SR3 be?

159
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,359
Should it be over the top?

160
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,139
Should it be serious but silly?

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,102
Or should it be self-aware and unrepentant, just there to have fun?

162
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:45,350
Should it be gangsta? Should it be gangster? Very different experiences for the player.

163
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,971
What should it feel like to be a third street saint?

164
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:54,614
Now our major problems, as I mentioned, was that the tone was ill-defined from the past

165
00:09:54,654 --> 00:10:00,757
games. Saints Row 1 had a relatively set, they wanted to make, I think the description

166
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,658
of it was like an MTV music video.

167
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,985
but they also had insurance fraud. You could jump in front of, you got money to jump in

168
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:13,127
front of cars. Didn't really make a whole lot of sense with an MTV music video. Saints

169
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:17,829
Row 2, we kind of pushed that a little further where you're driving around in a truck spraying

170
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:18,429
shit on people.

171
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:25,353
you know, and then we also had that dark narrative, you know, where you, uh, put Mero's girlfriend

172
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:29,895
into the trunk of a car and then put her into the, uh, monster truck race and then Mero

173
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:35,838
smashes her to death. You know, that's pretty very different things. Now, since we didn't

174
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:38,679
have much to start from, we were kind of coming at it fresh.

175
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,275
and we're also coming at it fresh with our team

176
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:46,919
uh... because by the time Saints Row the Third shipped we had only twenty

177
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,061
percent of the team had shipped a past Saints Row title

178
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,323
that's a pretty huge amount

179
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,665
of uh... of difference between the past game

180
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,166
and Saints Row the Third

181
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:02,191
This meant that, you know, people didn't have that automatic knowledge of, you know, what

182
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:06,616
is Saints Row? Oh, well, we did it this last time. I think I have a good idea. You know,

183
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:11,702
it's not too bad. We were getting people from different teams within Volition. We were getting

184
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:19,550
people from outside of our studio. The problem was we had a lack of buy-in in what the game

185
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,791
was.

186
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:24,950
people didn't know what they were making and they were constantly confused about,

187
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:28,415
you know, is, is fart in a jar, is that too far? Well,

188
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,719
you know, what about this other thing that I'm working on? I'm trying to write a spec

189
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:32,039
for this.

190
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,583
I don't really know what, what I'm trying to make.

191
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:38,708
Now this, this led to, you know, what I...

192
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:41,985
I use the description of soft versus hard power.

193
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:45,028
There's, you know, you can guide someone, you can direct them,

194
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:48,511
which is what, you know, a director as myself should have been doing.

195
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,493
And then you can mandate things.

196
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:54,336
You can say, all right, bring me your problem, this is your answer.

197
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,818
Bring me your problem, this is your answer.

198
00:11:56,932 --> 00:12:01,494
The problem with something like that is that you don't have people, you have people that

199
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:05,696
are renting those ideas. They don't really own what they're working on. And if they don't

200
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:10,178
own what they're working on, they don't really care as much. They're, they're not as invested

201
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,679
in the final product or even in that initial idea.

202
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,682
And since designers are advocates for the player, for the entire experience, if they're

203
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:24,083
not buying into what the game is going to be, who is? Who will?

204
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,942
Now our second problem was that for the first six months or so,

205
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:32,691
Saints Row the Third went a very different direction.

206
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,282
We started off with the idea that the player was an undercover agent infiltrating the Saints.

207
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,403
You were, you know, an FBI agent, something along those lines.

208
00:12:43,203 --> 00:12:47,184
You were doing this in order to allow the player to make choices.

209
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,304
We wanted choice to be a much bigger part of the game.

210
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:53,365
So you were making these choices of, you know, oh, at the end of the mission we go and we

211
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:55,986
find there's a big bale of cocaine.

212
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:57,867
Should I turn it into the FBI?

213
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,167
Should I give it to the Saints?

214
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,827
You know, each of those had different paths.

215
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:02,488
And so we were making the game.

216
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,448
that I think it would have been, I would have been fun,

217
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,372
but the question was, is this a Saints Row game?

218
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:12,694
And the very clear answer was no,

219
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:14,075
this is not a Saints Row game.

220
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:17,017
So this caused about six months in, we reset.

221
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:19,599
We reset the story, we reset the idea

222
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:21,061
of a lot of the top level design.

223
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:27,348
That was good. We were back on a better track. We were back on the track that we would eventually

224
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:32,190
ship on. The problem was that was even more confusion. We were asking the team that had

225
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,093
just wasn't buying into the initial vision, we were asking them to now reset and look

226
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,274
at another vision and figure out how to make that game.

227
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,995
The result was confusion.

228
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,017
confusion people didn't know what to do

229
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:49,477
they weren't sure about what they were making

230
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,078
they had lack of confidence in the vision

231
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:57,820
uh... we had to explain and re-explain well myself i had to re-explain

232
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680
constantly answer questions about

233
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,002
i'm doing this i don't i don't know what you want

234
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,951
It was, it was my problem. It was something that I needed to fix.

235
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:11,072
And the good news was that we could actually fix it.

236
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:16,594
We, we needed to resolve this as soon as possible, because if, if the team wasn't clear on what

237
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:20,115
the game was that we were making, we were never going to be able to make that game.

238
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:23,896
So how did we try to get everyone on the same page?

239
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:27,237
The first thing we did was we had a lot of brainstorming meetings.

240
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:31,278
We got the team, the design team together. We would sit down and we would talk about

241
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:32,779
what does over-the-top mean to you?

242
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:37,759
Now over the top had been used on Saints Row 1 and Saints Row 2 as a very general description

243
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,262
of this is what the game is.

244
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:39,984
It's over the top.

245
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:45,081
When we started Saints Row the Third, people started asking a lot more questions,

246
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,703
especially with the initial different direction.

247
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:51,545
They were asking the question of, you know, what does over-the-top mean?

248
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:56,268
Is it, you know, really vicious murder? Is it fart in the jar?

249
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:00,271
And the problem was it's somewhere in there,

250
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:03,953
and we can't put our finger on, you know, this is exactly what we're making.

251
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,490
So what we started to do was come up with a mantra.

252
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,012
We wanted people to be thinking about something as they were

253
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:10,893
working on systems.

254
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:14,016
We came to embrace the crazy, fun trumps all.

255
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:18,781
That kind of codified what we wanted designers to be

256
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:19,462
thinking about.

257
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,224
it was helpful, to be sure. And over the top,

258
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:26,068
you know, as luck would have it, was still kind

259
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,611
of the, the buzzword for the team, for the

260
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,534
rest of the project, and probably for, you know,

261
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:33,038
any future projects in that franchise. I think over

262
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:36,102
the top will be a key element of what

263
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:36,743
the game is.

264
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:44,251
The next thing we did was we did team presentations. We would, myself, the producer, we would sit

265
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:48,034
up in front of the entire team, ask them to come to lunch meetings or ask them to come

266
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:52,817
to, at the team meeting. We would just talk about, you know, here's what we're, here's

267
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:56,419
what our plan is for the crazy missions that we're going to do in the game. And then we

268
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,983
would talk about it. And this, this started to help getting people to ask those difficult

269
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:06,426
questions of, like, I don't understand why this fits. And getting that out in the open

270
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:07,046
helped greatly.

271
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:11,156
movie outings was a big help as well. Just getting people,

272
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,258
I think, the best one I think we saw was

273
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:15,620
the A-Team. I mean, that, that's a movie you

274
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,742
could call over the top. It was pretty ridiculous.

275
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:19,684
It was funny. It was a summer blockbuster.

276
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,409
The tone video is, is something I'm gonna, something

277
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,571
I'm gonna show in a minute here. Basically we

278
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:29,873
ripped up a bunch of movies, we put it

279
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:32,135
to a music track, and we wanted to capture

280
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:33,776
the feeling of Saints Row.

281
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,782
And then finally there's aha moments, or what I'm calling aha moments.

282
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:42,845
Basically, there are points in the game where something happened and we realized,

283
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:44,826
yes, that's it.

284
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:48,669
I think we've found something that is exactly what we want it to be,

285
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:51,091
what we want this game to be, and I can see it.

286
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:54,933
You know, everyone on the team can say, OK, I know where we're going.

287
00:16:57,361 --> 00:17:01,423
Now the tone video, this might be a little loud, just as a warning. We ripped up a bunch

288
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:07,365
of movies including Shoot Em Up, Bad Boys 2. We looked for, myself and the producer,

289
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:14,728
looked for what should the player feel like as they're playing Saints Row the Third. We

290
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:19,330
also put it to a music track which our producer picked and I think, you know, initially I

291
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,511
fought him on it. I didn't think it, I thought it was too out of date. Now I know that I

292
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,652
was totally wrong. So here we go.

293
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,347
So, personally, I think that helped greatly. Like, that, I,

294
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:05,808
that still gets me psyched. I love, I love hearing

295
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,508
that, seeing all that crazy shit going on. It's,

296
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:09,729
it's good stuff. That, that is what we wanted

297
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:10,589
the game to feel like.

298
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:19,311
Now, aha moments. The dildo bat. I, I think

299
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:21,252
people have probably read about this. You know, marketing

300
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,652
definitely ran with it. They, they went nuts with

301
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:23,792
this.

302
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:28,946
initially it was just one bullet pointed weapon

303
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,688
on one mission spec out of

304
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,189
thirty to fifty mission specs it was

305
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:36,069
not a big part of the game

306
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,312
now when the weapon artist took it and and you know i think the line item

307
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:42,192
description was just

308
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:43,393
dildo weapon

309
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:48,573
so he took that and he made a giant six-foot long enormous dildo you know

310
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:49,635
push things beyond

311
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:50,857
there's games that have

312
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:54,282
have done dildo bats before we knew this everyone else you know that

313
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:56,005
that made games knew this as well

314
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,589
so we wanted something that was even even crazier

315
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,614
So he took that, brought it to the technical rigger who rigged it up, got it all floppy,

316
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:10,298
brought it to the audio guys who added in some wet, floppy slapping sounds, and then

317
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:11,199
we put this in game.

318
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,641
And the team just loved it.

319
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:16,623
It really felt like awesome.

320
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:20,206
I feel like I'm playing something that I'm not going to get anywhere else.

321
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,287
This is a really enjoyable game.

322
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,188
Now, interestingly, we showed this to our producer, who

323
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,309
was incredibly scared.

324
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:30,010
He was kind of like, oh my god, there's no way.

325
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,311
THQ's not going to buy this.

326
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:32,571
ESRB's not going to buy this.

327
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,592
So he sent it off to our marketing guys.

328
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,514
And I think their response back was, we love it.

329
00:20:38,414 --> 00:20:39,915
They absolutely loved it.

330
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:42,456
And I think you can tell through our marketing campaign

331
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,477
that they really loved it.

332
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,678
It was a big differentiator.

333
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:48,038
I totally get why they used it.

334
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:53,110
uh... and this was a this was just a nice moment for i think the team to

335
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,071
to really gel and feel like

336
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:56,671
yes this is

337
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:58,992
we know what saint's row is now

338
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:01,833
now the lessons learned

339
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:03,533
the team

340
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:04,913
must own

341
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,734
the tone and the vision

342
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:12,860
This was something, you know, that I learned the hard way on Saint Jerome the Third.

343
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,826
I think there's a lot of other postmortems will talk about the things they did to set this up.

344
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:21,570
I saw the Deus Ex talk yesterday morning and I thought it was great.

345
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,114
They did a lot of really smart stuff and we did some stupid stuff.

346
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:28,578
But we learned from our mistakes and we've done a much better job.

347
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:36,377
you know tone is very tough especially for a game like Saints Row where we

348
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:39,718
still do have some discrepancies uh... looking back on it

349
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,539
you know we have the uh... we have insurance fraud we have

350
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,900
uh... the dildo bat

351
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,200
but we also have

352
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,541
uh... a moment where one of the enemies

353
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:51,443
uh... viciously cracks the neck of you know one of the other enemies i think

354
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:55,644
it's not as bad like one of my main uh... things coming out of Saints Row 2

355
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:57,085
was i didn't want the player to be a dick

356
00:21:58,077 --> 00:22:02,280
I felt in Saints Row 2 that a lot of times, especially in the Brotherhood arc, for those

357
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,642
who remember it, the player did some pretty vicious things.

358
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:09,485
And I found myself saying, you know, that's not my player.

359
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:11,086
I'm playing this game to have fun.

360
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:12,968
Like I don't want to be a jerk.

361
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:15,850
But we still ended up with some of these things.

362
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,991
Tone is very tough for us.

363
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:19,813
It might not be as tough for other games.

364
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:23,175
You know, there's, let's see, what is it?

365
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:27,899
uncharted i think they have something on their tone is something along the lines

366
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:29,281
of play indiana jones

367
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:30,523
you know that that's

368
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:34,450
that's got it you don't need to do too much more than that that explains the

369
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,610
game

370
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:40,000
The final element was use multiple methods. Do a lot of

371
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,422
different things. You can't just have one thing that, you

372
00:22:42,442 --> 00:22:44,604
know, this word is the tone. You need to

373
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:46,966
do a lot of things. There is no one

374
00:22:47,006 --> 00:22:48,628
size fit all. There were people on our team

375
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:50,870
who felt, you know, the video was, didn't make

376
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,171
any sense. They didn't, they didn't understand it. They

377
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:55,714
didn't understand Embrace the Crazy. There, there were individuals

378
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:58,116
who, they liked that, but they didn't like this

379
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,538
element. So you gotta find something that can kind

380
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:03,260
of hit everybody. You gotta find multiple things that

381
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,281
can hit the entire team.

382
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:10,560
Now, design briefs are something we're using going forward.

383
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:12,783
The goal is, before you've written

384
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:15,926
what something is going to be, write down

385
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:18,449
the problem you're using that you're going to solve.

386
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:24,442
And I think I haven't used this personally very much, but I'm looking forward to seeing

387
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:28,923
what we're going to do with it. And I think probably in one of these coming GDCs we'll

388
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:35,065
talk about it a little bit. And then vision trailers are fantastic. I think probably everybody

389
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:39,766
in here, I would imagine we're all design professionals, saw the Splinter Cell, I don't

390
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,906
remember, no not Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six Patriots.

391
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:46,248
vision trailer that came out maybe four or five months ago.

392
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:51,631
You know, that was a obviously fantastic tool, something they felt so proud of that they

393
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:55,372
wanted to put out to the public, you know, years before the game is going to hit the

394
00:23:55,412 --> 00:24:00,574
shelves. So these vision trailers are, it's tough to find the time to make them, but it's

395
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:03,416
absolutely worth every second of your time.

396
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:11,850
what the game is going to feel like, how are we going to make sure that the gameplay we

397
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:18,695
create is crazy. We want wow, we want more than wow, we want holy shit. Now Saints Row

398
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,799
2, we had kind of, you know, we had sections in our docs where we would write wow moments.

399
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:28,563
We wanted something that was cool, that was, players would remember. With Saints Row the

400
00:24:28,764 --> 00:24:30,865
3rd, we wanted to up our, up our ante.

401
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:35,422
you know up our hyperbole and and call them holy shit moments they were things

402
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:36,723
that you're gonna remember forever

403
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,884
uh... their water cooler moments

404
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:45,460
In addition to that, we wanted every mission to contain some over-the-top element.

405
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,300
We didn't want any FedEx missions.

406
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,802
You know, FedEx would be, okay, I have to start here and then I have to drive there,

407
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:54,802
pick up something, and then deliver it to somebody else.

408
00:24:55,342 --> 00:24:57,883
Those sorts of missions were not something we wanted any of.

409
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,284
We wanted even the smaller missions, even mini-missions.

410
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:05,865
We wanted to have some crazy element that players were going to be impressed by.

411
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:14,807
The major problem is that paper specs don't guarantee fun. We found this on Saints Row

412
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,668
2, and I'm sure everybody else has found it at some point. You know, you have this amazing

413
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:22,470
idea, you think it's going to be the best thing ever, you write it down, you feel really

414
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,671
proud of the spec, and then it gets in game and you're like, oh my god, this is awful.

415
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:33,553
Sometimes you won't admit it for a while. I know I'm, I'm guilty of that. But just writing

416
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:38,194
it down doesn't make it the best thing ever. We had a couple of these elements in Saints

417
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:38,354
Row 2.

418
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:45,240
the johnny get gurney mission there's a mission where you go to the hospital

419
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,662
johnny get one of your main lieutenants is injured

420
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:50,884
you have to get him on the gurney and then you have to fight your way out as

421
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,124
you're pushing him shooting here

422
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:56,227
machine gun that uh... enemies who are rushing in your you know running through

423
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:57,427
the hospital at top speed

424
00:25:57,968 --> 00:25:59,689
it's it sounds like it could be pretty cool

425
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:06,731
but it wasn't. It wasn't very fun. And then we had this sword battle, a big sword battle

426
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:11,835
at the end of the Ronin arc, or in the middle of the Ronin arc, where the player was avenging

427
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:17,599
the people who attacked Johnny Gat. You were going to go and murder this, I think it was

428
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:22,202
Junichi, and you were going to do it using his own weapon. You were going to, you know,

429
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:24,863
you were going to stab him, you were going to slice up all the Ronin.

430
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,672
but we did it really late and it then, it also did not end up being very fun.

431
00:26:34,774 --> 00:26:40,256
Now everything we do on a big game like this, you know, Saints Row was, like I said, over

432
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:46,299
a hundred people, takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money. So we can't just set

433
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,321
out a course lightly. We need to know as much as possible that what we're going to do is

434
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:51,981
going to work.

435
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:56,618
So our solution was pre-visualization.

436
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,645
you know this is avatar here i think everyone is has seen what they've done

437
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:05,927
they've seen uh... you know hollywood uses this to great effect

438
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:09,189
uh... and i think video games need to start using it more

439
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,231
uh... i'm a former animator so i kind of

440
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:17,354
i really like that sort of visual seeing things move as they're really going to

441
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:17,654
move

442
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:22,237
now previz is fantastic because it convinces skeptical groups

443
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,318
uh... it convinces programmers who often are

444
00:27:25,338 --> 00:27:26,599
uh... very

445
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,082
not eager, shall we say, to take on very, very difficult things or things that, you

446
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:37,065
know, they don't think are gonna be possible. This all, it all leads into buy-in. You want

447
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:42,008
something that people can look at and say, that's cool. I, you know, I think if we change

448
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:47,491
this, we could make it even better. Showing them something makes it a lot easier to get

449
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:53,395
someone behind your idea. The other element was that we wanted to prototype things as

450
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:55,396
early as possible. You never know

451
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,798
what's gonna work and you want to figure out

452
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:03,001
you know fail early, fail often that's that sort of mantra

453
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:04,603
uh... and nothing

454
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,946
almost nothing we ever do is final the first time

455
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:13,051
i always fall into that trap where i think yes that i've got it the spec is

456
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:15,673
great we're not gonna need to change anything everything's gonna work out

457
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:16,094
perfectly

458
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:17,456
And then we get it in game.

459
00:28:18,017 --> 00:28:21,241
And invariably, either I've left out something, or something

460
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:24,486
didn't get implemented, or oh my god, this other system,

461
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:26,910
because we're an open world game, is screwing with this

462
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,511
thing I wrote.

463
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,313
And so now it doesn't work.

464
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:37,304
I wanted to mention that there was a talk I saw, I think, three years ago by Mass Effect

465
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:42,567
2 level designers, which I really learned a lot from, about how they break down the

466
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:44,448
phases of development for their missions.

467
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:49,170
This was something that I took back to Volition and we kind of worked through, you know, how

468
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,711
do we set

469
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:54,093
different stages of you know is this is this ready is this fun

470
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:57,735
uh... how can we make it more fun and when is it really finished

471
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:02,638
it was it was a great help we didn't use exactly what they did because our

472
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:03,959
game is different but

473
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:04,999
it was great help

474
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,541
uh... and that's one of the reasons why i'd love gdc and why i wanna

475
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,162
you know hopefully give you something

476
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,227
Now, we did, I'm gonna show, I think, three previs movies here.

477
00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:20,810
This first one is for the first mission in the game.

478
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:23,312
This is essentially at the end of the first mission.

479
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:29,938
The player is robbing a bank at the very beginning of the game, wearing a costume, so that you

480
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:32,100
wouldn't have to customize as the very first thing in the game.

481
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,623
Because I felt it was very important that the player get right into the action, not

482
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:39,086
that you're thrown, you know, you watch a cutscene and then you have to go through this

483
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:40,327
giant UI system.

484
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:46,428
That's not the feeling I wanted for the game. So the player starts off wearing a costume.

485
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:51,189
He gets on top of the vault, which is pulled out by a helicopter, and then it goes smashing

486
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:55,550
around the building, smashing through things, destroying stuff while the player is fighting

487
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:02,471
off waves and waves of SWAT. So here is the previs that we did, interspersed with, in

488
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:06,492
the background, is the actual game, the final shipping product. I think you'll see a lot

489
00:30:06,532 --> 00:30:09,272
of similarities. And I'm going to stop it at one point here.

490
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:25,514
Alright, let's get rolling.

491
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:24,367
Now initially in the previs here, we had a boss, we ended it with the player throwing

492
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:28,169
a grenade at a helicopter and then in slow-mo you would shoot the grenade and the grenade

493
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:33,271
would blow up and the helicopter would lose its stabilization and would come crashing

494
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:39,413
into you. Because of co-op, we weren't going to really be able to do any sort of slow-mo.

495
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:42,035
And so, also through development we figured out like

496
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:46,997
okay this is all cool looking but for two minutes the player is just shooting

497
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:50,418
random people and doesn't feel any sort of progress doesn't feel like they've

498
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:51,739
uh... you know

499
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,720
who is their enemy why are they still here

500
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:57,982
and so in the final product i think you'll you'll notice

501
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:01,883
that there's a single helicopter that seems to keep coming back it's got this

502
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:04,845
we put a red marker over the top of it to make it clear like

503
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:09,267
this is your boss so we essentially added a boss once we got to uh...

504
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:40,204
Previs there is the, uh, here comes the grenade moment.

505
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:46,906
Well, shi-

506
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:54,493
So that was about two years before we got to that final product there, that we had that

507
00:32:54,533 --> 00:33:00,958
previs. It was enormously helpful to say this is what we're trying to hit. It took us a

508
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:05,500
long, long time to get there, but because we knew this is what we want to do, it was

509
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:09,763
much, much easier to convince the team and to make sure that that happened.

510
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:13,986
Now, our second mission, we wanted to start off with some big moments.

511
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:16,888
So we got the bank vault, we got this, there's a skydiving.

512
00:33:17,408 --> 00:33:20,170
I wanted the entrance to the city to kind of be this, you know,

513
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,272
what is the coolest, most over-the-top way to come to a city.

514
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:27,095
And it felt like skydiving out of a plane that you had just jumped out of

515
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:29,596
while shooting enemies, and then you land in the city.

516
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:31,097
Seemed like a pretty cool way to do it.

517
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:35,700
Alright, so let's hit this.

518
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:04,480
So we had just very brief snippets of, you know, this is what

519
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:08,123
general idea of what the camera's going to be, this is the enemies you're going to be shooting.

520
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:14,248
We got that in game and we pretty much realized like you're not going to want to do this for

521
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:16,350
three, five, six minutes.

522
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:21,353
And so in one of the gameplay reviews where we got, you know, all the different

523
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:23,875
disciplines to sit together and play through the mission.

524
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:29,792
somebody, I don't know where it came from, but the idea was we needed to get something

525
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:34,700
in the middle of the mission to break it up and kind of reset and up the stakes.

526
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,864
I thought back to the movie Eraser. I'm a big Arnold Schwarzenegger movie fan.

527
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:46,068
So if you remember that movie at all, there was a point where James Kahn

528
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:50,593
is the bad guy. Schwarzenegger has just jumped out of this plane that James Kahn took over.

529
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:53,976
James Kahn convinces the pilot to turn the plane around

530
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:56,378
and then for the next couple minutes you see that plane

531
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,981
coming right at Schwarzenegger as he's freaking out.

532
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:05,495
so he shoots at the plane the plane dodges him that moment was felt pretty

533
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:08,558
over the top it felt like something that would fit right in Saint's Row and so we

534
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:09,419
built this moment

535
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:10,239
that was uh...

536
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,282
even more ridiculous as you'll see

537
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:58,696
So, yeah, we made it just a tad more unrealistic than what Arnold did.

538
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:03,478
And the last one here went through a lot of iteration. This was

539
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:15,953
This is a moment at the end of the first act of the game where you finally get to reach your ultimate villain, Philippe Lorrain, who convinced you that he killed Johnny Gadd.

540
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:23,135
And now you're breaking into his tower, and this is the culmination of many hours of work, and you're going to kill him.

541
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:32,498
And so the idea was, you're going to drop one of these giant 600 ton skyscraper counterweights on top of him.

542
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:38,643
this moment it ended up that there is a technical difficulty with uh... animating the way we

543
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:39,725
the way we animate stuff

544
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:44,538
the further it moves away from the origin point of where the animation started,

545
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:47,180
the less accuracy it gets.

546
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,000
And so,

547
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,122
this tower wasn't actually big enough for us to create the gameplay we wanted to,

548
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:53,223
and so we had to

549
00:36:53,783 --> 00:36:55,123
send you down to the bottom and then we

550
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:57,945
send you up to the top again and then you fall again.

551
00:36:58,705 --> 00:37:02,467
And the animators were pulling their hair out. It just wasn't working.

552
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:03,728
So we ended up

553
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:07,730
compromising near the end of the project to get something cool in

554
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,950
there,

555
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,271
just to even have this moment.

556
00:37:19,257 --> 00:37:22,118
Not this thing loose. I'm gonna crush that son of a bitch.

557
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:22,838
Leave it to me.

558
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:25,379
Hurry it up! He's getting away!

559
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:32,682
Initially you had to shoot the ball free, but in the final game, your buddies free it for you.

560
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:41,065
I'm coming for you, Reggie!

561
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,488
Get off my damn ball!

562
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:54,246
you

563
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:12,506
So halfway through the video there you saw what we call the brute, which is a giant eight

564
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:17,788
foot tall character, come and run up and jump up on the ball. This was another case of where

565
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:22,010
we didn't have a boss. Like this was a sequence that, you know, for a very short period of

566
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,552
time it looks very cool, but then when you actually want to play it or want to do any

567
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:32,115
sort of extended gameplay on it, it gets kind of tired. And so we introduced a boss character

568
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:35,736
that upped the ante, made it much more interesting.

569
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:44,418
So, lessons learned. Previs is great. I love it. I love, as a former animator, I love doing

570
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:50,243
this stuff. I didn't work on any of these. This was a cinematic artist and the animators

571
00:38:50,263 --> 00:38:55,488
who did all these. And then the gameplay programmers made this, made this stuff happen, which was

572
00:38:55,928 --> 00:39:00,252
phenomenal. Those guys spent a long, long time and a lot of hours, invested a lot of

573
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:03,415
their selves in making sure that these things came together.

574
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:09,818
It previs builds that buy-in that you need. It's vital.

575
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:13,902
And, you know, as the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words.

576
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:19,689
So anytime you can show a picture to someone of what you're thinking versus sending them

577
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:21,771
an email or writing a spec, do that.

578
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:30,483
Now here's a terrible mock-up I did, mash-up for what ended up being our Johnny Gat, I

579
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:35,649
don't even know if it had a name, Johnny Gat Mobile, which was a giant Johnny Gat head

580
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,271
on the front of a van.

581
00:39:38,032 --> 00:39:42,194
You know, this sort of thing is really simple and people enjoy it.

582
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:48,656
It's, you know, you take five or ten minutes, produce something that the team will be able

583
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:51,256
to look back on and will sell that idea really quickly.

584
00:39:51,657 --> 00:39:56,318
You know, this seems obvious, but when you're busy, you don't always want to spend the time

585
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:58,699
to do that, but it is very worthwhile.

586
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:03,140
Now something we're doing at the studio moving forward with is sketching.

587
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:10,882
Our studio design director is pushing for all the projects to do sketches of,

588
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:13,823
basically instead of brainstorming, you all get together.

589
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:16,484
You don't work together at first.

590
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:18,044
You all draw out ideas.

591
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:20,525
You have a problem that you want to solve, you draw out ideas.

592
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:26,426
The idea is to get as many ideas out there as fast as possible.

593
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,032
and then work together to figure out what are the best ones.

594
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:37,057
The next step of previs, obviously, is then you want to animate that.

595
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:42,521
But if you can start with something very simple, just a drawing, that's the next step versus

596
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,644
trying to write a very detailed design spec.

597
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:50,727
Getting everyone involved early is vital.

598
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:54,815
uh... we wanted to include the art code

599
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:57,417
production we wanted to get everyone involved

600
00:40:58,798 --> 00:40:59,639
it can happen

601
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:02,181
where design kind of isolates itself

602
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:03,001
and

603
00:41:03,842 --> 00:41:05,784
becomes like a black box to the rest of the team

604
00:41:06,384 --> 00:41:08,265
and that does not work well

605
00:41:08,806 --> 00:41:12,148
you want everyone on the team to be invested in the entire game and all the

606
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:12,989
ideas that are there

607
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,431
they might have something that's better than what you thought up

608
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:21,004
And whenever you can, let the team that's working on it just go.

609
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:23,746
Don't try and drive things from above.

610
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:29,730
Be realistic. You can't do it all. We can't do it all.

611
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,812
As I'll talk a little bit later about scope control, it's really tough.

612
00:41:35,553 --> 00:41:39,796
Now that we've got our big holy shit gameplay moment, let's go to how do we make it fun?

613
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:40,956
How do we make it paste well?

614
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:45,227
Now the goal with pacing is very simple, create better experiences.

615
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:50,410
That's, you know, you can't really define, it's going to change based on what your game

616
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,531
is, what your pacing is intended to be.

617
00:41:53,132 --> 00:41:56,153
What I'm going to talk about is not the second to second pacing, or you know, putting an

618
00:41:56,213 --> 00:42:00,356
enemy in the player's view, but you know, carrying their vision from left to right,

619
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:01,197
not that sort of stuff.

620
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:06,400
Ours was, where we focused on pacing was the overall experience, the emotion of playing

621
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,081
the game, the emotion of playing that mission.

622
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:15,574
The problem was that Volition did not have a lot of experience doing this.

623
00:42:16,414 --> 00:42:19,055
There wasn't a lot to draw on from other projects.

624
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:24,137
We always ended up, we would put things in game and then we just, we would play them

625
00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:25,137
until they felt fun.

626
00:42:25,738 --> 00:42:30,520
And we ended up having to rely on, you know, just everybody hopefully having a good idea

627
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,300
of what pacing meant.

628
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,401
Additionally, open world makes this stuff very hard to pace.

629
00:42:34,981 --> 00:42:38,663
Because anything can happen and you always have to have tons and tons of little...

630
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:43,424
optional things that you need to turn off, or, oh, well, I

631
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:46,386
don't want cars spawning in this area, or, you know, oh, we

632
00:42:46,526 --> 00:42:48,907
don't need helicopters in this one, it screws up this thing

633
00:42:48,947 --> 00:42:52,628
that I'm trying to do. We write a lot of mission specs, and

634
00:42:52,648 --> 00:42:55,289
those are, those are good for asset identification, they're

635
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:58,530
good for, uh, getting the entire idea out there, but they're

636
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:02,232
not good for timing. They're not good for knowing how things

637
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:06,394
are gonna feel. The other problem was that we had no

638
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:10,455
common vocabulary. Pacing is a very difficult term to define.

639
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:17,623
and there's not a lot of uh... unity in terms of how people talk about pacing

640
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:19,864
there's not a lot of you know tension and

641
00:43:19,884 --> 00:43:21,765
uh... tempo and

642
00:43:22,105 --> 00:43:24,687
there's you can talk about it musically you can talk about it

643
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:26,648
uh... in all sorts of different ways and

644
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:31,471
just throughout the industry we don't have a good vocabulary of these are what

645
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:33,573
these terms mean and how they should be used

646
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:38,724
uh... just you know do a search on gama sutra for pacing you're gonna find

647
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:42,012
articles with all different sorts of things all different sorts of ideas

648
00:43:42,674 --> 00:43:45,160
and you're gonna have to figure out for yourself what you're gonna do

649
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:53,321
So the way we went about it was I worked with the studio design director, Jason Scott, to

650
00:43:53,401 --> 00:43:57,022
figure out what was available. What could we draw on? This was probably about two and

651
00:43:57,042 --> 00:44:01,823
a half years into the three-year project that I really started pushing for, we need to solve

652
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:05,424
this. We don't have, our pacing is not good, we need to improve it.

653
00:44:06,445 --> 00:44:12,991
So what we found, or I think what he found was the best example was this pacing visualization

654
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:16,594
of pacing as a cycle, as a circular cycle.

655
00:44:17,294 --> 00:44:24,000
You know, going from building action, this is the basic gameplay, to the crisis where

656
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:29,065
something goes wrong and you need to react, to the climax where things get even worse

657
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:33,088
and you need to figure out how are you going to come back from that precipice.

658
00:44:34,293 --> 00:44:38,516
and then the payoff where things go great and you figure out how to do it,

659
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:43,500
and then the reversal where, oh my god, you know, this new thing happened that's

660
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,221
gonna drive us back into that cycle.

661
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:48,583
All of these pieces flow together pretty well.

662
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:54,114
One issue is that you can't use this as a rule book. You can't

663
00:44:54,514 --> 00:44:58,536
always have all of these elements, and you can't always use the same sort of

664
00:44:58,596 --> 00:44:59,077
reversals.

665
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:00,557
There's definitely

666
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:04,520
times where you don't want the player to feel like, you know,

667
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,802
oh, that carrot is right there, I might be able to... No, you jerk, you pulled it away.

668
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:11,264
You don't always want the player to feel

669
00:45:12,104 --> 00:45:15,687
like they just failed, but sometimes you do. So it's a very fine line.

670
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:22,505
This is what I came up with. This is using a program called MindManager.

671
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:24,706
This is a breakdown of the second mission in the game,

672
00:45:25,286 --> 00:45:27,587
going from left to right, top to bottom.

673
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:30,349
Basically what I wanted to do was

674
00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:35,411
visualize what a mission looked like so that we could figure out where we had

675
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:35,811
holes.

676
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:39,333
Where are we missing a reversal? Where are we missing a payoff?

677
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:43,292
what this helped us do was you can see

678
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:45,654
you know this was where we ship the mission

679
00:45:46,014 --> 00:45:47,255
so i think we had a pretty good

680
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:48,616
idea of uh...

681
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,058
we had added in reversals we had added in that airplane

682
00:45:52,078 --> 00:45:52,118
uh...

683
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:56,501
flying right towards you that was a great reversal that we added in

684
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:02,159
This is a little more detail.

685
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,002
There's one mission that I wanted to mention or use as an

686
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:06,382
example.

687
00:46:06,422 --> 00:46:10,825
We had mission 11 was the player was fighting against

688
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:13,267
STAG, which was this military force that we brought in that

689
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:17,630
had these futuristic lasers and VTOL jets that could

690
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,431
transform from helicopters to airplanes.

691
00:46:21,294 --> 00:46:22,677
initially at the end of this mission

692
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:27,006
you had you had been blowing up all these uh... all these tag bases all these

693
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:27,266
little

694
00:46:27,928 --> 00:46:31,575
uh... pockets of of their uh... their troops and their their little base units

695
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:36,352
and then at the very end you went to save your buddy named Oleg

696
00:46:36,732 --> 00:46:37,913
and you go to the park

697
00:46:38,614 --> 00:46:41,236
and you kill a couple tanks and you kill a couple of VTOLs

698
00:46:41,996 --> 00:46:42,937
the problem was it was

699
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:46,600
basically the same as everything you've been doing the rest of the mission so we

700
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,822
we didn't really pay it off you just kind of

701
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,183
oh mission's over

702
00:46:51,104 --> 00:46:52,805
you saved your friends which is great

703
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:56,228
that was a great payoff but players didn't care

704
00:46:57,637 --> 00:47:02,522
What we did was we ended up adding in, we moved that element earlier, we added in a

705
00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:08,048
whole new element where you had to fly out over the sides of the city, you were put on

706
00:47:08,088 --> 00:47:12,552
a timer, told, you know, oh my god, if you don't, if you don't get to this giant AWACS

707
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:13,453
plane and blow it up.

708
00:47:14,454 --> 00:47:17,777
we're gonna all lose and the whole mission could be a failure at this point.

709
00:47:17,817 --> 00:47:21,519
So we put a timer on the player, told them they have to do this under time pressure,

710
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,021
made the stakes important, and then

711
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:30,105
you had this cool airplane that you had never seen before flying over the city,

712
00:47:30,485 --> 00:47:33,507
being escorted by other VTOLs. So it was a pretty good

713
00:47:34,628 --> 00:47:36,929
sequence where we figured out, you know, this

714
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,412
is not ending well, and we only really figured it out once we had started doing

715
00:47:41,953 --> 00:47:42,093
these

716
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:42,813
pacing maps.

717
00:47:45,558 --> 00:47:47,960
Now the future of pacing is still a work in progress.

718
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,123
We're still figuring out what pacing means to us.

719
00:47:51,623 --> 00:47:53,184
How do you pace open world?

720
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:54,885
Are we only pacing the missions?

721
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:56,867
We're still talking about it.

722
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:01,190
We have a group talking about it right now at the studio.

723
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:06,273
There's actually a GDC talk that was given by Jason Scott,

724
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,514
our studio design director, just an hour ago.

725
00:48:09,755 --> 00:48:11,376
If you have the GDC vault, I would

726
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:12,476
suggest you go and watch it.

727
00:48:12,817 --> 00:48:15,578
It's really interesting talk about the studio design groups

728
00:48:15,638 --> 00:48:19,340
that Volition has, where we basically get all the designers

729
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,661
together, break them up into groups,

730
00:48:21,121 --> 00:48:23,903
we figure out what topics we want to talk about as designers,

731
00:48:24,303 --> 00:48:26,924
and then we work through them with clear end goals

732
00:48:27,044 --> 00:48:29,206
on what we're going to figure out, what we're going to deliver

733
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:29,746
at the end of that.

734
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:36,368
Now, pacing was one of those where I felt it was really necessary for our project to

735
00:48:36,428 --> 00:48:37,649
figure out better ways to do it.

736
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:48,552
Additionally this is, we've been, as we've been working on these pacing, I broke out

737
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:51,493
the pacing cycle and

738
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:57,916
I think I started to feel like we're not really in a cycle,

739
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,597
because the game is always moving forward.

740
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:02,218
We're always kind of ramping things up for the player.

741
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:04,960
And so I started to feel like it's more of a wave.

742
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,922
Like that wave can start small, it can get big.

743
00:49:08,802 --> 00:49:11,564
The whole game, I think, will feel more like this.

744
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:13,425
You know, this is still a work in progress.

745
00:49:13,465 --> 00:49:16,266
I'm still figuring out, you know, how do we even visualize with this?

746
00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:17,347
Is this going to be fun?

747
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:21,790
You know, one of the other designers is not a big fan of how this works.

748
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,694
Now playtesting, I'm not going to go into it too much.

749
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,856
Lots of other talks have covered it.

750
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:39,925
We did, I think, cross-project critiques where groups of the designers got together from

751
00:49:40,026 --> 00:49:40,746
another project.

752
00:49:40,846 --> 00:49:41,887
They would play our game.

753
00:49:41,927 --> 00:49:46,472
They would give us feedback within certain sets that we wanted to get feedback on.

754
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,223
They were very helpful. We ran those for about a year. So, looks like I'm getting short on

755
00:49:52,263 --> 00:50:02,650
time, so I'm gonna speed up here. Lesson learned, GDC, our GDC talk on Jason Scott's talk, go

756
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,753
see that. Playtesting is fantastic. You know, everybody should use it if they don't already.

757
00:50:07,573 --> 00:50:12,196
And then additionally, which you're not at, there's a Volition talk right now by Jordan

758
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,799
Lin who runs our playtesting lab. That you can also see on the vault.

759
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:23,756
Now, scope control is very tough. Saints Row 2, we added tons of stuff constantly. Now,

760
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:28,739
the problem is, who can tell me what exact size the game should be? How many features

761
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,941
should it have? How many missions should it have? You know, how are we going to sell twenty

762
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:37,865
million units? What, what is the right number? It's really difficult to define that. So what

763
00:50:37,905 --> 00:50:44,309
we did was, we dumped everything we wanted to do onto our schedule, and then we started

764
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:44,789
figuring out.

765
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:49,125
we need to start cutting stuff. So every three to four months we would cut things.

766
00:50:49,325 --> 00:50:53,566
We had twenty six of these in total. Some were meetings where all the directors would

767
00:50:53,606 --> 00:50:57,926
get together and talk about, you know, I don't like this feature or I think this is going

768
00:50:57,946 --> 00:51:02,667
to be too tough. Sometimes the producer would come to us and say, I don't think this feature

769
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:06,208
is really going to work or I don't think this is worthwhile, let's just kill it. We ended

770
00:51:06,268 --> 00:51:10,589
up killing about four thousand man days of scheduled work throughout the project.

771
00:51:12,992 --> 00:51:16,775
The project pillars helped us, you know, I think a lot of other projects do this. This

772
00:51:16,835 --> 00:51:25,361
was a fun image of Johnny Cat doing the howling at the moon, or the three wolf moon playing

773
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:29,504
keyboard. But anyway, the pillars are the important part. They helped us to define what

774
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,965
are the important elements of the game.

775
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:35,812
We also did custom and core mission definitions.

776
00:51:36,392 --> 00:51:38,613
We had some missions where we said, this is only

777
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:40,514
gonna use core features, we're not gonna add any

778
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:43,115
new functionality for it. We had missions like the

779
00:51:43,135 --> 00:51:45,516
skydiving where we said, we're gonna do every awesome

780
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,156
thing, we're gonna make this the best mission we

781
00:51:47,196 --> 00:51:47,876
possibly can.

782
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:55,805
yes so here is one of the features that we ended up cutting we called it free

783
00:51:55,845 --> 00:51:56,206
gunning

784
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:57,987
this kind of a combination

785
00:51:58,007 --> 00:52:01,829
of uh... you know the assassin's creed sort of parkour plus

786
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:02,950
shooting with a gun

787
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,772
pretty you know the name kind of defines it all

788
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:10,795
it was a pretty cool feature it looked really neat it was fun to slide over

789
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:11,395
cars

790
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:14,517
you know to run against walls and all that sort of stuff

791
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:17,479
but in an open world with

792
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,442
tons of A.I. tons of vehicles all kinds of crazy stuff going on

793
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:27,848
This feature, we spent about a year on it and we probably could have spent way, way longer.

794
00:52:28,268 --> 00:52:30,750
We ended up cutting it, just like we cut, we had cover.

795
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:33,953
We cut cover because it didn't fit with what we wanted to do.

796
00:52:34,013 --> 00:52:38,377
But free gunning really fit with our goals of fast, fluid and fun combat.

797
00:52:48,994 --> 00:52:52,199
Now the outcomes of this, I think we shipped with a lot of really cool stuff.

798
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,601
I think we had a lot of variety.

799
00:52:53,661 --> 00:52:55,063
We had cyberspace.

800
00:52:55,124 --> 00:52:56,806
We had a stag helicarrier.

801
00:52:56,866 --> 00:52:58,389
We had Professor Genki.

802
00:52:58,429 --> 00:52:59,811
We had a mission on Mars.

803
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:02,815
We had a lot of really amazing stuff in the game.

804
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:07,955
Mars was something that was interesting because it was constantly on the cutting

805
00:53:07,995 --> 00:53:13,296
board. It was a very difficult push for me. I wanted to have two endings to the game.

806
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:15,577
And that was very hard to sell the producer because

807
00:53:16,157 --> 00:53:19,938
he's very much in, you know, you want every player to see every single thing

808
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,699
that you did because we're spending a ton of time making all this stuff.

809
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:37,966
In the end I think it was the right thing to keep it and I think a lot of that went to because the mission designer who owned that mission really wanted it to be in the game and spent a lot of his own time to make sure that it got in the game. He had that ownership of Mars.

810
00:53:40,034 --> 00:53:43,197
The main problem was, at the end of the project, we didn't have enough people.

811
00:53:43,578 --> 00:53:48,963
We grabbed most of the programmers, a lot of the artists and designers from other parts of the studio,

812
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:50,244
other parts of Volition.

813
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,407
We ended up with too much stuff.

814
00:53:54,328 --> 00:53:55,189
We should have cut more.

815
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,953
It's a lesson that, you know, I need to learn, I need to get better at

816
00:53:59,834 --> 00:54:04,078
personally, but at least, you know, like AA, admitting you have a problem is the first step.

817
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,900
It's really, really hard to do this.

818
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:10,642
Scope control is really, really difficult for me.

819
00:54:11,602 --> 00:54:12,723
But we should have cut more.

820
00:54:13,143 --> 00:54:14,664
Going forward, I find that I constantly

821
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,025
have to reevaluate and constantly think about this,

822
00:54:17,105 --> 00:54:17,925
that it's really hard.

823
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:20,186
Now what I learned.

824
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:22,207
We'll end here.

825
00:54:22,908 --> 00:54:24,469
We've got the tone and the pillars

826
00:54:24,669 --> 00:54:25,869
are very, very important.

827
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:29,311
You want the entire team on board with what you're doing.

828
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:36,476
Prototyping is fantastic, previs is fantastic, you want to know what you're making before

829
00:54:36,556 --> 00:54:37,818
you spend the time making it.

830
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,262
Figure out what your weaknesses are.

831
00:54:41,282 --> 00:54:47,090
You know, whatever that is for your game, look at it, look at what's available in the

832
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,953
industry and start working on making it better.

833
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:59,145
For us, I would imagine for other people, it's really easy to have the best ideas ever

834
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:02,827
and want to get every single thing in the game because it's awesome. This thing is going

835
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:07,149
to be amazing. Every designer is going to envy me because this is the best thing ever.

836
00:55:07,709 --> 00:55:12,891
But you can't do everything and you probably don't want to do everything because your game

837
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:13,611
won't ship until 2030.

838
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:19,105
And for us, specifically, it was don't fear, embrace your

839
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:21,928
content. You know, we are an over-the-top, polarizing game.

840
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:26,111
People, you know, some people love Saints Row, some people

841
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:29,494
hate Saints Row. But we wanted to make a Saints

842
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:31,656
Row game, and we, we ended up, I, in my

843
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,018
opinion, really building on what had been done in

844
00:55:34,038 --> 00:55:34,438
the past.

845
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,841
And so that's my talk. Thank you very much.

846
00:55:49,074 --> 00:55:51,135
If there are any questions, I think we've got a couple minutes, so.

847
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:54,037
Probably less than five.

848
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:55,959
Q Okay, I've got one.

849
00:55:56,259 --> 00:56:00,242
So you were talking about tone earlier, and especially in Saints Row 2, that you had this

850
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:03,645
conflict between over-the-top and then very dramatic.

851
00:56:04,245 --> 00:56:08,328
And now, playing Saints Row 3, loved it, I thought it was an amazing game, and certainly

852
00:56:08,348 --> 00:56:10,470
based on your goals, it certainly seemed to achieve them.

853
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:15,128
But thinking about that, I mean, think about, say, just for argument's sake, your tone is

854
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:19,212
goofy comedy and you're doing a two-hour movie, you can pull that off and you'd be pretty

855
00:56:19,232 --> 00:56:24,737
consistent. Maybe you need 10 minutes of a little drama to set the scene. But when we're now

856
00:56:24,797 --> 00:56:29,181
talking about an open-world game where you're going from, you know, eight hours to 10 hours

857
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:30,302
to 12 or even 20 or, you know, even more.

858
00:56:33,648 --> 00:56:35,069
Can you really stick to that tone?

859
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:35,830
Like, what do you feel about it?

860
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,411
Because, I mean, honestly, you say these things

861
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:38,632
about St. George II, and I played that,

862
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:40,994
but personally, I liked a lot of that drama,

863
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:42,055
even though it was a counterpoint,

864
00:56:42,095 --> 00:56:43,996
because it felt like that gave

865
00:56:44,056 --> 00:56:45,998
that really long experience some depth,

866
00:56:46,118 --> 00:56:49,701
where if it's much more consistent in a particular tone,

867
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:52,263
it sort of gets a little stale over time.

868
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,805
Do you have any feelings on balancing between those two,

869
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:56,206
especially over that longer experience?

870
00:56:57,506 --> 00:57:04,732
Yeah, so I mean the question is about Saints Row 2 had had that difference and so maybe that helped with an 8 to 10 hour experience.

871
00:57:06,114 --> 00:57:17,204
My opinion is that because it's an open world game, there's so much stuff you can choose to do at any different point that in a lot of ways you set what you're going to experience.

872
00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:25,658
I can totally see that point, and in the reviews, the one that I really found interesting was

873
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:31,363
the zero punctuation Yahtzee review, where he absolutely loved SR2, but then he felt

874
00:57:31,403 --> 00:57:36,487
kind of disappointed by SR3 because it was too cohesive, like it was too much of the

875
00:57:36,507 --> 00:57:37,008
same thing.

876
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:38,329
So, kind of to your point.

877
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,932
I don't know that there is a perfect way to do it.

878
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:48,130
I think if you start to switch between one and the other, or the player doesn't know

879
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:52,354
what to expect, like, I think with Saints Row 2 it was kind of nice that the story was

880
00:57:52,394 --> 00:57:55,897
maybe a little more serious, and then the activities were goofy, so you kind of had

881
00:57:55,937 --> 00:58:01,403
your choice of what it was, so I can see where that, maybe not criticism, but where that

882
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:02,203
opinion comes from.

883
00:58:03,885 --> 00:58:06,327
you know, there's probably not a right answer for it.

884
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:08,649
Our goal was to make it cohesive,

885
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:12,232
and I think we did with the art and the gameplay

886
00:58:12,252 --> 00:58:14,413
both kind of fitting with that over the top.

887
00:58:14,513 --> 00:58:18,056
So, you know, maybe in the future it'll change back

888
00:58:18,136 --> 00:58:19,898
to something more akin to Saints Row 2.

889
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:20,298
Who knows?

890
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:20,999
Thanks.

891
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,160
Hi.

892
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,202
Hi, I'm over here.

893
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:26,743
So I love the way that the...

894
00:58:27,438 --> 00:58:32,382
you know, fun at all costs thing works not only into the aesthetic, but into like a lot of the individual systems designs.

895
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:37,667
And some of that stuff seemed like very, like once you saw it, it made perfect sense, like being able to dive into the wind,

896
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:40,390
like through the windshield of a car and not have to wait for the opening animation.

897
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:46,535
But, what were the decisions like for something like the upgrade system, where you, you know, you can essentially become invincible to things.

898
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:51,440
And oftentimes that's something that's very hard to work with the players, and you worry about it basically being a cheat code that can make...

899
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,104
experience stale or something? Did you guys wrestle with that at all? What was the process?

900
00:58:56,785 --> 00:59:02,731
So the question is about making the player invincible, I guess. I think with the upgrades,

901
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:09,437
we wanted players who really put their time into it to get the kind of ultimate reward

902
00:59:09,578 --> 00:59:10,038
out of it.

903
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:18,555
I do see the point about, especially for us with DLC, I think it was, honestly it was

904
00:59:18,595 --> 00:59:23,680
a mistake. It was a mistake, it was an afterthought where we were like, you know, oh my god, we

905
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,764
didn't think about that player that played for 80 hours and is probably more likely to

906
00:59:28,804 --> 00:59:35,170
buy DLC, and now DLC is not really balanced for them. I think that was kind of a mistake.

907
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:37,132
Well, wrap up now?

908
00:59:38,965 --> 00:59:46,230
Last question. Um, yeah, I think, uh, I wanted to reward the player for spending all their time

909
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:51,893
and just make them feel that their effort had really been worth it and they got everything

910
00:59:51,913 --> 00:59:55,996
they wanted out of that. And I felt, for me personally, that, you know, if I'm invincible,

911
00:59:56,056 --> 01:00:01,159
if I've spent that, you know, 40, 50 hours, whatever, that I want to be invincible. I want

912
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:04,461
to just run around and kick ass. Maybe it is kind of a cheat code.

913
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,729
No, I mean, I think it was cool you guys did it.

914
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,716
I was just... it seemed like a departure, so...

915
01:00:08,857 --> 01:00:10,322
Yeah. Thanks.
