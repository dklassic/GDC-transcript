1
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:08,574
Cool.

2
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:11,355
Maybe we should get started.

3
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:15,618
First thing, I'm supposed to remind you to please turn off

4
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:16,558
your cell phones.

5
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:22,242
And I guess, otherwise, people still filing in?

6
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:23,242
OK.

7
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:25,324
I guess we should begin.

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,764
Hello, everyone.

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:31,337
Thank you for coming to this session instead of going right to lunch.

10
00:00:32,318 --> 00:00:35,400
My name is Jane Ng, and I am an artist at Campo Santo.

11
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,403
First, a little bit of background about myself.

12
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:44,588
I've been doing environment art for games professionally for over 12 years.

13
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,432
Before I joined Campo Santo, I was at Double Fine Productions for six years.

14
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:52,434
Most recently, I was the lead artist on The Cave.

15
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:58,146
Before Double Fine, I was part of much larger teams at EA.

16
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:01,988
I was a senior artist on Spore, and in the PS2 era,

17
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,109
I was a lead world artist on Godfather.

18
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,011
I am now working on Firewatch, due out later this year,

19
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:11,132
and this is a behind-the-scenes look

20
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:14,654
at how we are translating a very graphic 2D art style

21
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:18,135
into a 3D world that you can explore in first person.

22
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:19,876
Let's jump right in.

23
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:25,285
This is a poster we made for the announcement of the game

24
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:26,685
almost exactly a year ago,

25
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:28,866
actually right before GDC last year.

26
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,248
This poster art was also actually

27
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:33,609
kind of the key art for our game.

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,251
At that point, our company was only three months old.

29
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,072
Not everybody had started.

30
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:42,513
We hadn't found a graphics programmer yet.

31
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:45,154
We knew the story we wanted to tell,

32
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,135
but visually speaking, this was really all we had.

33
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:50,416
This was the goalpost we set for ourselves.

34
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:53,889
Well, this aesthetic didn't just jump out of nowhere.

35
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,470
The look of the game had been brewing for a few months.

36
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,730
Let me show you.

37
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,851
This was the first concept sketch by Olly Moss,

38
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:05,232
when Sean and Jake, the co-founders of Campo Santo,

39
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:08,232
first started talking with him about maybe working together.

40
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:10,353
And this is about maybe mid-2013.

41
00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:14,194
And here are some more early sketches.

42
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:18,515
The basic premise of the story was already known then.

43
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:23,400
Like you, we know that this happens in the national forest,

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,462
that you play as a fire lookout.

45
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:29,505
Who spent a lot of time talking to another lookout

46
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,345
in another tower?

47
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,629
Now let me show you how the game looks right now.

48
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:14,088
Thank you.

49
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:20,052
For the next 23 minutes or so,

50
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:23,154
I will explain how we were able to create this game world

51
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:26,176
with a very small art team in the last 12 months.

52
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:27,757
And if you like what you see,

53
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:31,019
we have a public demo this Friday, actually.

54
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,361
I will share more details at the end,

55
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,742
and you can come see it for yourselves.

56
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:38,084
Okay, let's back up a little bit.

57
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:39,585
What is Firewatch?

58
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,416
Firewatch is a mystery set in the Wyoming wilderness,

59
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:46,278
where your only emotional lifeline is the person

60
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,079
on the other end of a handheld radio.

61
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,102
It is a narrative exploration game made in a Unity engine.

62
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:55,645
We were using Unity 4.5 all last year,

63
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:58,386
and we have just transitioned into Unity 5.

64
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,790
You play as Henry in first person,

65
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,612
and you have full body awareness in the game.

66
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,498
You can look down and see your body,

67
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:11,780
see that maybe you should hike outside a little more often,

68
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,342
see your boots going through the grass,

69
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:16,283
your hands interacting in the world,

70
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,245
and you spend a lot of time talking to Lila

71
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:22,547
over your handheld radio, and she's your supervisor.

72
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,570
Henry's story takes place in a very specific time

73
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,211
in a very specific place.

74
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:32,794
We are trying to evoke, not necessarily recreate,

75
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:35,775
a piece of wilderness in the Shoshone National Forest

76
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:36,476
in Wyoming.

77
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:37,745
in the summer of 1989.

78
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:43,329
The world of Firewatch is visually very stylized,

79
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,652
but for Henry's story to be believable and immersive,

80
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:48,794
the world has to feel real.

81
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:53,118
We really want the player to feel physically connected

82
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:54,519
to Henry in first person.

83
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,128
It is important that as Henry,

84
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:09,116
The player feels like he could live in this cabin as a lookout,

85
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:13,098
that this forest around him is a place he could have real human thoughts,

86
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:17,981
real worries, and thus a real relationship over the radio with Delilah.

87
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,742
The art really needs to support this sense of realness,

88
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:23,763
despite whatever stylization.

89
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:28,446
So who is making this? Who is Campbell Santo?

90
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,687
We are a small development team of 10,

91
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:34,888
with seven of us based right here in San Francisco,

92
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:38,030
one in Vancouver, Canada, and two in the UK.

93
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,672
And we all wear many hats, so we don't really have titles.

94
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,874
But this is about the half of us most daily

95
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:46,875
preoccupied with the visual aspects of the game.

96
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,398
Now let's go back to talking a bit more about the key art.

97
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:56,287
It is designed by Olly Moss, and as some of you might know,

98
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,568
he is quite an established graphic designer

99
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:01,070
before he became involved with game development.

100
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,031
Olly is most well-known for his poster designs.

101
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:09,674
A lot of them are about movies, and some are about games.

102
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:14,296
His designs are great at clearly communicating an idea

103
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:17,037
while hitting the right emotional tone of the subject.

104
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,698
And I really, really like that Last of Us one.

105
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,839
Now let's look a bit into what is so striking

106
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,579
about this image.

107
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,582
If this is to be our art direction for a 3D game,

108
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:31,924
we really need to clearly understand

109
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,306
what makes this image so special for us.

110
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,489
Why it makes people feel the way they feel when they see it,

111
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,332
before we can even attempt to translate this into the game.

112
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,794
Analyzing this could be its own lecture,

113
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:47,116
so for today I will just pick three key points

114
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:47,656
to talk about.

115
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,018
I will first list them,

116
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,939
and then I will go into detail for each one.

117
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,982
Okay, number one, the colors.

118
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:58,184
There are beautiful and bold colors here,

119
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:00,244
and they're in very distinct layers.

120
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,086
Each layer adds to a feeling of great depth and distance,

121
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,207
pretty perfect for a wilderness game.

122
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,609
And the color palette itself really sets the right tone

123
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,809
for a mystery in the woods.

124
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,151
Number two, the shapes.

125
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:18,873
Much of the composition is made with flat shapes

126
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:20,394
with strong distinctive silhouettes

127
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,495
with abstracted internal details.

128
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,857
Number three, narrative details.

129
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,618
You might not notice on first glance,

130
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:34,200
but if you look closer, the story is actually hinted at

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,100
in the little details.

132
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:41,063
Okay, now let's talk a bit about how we're bringing

133
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,644
the layers of colors in the game in some detail.

134
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,787
Now, if we were making a 2D game,

135
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,169
this would actually be quite easily achieved.

136
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,211
You know, use an eyedropper,

137
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,773
separate these into parallaxing layers,

138
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:54,994
and you know, bam.

139
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,616
But in a 3D world,

140
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,938
one in which you can walk around at will,

141
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,121
not to mention Firewatch is not a level-based game.

142
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:06,984
And as much as we love this color orange,

143
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,026
it will look lovely during the sunset,

144
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:11,128
but it really shouldn't look like that

145
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:12,669
in the night or in the morning.

146
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,252
So copying the colors directly from the concept art

147
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:19,853
and painting it directly onto the assets

148
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:21,394
is quite out of the question.

149
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,495
We require instead a dynamic solution.

150
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,757
Since Firewatch takes place in the outdoors,

151
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:31,439
the biggest chunk of color is actually determined

152
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:32,119
by the sky.

153
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,140
Sometimes it's even more than half of your screen.

154
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:39,185
We tried a few different ways to make our skyboxes.

155
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,827
Initially, we used a program called VIEW

156
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,469
to generate panoramas.

157
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,111
But we have since developed our own tool

158
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:48,893
to generate procedural skies that really cut down

159
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,234
on the compression artifacts.

160
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,416
And it is also a dynamic tool.

161
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:57,280
And this shows you a bit of what our sky tool looks like.

162
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:03,251
Now, for our style, we really want to be able

163
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:06,716
to control our sky colors like how you would imagine

164
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,899
making such a thing inside Photoshop,

165
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,264
rather than how you would define a physically correct,

166
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:14,507
physically based sky shader.

167
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,430
Due to the time limit, I can't go into too much detail

168
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,971
about exactly what's going on here.

169
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:22,394
But Paolo, our graphics programmer,

170
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,415
has written a pretty in-depth explanation

171
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:25,697
on our development blog.

172
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:27,578
So if you want to read more about it,

173
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:30,441
I will share the link, and it will be explained there.

174
00:09:32,663 --> 00:09:35,525
The sky is really important because we also

175
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:38,528
derive a lot of game lighting from the sky.

176
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,571
And lighting is a huge factor in determining color on screen.

177
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,126
Since the bulk of our development was using Unity 4.5,

178
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:52,188
we used the excellent Unity extension Marmoset SkySharp

179
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:55,429
as our dynamic image-based lighting solution.

180
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,090
And SkySharp is so easy to use.

181
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,071
Once you have a visual skybox,

182
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:02,712
and in our case we used the procedural tool

183
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:04,472
that I just showed in the previous slide,

184
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:07,954
you just need to add a shadow passing directional light,

185
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:11,495
which is your sun, and with a few button presses,

186
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,956
and you will have yourself a very naturalistic

187
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:17,157
and very dynamic lighting in a world that matches your sky.

188
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:21,218
And this approach pairs ideally with big outdoor spaces.

189
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:24,079
And luckily, Firewatch falls into that category.

190
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,420
The upside of having a dynamic solution for lighting

191
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,041
is that if you build an interpolation manager

192
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,982
on top of it, you can change your colors on the fly

193
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,122
as the player moves around.

194
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,969
And one of the ways we trigger a color change

195
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,890
is using trigger volumes.

196
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,051
So in this video, I accidentally placed one right around here.

197
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:50,412
So it's a mistake.

198
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:53,433
It doesn't happen like that in the game.

199
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,594
But it looks really cool, and it illustrates my points,

200
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:57,615
so I recorded it.

201
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,316
Yeah, it's not like that in the game.

202
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:04,417
So actually, in the video, besides the sky and sun

203
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:07,278
changing colors, something else was also changing.

204
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:09,184
It's the atmospheric fog.

205
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:15,231
Now, but before I talk about the fog, it is hot tip time.

206
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:20,376
I'm going to share some of these lessons learned all

207
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:20,977
through the talk.

208
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:23,780
And these are mostly aimed for smaller developers.

209
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:26,202
OK, so hot tip number one.

210
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:29,966
Spend the money to buy a tool if it will save you

211
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:30,967
a lot of development time.

212
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:33,625
It is very tempting to write your own tools

213
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:36,087
because you know what you want, you know how you want it,

214
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,109
but it takes a lot of time to make good usable tools.

215
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,852
And here's a list of Unity extensions

216
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:44,013
that we bought and used and are very thankful for.

217
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,216
Something that is $120 per seat

218
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:50,899
is considered very expensive in a Unity asset store.

219
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,582
But if it saves you a day or two per seat, it is worth it.

220
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,245
That is equivalent to paying someone $15 an hour

221
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:58,446
for just one day at work.

222
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,142
you could be spending that day making your game better

223
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:04,423
and more unique instead.

224
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:08,847
Okay, so we have sky color,

225
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,609
but how do we create those layers leading up to the sky?

226
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,153
The answer is, as I said before, atmospheric fog.

227
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:18,075
Traditionally in 3D games,

228
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:19,837
most artists would use fog

229
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,458
to enhance the perception of distance.

230
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,661
The objects are gradually more fogged out

231
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:26,523
as they become more distant.

232
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:31,659
And the Unity scene fog or the global fog image effect readily achieves this.

233
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:36,667
The problem is, with just a scene fog, is that you only get one color.

234
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:41,815
And it also just uniformly becomes stronger as, you know, as more distant.

235
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:45,894
So in order to get final control over the fog,

236
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:50,256
our first instinct was to use a color strip texture

237
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,178
to modulate the color and intensity of fog

238
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:54,038
based on distance.

239
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,800
We developed what we are calling stylistic fog.

240
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,381
It's a very innovative name,

241
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:02,823
which takes a strip of RGBA texture as input,

242
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,384
and it is applied as an additive blend

243
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:07,646
post-process image effect to the scene.

244
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,228
Here's the scene in Firewatch without fog.

245
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:14,697
And here it is with stylistic fog.

246
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:17,299
And you can see the texture strip we're using

247
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,640
in the scene in the bottom.

248
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:24,264
And this really scary, horrific one is my reference fog.

249
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:25,965
It is very good for debugging,

250
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:29,448
and you can see exactly what pixels in your color strip

251
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:31,729
is affecting which part of your scene.

252
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:35,712
Now let's look at the same scene in a different lighting.

253
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,394
This is actually the same lighting

254
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:41,476
from the video I showed earlier, but with no fog.

255
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,623
And now with stylistic fog.

256
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,364
When the fog intensity is high,

257
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:50,445
it really hits close to the graphic art style of the poster.

258
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,786
And since it is a dynamic system,

259
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,786
it is very easy to experiment with.

260
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:57,687
This is the sunset lighting,

261
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,787
but with the daytime fog we had earlier.

262
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,968
It's kind of fun to just play with it.

263
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:03,828
Here's another experiment.

264
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:05,089
I kind of like this one.

265
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:06,169
It's weird, though.

266
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,310
I hope this shows how powerful it is

267
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,631
to have good controls over your different colors.

268
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:16,108
Which brings me to hot tip number two.

269
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,812
So while I urge you all to buy the tools when you can,

270
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,113
you are going to have to make some of your own.

271
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:27,776
And when you do, excuse me,

272
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,118
develop your custom tools to the strength of your team

273
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:32,979
with a goal to minimize dependencies.

274
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:37,005
For example, it makes sense for us to use a color strip

275
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:40,627
textured control fog because it is very easy for Ollie,

276
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,189
who is an excellent 2D artist who lives and breathes

277
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:46,631
Photoshop every day, to understand a texture strip

278
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,252
intuitively as an input.

279
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:50,713
It might not make sense for another team,

280
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:54,195
so if, let's say, a text-based input is more comfortable

281
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:56,136
to you, then by all means, use that instead.

282
00:14:56,156 --> 00:15:00,819
Okay, now let's talk about the importance

283
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:01,980
of the color palette itself.

284
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:06,218
The colors are not just there to look beautiful.

285
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,541
The colors on screen really do drive the mood of the scene.

286
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:13,025
It is really important to recognize what kind of mood

287
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,626
you are trying to convey with your colors.

288
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,869
And since Firewatch is a narrative game,

289
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,092
we are pretty clear on what mood we are trying to tailor

290
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,133
for each story moment.

291
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,621
The art being in harmony with what the player is feeling

292
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:28,963
really does add to the immersive realness

293
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,044
of player experience.

294
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:33,447
For example, when the game is trying to introduce

295
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:36,190
a mysterious, perhaps menacing element,

296
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,772
you really want the mood of the scene to support that.

297
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,235
You probably don't want that crazy parade,

298
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:44,417
you know, birthday party color scheme

299
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:46,158
when you're trying to be spooky.

300
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,939
We sketch up this mood progression with what's called a color script.

301
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,142
It is a process used frequently in other games and also films.

302
00:15:56,742 --> 00:15:59,724
This is a chunk of color script from The Incredibles by Pixar.

303
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,507
And this is our color script for our PAX demo.

304
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:09,630
And here's another one for a little bit later in the game.

305
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:13,852
We try to do this really early in world building.

306
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,285
When we have to make a new area of the game,

307
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:19,173
we pick the most iconic story moment for the locale

308
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,139
and build it with that color palette in mind.

309
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:23,594
And we do this in passes as well.

310
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:27,735
First, when you have a pretty rough idea of player experience,

311
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:29,695
we have a pretty rough color script

312
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:32,856
and use that information to build a pretty rough gray box.

313
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,756
And then you play around it.

314
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:37,457
And when you're happy with the general scale and pacing,

315
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:39,957
we take screenshots from the game,

316
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:43,218
paint over it to how we want, and use

317
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,998
those to create a more detailed color script, which

318
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:47,099
are more like these ones.

319
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,460
Now, hot tip number three.

320
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:56,914
Having a color script really helps a team visually map out player experience.

321
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,415
Whoops, I think I went too far.

322
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,337
Anyway, I think you guys saw the thing.

323
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:07,680
Having a color script really helps a team visually map out player experience

324
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,061
from start to finish and be on the same page about expectations.

325
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:15,203
Make sure you're happy with an overview of player experience

326
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:19,405
with sketches and whatnot before you go into full art production.

327
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,491
Making art once is not actually that hard.

328
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:26,632
Having to rework finished assets is what is really costly

329
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,512
for a small team.

330
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:30,933
Okay, now I'm doing it right.

331
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:35,134
Let's switch gears a bit and talk about shapes and silhouettes.

332
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:40,975
Now, since Firewatch is set in the Wyoming wilderness,

333
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:42,656
our Wyoming wilderness,

334
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:44,996
and not, let's say, a fantasy wilderness

335
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:46,817
like Middle Earth or Brutal Legend,

336
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,886
We don't really have giant evil shiny towers

337
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,787
or huge statues that we can use

338
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:54,248
to draw the player's interest.

339
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,350
What do we have?

340
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,232
Lots of trees and rocks everywhere.

341
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,236
So we have to use those natural elements

342
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,938
to effectively guide the player's eye

343
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:07,099
to where we want them to go.

344
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,681
And this is a quick drawing of how

345
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:10,942
we're using some trees and rocks

346
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:13,003
to see if we can funnel the player forward.

347
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:17,246
And this is how we mock it up pretty quickly.

348
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:20,327
And notice how there is already a stuffed-in sky

349
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:22,828
and some really rough lighting even at this stage.

350
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,231
And this is a paint-over concept Ollie did over a screenshot

351
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,472
after he saw how crappy it was.

352
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,273
And this is what's currently in the game.

353
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,234
We nicknamed this Pride Rock.

354
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:41,136
And if you as a team naturally nickname your big shapes

355
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,837
during development, you're probably on the right track.

356
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,390
Now trees.

357
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:52,831
When creating our trees, I focus mostly on the silhouette

358
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:54,032
they create in distance.

359
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:55,572
And these are all handmade.

360
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:57,293
We don't have sweet tree or anything.

361
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,313
They still have to look good up close, of course.

362
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:03,574
But I just make sure that the lower branches are up to snuff,

363
00:19:03,774 --> 00:19:05,655
because most of the rest of the tree

364
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,455
is usually way beyond player reach.

365
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:10,476
These things are actually realistically proportioned.

366
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:13,917
So they're like 20, 30 meters tall or even taller.

367
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:15,958
Real trees are really big.

368
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,839
Ollie really wanted our tree shapes to get more stylized

369
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,581
and more simplified as they're further out in the distance,

370
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,021
just like in the key art.

371
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:28,563
Now, the middle two trees on screen,

372
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:30,424
the one on the middle left,

373
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:33,666
is what a model would look like without any texture detail.

374
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:37,288
And he's hoping that for the middle right,

375
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,030
it shows what, in Ollie's mind,

376
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,832
a reduced detail LOD stylization should look like.

377
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:46,514
While the stylistic fog is great

378
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,735
at cutting down the texture detail.

379
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,191
It does nothing to simplify the silhouette of the trees at all.

380
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:55,893
So how are we going to do this?

381
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,195
When I was first playing with Unity,

382
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,437
I noticed that when you're creating an alpha material,

383
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:07,279
alpha texture, there is this slider called alpha cutoff,

384
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,200
which essentially determines where the transparency

385
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,661
threshold of your alpha testing is.

386
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,483
And this shows the same tree with three different alpha

387
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:16,123
cutoff settings.

388
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,731
And it is much easier to see the difference in silhouette.

389
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:26,194
So I realized, hmm, now if we could somehow adjust

390
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:28,795
the slider as the tree is further out in the distance,

391
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:31,757
this would basically achieve the effect we kinda want

392
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,058
of simplifying the silhouette.

393
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:35,279
And so that's what we did.

394
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,521
In our foliage shader, we do puff out the tree

395
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:41,643
in the alpha test threshold, just like this.

396
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,787
And together with the stylistic fog,

397
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:48,690
it does a really good job of simplifying and stylizing

398
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:50,752
what we want to achieve in the art direction.

399
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:55,237
Okay, now a quick few words about our rocks.

400
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,760
This is a concept sheet for our rocks.

401
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,543
It is all about the angular shapes,

402
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,305
and especially the shapes that they create

403
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:03,286
in pretty harsh lighting.

404
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:08,504
And when I was making these, I basically only cared about the shape they create.

405
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:13,766
I tried to make each module one have its unique, interesting shape characteristic in all 360

406
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:17,889
degrees so I can use them differently as I rotate them.

407
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,750
And think of these as your rock words.

408
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,553
And just like how you use words to create different sentences, we're hoping that we

409
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:30,636
can use these rock words to create different rock sentences so they all mean something

410
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:31,956
different in combination.

411
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:35,099
Or you can think of these as Lego blocks, you know, similar.

412
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,324
And there's almost no texture detail on these,

413
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,429
other than some dry-brushed highlights on the edges

414
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:44,213
from the ZBrush sculpt, a gentle occlusion bake,

415
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:45,756
and a good quality normal map.

416
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:49,558
Okay, let me demonstrate how we actually use

417
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:50,838
these raw modules.

418
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,840
This is a detailed paint-over concept

419
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,441
with notes for our front-end UI scene.

420
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,303
It is also the first shot of our teaser trailer.

421
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:03,084
And as you can see, the notes are all about

422
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:06,206
how we should arrange the raw composition.

423
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:09,587
And this is a quick scene breakdown

424
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:11,428
showing just how we use those

425
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:14,290
to create what Olly wanted.

426
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,307
You will see a floating one.

427
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:19,569
Yeah, those floating ones are just a module

428
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,050
before I layer onto the scene.

429
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:28,176
Getting close, that's pretty good.

430
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:30,238
Need some pointy bits though, right?

431
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:31,238
There you go.

432
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:34,521
I'm missing some stairs, and that one's good for stairs.

433
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:36,763
Ta-da!

434
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:41,868
Okay, so hot tip number four.

435
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:46,069
Make a small number of modular assets that are versatile.

436
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,110
For a game full of rocks,

437
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,071
we actually only have a handful of types.

438
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,571
Keeping your number of assets low

439
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,432
makes your life a lot easier

440
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:56,433
because you'll be managing way less data.

441
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:59,954
You are likely going to have to retouch all of your assets

442
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:02,635
like once or twice, so if you only need three rocks,

443
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:06,136
don't make a fourth one, even if it's really fun to make.

444
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:11,883
Okay, I talked a lot about the ways we have abstracted

445
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:15,445
the forest of Firewatch down to just shapes and colors.

446
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:18,646
Now let's go into the ways we put narrative details

447
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:19,227
into the world.

448
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:23,469
I mentioned earlier that no matter the stylization

449
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,010
of the art, the world needs to feel real enough

450
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,031
to support a real human relationship you build

451
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:29,792
with Delilah.

452
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:33,433
And one main way the player interacts with Delilah

453
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:36,275
is through conversing about objects that you can look at.

454
00:23:39,882 --> 00:23:42,103
or objects that you can pick up, examine,

455
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:46,544
and you can choose to radio to Delilah and talk about them.

456
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:48,445
Yeah, check out this whiskey.

457
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:53,286
So while we focused on the shapes and silhouettes

458
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:55,107
of the generic rocks and trees in the world,

459
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:58,788
we did the exact opposite for all the human scale props

460
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:00,168
that has narrative payoff.

461
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:03,069
These items are actually quite simple in shape,

462
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,830
but has a lot of detail in the texture

463
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,510
and are all very unique.

464
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:10,403
And these are all in engine shots, actually.

465
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:11,564
We just put it in a white room.

466
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,847
And there are two advantages to this style choice.

467
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:19,529
Number one, it establishes a pretty clear visual language

468
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:23,491
that any object with a certain level of texture detail

469
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,292
is something that adds to your story,

470
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:27,934
or is something that you could talk to Delilah about.

471
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,796
And the second is our last hot tip.

472
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:37,449
By focusing your art bandwidth on assets

473
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:40,593
that deliver the most payoff in terms of player experience,

474
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:43,295
you are basically getting the most bang for your buck there.

475
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,958
So do use style to your production advantage.

476
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,101
Our rocks and trees are relatively simple assets

477
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:50,663
because they only serve to set the stage,

478
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:54,327
but we put a lot of design love and thought into these props

479
00:24:54,387 --> 00:24:56,169
because they do help build narrative,

480
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:58,091
and narrative is the core of our game.

481
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,292
Okay, now some final thoughts.

482
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,653
I would like to encourage you all

483
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,174
to embrace your limitations.

484
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:07,995
A lot of the art and process decisions

485
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:09,556
we have made developing Firewatch

486
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:12,037
are defined by the people and technology

487
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,278
we have available to us.

488
00:25:14,418 --> 00:25:15,819
Knowing what your limitations are

489
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:18,740
and working within them can be very empowering.

490
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:21,802
They can push you to play to your strengths,

491
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:22,942
and when you do that,

492
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:25,443
you can create amazing things with a small team.

493
00:25:27,515 --> 00:25:31,217
Lastly, I want to invite you all to our demo day this Friday.

494
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:35,760
It's from 11 to 7 on Howard Street between 6 and 7.

495
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,301
So it's only two or three blocks from here.

496
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:39,182
Very walkable.

497
00:25:39,982 --> 00:25:42,724
And we have transformed a bit of Soma into a little forest.

498
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:44,565
I mean, there are real trees and everything.

499
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:45,605
It's awesome.

500
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:47,646
And you can play Firewatch there.

501
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:48,587
We have demo stations.

502
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:50,068
And it's a free event.

503
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:52,429
You don't need a GDC pass, so bring a friend.

504
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,090
And that's it.

505
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,931
I hope you all enjoyed the presentation.

506
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:57,131
Thank you.

507
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:10,068
Again, for those interested in more in-depth explanation

508
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:13,109
for the processes and tools I mentioned or haven't mentioned,

509
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,350
we try to keep up with our development blog

510
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,371
and probably will do more of it after GDC.

511
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,811
And please keep in touch.

512
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:22,732
Twitter's probably best.

513
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:25,573
And please fill in the evaluation form.

514
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:27,713
I very much appreciate it if you do.

515
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:30,214
And have a great rest of GDC.

516
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:31,515
Thank you.
