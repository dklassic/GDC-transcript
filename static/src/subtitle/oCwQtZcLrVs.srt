1
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:11,455
OK, thanks for tuning in.

2
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:14,937
This is Mining Your Own Design, Crafting the Crafting System

3
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:15,718
in Astroneer.

4
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:17,599
Let's get right into it.

5
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,281
So first, just a couple of quick introductions.

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,122
I'm Aaron Bittlecombe.

7
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:25,323
I'm a technical designer with System Era.

8
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:28,285
And I've been in games for about eight years

9
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:31,446
and been working on Astroneer for the last three of those.

10
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:37,345
Before that, I worked on Galaxy, this 2D roguelike shooter,

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,927
and on Envelop VR, which was a desktop VR platform.

12
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:44,269
Most of my career has been focused on gameplay

13
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:46,690
and interaction design, especially features

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,851
that are highly physical and tactile.

15
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,953
But I've also worked on everything from systems design

16
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:53,173
to engine architecture.

17
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,315
I'm sure any indie devs listening are familiar

18
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:57,756
with wearing lots of different hats.

19
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:01,678
And I would like to overhear a gameplay programmer

20
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:02,318
in a system era.

21
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:05,016
I started in games around the same time as Aaron,

22
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:07,177
but I worked in mobile and casino games

23
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:09,257
before making the jump to PC and console.

24
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:10,938
In addition to programming,

25
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:13,739
I also have a design background that's been part of my work.

26
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,760
I've often worked in UI and UX and large gameplay systems.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,481
I made the Absurd Seagull Simulator's Sploot

28
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:22,361
to try my hand at VR

29
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:24,822
and mess around with its tactile interactions.

30
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:27,643
And I did independent work for a while after that,

31
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,063
also wore many hats,

32
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:30,984
and joined System-R about three years ago.

33
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:34,547
All right, so what is this talk actually about?

34
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:37,788
Well, we wanted to give you a look at some of the lessons

35
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,268
that we learned while working on our crafting update,

36
00:01:40,648 --> 00:01:43,049
which came out near the end of our early access period.

37
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,250
We'd identified that the crafting loop

38
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,350
was kind of struggling to scale up

39
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,110
with the additions that we'd made

40
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,851
to most of the other systems in the game.

41
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:55,632
But to improve it, we had to make big changes

42
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:57,612
to widely integrated parts of the game.

43
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,742
It was kind of like trying to perform open heart surgery,

44
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:03,544
but on a conscious patient.

45
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:06,646
Once we got into working on it, we quickly

46
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,227
started second guessing ourselves.

47
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,530
And it was kind of a red flag that we didn't understand

48
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,232
something about Astroneer.

49
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:22,119
Mining your own design is really just a way

50
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,260
to describe the process that we developed

51
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,742
to overcome that paralysis.

52
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:29,642
We treated Astroneer kind of like an archaeology dig site,

53
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,283
digging into it and deepening our understanding

54
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:33,103
of how it worked.

55
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,764
It allowed us to make changes that could be almost seamless.

56
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:39,045
As a new player, you'd be hard pressed

57
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:40,425
to spot the new from the old.

58
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,126
This meant reconciling some conflicting ideas

59
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:46,787
about the core aspects of our game, which

60
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,948
made our goals seem mutually exclusive at first.

61
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:54,757
That conflict only really became apparent when Elijah and I started pushing forward

62
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,698
what at least felt like competing visions for the game.

63
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,360
We didn't really set out to use this back and forth process. It's just what emerged over the

64
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,942
course of putting this update together. Mining your own design happens whenever we were in

65
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:13,884
conflict with each other. I was coming at the crafting system with more of an outsider's

66
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:18,126
perspective, while Aaron was really familiar with the existing gameplay and how players

67
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,026
were engaging with it.

68
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,201
Soon after we started working on the update,

69
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:25,682
we both accepted that we both had valid points.

70
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:27,822
And diving into Astroneer's mechanics

71
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,583
to break them down and understand them

72
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,763
wasn't so much to prove who was right,

73
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:34,463
but to find some sort of missing or misunderstood

74
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:37,784
piece of the design that could reconcile our perspectives.

75
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,324
We didn't realize it at the time,

76
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:42,985
but this is going to change our understanding of Astroneer

77
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:44,025
and how we build it.

78
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,906
Working together also reviewed holes in the design process

79
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,826
that we were using and advanced it further.

80
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:55,280
It established the immense value of bringing the engineer into the design process early on.

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,943
So, if you're not familiar with it, Astroneer is an exploration, crafting, and survival game set

82
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:07,785
in space. It focuses on ground-based exploration rather than spaceship travel, and it's limited

83
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:10,346
to a small set of planets in a fixed solar system.

84
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:13,796
By this point in development, we had a lot of things

85
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:16,616
that already worked great and made our game really unique.

86
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,777
Our planets were procedural,

87
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:21,117
but each of them had a distinct identity,

88
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,398
and this made exploration both beautiful and unexpected.

89
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:27,238
Our terrain was fully deformable,

90
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,159
and you could sculpt it like Play-Doh.

91
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,299
Item interaction was extremely tactile and diegetic,

92
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,100
which made it not only charming and toy-like,

93
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,320
but it also was intuitive for new players.

94
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,481
And we had this chill, low stakes vibe

95
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,003
that emphasized relaxed problem solving,

96
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,544
with only the occasional moments of danger

97
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:47,825
to kind of spice things up.

98
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,126
All of this was presented

99
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,627
in a vibrant aerospace fantasy package.

100
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:54,889
So what was the problem?

101
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,390
Well, player engagement dropped off

102
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,731
after just a couple of hours.

103
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,452
We were at early access and the opinion

104
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:02,813
of the player base hovered around,

105
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,654
hey, great concept, can't wait to see the full game.

106
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,816
This had not shifted despite months of updates.

107
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:14,172
It was clear that there was something in Astroneer that was sapping player motivation or just

108
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:15,452
not really keeping their interest.

109
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:20,736
There were a lot of fun and interesting things, especially what we had added recently to the

110
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:23,117
game that players just never even got to see.

111
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,300
I believe that it was the crafting system that was kind of the main offender for all

112
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,540
this.

113
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,403
It was flat compared to the new drip of experiences you got from spelunking, unlocking items,

114
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:34,644
and visiting different worlds.

115
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,122
Baseboarding and exploration both generated resources

116
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:39,483
that followed into crafting.

117
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,606
It was kind of the end point of almost all steps

118
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,687
of your gameplay.

119
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,509
Nothing changed how crafting worked, though,

120
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:48,090
past the first hour of the game.

121
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,473
I liked a big moment where a mechanic got introduced

122
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:53,934
that changed some part of the crafting system

123
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,377
you're familiar with and gave you this totally new experience

124
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,618
with new opportunities.

125
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:02,601
Thanks.

126
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:03,021
I like the

127
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:08,446
cadence of crafting games, how they manage to fold in new resources and new steps, new

128
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:10,408
ways of building the longer you play.

129
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:15,592
These are big, important beats in the experience that give you something new and interesting

130
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:18,815
to play with, and they make me excited to see what's going to come next.

131
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,397
It felt like Astroneer was really missing this opportunity.

132
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:27,662
I thought that we should have more resources in the game, but just not make them all available

133
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:28,282
from the outset.

134
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:34,295
I wanted to add a few new modules that combine or transform the existing resources into entirely

135
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:34,715
new ones.

136
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:41,238
This would give us a couple new resource sets, unlocked by these modules, to divide the crafted

137
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:42,579
items up in between.

138
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:49,462
Each module would feed into the next, giving us a nice natural progression so that we could

139
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:54,004
divvy up the recipes between early, mid, and late game pretty effectively.

140
00:06:55,264 --> 00:07:00,187
I didn't actually disagree with Elijah, at least in principle, but I was having trouble

141
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:05,249
squaring it with that same laid-back, low-stakes vibe that felt like a core part of Astroneer's

142
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:05,809
identity.

143
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,712
The team had often talked about simplicity and minimalism as watchwords for the game,

144
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:16,155
and I was worried that the various additions we'd made to the crafting system already

145
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,256
had moved us away from those concepts.

146
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:22,076
Despite the fact that the overall crafting loop was

147
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:25,339
shallow and repetitive, it also had a lot of moving parts

148
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,202
that completed for the player's attention.

149
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:30,466
On top of that, after the smelter,

150
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:32,428
each of our crafting modules only

151
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:34,390
got more complex in their interactions,

152
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:37,735
involving things like reusable containers, which

153
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,136
were needed to hold resources.

154
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:42,769
Even though players use these modules less often

155
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:44,630
than the smelter, their complexity

156
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,930
took a lot more focus.

157
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,571
And it wasn't clear how much the game had actually

158
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:49,412
benefited from it.

159
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:55,855
The more Elijah and I battled over this,

160
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:58,656
the more we started to realize that we were really

161
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:01,297
arguing over the issue of cognitive load in our game.

162
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:03,858
Normally, when you hear that term,

163
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:07,140
it's in a negative context, as in you have too much of it.

164
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:10,440
But you can just as easily end up with not enough,

165
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,962
which results in losing player engagement.

166
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,205
This was the problem that Elijah was pointing to

167
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,466
with our crafting system.

168
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:21,350
Its core loop centered around just three simple steps

169
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,271
that the player repeated ad nauseum.

170
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,874
You mine resources out of the ground,

171
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,555
toss them into the smelter,

172
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:29,697
and use the output to print new items.

173
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:36,415
On top of that, all but one of these resources was available on your starting planet,

174
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:40,321
and there were no choices in how to use them outside of what you wanted to print.

175
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:45,467
But at the same time, we had added several additional crafting stations.

176
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:50,448
And instead of creating a stable long-term loop, they'd started chipping away

177
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:53,448
at the simple elegance that players had found appealing to begin with.

178
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:58,749
From my perspective, I felt like we were already placing too much cognitive load

179
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,830
on players to the point that we were losing them to frustrating complexity.

180
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,391
You run into an apparent contradiction of opinions like this, you know, too much

181
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:09,092
cognitive load versus too little.

182
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,959
Don't be too quick to just discard one argument and take the other.

183
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,781
It's easy to use a common language that is actually obfuscating what you're

184
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,822
really talking about. Aaron and I both had an opinion about

185
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,724
the crafting system, but it was only when we laid out the specifics of our

186
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,225
positions that we realized we were talking about different

187
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:31,787
subsets of the crafting system. Aaron was talking about the visceral

188
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:34,508
moment-to-moment interactions that the player had with crafting.

189
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,929
He did have a really good point about how these modules are complicated to

190
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:38,250
players.

191
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:43,046
for players to use, which I hadn't concerned myself with very much.

192
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:47,590
Instead, I was focusing on the systemic interactions within the crafting system

193
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,153
and how to beef those up. We were both right, but my relative

194
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,935
distance from working on the crafting system

195
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:57,237
day in and day out gave me a pretty clear view of the

196
00:09:57,578 --> 00:10:00,240
core loop of Astroneer's crafting and its deficiencies.

197
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,903
And speaking of the core crafting loop,

198
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:09,378
This diagram illustrates it and kind of how it works.

199
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:12,879
To start with, players use the deform tool

200
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,240
to mine resource nuggets from deposits embedded in the soil.

201
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,001
Two of those mined resources could

202
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,421
be fed through the smelter, which

203
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:21,822
would turn them into metals.

204
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:27,104
And the final crafting step was using the resources

205
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:28,504
that you had mined and that you had

206
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:32,245
converted with the smelter in order to make printed items.

207
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,905
printer would consume a couple of nuggets

208
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,606
and output some kind of item like a solar panel

209
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:41,268
or an oxygenator, something of the sorts useful in space.

210
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,973
The smelter was the only module that created

211
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:53,353
new resources in the game.

212
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:55,695
And it was also the first crafting module

213
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,176
that players would unlock after about 30 minutes of play.

214
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:02,278
It only created two new resources that had a use.

215
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:06,207
Ores didn't have any of the use other than to be smelted.

216
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:09,048
They weren't used in any crafting recipes directly.

217
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:12,129
So the player wasn't facing many trade-offs

218
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,970
when they were engaging with the crafting system.

219
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:19,312
Using it was very simple.

220
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,233
You can see in this video over here that all you have to do

221
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:25,315
is take an ore, place it onto the smelter,

222
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:28,936
and then it turns it into a nugget of metal.

223
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:30,477
It's a one-to-one conversion.

224
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:31,577
And...

225
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:35,668
And again, you can't use the or for anything else.

226
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,311
So with the speltzer being so simple in its form

227
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,993
and having such a simple UX, it really

228
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:45,415
felt more like a beginner crafting module

229
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:48,618
in order to kind of ease players into the concept of using them.

230
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:51,780
But you could make literally every item in the game

231
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,341
using just the speltzer and printers.

232
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:57,424
So let's take another look at that crafting diagram.

233
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,524
As we said, in addition to the core loop,

234
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:02,265
there were these three other modules

235
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:03,646
that were involved in crafting,

236
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:05,527
but were on their own separate track.

237
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:07,868
We'll call this track the spur,

238
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:10,530
because it kind of poked out the side from the core loop.

239
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,692
The first of these was the soil centrifuge,

240
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:16,214
and it was practically the module equivalent

241
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,054
of your terrain tool,

242
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:19,216
as it produced all the same resources as it.

243
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:23,437
Branching out from that were the chem lab and the condenser,

244
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:27,399
both of which made the same single resource, hydrazine,

245
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:29,541
which served as Astroneer's rocket fuel,

246
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,282
but wasn't actually used in crafting.

247
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:36,985
The soil centrifuge worked by taking a sample resource

248
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:38,506
that you would have mined out of the ground

249
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,208
and effectively cloning it in exchange for the soil

250
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:42,929
that was collected when you deformed terrain.

251
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,790
There were a few parts to it

252
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,451
that can make it confusing to use,

253
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:48,793
which is probably a little easier to understand

254
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,773
if we see it in action.

255
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,476
So the orange buttons that you're seeing

256
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:56,977
would allow you to select whatever output you wanted,

257
00:12:57,437 --> 00:13:00,058
but it also made it clear which resources could be cloned.

258
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:02,398
But you could also just select your output

259
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,519
by placing any valid sample resource,

260
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,980
which would automatically set it as the selection.

261
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,620
The amount of resources that you got back

262
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,701
depends on how much soil you provide,

263
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:14,242
and different resources have different exchange rates.

264
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,342
All of this presented a bit of a learning curve

265
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:20,003
without adding anything fundamentally new

266
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:20,843
to the crafting loop.

267
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:32,243
In the case of the condenser in the chem lab, like we said, both of them only produced that

268
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:33,763
single resource, hydrazine.

269
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:39,386
Originally, hydrazine could be either mined out of the ground or produced from nothing

270
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,067
but the atmosphere and electricity through the condenser.

271
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:48,569
Mining something as complex as rocket fuel felt kind of bizarre, but the condenser was

272
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:53,091
way too overpowered and unbounded to serve as the only way to produce hydrazine.

273
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:55,694
So to address both of these issues,

274
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:58,295
we previously added the Chem Lab,

275
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:00,776
which crafted hydrazine from a new resource

276
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,217
that we used to replace the hydrazine deposits.

277
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:06,438
At the same time, we changed hydrazine

278
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,100
to depend on the same reusable canisters

279
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,760
that were also used to store soil.

280
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:12,921
This introduced a constraint

281
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,882
on the previously unbounded production in the condenser,

282
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:18,623
as players now needed to manually supply it

283
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:19,624
with fresh canisters.

284
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:23,944
But the downside was a finicky and kind of tedious UX.

285
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,685
Players had to juggle their canister use

286
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,265
between soil and hydrazine.

287
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,586
And while we had intended for the chem lab

288
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:34,847
to eventually produce an entire set of complex resources,

289
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,388
in the meantime, we were presenting players

290
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:40,108
with two ways of doing exactly the same thing

291
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,009
without a clear trade-off between them.

292
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,361
So let's see how those both worked.

293
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:51,463
With the condenser, using it was actually pretty simple.

294
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:54,466
You just attached an empty canister and started it running.

295
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,288
As long as it remained powered, it

296
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:59,450
would slowly fill up the canister

297
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,530
until it was complete.

298
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:04,193
You could also put empty canisters in storage next to it,

299
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:05,774
and they'd be pulled in automatically

300
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,516
when the previous one was full.

301
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:11,471
For the catalyzer, that thing that looks like a pizza oven,

302
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:13,352
hold the mind resource, ammonium.

303
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,854
For every nugget of ammonium, you also

304
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:17,215
needed an empty canister.

305
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,096
If you had a mismatch between those,

306
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:20,537
the machine wouldn't even start.

307
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:23,959
Otherwise, you'd set it going, and a few seconds later,

308
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,240
you'd have some hydrazine.

309
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:28,302
The issues with the spur modules was

310
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:31,344
more subtle than just an overtly broken design.

311
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,972
It wasn't that players didn't enjoy using them at all.

312
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:37,354
Outside of that initial learning curve,

313
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:41,738
it was actually full of the kind of tactile

314
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:46,143
and dynamic interactions that Astroneer was so special for.

315
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:50,198
The real problems only manifested in the interactions

316
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,319
between these modules and the rest of the game

317
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,599
in one of two ways.

318
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,840
Either they were too cut off from other systems,

319
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:58,701
kind of acting like a mini game,

320
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,362
or they were redundant with other systems

321
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:02,703
and ended up undercutting them.

322
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:06,404
We found that these kinds of design challenges

323
00:16:06,484 --> 00:16:08,485
can be especially difficult to address

324
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:11,726
since things often seem to be working up close.

325
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,083
This not only leads to an urge to defend them

326
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:18,447
from valid critique, but it can also obscure problems

327
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:20,770
until much later on, after those systems

328
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,871
have become entrenched.

329
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:24,914
Confronting issues like this require

330
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:26,596
you to look at your game holistically

331
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:29,299
and evaluate individual parts of your design

332
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,961
as gears in the larger machine.

333
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:38,340
In the case of the condenser and the soil centrifuge,

334
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,762
both of them had been built around testing out

335
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:41,463
different sinks.

336
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,026
The condenser was a power sink, and the soil centrifuge,

337
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:46,848
naturally enough, was a soil sink.

338
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,870
In order to demonstrate each of these ideas,

339
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:53,013
we'd use existing resources to service their output,

340
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:55,976
mostly just as a convenient proof of concept.

341
00:16:56,877 --> 00:17:00,697
But in each case, this had led to the same unintended consequence.

342
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,959
Both functioned as resource gathering shortcuts that started to undercut the need to collect

343
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:11,460
resources from the wild. Mining resources served as the backbone for exploration,

344
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,381
and it helped establish the alternating rhythm between exploration and base management.

345
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:20,001
The Chem Lab was the least problematic of the three,

346
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:22,882
and mostly it just suffered from being underutilized.

347
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:28,321
We still felt like there was a great opportunity to expand its use with new resources,

348
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:31,968
but this was stymied by the problems we were having with the other two.

349
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:39,919
With the strain that these modules placed

350
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:42,360
on the rest of the loop, the obvious question

351
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,720
was why not just cut them and start over,

352
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,641
aside from the fact that we were a live game?

353
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:51,143
The problem was that from the player's perspective,

354
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:52,963
they had real value.

355
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:55,945
The instant gratification that they provided

356
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,586
sidestepped a lot of potential frustrations

357
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:00,946
that arose when needed deposits came up short.

358
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:05,108
In a way, they functioned kind of like player junk food.

359
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,710
In small doses, there wasn't a problem.

360
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,152
But without any limits placed on them,

361
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:13,294
they soon took over the more balanced diet

362
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:14,114
of the mining group.

363
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:18,117
Players gorged themselves until they started to feel sick

364
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,159
and ultimately started burning out.

365
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,702
We saw this pretty clearly with the soil centrifuge.

366
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:30,329
I had actually anticipated the impact that it might have on resource mining,

367
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:34,772
and I tried to mitigate it by making it less efficient than mining deposits.

368
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:39,354
It also required that sample resource of whatever you wanted to produce,

369
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:42,957
so you couldn't just skip ahead without doing some of the initial exploration.

370
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:48,220
The idea was that it would function great as a supplement to mining,

371
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,483
since you could collect soil in the process and get a double return for your efforts.

372
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,538
But players started to just grind for the soil itself,

373
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:58,739
digging up the terrain around their base

374
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:01,760
instead of continuing to explore for deposits

375
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,380
that they could just clone instead.

376
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,401
We'd made some attempts to tune our way out of the problem,

377
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,742
but it didn't really seem like there was a sweet spot.

378
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:12,943
We were kind of in a stalemate with our players.

379
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:15,924
So over time, we really lost sight

380
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:18,024
of why these modules were introduced in the first place.

381
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:21,566
The design intent was to provide new resource sinks

382
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:22,906
and engagement with base builders.

383
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:26,063
We paired those things with these potent resource shortcuts

384
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,125
as an incentive for players to generate power and collect

385
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:29,465
soil.

386
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:32,866
But over time, in our minds, the intent incentive

387
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:35,287
became a single, inseparable assumption

388
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:37,708
about how these modules just had to be.

389
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:41,630
We felt stuck, and trying to balance a resource

390
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,731
clutter in this infinite rock and fuel generator

391
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,012
was not working.

392
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:48,013
This is why mining your own design

393
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:51,695
and doing it with someone else can be so important.

394
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:54,857
in really decomposing how your design works

395
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,878
and figuring out what parts are actually necessary

396
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:57,699
and what parts are not.

397
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,220
And I brought the perspective to Aaron

398
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,622
that we needed a new resource set that

399
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:05,363
expanded over time with the crafting gameplay.

400
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,185
He started to look at the existing crafting system

401
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:09,286
in a totally new light.

402
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:12,808
My proposal provided a new set of incentives for players

403
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:15,549
to engage with crafting and proctored

404
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,590
him to look at our existing modules and the incentives

405
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,571
they provided and asked, wait a minute,

406
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:22,053
maybe these modules don't have the right incentives at all.

407
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:29,725
This was the sign we needed to know that we were on the right track with this redesign.

408
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:36,409
The experience that we intended the player to have started lining up with how we were incentivizing them to play Astroneer.

409
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:44,833
If you find yourself struggling to align your design's incentives and intent, challenge the assumptions that you're making on each half of that divide.

410
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:48,375
This can reveal a hidden or flawed assumption.

411
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:55,178
If you're still struggling to challenge your assumptions, then collaborate with someone who has a very different vision for the design.

412
00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:00,642
It's easy to get attached to the way things are and to take it personally, but let it go.

413
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:05,886
This can be difficult to practice, but it's a powerful way to get through problems that have gotten you totally stumped.

414
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:11,131
In hindsight, the solution to these three was actually pretty straightforward.

415
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:15,594
Since all we needed was to prevent these modules from being redundant with each other,

416
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:18,397
then the answer was to make all of their outputs unique.

417
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:22,631
As soon as we landed on this idea, it immediately clicked for us.

418
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:28,160
Having more modules that made unique resources gave us a way to expand the

419
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,926
resource table without adding tens of new deposits, which was pretty

420
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,028
disruptive to the game.

421
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:38,673
Resource acquisition could tie into additional game systems in a more fundamental way,

422
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:44,636
and most pressingly, it would expand the depth of the crafting system without even needing new

423
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:50,239
modules, while simultaneously reducing the cognitive load caused by the current disjointed

424
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:57,322
system. The result of this was a distinct purpose for each of the three modules that actually

425
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,723
strengthened their existing conceptual identities.

426
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:04,795
First up, we had the soil centrifuge.

427
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:07,597
Instead of cloning our mined resources,

428
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:11,140
we coined the idea of trace minerals that could only

429
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,401
be produced from soil.

430
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,143
This leaned into the fact that soil

431
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,305
could be collected anywhere, making

432
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:20,207
these resources more reliably available than their mined

433
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:20,827
counterparts.

434
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:24,730
This also did away with the idea of the confusing sample

435
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,672
mechanic, which made it much easier

436
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:27,733
to select what you wanted.

437
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:35,759
For the condenser, we embraced the idea that you were collecting resources out of the atmosphere itself,

438
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,984
going further with that idea and giving every planet a different set of gases that could be produced.

439
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:45,829
And since that meant it no longer took the place of other systems,

440
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:52,896
there wasn't as much need to constrain it, which allowed us to do away with the reusable canisters that players were finding kind of tedious.

441
00:22:55,699 --> 00:23:01,772
And finally, for the chemistry lab, we could finally expand it into a multipurpose crafting station.

442
00:23:02,785 --> 00:23:06,508
To differentiate the complex resources that it would produce from the smelter,

443
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:11,392
we introduced the idea of composite resources, which would be made up from mixed ingredients.

444
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:18,237
This had a secondary benefit in that it allowed us to compact multiple resources into one,

445
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:21,900
which was particularly important in a game with a diegetic inventory,

446
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,885
where your inventory space was actually physical and could take up real space in the game.

447
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:39,666
Taken all together, these changes not only addressed the existing issues that we'd had with these modules, they opened up new opportunities for us.

448
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:48,128
The condenser and the centrifuge could provide new challenge factors for resource scarcity, planet travel, and large-scale terrain deformation.

449
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:54,970
And the Chem Lab created a huge multiplier on our raw resources, adding any number of permutations between them.

450
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:58,979
For the first time, it felt like our goals for this update

451
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:00,320
actually seemed to be in sight.

452
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,382
You can kind of see with the graph there

453
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,542
how this would work.

454
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:09,305
The three different sources for our raw resources

455
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,926
could funnel through the other crafting stations

456
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:14,288
into finally a complex one at the end.

457
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:19,230
So fixing these modules required us to take a step back

458
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,292
and ask two questions that were vital in this process

459
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:23,413
of mining our own design.

460
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:25,634
What do we want the player to do?

461
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,980
and why is the player willing to do it?

462
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:31,643
The first is about examining your intent as a developer.

463
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:35,046
How does your economy, enemy AI, and counter design

464
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:37,487
all come together to make the gameplay experience

465
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:38,008
for the player?

466
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:39,849
What possibilities and challenges

467
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:41,190
are you trying to introduce to them?

468
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:44,092
The second question is about what your player

469
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,513
is actually doing in your game.

470
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:47,155
Players can come up with shortcuts

471
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,176
you never anticipated that subvert your intent.

472
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:52,098
They can also put up with boring or bucky gameplay

473
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:53,880
to accomplish their own personal goals.

474
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,040
Motivations can vary wildly.

475
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,682
They can be something like mastery, joy, item rewards,

476
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:01,203
fantasy fulfillment.

477
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:03,484
But what matters is that your player wants it.

478
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:06,005
And since it has shaped the desire path

479
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:07,205
that players take through your game

480
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,786
to get to what they really want.

481
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:14,749
You're playing the game wrong is kind of a classic designer

482
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:15,269
complaint.

483
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:18,710
But this is more about spotting negative player motivation

484
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,152
that's enticing them to suffer for what they really want.

485
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,127
The goal is to alleviate player fatigue

486
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,148
and make sure they're not putting up the clunky UX

487
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:27,008
or in gameplay.

488
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:29,630
This is a factor in our big game lull

489
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,151
that I didn't totally appreciate at the outset.

490
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:34,833
I kind of thought it was all about systemic design, right?

491
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:38,574
But once you've identified these negative player motivations,

492
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:40,816
fixing them is going to lead you back to that question of,

493
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:42,797
what do we want the player to do?

494
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:45,618
Every time you iterate those two questions,

495
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:47,179
you bring your design's incentives

496
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:49,900
and the player's desires into tighter alignment.

497
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:53,773
This probably doesn't sound like a totally revelatory process

498
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:55,794
to you, but it can be easy to forget

499
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:58,195
to do it at the right time, and more importantly,

500
00:25:58,415 --> 00:26:00,356
to consider both of these questions fully.

501
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:07,820
So at this point, we had kind of assumed that the hard part

502
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,000
was really behind us.

503
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:12,402
Astroneer uses real world materials.

504
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:15,023
Partly this is for the aerospace fantasy aesthetic,

505
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:17,585
but we also felt it made the printer recipes more intuitive.

506
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:23,104
we assumed that this rear wall connection would make it very easy to pick additional ingredients.

507
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:29,130
Aaron did some research and came up with a potential set, and it was too large, and he

508
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,874
struggled to narrow it down. Thinking that maybe we just didn't understand them well enough to

509
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:37,497
leverage these new resources, Aaron invited me to take a look over the

510
00:26:37,617 --> 00:26:42,361
potential ingredients with him. I have an interest in engineering and manufacturing.

511
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,210
These were real-world ingredients,

512
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,631
they had real-world properties that were useful in the manufacture of various goods.

513
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:51,412
Things like electric wood conductor,

514
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:54,193
light structural material, shock absorber.

515
00:26:55,273 --> 00:26:57,014
We thought tagging all these new resources with

516
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,915
these properties was going to make it obvious to pick.

517
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:02,536
Instead, we found it no easier to judge.

518
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:06,457
It was no easier to judge if Astroneedle needed

519
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:08,758
another electrical conductor or shock absorber

520
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:12,359
versus if it needed tungsten carbide or carbon fiber.

521
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:18,798
So running around in circles like this

522
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:22,560
was an indication that we didn't totally understand something

523
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,062
about our design, maybe an entire pillar of our design

524
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,563
that hadn't been identified yet.

525
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:30,604
We had to do some mining to discover

526
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:33,346
the missing connection between Astroneer's resources

527
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:34,947
and the recipes.

528
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:37,888
From the outset, we assumed that we

529
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:40,150
need more resources was the problem that we were solving.

530
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,052
It was, but mostly in service of adding a crafting progression

531
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:44,572
to our game.

532
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:50,376
We kept asking, what are these materials used for in the real world to try and understand them better?

533
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:55,479
But that's not as useful a question as, what are these materials used for in Astroneer?

534
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,661
To print items is the answer to that question.

535
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,422
Half of their purpose was unexamined.

536
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:06,145
Our exhaustive research on the new resources made us pretty sure we had a good grasp on them.

537
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:10,267
But maybe we didn't understand the anatomy of a printed item itself well enough.

538
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:15,150
It was easy to forget about printed items because we weren't really adding many to this new update.

539
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,598
So we took all the resources off of the board

540
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:23,479
and put up all the items you could print instead.

541
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,780
We went through each of them and started asking,

542
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:28,982
what would matter if you tried to build this?

543
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:32,164
A shuttle would need to be light, strong, and heat

544
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:32,625
resistant.

545
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:35,486
A rover would need to be tough and have good shock absorption.

546
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,588
This line of questioning made us focus

547
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,089
on the output of the crafting system,

548
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:41,390
and it generated the same set of material properties

549
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,011
that we'd come up with for the resources.

550
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,113
This is an exciting moment.

551
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,954
Up until this point, we'd never thought about our printed items

552
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:48,475
in this way.

553
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:50,953
We had such a small set of ingredients in the game

554
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:53,115
that we'd made all of our recipes on intuition.

555
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,557
There was an underlying logic to the system

556
00:28:55,597 --> 00:28:57,439
we had just never articulated before.

557
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,500
Unfortunately, with Astroneer late

558
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,681
in its early access development,

559
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,202
there were a lot of printed items

560
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:03,724
to do this mapping exercise on.

561
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:06,886
It gave us a very clear roadmap of the material properties

562
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:09,909
that would be most useful for printing Astroneer-type items.

563
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,331
Knowing that made the set of resources

564
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:15,413
that best matched those material properties quickly emerge.

565
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:19,747
So part of the problem here was that we were really

566
00:29:19,807 --> 00:29:22,529
relying too much on our design intuitions.

567
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,091
Especially on a small indie game,

568
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,014
it was pretty effective for a long time

569
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:30,756
to just kind of run off of our gut feelings

570
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:32,978
on what the game needed and how things worked.

571
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,280
In the early stages of development,

572
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,782
having good design intuition is an effective way

573
00:29:37,822 --> 00:29:38,923
to build up a foundation.

574
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:41,685
But as the game becomes more complex,

575
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:44,347
those same intuitions can start to get murky.

576
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:48,534
Rather than relying solely on your gut feelings,

577
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:53,498
try to identify the underlying rules guiding your intuitions

578
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,879
and make them explicit.

579
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,602
This makes it possible to quickly iterate

580
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,004
on concepts with confidence, instead

581
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:01,865
of spending weeks trying to understand

582
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,146
why something feels off.

583
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:07,009
So we were in a pretty good place.

584
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,052
Every new ingredient in the revised crafting system

585
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:12,894
had a purpose, except for the gases.

586
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:14,996
Gases were tough to think about.

587
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,462
They are used in manufacturing, but more often than being just

588
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,563
like a direct ingredient in making something,

589
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,464
they're more like a part of the manufacturing environment

590
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:25,544
that you have to control for.

591
00:30:26,305 --> 00:30:29,626
For instance, oxygen oxidizes materials.

592
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:31,386
And so if you're making something

593
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,007
and you do not want it to oxidize,

594
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:35,368
don't make it in an oxygen-rich environment.

595
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:38,749
The only gas that made sense as an ingredient

596
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,429
was hydrogen for making hydrazine.

597
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:43,130
But we needed six useful gases to spread

598
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,371
across all the different planets to have our progression.

599
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,087
We considered using the gases as part of the recipe

600
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:51,228
for the crafting modules to try and capture

601
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:54,469
that concept of they're a component of the manufacturing

602
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:54,989
environment.

603
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:57,130
But it ended up being a weak comparison.

604
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,012
An alloying furnace isn't made out of nitrogen.

605
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:02,432
It just kind of needs it to run.

606
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:06,074
More importantly than that, we wanted players

607
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:08,615
to build a lot of atmospheric condensers,

608
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:11,176
not just get a gas once and then never

609
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:12,196
have to worry about it again.

610
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:20,817
As before, it wasn't that we hadn't thoroughly researched

611
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:22,698
and considered the gases carefully,

612
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,821
but that we were failing to consider

613
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:27,782
how they were actually being used in the game.

614
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:29,964
We just rolled with the assumption

615
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,885
that gases would be used to print items

616
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:33,246
like any other resource.

617
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,408
But there was a question to be asked of,

618
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,410
well, what are the printer recipes for?

619
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,172
They're there to give players items, yeah,

620
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:43,754
but they're also there to take the players' resources.

621
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:47,600
Printer recipes are the resource sink in the game,

622
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:50,122
but they don't have to be the only one.

623
00:31:50,862 --> 00:31:53,223
We were chasing the power sink of the atmospheric condenser.

624
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:55,584
We could just come up with a new sink that could

625
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:56,745
keep pace with its output.

626
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:00,627
Maybe the alloy furnace could require certain gases to run.

627
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,388
Thinking about it this way made sense for the gas

628
00:32:03,408 --> 00:32:05,929
to only be partly consumed and to have

629
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:08,651
like a fuel for many of our different crafting recipes.

630
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:11,992
Reframing the role gas is played in crafting

631
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:13,233
led to a new sort of item.

632
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:15,884
canister of gas that would get gradually consumed

633
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:17,725
to run crafting modules.

634
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:21,047
The shift into contextual framing for the gases

635
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:23,068
allowed us to think about them differently

636
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,210
and break the constraints that we'd always had

637
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,952
around printer ingredients, where they were fully consumed

638
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,733
and they were competing with all the other

639
00:32:31,273 --> 00:32:33,155
printer ingredients in their input slots.

640
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:36,397
It made us more comfortable with putting the gases

641
00:32:36,477 --> 00:32:40,539
in all kinds of recipes for making composite resources

642
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,040
that

643
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:43,719
maybe may not have been a major player in otherwise.

644
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:48,148
This idea of what's this for that we asked with the gases

645
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:49,932
isn't just an arbitrary question.

646
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:53,393
We've talked about several design problems

647
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:56,094
that were only solved for us after we challenged

648
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,916
a constraint that we had previously

649
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,117
assumed was essential.

650
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:03,920
What's this for is kind of a thought exercise,

651
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,182
and it's actually one of my favorite design tools.

652
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:09,584
It's a simple way to effectively take a step back

653
00:33:09,844 --> 00:33:11,466
when you find yourself spinning your wheels

654
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:15,068
and remind yourself of what it is that your ultimate goal is.

655
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:19,900
What do you want the player to do, and why is the player willing to do it,

656
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,081
are really just specialized versions of this idea.

657
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:29,223
Asking, what's this for, forces you to articulate what it is you're trying to accomplish,

658
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:33,784
without focusing on the particular approach that you've been taking to get there.

659
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:36,085
So, for instance,

660
00:33:37,245 --> 00:33:38,986
If we used it on the soil centrifuge,

661
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:42,028
it revealed that we just wanted a sink for soil

662
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:45,330
and simply needed to provide something of value to do so.

663
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,731
If we employed it on the resource table,

664
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:50,753
it revealed that we needed to know how our ingredients would

665
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:52,914
be used in Astroneer, not in the real world.

666
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,355
And of course, with the gases, it

667
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,937
got us past trying to confine them

668
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:00,499
to the same conceptual uses or other resources.

669
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:03,400
From here on, things went pretty smoothly.

670
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,061
we'd realize the value of minor redesign,

671
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:08,202
and we got into the practice of challenging each other's

672
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:09,503
assumptions on the fly.

673
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:12,244
Our last problem to tackle was how the player would

674
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:13,945
make the new composite resources.

675
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:17,427
You see, we'd already identified five or so manufacturing

676
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:19,688
techniques that I had convinced everyone

677
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,769
that we were going to turn into new crafting modules.

678
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,730
But once we'd parceled the resources out between them,

679
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,072
few were severely underutilized.

680
00:34:28,977 --> 00:34:31,639
We collapsed the crafting manufacturing techniques

681
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,722
into two generalized concepts, both of which could justifiably

682
00:34:35,902 --> 00:34:40,225
use gases as fuel, heat processes relying

683
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:44,148
on inert gases, and chemical relying on fossil gases.

684
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:47,390
This resulted in two composite resource machines,

685
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,092
the alloying furnace and the chemistry lab.

686
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,414
We prototyped these and play tested them with the team,

687
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:54,955
but they were so similar, the team

688
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:56,476
found it very difficult to guess.

689
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:59,658
which one they needed to use to make any particular resource.

690
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,759
The only difference was the type of gas used,

691
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,459
volatile versus inert.

692
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,419
Otherwise, they had the exact same UX

693
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,600
and basically did the same thing.

694
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,941
People don't have a great intuition about volatile

695
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:13,501
and inert gas, as it turns out.

696
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:15,382
It just wasn't a strong enough distinction.

697
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:18,482
And it was a departure from how unique all the other crafting

698
00:35:18,502 --> 00:35:19,623
modules felt from each other.

699
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:22,183
In the end, we combined these two

700
00:35:22,423 --> 00:35:25,144
and kept the more conceptually open-ended one, the chemistry

701
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:25,324
lab.

702
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:28,014
Aaron had really challenged me and be like, come on, man.

703
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:29,575
What are these really for?

704
00:35:29,815 --> 00:35:31,315
And I was like, all right, you're right.

705
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,496
This replaced the old chemistry lab,

706
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:35,397
and it brought us full circle.

707
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:38,198
We'd always imagined the chem lab could

708
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:40,538
be the station for combining complex resources,

709
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:41,899
and now it finally was.

710
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,821
This left us with a final set of modules

711
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:50,442
that kind of had a surprising twist to them.

712
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:53,223
Not a single brand new module was necessary.

713
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:56,146
With all the changes to our existing modules

714
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:58,607
that we already talked about, we had everything

715
00:35:58,627 --> 00:36:00,207
that we needed for this crafting update.

716
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,848
Not only did this preserve existing save files, which

717
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:06,188
is a godsend in a live game, but it

718
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,189
made onboarding the player to the new crafting system

719
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:09,089
incredibly fluid.

720
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:11,669
While the inputs and outputs changed,

721
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:15,110
the overall UX for each item was familiar.

722
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,110
It had been improved somewhat, but it

723
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,491
remained largely the same.

724
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:23,052
This is true, too, of their visual language, which

725
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:25,153
A lot of these modules were kind of older.

726
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:29,737
And so really, when we visually updated from the up,

727
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,718
when we upgraded them for the update,

728
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:34,400
it felt more like that, just visual updates, not

729
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,841
a total rework of the modules.

730
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:38,764
We managed to address both of our concerns

731
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:40,405
about cognitive load that had plagued us

732
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:41,646
at the outset of this project.

733
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:45,849
Being able to keep that familiar UX and visual language

734
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,191
kept the cognitive load manageable.

735
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:50,372
We didn't have to teach players how to use these things.

736
00:36:51,313 --> 00:36:52,554
But redesigning their output.

737
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:55,516
totally added this depth to the crafting system that

738
00:36:55,636 --> 00:36:56,837
gave it some more staying power.

739
00:36:57,537 --> 00:36:58,778
It was as though we had uncovered

740
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:01,119
the true form of our existing modules

741
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,741
and our ugly ducklings had grown into be beautiful swans.

742
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:09,004
So this had taken us pretty much to the finish line with this.

743
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,865
Presumably, all that was left was

744
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:13,546
to actually implement these modules in game

745
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:14,747
and ship the update.

746
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:21,956
So far, we've mostly talked about this idea of mining your own design in the context of identifying

747
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:26,920
the broken or incomplete parts of your game and finding solutions that still stay true to it.

748
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:33,186
But as we learned at the end of this update, it's also an important piece of protecting

749
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:37,390
the parts of your design that do work or critical parts of the new solution.

750
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:42,812
While the crafting update was on the whole a significant success for us,

751
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:48,540
it wasn't without some key mistakes that ended up compromising some of the goals that we had set out with.

752
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:52,266
Most of these came right at the tail end of development.

753
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:55,593
At this point, Elijah had been pulled away

754
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,333
from direct collaboration with me

755
00:37:57,873 --> 00:38:00,474
in order to start actually implementing these new features.

756
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:04,095
Ostensibly, the design had already been locked,

757
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:06,355
but as the feature started coming online,

758
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:08,836
ongoing feedback from the team made it clear

759
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,416
that further iteration was needed.

760
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:14,657
Unfortunately, we had neglected to buffer the schedule

761
00:38:14,717 --> 00:38:17,738
sufficiently to absorb these setbacks,

762
00:38:18,538 --> 00:38:22,119
resulting in some hasty last minute changes to the design.

763
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,781
And without the benefit of Elijah's counter perspective

764
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:28,603
that I had relied on throughout the rest of the development

765
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:31,845
process, we were missing one of the key ingredients

766
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:34,127
to this idea of mining our own design.

767
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:42,372
I want to take a closer look at one of the mistakes

768
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:44,093
that we made here and discuss how

769
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:46,655
better using the concept of mining our own design

770
00:38:47,055 --> 00:38:49,557
could have prevented, or at the very least, mitigated it.

771
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,350
Playtesting the new version of the soil centrifuge

772
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,751
had revealed two overlapping issues.

773
00:38:56,991 --> 00:39:00,272
Previously, the overlap between the centrifuge and mined

774
00:39:00,332 --> 00:39:02,893
resources provided a kind of release valve

775
00:39:02,993 --> 00:39:05,973
on the persistent need for the common resources.

776
00:39:06,993 --> 00:39:08,954
Without that overlap, players started

777
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:11,775
to chafe against that constant need, which

778
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:14,675
crowded out their limited personal inventory space

779
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:17,196
and forced them to make multiple trips

780
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:19,396
to collect all the different kinds of resources

781
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:20,017
that they needed.

782
00:39:21,785 --> 00:39:25,267
And as they depleted the local deposits of those common resources,

783
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:30,311
this meant tedious expeditions in search of a resource that had once been plentiful.

784
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:32,112
On the other hand,

785
00:39:33,148 --> 00:39:36,130
The exclusive nature of the centrifuge

786
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:38,312
meant that soil collection was now

787
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:40,594
an unavoidable part of the crafting system.

788
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:45,038
This was, of course, intended, but the prevalence

789
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:48,741
of the soil-extracted resources in our new recipes

790
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:51,103
meant that players had trouble keeping up

791
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:53,825
using only the soil that they got while mining deposits.

792
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,108
We kind of had pushed into the soil grind

793
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:58,329
instead of alleviating it.

794
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:02,323
With the clock running down toward our release,

795
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:05,424
we needed to figure out how to address these issues fast.

796
00:40:06,525 --> 00:40:09,026
The simplest solution, at least on the surface,

797
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:11,727
was to just restore some of the mine deposits

798
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:14,269
to the centrifuge, and at the same time,

799
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:17,230
make deposit versions of its new exclusive ones.

800
00:40:18,518 --> 00:40:20,239
This did solve the immediate problem,

801
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:22,379
but it also removed the centrifuge

802
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,660
from the crafting progression.

803
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,420
And now the mid-game rested solely

804
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,601
on the shoulders of the chem lab and the condenser,

805
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:31,282
spread out across six different planets.

806
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:39,784
So what could we have done instead?

807
00:40:40,624 --> 00:40:43,804
Importantly, the two issues that had shown up in play testing

808
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:46,625
had a serious impact on the pacing of the crafting loop.

809
00:40:47,556 --> 00:40:51,840
Having a solid progression was definitely important, but it wouldn't matter much if

810
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:57,564
players tired of the loop before they had moved through it. Doing nothing wasn't really an option

811
00:40:57,605 --> 00:41:04,430
here. As before, the real failure on our part was in not asking ourselves the right questions.

812
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:08,774
What do we want the player to do? And why is the player willing to do it?

813
00:41:09,755 --> 00:41:11,656
More simply, what's this for?

814
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,681
Asking those questions would have reminded us of the critical role the centrifuge played in our new progression

815
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:23,022
and redirected our attention on other areas that were more flexible,

816
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:29,063
such as the exchange ratio on the centrifuge or the frequency with which its resources showed up in recipes.

817
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:35,864
But it had been all too easy to see the new paradigm that we were introducing as the actual problem

818
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:40,545
and fall back on aspects of the old system that were at least a known quantity.

819
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:44,854
Ideally, we would have had time to iterate on these issues.

820
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:48,216
But even with the most forward-looking production

821
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,417
schedules, the reality of development

822
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:53,639
sometimes means that you have less time than you'd

823
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,840
like to make decisions.

824
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,941
Mining your own design allows you

825
00:41:57,961 --> 00:42:01,043
to isolate the most important core principles of your game

826
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:03,284
and better adhere to them when you're making

827
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:04,545
these kinds of tough calls.

828
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:08,667
Ultimately, the cracking update was still a major success

829
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:09,307
for Astroneer.

830
00:42:10,475 --> 00:42:14,478
not only filled out our mid-game, but it also paved the way for another year and a half of updates.

831
00:42:15,418 --> 00:42:19,581
Since release, the number of crafted items in the game has more than doubled,

832
00:42:19,942 --> 00:42:23,664
and it's done so without adding a single new resource or crafting module.

833
00:42:23,945 --> 00:42:28,068
We haven't touched this crafting system at all since we introduced it a year and a half ago.

834
00:42:29,148 --> 00:42:31,790
But more importantly, the process that we went through on this update

835
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,012
greatly improved our understanding of Astroneer,

836
00:42:34,372 --> 00:42:37,955
allowing us to make future updates with more confidence and efficient iteration.

837
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:41,250
Earlier this summer, we released the automation update,

838
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,232
something we planned for the game for a really long time.

839
00:42:44,252 --> 00:42:48,074
It was one of the most major features that we've released.

840
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:50,495
Made a number of improvements to the crafting,

841
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:54,637
providing new ways to counteract the tedium of manually upkeeping

842
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:55,538
a functional base.

843
00:42:56,698 --> 00:42:59,400
But thanks to the stable foundation we built,

844
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,601
we were able to layer these new features

845
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:03,402
on top of the existing crafting system

846
00:43:03,422 --> 00:43:05,203
without having to overhaul it at all.

847
00:43:08,646 --> 00:43:13,189
So, minding your own design is not just a technique that's specific to Astroneer.

848
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:16,791
It's about asking the right questions about your game to avoid

849
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:19,612
sticking to familiar design patterns that are failing you.

850
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:24,055
Asking these questions that challenge even your deeply held assumptions can

851
00:43:24,095 --> 00:43:26,776
allow you to mind the text for hidden rules and a

852
00:43:27,056 --> 00:43:29,077
deeper understanding of what makes your game tick.

853
00:43:30,218 --> 00:43:32,039
Bringing in someone from a different discipline

854
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,842
can invite a totally new vision for the design that's

855
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,423
able to generate the sort of questions that

856
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:38,304
are tough to ask yourself when you're really

857
00:43:38,344 --> 00:43:39,785
close to it on a daily basis.

858
00:43:41,006 --> 00:43:42,868
It's all about nutting yourself into asking

859
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,590
those fundamental but powerful questions.

860
00:43:46,551 --> 00:43:47,711
What do you want the player to do?

861
00:43:48,432 --> 00:43:50,233
Why is the player willing to do it?

862
00:43:50,854 --> 00:43:51,254
WTF?

863
00:43:51,855 --> 00:43:52,515
What is this for?

864
00:43:53,027 --> 00:43:55,090
All right, that is our talk.

865
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,473
Once again, thank you very much for tuning in.

866
00:43:58,434 --> 00:43:59,916
We've put up our email addresses

867
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:02,119
if you have any questions that you want to send us.

868
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,944
And I hope very much that you enjoy the rest of GDC.
