1
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:07,074
So I think it's about two minutes in already,

2
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:09,135
and I'm going to start.

3
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:14,180
Yes.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,380
Woo!

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:14,520
Woo!

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:14,700
Woo!

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:14,900
Woo!

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,681
Woo!

9
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:16,321
Woo!

10
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:16,421
Woo!

11
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:16,522
Woo!

12
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:16,982
Woo!

13
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:17,102
Woo!

14
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:19,244
Woo!

15
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:19,504
Woo!

16
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:23,628
Woo!

17
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:23,728
Woo!

18
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:23,968
All right.

19
00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:25,338
Now I'm hyped up.

20
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:27,839
Okay, so designing Journey.

21
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,841
Journey took us three years to make,

22
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:33,883
but the company, that game company, was started in 2006.

23
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:38,686
In the first three year, we were making other games.

24
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:41,508
You know, so far, we've made three games

25
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:45,030
on PlayStation console, Flow, Flower, and Journey.

26
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,172
This is the journey team at the end of the development.

27
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:51,452
Here's a celebration.

28
00:00:52,573 --> 00:00:54,554
And we've made sky for every team member.

29
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:58,916
And it's a small team, there's 12 people here.

30
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:01,517
When we started making Journey,

31
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:04,618
it was seven guys after the finishing flower.

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,780
And over the course, various people come and leave,

33
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,961
and most of them were on the stage last night.

34
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:16,828
We, actually before Journey, we've already kind of made

35
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:20,570
quite a few awards, which I'm proud of,

36
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,791
and now with Journey, it's kind of going crazy.

37
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:28,694
But what I'm most proud of is actually these kind of

38
00:01:29,594 --> 00:01:33,416
association of video game with museum and art,

39
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:38,259
and some other industry giving our game nominations

40
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:38,739
and awards.

41
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:43,734
Because deep down I always wanted games to be accepted by,

42
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,775
I guess, the mass.

43
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,237
So a lot of people ask us, you know,

44
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:51,898
how did you guys do it?

45
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,499
You know, you don't even have a PR department,

46
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,360
but we see you in the news all the time.

47
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,501
I'm like, well, I guess maybe the difference is

48
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,863
like we view game development

49
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:03,503
from a very different perspective.

50
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:09,545
I remember when I was at GDC in 2004, 2005,

51
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,825
we were talking about innovating games

52
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:13,485
around gameplay mechanics.

53
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,086
And there are various ways you can innovate games.

54
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,666
You can make a new technology

55
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:21,567
and build a new game around it.

56
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:23,567
You can create a unique art style

57
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,587
and build a game around it.

58
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:28,188
But when we approach innovation,

59
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:31,869
we like to look at it from the perspective of emotion.

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,362
I kind of see games as an entertainment,

61
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,744
and when I think about entertainment as a whole,

62
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:44,848
I see it as a kind of industry to fulfill human desire.

63
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:46,929
Just like food and water,

64
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,052
when a human have a craving for emotion,

65
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:55,336
there's various ways you can get it through various medium.

66
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,178
It just happened to be interactive medium

67
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:00,379
can provide entertainment,

68
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,141
can provide various emotions.

69
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,731
People often compel games to film,

70
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:12,553
and if you look at film, which has grown quite mature,

71
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:16,474
and the genres of the film are often divided

72
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:19,715
based on the feeling, and from negative to positive.

73
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:22,816
But when I look at video game genres,

74
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:24,936
and particularly the early video games,

75
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:32,083
These are what I consider the arcade era, even though Angry Birds and Bejeweled are here.

76
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:37,245
I mean, I consider they are the type of game which was very popular in early days.

77
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,006
And these games are about the sense of...

78
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:46,314
accomplishment, you know, you're really getting better at performing certain skills. The feeling of

79
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:55,499
achievement is really a powerful emotion that is often not achievable in cinema. And I think that

80
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:04,184
is why in early age this emotion has been explored a lot. And over the past 20 years, games have

81
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:07,605
become bigger and bigger, particularly the console game.

82
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:16,014
with the teenagers and younger male and and and if you look at the games that appear into this particular age group

83
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,710
a lot of them are about empowerment.

84
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,572
And particularly when you think about

85
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:24,294
what this age group people need emotionally,

86
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:27,156
most of them are in school,

87
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,318
they were told not to do certain things,

88
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:33,041
and in the home, they can't drive, they can't drink,

89
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,422
they can't leave school,

90
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,444
there's a lot of limitation about the freedom.

91
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:39,966
So in a way, a feeling of freedom

92
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:42,868
is something that really appeal to this age group.

93
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,492
But as I grow older, I have the freedom.

94
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:49,973
I have a job, I have the money,

95
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,514
I can go anywhere I want to.

96
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:54,955
I start to find it's less appealing to me,

97
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:57,376
and I start to play less and less games.

98
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:02,037
And if you look at the innovation on emotion

99
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:03,058
in the history of video game,

100
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:05,599
I can recall a couple.

101
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:08,640
Like, for example, Sims.

102
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:15,979
Sims is the first game that gives me a feeling of socializing with someone.

103
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,480
And that is huge.

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,604
That's like, you know, before multiplayer even existed, this single-player game can

105
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,766
give me the feeling of connection and relationship.

106
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:34,372
And I think that's why it has a huge hit and has a very different appeal to different demographics.

107
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,853
So when we started that game company,

108
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:42,214
we wanted to push the boundary of what kind of emotion

109
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:45,015
can games communicate to the players.

110
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:50,576
And we thought, you know, if there is a variety of feelings

111
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:52,777
that's available in the entertainment,

112
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:55,438
it is going to be a healthy media.

113
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:58,559
In gaming, it will be making the gaming

114
00:05:58,619 --> 00:05:59,539
a more healthy medium.

115
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:04,520
And for player, if all they play is the empowerment,

116
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,441
if they have new feelings,

117
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:08,302
it will also be healthy for them.

118
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:13,866
And so now I'm just gonna talk about Journey.

119
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,508
This is why you're here.

120
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:20,031
So in early 2006, this is before

121
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:21,812
That Game Company was created.

122
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:24,654
I already have this idea for Journey.

123
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:30,634
At the time, it was about the third year

124
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:33,036
I've been playing Warcraft, a lot of Warcraft.

125
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,999
You know, I started since early alpha

126
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,121
because my friends works in Blizzard.

127
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,144
I feel super privileged to be able to play this game

128
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:41,824
before everybody.

129
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:45,664
But there is also the time I started getting

130
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:47,185
really sick of World of Warcraft.

131
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,587
And the reason for that is that, you know,

132
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:53,349
most of the time I'm really busy working at school,

133
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,511
and I almost have no social life.

134
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:59,334
So being online, being with other people,

135
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:01,435
the real people, they are on the internet,

136
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:04,578
is something that makes me feel close

137
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,119
and makes me feel less lonely.

138
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,320
So when I'm playing game online,

139
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,723
I wanted to have emotional exchange with the other player.

140
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:12,503
So.

141
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:16,157
you know, kind of wanted to have romance or friendship.

142
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:17,959
But most of the time,

143
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,741
the player doesn't care about those things.

144
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,623
They like to talk about a strategy,

145
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,605
how you're supposed to kill this boss,

146
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:27,287
move over to the left, you know, and you're slow.

147
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:29,249
And all they will say, you know,

148
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:33,492
no, I wanted this loot, and this is my turn,

149
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,613
you're not supposed to get it.

150
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,277
And so I was kind of disappointed

151
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:39,778
because the more I play this game,

152
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:41,019
the more people I encounter.

153
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,752
the more I realize I have no connection with any of these people.

154
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,017
They just remind me that I'm a lonely person.

155
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:54,559
And so it's kind of sad. So I was hoping that there would be a different type of game out there

156
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,559
that will

157
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,061
satisfy my desire, I guess, to have a connection with people.

158
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:07,083
And so, you know, as you can tell I'm an introvert. I don't like to go to parties or bars.

159
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:11,405
So I was imagining this online world where

160
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,567
there's no longer the difference between,

161
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:19,188
first of all, there's no enemies you can kill,

162
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,869
and there's no armor sets, like,

163
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:24,970
oh, I'm platinum, and you're only bronze, right?

164
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,971
I want everybody to forget about those material things

165
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:32,312
and just focusing on the fact that we are all human.

166
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:40,237
And so, I, um, the other thing I got, you know, quite annoyed is a lot of people will

167
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:45,920
check to see if you're a guy or a girl in these online games, and it's always a sad

168
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,300
ending.

169
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,081
Uh, so.

170
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:55,357
And so I really want to see a game where there's no difference of gender and age.

171
00:08:55,577 --> 00:09:01,762
And yeah, sometimes I realize this guy I really have a connection to during playing certain raids

172
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:06,786
is actually 12 years boy and I just suddenly feel like such a disappointment.

173
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:12,129
So I want to see a world where everybody is the same.

174
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,471
You can't tell how they are, what their gender is.

175
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:17,994
They are all on their paths searching for something.

176
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:21,688
You know, it's something... I don't know what that is.

177
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:28,284
And so I have this scene here where one person is just simply standing on a bridge,

178
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:35,106
looking down in the waterfall, and I'm just imagining a scenario where I can just walk up to him

179
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:41,848
without words, and he's just staring at the waterfall, and I decided to stop and look into

180
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:48,570
the waterfall and thinking, why is he looking at there? And the very action of stopping and

181
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,890
being next to someone and not keep moving on.

182
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:55,610
gave me a feeling that that moment we are together,

183
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,911
we're together for this.

184
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,772
But back then I was thinking about MMO

185
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,613
because all I play is World of Warcraft.

186
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,794
So there's supposed to be lots of players

187
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,915
and this scene is something I really liked,

188
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,735
I want to see in a game one day.

189
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,717
It's basically, I also just finished Shadow of the Colossus.

190
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,419
How ridiculous that is.

191
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,645
So in the scene, there are these dark pillars.

192
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,607
They are actually the legs of the giants.

193
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:25,890
And they are walking through the snow field,

194
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,991
kicking up all the dust.

195
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:29,855
So it's very foggy and dusty,

196
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,137
and you can't see it in the front.

197
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:36,762
You guys have to keep silent because if you make noise the giants will notice you.

198
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:42,188
So you have to slowly contract through this plane and rely on the guy in front of you

199
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:47,813
to lead you away from danger and at the same time being relied upon by the person behind

200
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:47,993
you.

201
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:53,638
And that feeling is something I really want to experience in this game.

202
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:58,309
But we had no money and there's no that game company back then

203
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:05,913
So we were very very lucky to be able to find a funded deal to work with Sony

204
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,635
So, you know, they helped us to build the previous two game

205
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:13,818
flow took us a year flower two years and

206
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:19,761
so when we finish flower we say, okay, finally, let's make our third game and

207
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:21,182
I

208
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,303
Feel like we're finally ready to tackle an online gameplay

209
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:34,103
So we want to take what we learned from Fuller and Flower and try to induce a new emotion between two strangers online.

210
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:38,371
And when thinking about the emotion,

211
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,472
you know, we're going back to this pie chart here,

212
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:43,294
and I mentioned early on there's social games like Sims,

213
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:47,817
but this is also the era 2009 when Facebook gets big, right?

214
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,117
The social game become big.

215
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:50,558
People are talking about social games,

216
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,600
but I look at the social games,

217
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,741
I look at the mechanics, the interactions,

218
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,343
they're not really about socializing.

219
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,785
It's more like exchanging numbers and resource management,

220
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,506
which reminds me more of the earliest games.

221
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:06,027
And when I think about social emotions,

222
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:08,088
Sims was one of them.

223
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:09,868
And when I play Guitar Hero,

224
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:13,089
I have a great social bonding with people playing with me.

225
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,951
And even playing Minecraft, well Minecraft is recent,

226
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,671
but I'm just trying to say that there are interactions

227
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:21,492
that actually make you social.

228
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:22,292
So.

229
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:28,040
you know, my habit, you know, with previous games

230
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,062
is trying to make an emotion that's stronger

231
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,222
and that's different.

232
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:33,684
So I really know that, you know,

233
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:36,505
it's some emotion there that's gonna bind people.

234
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,387
They're gonna have a deeper connection

235
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:40,328
after they finish the game.

236
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,470
But I have no idea what is the emotion.

237
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,292
So it take us quite a while to search for exactly

238
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:51,935
what is the emotion behind social interactivity.

239
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:57,089
So I first look around at the online games

240
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,130
that's popular on the console.

241
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,453
There's a lot of team fights or team survival, co-op.

242
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:09,076
It was very interesting for me to look at

243
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:13,319
kind of like what is the average noise,

244
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,660
if you think about online games.

245
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,402
People keep telling me how they hated online players,

246
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:19,983
and then people are mean online,

247
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:21,204
they don't want to know who they are.

248
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:25,675
I really want to make something that makes them feel differently

249
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:28,237
or make people trust each other better.

250
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:33,523
And I was very lucky that I have met quite a few astronauts

251
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:37,147
in my life and talked to them about experience

252
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:38,428
in space.

253
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,752
they talk about how there's this weird myth

254
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:47,394
between all the astronauts who went to the moon,

255
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:49,635
that after they came back,

256
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,497
they all become very, very spiritual and religious.

257
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:53,998
I mean, that's kind of like a joke

258
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:55,619
I heard from a lunch table, right?

259
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:59,482
And they say there must be something mysterious

260
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,904
about the moon that really transformed

261
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:02,925
these people who went there.

262
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:12,190
And later on I met the guy who drove the first moon buggy and I asked him,

263
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,112
so what is so special about the moon that makes these people feel different after they come back?

264
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:20,073
And he said, you know, on the moon there's nothing.

265
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:24,155
There's no sound because there's no air. It's utterly quiet.

266
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:29,218
And the Earth is so small, it's like your thumbnail, you can just cover it up, you know.

267
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:36,763
And you're on this strange place where there's nothing and there's no sound and you just can't stop but thinking

268
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:37,964
Why?

269
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:45,891
You know, why are we here? You know, what about the rest of the universe, you know, because everything you know, these these these

270
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:51,135
Astronauts, they're mostly scientists. They know a lot about Earth's but and all of a sudden

271
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:53,795
they're facing with a lot of unknown.

272
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:59,561
And I learned psychology, I know that the sense of awe

273
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:06,228
and unknown is directly tied to a lot of religious meanings.

274
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,331
And so it's kind of an inspiration.

275
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:11,473
It might not directly connect to what the game is,

276
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:14,576
but it kind of inspired me looking at our life today.

277
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,727
We are kind of super empowered by technology today.

278
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,228
We can move really, really fast.

279
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,990
We can live and work above the clouds.

280
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,571
We can talk to anybody, talk to anybody

281
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,532
at anywhere, at any time.

282
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:38,980
and in our pocket or our bag, we carry the entire knowledge that human has ever gathered.

283
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:45,045
It makes me feel powerful because if I get to bring the gadgets today to 10 years ago,

284
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:51,549
they will think I'm a god. I know everything, I can do anything. But it also kind of makes me feel

285
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:57,474
like we are living a life where we're trapped by these empowerment. We can't simply live without

286
00:15:57,514 --> 00:15:58,074
them anymore.

287
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,025
And when you look at video games,

288
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:03,887
and particularly the popular commercial games,

289
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:07,329
you know, most of these characters are kind of,

290
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:10,111
you know, carrying something, symbolize power.

291
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,933
And the gameplay, you know, I mentioned earlier,

292
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,274
is mostly about empowerment.

293
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,695
And when you have empowerment,

294
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:20,092
when you put a bunch of people in that environment,

295
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:21,394
their first reaction is,

296
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:25,159
how am I gonna apply my power on someone else, right?

297
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,581
If you give me a gun,

298
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:29,506
and you lock me up with another guy in a room,

299
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:32,129
I think I'm gonna use it someday.

300
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:39,407
So, the problem is, you know, when you have a lot of power,

301
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:43,169
even though the game is supposed to be about survival

302
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,691
and bonding and collaboration,

303
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:48,613
most of the time you're applying your power,

304
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,274
like let's say I'm shooting Left 4 Dead,

305
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:53,195
and if my teammates block me, I'm like, ugh.

306
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,693
Get away, you know, I'm gonna shoot this zombie.

307
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:59,754
And the only time I felt a connection

308
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:03,156
while playing Left 4 Dead is when someone was

309
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:05,777
patching me up, and I really feel something,

310
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,517
but too bad it's so rare.

311
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,918
Most of the time, majority of the time,

312
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,299
I'm still applying power.

313
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,060
So when I think about redesigning a social experience,

314
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,901
that's something that will connect people together,

315
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:26,316
I think the very first important thing is to reverse the power relationship between

316
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,777
the players and the world.

317
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:33,260
The player needs to be less powerful and the monster needs to be more powerful.

318
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:36,263
And then you will think about collaborating with other people.

319
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:43,588
And in a lot of games today, it's mostly about achievements, you know, and challenge about

320
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:44,788
conquering the monster.

321
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:47,911
And too bad the monster logo looks like the Android logo.

322
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:50,732
It has no indication here.

323
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:56,074
So what I'm trying to see is that in an online game,

324
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,836
you know, most people think about getting items

325
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:02,457
and getting power and think less about the other player.

326
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:04,358
And particularly in World of Warcraft,

327
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:07,140
most of the time I don't think about the player,

328
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,601
only when I'm like, this guy is too difficult to beat.

329
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:12,302
I need another guy to help me to beat this boss.

330
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:16,984
And I kind of think of them as a tool to get the treasure afterwards.

331
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:18,605
And I want to see a reverse.

332
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:24,448
I want to see the treasure and the monsters only being a means to make me realize how

333
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:25,729
awesome the other players are.

334
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:31,857
In most of the online games, it's about shooting,

335
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,919
but I wanted to see online game where the skills

336
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,840
the player gain and improve over time

337
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,641
is actually about communicating emotions

338
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,823
and really feel each other rather than just,

339
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:45,964
you know, like how accurate your gunshot is.

340
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,923
So, the problem, you know, trying to create that word

341
00:18:52,243 --> 00:18:55,144
is very difficult because in a lot of modern day games,

342
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:57,284
the theme of war is just too noisy.

343
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,525
You just don't have time to look at the other friend

344
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,546
when a tank and a helicopter is attacking you.

345
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,207
So I thought, well, it's easy.

346
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,047
The first thing is we should get rid of the noise,

347
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:10,368
and we just keep a game to focus on people.

348
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,389
And then we have that problem where, you know,

349
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:14,930
if I have a gun, I'm gonna use it,

350
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,090
so we have to ditch that.

351
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:24,175
And then, you know, it started to get interesting, you know, a bunch of people in a lobby kind of like waiting before the raid starts.

352
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:25,556
They start to talk to each other.

353
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,277
But I kind of wanted to have more structure.

354
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,757
So I thought, well, what if we have less people?

355
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:34,158
You know, it's easier to design when you have less people.

356
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:37,859
Let's say we are in a very hazardous environment.

357
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:39,460
Not many people can survive.

358
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,140
And there's only two people left.

359
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,921
And then, you know, all of a sudden,

360
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:46,582
this guy in the distance become very, very interesting

361
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:51,044
compared to, you know, a constant warfare of action.

362
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,966
So that's kind of the very beginning of Journey.

363
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:58,307
We wanted to have a game which make you feel

364
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:01,809
somewhat lonely, somewhat small,

365
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,590
but you have a great sense of awe

366
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,531
and the feeling of unknown towards

367
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:10,953
the mystery behind this game world.

368
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:16,010
But that's just a kind of emotion we identified,

369
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,271
but to actually execute that emotion,

370
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:19,992
we have to do a lot of prototyping,

371
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:22,074
because we have not seen a lot of games

372
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:23,775
that's trying to achieve that.

373
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:26,917
Maybe Myst or Shadow of the Colossus is the only two

374
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:29,859
I can see that is actually having similar feeling.

375
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,901
So when we prototype,

376
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:35,262
I actually always start prototyping music.

377
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:41,049
it's not the interactivity because music is the most effective and powerful medium

378
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:47,719
that can create emotion. So I work with Austin Wintory, by the way he's Grammy nominated.

379
00:20:53,771 --> 00:21:00,777
I was really really lucky to have a music that he made pretty much like right beginning of the

380
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:08,804
development. So four months into Journey's development, our artist made this mock-up

381
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:12,167
trailer with Austin's music and I'm just going to play it here.

382
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:31,875
And you can see in the early days, our character looks like a ninja.

383
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:44,244
And he still has like a human shape, he has arms, you know, it's very much the early stage.

384
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:51,749
But we know the world needs to make you feel big and inspiring, and you need to feel small.

385
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:59,299
So, it's kind of various landscape, but you can hear the music, that's the music we used

386
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:00,240
in the endgame.

387
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,222
It's the music you would hear on a cross-media buy before you launch the journey.

388
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:10,704
It has not changed, it just hits something strong and I really feel there's something

389
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:10,944
there.

390
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:14,645
And we kind of start to build the game around this music.

391
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:20,228
And the mountain used to be a...

392
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:23,646
crevice of a canyon rather than a hill.

393
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:30,094
All right.

394
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:31,075
And so...

395
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:31,135
So...

396
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:37,970
Then we start to enter all kinds of RAM problems.

397
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,754
You know, like, I think the trailer is the only thing successful in the early day.

398
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,919
So, okay, let me show you something we learned, right?

399
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,923
We started prototyping with co-op

400
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:50,166
because we know we wanted people to work with each other.

401
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,729
So we started this prototype called Rope.

402
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,591
So basically it's a one button game, you just press space.

403
00:22:57,972 --> 00:23:00,333
And rope is the action, you know, in the chat bubble

404
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:03,034
it's the action, and you can see a long legged guy

405
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:05,555
can't break rock because he doesn't have arm.

406
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:08,717
But the fat guy, he has strength, so he can break a rock.

407
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:11,858
But still the chance is not always 100%, right?

408
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:15,279
And so as they collaborate, here's a rope

409
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,020
so they can climb up.

410
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:21,261
So the long-legged guy runs fast and he can jump through gaps.

411
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:24,002
And so, well, he didn't do it that time.

412
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:28,785
But with a rope, because anybody can lower a rope at any time,

413
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:34,088
eventually, with the chance, they can collaborate.

414
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,432
And we thought this is a great game, you know, you help each other,

415
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:41,115
but then, you know, the problem is like, what if you're playing alone?

416
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:42,256
You can't play this game.

417
00:23:42,577 --> 00:23:48,802
And, you know, Sony keep telling us that this game could have a great multiplayer,

418
00:23:48,842 --> 00:23:50,383
but it needs to have a single player.

419
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,105
Otherwise, you will not sell your game, right?

420
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:55,087
And so we're like, okay, well, this doesn't work.

421
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:57,268
And here's an example where...

422
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:01,458
Two people are collaborating and they're pushing a heavy rock.

423
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:06,120
I mean, this is a very common co-op feature I think most co-op games have.

424
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,101
But if you're alone, you can't even finish this level.

425
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:15,424
Even though there's a great feeling of collaboration, it becomes quite a trouble for us when we

426
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:18,766
wanted to design a game where it's possible to play alone.

427
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,971
And the other thing, you know, as you can see,

428
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,973
most of the prototype early on is like Java and Flash.

429
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,895
They're 2D prototypes.

430
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:29,996
And stuff we thought was brilliant.

431
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:32,784
didn't walk in 3D at all.

432
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:36,389
So we started this idea about trail.

433
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,930
So if you walk in a desert,

434
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,193
you can only see so far and from the top down,

435
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,095
how would you know there's other player?

436
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:44,197
And even if the other player exists,

437
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:46,260
if they're moving towards one direction,

438
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,861
how are you ever gonna catch up

439
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:49,403
if you all have the same speed?

440
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:51,786
So if you walk on other people's trail,

441
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:52,767
you will speed up.

442
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:57,225
And so eventually, you know, as you explore,

443
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:58,426
you will run into other player,

444
00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:01,906
and you can see the shout has been, you know,

445
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:04,847
very early prototype, I think that was a success.

446
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:06,487
But in here, I'm trying to show you

447
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:09,648
that if the player can be next to each other,

448
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,369
they become more strengthful, and they can climb up rocks.

449
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,629
And, you know, but these mechanics,

450
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,450
eventually when you transfer into 3D,

451
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,391
it's almost impossible to actually pull it off

452
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:23,311
because cameras.

453
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:24,812
and other things.

454
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:28,096
So here's another prototype we thought was smart

455
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:29,498
is when the two people are traveling,

456
00:25:29,518 --> 00:25:30,759
they get to go faster

457
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,901
because they can leapfrog from each other

458
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,445
and they can increase the speed.

459
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,600
Another great idea we had, we thought it was smart,

460
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,523
is the idea of calling to distracting the monster.

461
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:46,725
In Journey, you see the monster, right?

462
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,766
But if you shout at them,

463
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:49,927
then the monster will not attack you.

464
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,309
So between the two players,

465
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:54,291
you might be able to collaborate and distract the monster

466
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:55,432
and to get through.

467
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:59,974
But when we actually try to execute this idea in 3D,

468
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:02,876
it's almost impossible to tell the distance

469
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:05,297
between you and the monster and coordinate.

470
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,658
It's just way too hard.

471
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:12,241
And it tells me that a top-down view is great

472
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:14,622
for strategical maneuver and collaboration,

473
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:16,183
but it's almost impossible in 3D.

474
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:21,860
So here's another scenario which we really saw

475
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,521
was a great idea which also got killed.

476
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:25,683
You know, we thought about desert,

477
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:27,043
of course there's sandstorm.

478
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:30,746
So sandstorm is coming and people need to find a shelter.

479
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:33,067
The shelter is kind of a gray color.

480
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:35,789
And you can see the sandstorm keep going.

481
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,591
If they stay in the shelter too intimately,

482
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,132
the color of them will change to pink.

483
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:42,914
I don't know what that means, maybe they're shy.

484
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:45,235
And so,

485
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:50,430
this very scene of the sandstorm wiping the entire world

486
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:53,851
was a very powerful emotional experience,

487
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:55,752
but in the end, when we bring it to 3D,

488
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:59,955
we realize how difficult it is to actually do a sandstorm,

489
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:01,315
and we just couldn't do it.

490
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:06,738
And there's also this idea about graphics as gameplay.

491
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:09,379
This is something very unique in TGC.

492
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,781
Internally, we call it a gameplay,

493
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:19,596
We are more of a gameplay company than than gameplay mechanics company. What do I mean? So

494
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:25,839
Imagine you're in the desert and you're walking towards a mountain in the distance and you've been walking

495
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:30,833
And the mountain is so far, there's almost nothing changing on screen.

496
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:36,315
And this is kind of how it feels early on in the journey, where we have to keep dropping

497
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:41,557
breadcrumbs to keep the player feel like, oh, am I actually making some progress?

498
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:46,238
The world is so big, you know, we want it to feel epic, but then it's really boring

499
00:27:46,258 --> 00:27:47,499
to traverse through the land.

500
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:51,320
And for quite a long time, we were like, this game is not fun at all.

501
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:57,601
So in order to create feedback for simple traversal,

502
00:27:57,621 --> 00:28:00,703
like walking, we added the sand trail

503
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:02,425
so at least you're enjoying something.

504
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:04,446
You can sense how long you've been walked.

505
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:08,770
And we wanted to have a lot more dunes and things

506
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,172
that would be passing by so when you walk,

507
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:13,674
the entire screen is giving you feedback

508
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:15,255
rather than just staring at an image.

509
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,818
So we went out to a real kind of desert beach.

510
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,220
This is the Pismo Beach.

511
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:26,454
And here's a video of our lead engineer, John Edwards,

512
00:28:26,554 --> 00:28:27,374
climbing the sand.

513
00:28:28,255 --> 00:28:30,316
And I'm like, if you jump off the sand,

514
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:33,497
can you actually slide down, you know, like sand slide?

515
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:37,599
And so here I'm telling him, hey, you know, let's try this.

516
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:39,820
Let's try, just jump off, see what's gonna happen.

517
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:42,601
So here he jumps down,

518
00:28:45,002 --> 00:28:45,983
and then just stopped.

519
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,757
Right? And how terrible is that?

520
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:55,062
And so, I wish in the ideal world he would just be sliding down, right?

521
00:28:55,162 --> 00:28:58,724
And that's what we did exactly in Journey, which is like,

522
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:04,549
you climb up kind of slowly, and then eventually you kind of like slide down on the other side.

523
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,993
You know, it's kind of weird, it's like we're trying to capture realism,

524
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:13,095
but we're trying to capture the realism that we wished.

525
00:29:14,874 --> 00:29:19,956
So, you know, then walking becomes interesting because every dune you climb up, you have

526
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:24,057
this anticipation of what's behind it, and you also have a reward.

527
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:27,699
So there's a lot more engagement in the basic movement.

528
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:31,340
And there's no mechanics here, really, just the feedback.

529
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:36,074
So as we work on this game, we run into a lot of distractions.

530
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,275
As a good designer, you need to be very clear

531
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:43,517
about the experience you want and stay the hell away

532
00:29:43,597 --> 00:29:45,418
from the experience you don't want.

533
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:49,499
So Journey is a very simple.

534
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:54,053
Interface game because we wanted to make it for everybody, you know

535
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:56,314
We want a kid to be able to pick up the game to play

536
00:29:56,814 --> 00:30:02,656
We want to give this to my dad or my mom and they should be able to just enjoy it rather than learning a lot

537
00:30:02,696 --> 00:30:03,536
about gaming

538
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:09,778
So when I think about online game, the first thing I think about is the online interface, you know

539
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,839
This is Journey's online interface. There's another guy. So, you know, it's online game, right?

540
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,722
And then when I think about online games,

541
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:20,825
before we made this game, it was like this, right?

542
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:24,788
You have to figure out a lobby, check out a room,

543
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:26,569
and check everybody's pin number,

544
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:29,252
and make sure it's all green, and then you start the game,

545
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:31,633
and you have to say, you know, ready.

546
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:34,696
And I just don't know how I'm gonna explain

547
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:36,577
what is a pin number to my mom.

548
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:41,776
So we say, well, we have to hide all these interfaces.

549
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:46,821
And the next problem is just the user IDs, right?

550
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:50,484
You know, like, because player has been playing

551
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:52,066
the aggressive competitive games,

552
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,248
and their name tend to be very aggressive.

553
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:55,629
This name is actually not too bad.

554
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,792
they actually take me out of the game.

555
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:03,513
Even with Paris, well, Harris Hilton,

556
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:06,475
but I'm seeing Paris Hilton, I'm seeing real world.

557
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:10,157
It takes so much effort for us to transport

558
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:13,879
the player from their living room into a magical realm.

559
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:17,501
And these names, these texts just bring them back.

560
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:21,143
And I really think in order to have them collaborate

561
00:31:21,243 --> 00:31:25,905
and connect, they have to forget these real life things.

562
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:29,228
And the next thing is people will say,

563
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,730
oh, online game, I get to talk to my friends, right?

564
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,772
I need to have voice chat, or at least I can type.

565
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:38,797
And knowing console games,

566
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:41,799
I just really don't want to hear the voice

567
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,441
of the 12-years-old boy.

568
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:48,466
And who knows who's playing the games on the other side, right?

569
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:49,146
And...

570
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:52,917
But Sony was talking to us that, you know,

571
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:55,418
if you have friends invite, you know,

572
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:58,320
you can have a viral marketing, right?

573
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,641
Because it's fun to play with friends,

574
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:02,142
they will tell other player to buy the game.

575
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:04,364
And we thought this is good idea,

576
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:06,165
but when you implement that,

577
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:08,486
if you have two stranger on the internet,

578
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:10,727
and they can't chat, they can accept that.

579
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,629
But if I'm playing with my best friend,

580
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:16,110
and he's on the internet, and we can't chat,

581
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,190
it's kind of frustrating.

582
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,932
And because of that, we actually decided

583
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:21,672
to not even support friends invites,

584
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:24,654
because it would break the integrity of the word.

585
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:31,136
So the only way we allow players to connect

586
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:33,737
with each other is at the very end of the game,

587
00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:36,118
after all the critics rose up,

588
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,120
the very end, we show you the ID of the other player.

589
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:46,389
And so that way we can protect the feeling between the strangers.

590
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,512
And the other distraction is in the early days when we tried 4-player co-op,

591
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:55,934
we realized there are a lot of weird situations, like

592
00:32:56,855 --> 00:33:00,657
after they play for a while, they start to talk about us versus them.

593
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:03,079
They suck, you know, we are great.

594
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,021
And I'm thinking, well, sure,

595
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:08,263
having competition is great for online games,

596
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:12,107
but that's not the emotional connection I'm thinking about.

597
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,991
And the worst case is when there are three players,

598
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:17,892
they're a bigger group.

599
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:20,735
And this single player is isolated.

600
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:23,879
I remember talking to my professor, Tracy Fullerton,

601
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:26,583
who's sitting here, and she told me she hated this game

602
00:33:27,043 --> 00:33:29,787
because she's an explorer, she wants to explore the game,

603
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:32,270
but all the other testers wanted to move on.

604
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,174
And she felt forced, she has to conform herself

605
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:37,416
towards others.

606
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,482
And so in the end we start to focus on

607
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,164
one-on-one interaction.

608
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:45,908
But also based on that particular problem

609
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:47,410
with the three versus one,

610
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,313
I wanna bring this idea of collaboration and flow.

611
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,004
So, Flow, originally, I learned it through making

612
00:33:57,425 --> 00:33:58,906
the single-player game, because, you know,

613
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:02,830
as a psychology theory, Flow is about the balance

614
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,832
between the player's ability and the challenge of the game.

615
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:08,795
And you want to make sure, no matter where the player

616
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:12,558
evolves in the game, they're in this nice balance.

617
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,522
But also, there's this concept of the flow for collaboration.

618
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:21,145
or in Bernie DeKoven's word, collaboration,

619
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,487
which is like in any group co-op,

620
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,770
there's a balance between the individualism

621
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,972
and the group conformity.

622
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,833
You can't just be too much about yourself,

623
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:32,274
then the group will abandon you.

624
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:35,317
And you can't just always do what the group wants you to do,

625
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:36,417
then you lose yourself.

626
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:39,580
And the player needs to have the choice

627
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,342
to actually navigate through the experience,

628
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:43,683
to stay in the flow,

629
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:46,065
and also to stay in the flow of collaboration.

630
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:53,110
And that's really why we try really hard to create Journey's seamless online lobby system,

631
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,352
where, you know, we will match you up with all kinds of players,

632
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:58,954
but some of them might not match with you.

633
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:04,198
They might be explore, but you wanted to finish the game as quick as possible.

634
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:08,162
But we believe if you have the choice to walk away from a player,

635
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:12,707
eventually you will run into someone who wants to do the same thing,

636
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:16,731
who is a similar type of player, and then you would love to be next to the player.

637
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:22,056
When they have the choice to leave, the co-op is actually more real and sincere,

638
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:25,860
and I think it's possible to have a stronger emotional connection.

639
00:35:27,286 --> 00:35:32,531
And so in the end, Journey's online matching system is based on the physical distance.

640
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:35,494
You know, if someone's close to you, we will match you up.

641
00:35:35,894 --> 00:35:38,637
But if you don't like them, you start to kind of walk away.

642
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:42,400
The system will disconnect them and find someone else.

643
00:35:44,624 --> 00:35:47,025
Another type of distraction, resource, right?

644
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:51,147
In Journey, you go through, pick up those cloth strands,

645
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:54,688
and you fly, and you love them.

646
00:35:56,429 --> 00:35:59,370
And when two people who love strands, they meet,

647
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,012
and one guy take the resource, and he fly,

648
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:03,813
then the other guys hate you.

649
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:08,335
And in fact, in our early days of playtesting,

650
00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:09,155
people were saying like,

651
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,616
I really don't want to be with the other player.

652
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:15,141
They don't belong here because they're going to steal my resource.

653
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:19,438
So for quite a while, in order to compensate,

654
00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:20,800
we thought we have a great idea.

655
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,102
We have the player who drops the resource

656
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,002
after they use them,

657
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:26,284
so they don't actually consume resource.

658
00:36:26,945 --> 00:36:29,107
So maybe that way the player will love them.

659
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:32,250
So this is an early stage kind of 3D prototype.

660
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,492
And you can see if the player flies,

661
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:37,754
he drops all these kind of strands right behind them.

662
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:39,996
So for the other player,

663
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:42,178
he can just pick them up and fly up for free.

664
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,474
It's kind of like a communism thing, you know, you share all the resources.

665
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:52,427
But the problem is that even though mathematically you share it,

666
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:54,528
psychologically you don't.

667
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:58,610
A lot of players complain about how I picked up all these resources

668
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,871
and I carried all the way to the other guy

669
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:02,872
and he got to use my resources to fly.

670
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:04,993
He takes advantage of my labor,

671
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,354
even though most of them are not intentional.

672
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:10,796
And a lot of people feel kind of very weird

673
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:12,657
where there's a guy stalking you

674
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:14,778
and stay behind you and just pick up your stuff.

675
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:21,509
And so they just think this is, you know, they still feel like there's some kind of stealing happening.

676
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:26,059
So in order to really eliminate that,

677
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:28,280
so at least people don't hate each other,

678
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,261
we decided to drop the idea of possession, like resource.

679
00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:34,682
We just have infinite resource,

680
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:38,163
except the player have limited pocket size.

681
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:40,184
You can only carry this much money, right?

682
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:43,105
So, and people go to resource,

683
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:45,266
they all pick up their money, and they can all fly,

684
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:46,966
and they don't hate each other.

685
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:49,727
And then, at some point,

686
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:51,928
we have another distraction from physics.

687
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:55,755
In most online games, there's no collision,

688
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,436
so people can't just walk through each other

689
00:37:57,857 --> 00:37:59,878
because collision online is very difficult to do

690
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,760
and it causes all kinds of problem.

691
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:06,250
And at some point, we talk about the two people

692
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,771
helping each other to go through a rock.

693
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:10,273
You can see in a 2D prototype, it's very easy,

694
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,115
but to do this in 3D, you need to be able to

695
00:38:13,215 --> 00:38:14,896
carry the guy, push him up, and the other guy

696
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:17,378
have to pull you up, so there's a lot of collision

697
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:20,119
we have to, physics have to be implemented.

698
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,941
So we thought, well, but this is gonna make people

699
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,662
trust and help each other even more.

700
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:28,425
Let's do this, this is gonna make this emotion deeper.

701
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:34,630
So we added the physics so the player can actually push each other, you know, they feel the existence of each other.

702
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,791
This is great.

703
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:42,137
But instead of helping each other to push them onto the rock, they'd like to push them onto something more exotic.

704
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:46,937
So, and for quite a while I thought it was just,

705
00:38:47,398 --> 00:38:48,458
you know, those playtests,

706
00:38:48,478 --> 00:38:49,679
they play too much Call of Duties,

707
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,520
they're just mean, right?

708
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,983
And then we were doing playtests at our own office.

709
00:38:57,183 --> 00:38:58,624
You know, our lead engineer, John Edwards,

710
00:38:58,644 --> 00:39:00,225
who was the guy who jumped off the sand,

711
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:01,325
killed me.

712
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:04,067
And multiple times.

713
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,708
I'm like, wait, you know this game is about

714
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:08,709
helping each other and having a connection, right?

715
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,190
Why do you keep doing this?

716
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,152
And he just stared at me laughing because we are just right across the office.

717
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:15,393
I'm like, come on, revive me.

718
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:16,414
Right.

719
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:21,217
And then I realized for quite a while I was disappointed about humanity.

720
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:24,259
So so.

721
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:29,634
I was so disappointed and one day,

722
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:34,615
Kylie told me to meet her brother's girlfriend.

723
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:37,196
She is a spiritual psychologist.

724
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,737
So I talked to her about this very, very dilemma

725
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:42,738
about humanity, right?

726
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:46,859
And she said, oh, you know, it's because your players,

727
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:48,499
they're babies.

728
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,820
What do I mean by that?

729
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,560
You know, like when you transport yourself

730
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,421
from the real world to a virtual space,

731
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:56,501
particularly when character looks like dots.

732
00:39:57,688 --> 00:40:00,669
they don't carry the morality from our real life, right?

733
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:01,889
It's like a new baby.

734
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:03,870
And baby only seek for feedback.

735
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,330
And pushing a guy to a rock has almost no feedback, right?

736
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:10,391
But pushing a guy to kill them,

737
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:12,371
there's animation, there's blood,

738
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,412
there's a sound of crying,

739
00:40:14,532 --> 00:40:19,613
and there's social anxiety of waiting you to revive them.

740
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:20,993
It's so much more rewarding.

741
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:23,333
Of course, the player wants to do that.

742
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:26,875
So what I learned is that the morality

743
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:28,216
doesn't necessarily carry over,

744
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:30,637
and in order to shape players' behavior,

745
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:33,239
you have to control the input and output.

746
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,501
So in order to prevent this happen,

747
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,103
we actually get rid of collision in the end.

748
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,766
So what happens is instead of pushing each other

749
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,347
when you're next to each other,

750
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:45,848
you start to give each other money.

751
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:51,485
And so people love to be next to each other because there's a lot of feedback

752
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:55,308
But there's no feedback by pushing them to a cliff or kill them

753
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:03,655
And now they can both fly just being next to each other. They love each other, you know, and just these little tweaks about

754
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:09,480
Features can can go a long way and there's so many small things about journey. That's kind of like

755
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,162
Constantly play testing and realize it's not working

756
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:15,357
And now I'm gonna talk about,

757
00:41:15,377 --> 00:41:17,458
I think the most important thing for journey

758
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:19,318
is once you figure out the mechanics,

759
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:22,239
you really need to push for emotional catharsis.

760
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,480
And catharsis is kind of like,

761
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,741
you know what people would say,

762
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:29,742
a climax of a great story, you know.

763
00:41:30,842 --> 00:41:32,743
But what's important for catharsis is,

764
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,344
it's not emotion, it's just intensity.

765
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:38,005
I think no matter what emotion you're pushing for,

766
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:41,366
whether it's joy or sadness or sarcasm,

767
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:43,026
you know, all kinds of emotion,

768
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:48,930
you need to push to a certain depth, a certain intensity,

769
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,433
because otherwise, adults, you know,

770
00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:54,615
myself as a gamer, I'm too jaded.

771
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:57,578
You know, I need to be really shaken

772
00:41:57,778 --> 00:42:00,461
and to be surprised to actually feel something.

773
00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:05,288
And so this is a typical three-act structure from Hollywood,

774
00:42:06,129 --> 00:42:09,052
you know, how you would structure the intensity of emotion in a story,

775
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:13,076
hoping that at the very end, there's a huge rise.

776
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:16,900
And that rise is the change of intensity,

777
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:20,324
and that's the cassathes of emotion.

778
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,665
So, you know, for journey, the feeling is awe and mystery,

779
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:29,749
and we wanted to kind of be able to control that.

780
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,933
And this is when I start to look into Joseph Campbell's work.

781
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:36,455
He's a master about myth and awe.

782
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,399
And this is where I actually get to learn

783
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,800
the hero's journey in depth,

784
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,801
because I keep hearing it,

785
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,262
but never really pay attention to it.

786
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,244
And the hero's journey,

787
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:54,402
is essentially a structure of storytelling about a transformation of human being.

788
00:42:54,883 --> 00:43:01,847
It can be something like a transformation of a farm boy into a galaxy saver or, you know,

789
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:07,950
some hacker guy turning into, you know, you know, the one.

790
00:43:09,611 --> 00:43:17,842
And it could also be used for more abstract stories, like the transformation of a little

791
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:19,804
lion into the king.

792
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:26,684
So when I actually line up the transformation of the hero's journey, which is called the Monomyth,

793
00:43:27,645 --> 00:43:33,809
with the intensity of the 3X structure, and I'm thinking about like doing a transformation

794
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:41,594
of a character's life from the birth to death, it's surprisingly aligned. It's almost like

795
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:48,199
perfectly aligned. It's such a great 3X story about a hero's journey, which is also a human's life.

796
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,042
And I'm just at that point. I'm so geeked out

797
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:57,988
I'm like this is so perfect people all figure it out a long time before we look into cinema and all these things

798
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,290
We have to try it out as a game

799
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,251
So we create an arc of journey,

800
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:07,833
and then based on the arc, we create the landscape,

801
00:44:08,053 --> 00:44:10,514
the world of journey, which you can see from the altitude,

802
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:12,274
it's almost like based on the arc.

803
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:16,796
And then we figure out the character's growth

804
00:44:16,896 --> 00:44:21,318
from young to old, and they eventually transcend.

805
00:44:22,379 --> 00:44:25,360
And based on the storyline, we create the mood

806
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,302
and the colors and the detail of each area in the world.

807
00:44:31,154 --> 00:44:35,717
And then based on that, we have a more detailed emotional arc

808
00:44:36,178 --> 00:44:40,000
with gameplay elements specified in this chart,

809
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:44,263
and divide these larger into smaller levels.

810
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:46,905
So this is all done in the first year,

811
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:48,086
the first half year.

812
00:44:49,968 --> 00:44:53,470
So basically, we break all these nodes down

813
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,532
into small scenarios of gameplay elements,

814
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:57,953
storytelling elements, and

815
00:44:58,953 --> 00:45:01,716
um, um, you know, the history elements.

816
00:45:01,756 --> 00:45:03,538
There's actually two starry lines for journey.

817
00:45:04,419 --> 00:45:10,346
Um, but you can see based on this arc, we have this, this intensity, uh, curve here.

818
00:45:10,366 --> 00:45:16,935
Um, if I map it out onto, uh, uh, axis, uh, you can see basically.

819
00:45:18,773 --> 00:45:22,694
We can use that as a guide to direct what we want

820
00:45:22,794 --> 00:45:23,954
in terms of gameplay.

821
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:27,355
So on the positive side of the intensity,

822
00:45:27,415 --> 00:45:29,316
we want to make the player feel free.

823
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,757
We want them to have lots of movement.

824
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:33,677
We want them to feel energetic

825
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:35,357
and feel connection with each other.

826
00:45:35,878 --> 00:45:36,958
And on the opposite end,

827
00:45:37,058 --> 00:45:39,018
and you can imagine what kind of emotion that is.

828
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,059
When we work with artists,

829
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,580
it's very easy to tell an artist to paint something

830
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,280
that's...

831
00:45:46,214 --> 00:45:47,997
you know, very intense or very low.

832
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:50,540
And it's easy to work with composers

833
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:53,844
to get a music that feels sad or happy,

834
00:45:53,904 --> 00:45:57,770
but it's very hard to work on controls and gameplays

835
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,433
because what is a sad gameplay?

836
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:02,456
You know, there's almost no reference.

837
00:46:03,717 --> 00:46:09,121
And we as game designer we have a lot of vocabularies to refer from all the games in the past

838
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:15,425
About how to create a sense of fun a sense of achievement and a sense of accomplishment and empowerment

839
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:22,931
But you know my knowledge about other emotions only through the games. I've done you know flow and flower which is

840
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:26,673
Zen like game and a love giving a peaceful game

841
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:28,615
so

842
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:33,488
it takes a lot of effort to explore these mechanics to follow the arc.

843
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:36,250
At the end of the first year of the journey development,

844
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,672
the game is supposed to look like this.

845
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:41,453
This is the concept art. Matt Nauba has Jewel.

846
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:43,775
But this is what the game kind of looked like.

847
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:45,196
You know, we kind of blocked it out.

848
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:49,599
And this is the second bridge area, which is supposed to look like this.

849
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:51,960
We have some basic foundation of it.

850
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,781
we actually blocked out the entire game

851
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:56,542
before the first year.

852
00:46:56,642 --> 00:46:58,443
So we have the final mountain level

853
00:46:58,583 --> 00:46:59,543
and underground level,

854
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,345
except this is the target of the emotion.

855
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:05,445
This is how it feels.

856
00:47:05,786 --> 00:47:08,387
Nothing really kind of makes me feel anything.

857
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:09,547
The game sucks.

858
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:12,568
Nobody have any confidence it's gonna do well, right?

859
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:15,229
And so we keep pushing it,

860
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,590
at the end of the second year.

861
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,812
This is the trailer we made

862
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:22,192
at the end of the second year.

863
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:29,071
And you can see this is very similar to the final trailer,

864
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:31,432
except the sand is not as sparkling

865
00:47:32,093 --> 00:47:34,515
and some of the model is not very polished.

866
00:47:36,016 --> 00:47:38,498
But you can see mostly the character is there,

867
00:47:39,118 --> 00:47:41,660
the scene is there, and the storyline is almost there.

868
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:43,862
I'm gonna save some time now.

869
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:50,110
So this is the curve we measured at the end of the second year.

870
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:52,332
It's basically there.

871
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,814
You know, like, we have the first four levels basically there.

872
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:58,057
And we have a lot of people coming to playtest.

873
00:47:59,078 --> 00:48:00,919
And the result is not good.

874
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,221
And they say this game is really bad.

875
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:08,145
Some people told me, you know, before the final Heaven level,

876
00:48:09,726 --> 00:48:12,008
when the player died, you should just cut it there.

877
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:14,530
Because the later part is making the game worse.

878
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:16,696
I'm like, what, really?

879
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:21,837
So I looked at the game, and what happened is that

880
00:48:23,078 --> 00:48:24,478
if you look at the green curve, right,

881
00:48:24,898 --> 00:48:27,519
this is the final emotional rise.

882
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,361
And that is not even bigger than the level

883
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:35,141
where the water is kind of floating.

884
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,996
And that's not even higher than the sand surfing level.

885
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:41,957
It's not exciting, it's not satisfying.

886
00:48:42,598 --> 00:48:44,659
But the guy was saying like when he died

887
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,680
and accidentally the game crashed,

888
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,962
he was staring at the white screen for about two minutes

889
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:51,623
without nobody noticing.

890
00:48:52,104 --> 00:48:53,745
And he was in a deep thinking, he was like,

891
00:48:53,785 --> 00:48:55,586
this is very serious tragedy.

892
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:01,313
And he really liked it, you know, and I started to look at why.

893
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:06,515
I'm like, actually, if you jump from that level to the very bottom where you just died,

894
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:08,917
it's the biggest emotional change.

895
00:49:09,297 --> 00:49:13,219
And it's actually, you reverse it, it's actually a catharsis of tragedy.

896
00:49:15,257 --> 00:49:16,998
But that's not what we intended.

897
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:19,079
You know, we're not trying to make a sad story here.

898
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,202
So we actually took another year just to fix that problem.

899
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:29,946
So what did we do to increase this Cassathes?

900
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:32,547
So first we have to make sure the mountain,

901
00:49:32,987 --> 00:49:35,629
the level before the final rise, is low enough.

902
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,292
So what we changed is the mountain kind of feel long and shallow and tedious

903
00:49:41,532 --> 00:49:46,555
because it's just a lot of wind blowing at you and it takes forever to walk over it.

904
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:50,197
But we actually wanted to make it feel more struggling.

905
00:49:51,182 --> 00:49:53,944
So we create a completely new animation set.

906
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,867
You know, animation sets is hundreds of animations.

907
00:49:57,347 --> 00:49:59,329
And we just make it for this level

908
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:02,251
where you kind of feel weak walking against the wind.

909
00:50:03,512 --> 00:50:07,796
And climb slowly, and jump slowly, and shout weakly.

910
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:10,238
And we actually change the physics

911
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:11,539
of the scarf and the clothes,

912
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,040
so they actually, when they're frozen,

913
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,741
they become heavy, they become lifeless.

914
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:21,174
In the middle of the scene, the guardians, the serpents,

915
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:22,736
usually just kind of stay above.

916
00:50:22,776 --> 00:50:25,338
They just kill other Klaus creatures, being scary,

917
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:26,419
but they never attack you.

918
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,842
We actually make you to be attacked,

919
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:32,645
and we make this shelter actually crushable,

920
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,047
so it's no longer safe.

921
00:50:36,128 --> 00:50:39,091
And to extend the amount of struggling,

922
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:41,652
we also need the player to spend longer time in the level.

923
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:44,875
So we added two new areas just to extend how long it is.

924
00:50:44,895 --> 00:50:47,837
There's a sanctuary, which gives you a brief rest.

925
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:50,719
And then there's this fortress area you have to go through.

926
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,702
And then eventually you go to the final walk of death.

927
00:50:56,903 --> 00:50:59,106
And to make this error even work better,

928
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:01,689
we have to figure out a way to continuously

929
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:03,171
slow down the player's input.

930
00:51:04,212 --> 00:51:05,634
And we actually dim the light,

931
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:09,439
because the light is a symbol of hope and goal.

932
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,662
So when you actually die, there's no hope.

933
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:17,327
you know, we spent so much time tweaking the timing, right?

934
00:51:17,787 --> 00:51:20,929
A lot of times I walk, I thought three minutes is about

935
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:23,090
the good time to walk to your desk.

936
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:23,831
But then,

937
00:51:25,732 --> 00:51:29,054
and then our team member were like, this is too long, right?

938
00:51:29,094 --> 00:51:30,595
And they want it to be 30 seconds.

939
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:31,976
I'm like, 30 seconds is not enough.

940
00:51:32,016 --> 00:51:33,757
I'm not even in the right mood yet.

941
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,038
So it's just constantly back and forth tweaking

942
00:51:36,058 --> 00:51:38,399
the exact right number where everybody's happy

943
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,601
and you know, for you to fall down.

944
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:46,485
And then when we move to the summit we have to make sure the summit is a lot more exciting a lot more

945
00:51:46,505 --> 00:51:49,928
Climatic and a lot more free right you know what is the emotion of?

946
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,332
The intensity right originally summit actually looks like this

947
00:51:55,973 --> 00:51:58,996
At the end of the second year, but the whole game is on rail

948
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:02,619
So you just kind of like follow the rail going through and seeing everything

949
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,043
But you don't have a lot of control you can kind of like Star Fox a little bit. You know

950
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:07,123
but

951
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,344
Because of that, I think that's why the game was not climatic,

952
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:15,927
because even though visually it's the same as the final game,

953
00:52:16,728 --> 00:52:18,230
gameplay-wise, it's not.

954
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,835
You have no freedom, you can't move anywhere you want,

955
00:52:23,155 --> 00:52:25,778
and it's just not right.

956
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:26,419
So what we did.

957
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:32,209
is we break free the rail, we end up opening up the entire area, you can go anywhere you want,

958
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:38,173
and we actually added a surfing area as well because surf is actually the most fun

959
00:52:38,493 --> 00:52:42,876
out of the entire game. We know it, the flying is not fun, so we actually have to bring the

960
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:46,638
surf back just to give you a feeling of excitement again.

961
00:52:49,662 --> 00:52:51,864
all the way until you walk into the light,

962
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:54,285
we kept it free, so you can do it.

963
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:57,067
You can walk anywhere, even walking into the light,

964
00:52:57,167 --> 00:52:59,108
it's your decision until the very end.

965
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:03,811
And I think this freedom is super important of journey

966
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,913
because if you think about all the highs of the journey,

967
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:09,615
you know, whether it's the surfing part

968
00:53:09,755 --> 00:53:13,697
or the water temple, or eventually the summit,

969
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:16,599
it's always about movement and freedom.

970
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,772
So eventually we executed at the end of the third year

971
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:26,794
in a playtest of 25 players.

972
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,776
Three of them actually have tears in the end,

973
00:53:29,796 --> 00:53:31,657
which is kind of amazing,

974
00:53:31,677 --> 00:53:34,138
because that's when we know the emotion is actually working.

975
00:53:34,538 --> 00:53:36,379
Before that, all the playtests is just like,

976
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:39,601
people get lost, people don't know what to do here,

977
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:41,102
or people get stuck.

978
00:53:41,662 --> 00:53:44,704
And I think while we do playtests mostly for usability,

979
00:53:45,424 --> 00:53:47,304
Testing for emotion is super crucial,

980
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:50,025
but unfortunately you won't get it until the very end.

981
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:53,505
I really wish there's a better way to test those things.

982
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:56,706
So when we launched the journey,

983
00:53:58,386 --> 00:53:59,807
I was very nervous because

984
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:06,188
we spent way too much time to build this game.

985
00:54:06,728 --> 00:54:08,688
We extended the project for two times,

986
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:11,749
and in the end we had to put our own money in

987
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:13,429
just to make sure we could finish the game.

988
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:17,204
is all this thing gonna be worthwhile?

989
00:54:17,244 --> 00:54:18,745
You know, we just don't know.

990
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:20,667
You've been close with this game forever.

991
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:24,110
And it was really relieving,

992
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:25,712
the first day we launched the game,

993
00:54:26,112 --> 00:54:27,734
people started to post on our forum

994
00:54:28,114 --> 00:54:29,635
to apologize to each other

995
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:32,058
for not being able to play through the whole game

996
00:54:32,138 --> 00:54:33,039
because they had to leave.

997
00:54:33,399 --> 00:54:34,780
But they couldn't tell the other person,

998
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,702
so they started to leave in post on our forum.

999
00:54:37,303 --> 00:54:39,965
And I can never imagine a Call of Duty player do that,

1000
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:41,186
but they are the same person.

1001
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:42,047
Right?

1002
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:45,269
And so as you play the game,

1003
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:49,291
you slowly build up your scarf and cape,

1004
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:51,932
and you become one more veteran player.

1005
00:54:53,653 --> 00:54:56,295
And I have a bunch of fan art here,

1006
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,997
because I think fan art is a great way

1007
00:54:59,037 --> 00:55:01,678
to see what the player remembered about your game.

1008
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:04,660
And they usually would remember the most intense emotion,

1009
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:08,962
and this is what they remembered.

1010
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:10,863
They draw hearts at the end of the game.

1011
00:55:12,303 --> 00:55:17,327
They remember the awe and the sublime beauty of the world.

1012
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:23,711
They remember being scared and afraid of the danger.

1013
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:27,154
And they also remember struggling together with each other

1014
00:55:27,614 --> 00:55:30,416
and helping each other to push all the way to the end.

1015
00:55:32,536 --> 00:55:36,917
And so, before all these awards season,

1016
00:55:37,018 --> 00:55:38,818
I still question whether it's worth it

1017
00:55:39,498 --> 00:55:41,139
to push a game to its extreme.

1018
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,421
Up to today, we have 896 emails from our fans

1019
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:49,382
who tell us very personal stories

1020
00:55:49,822 --> 00:55:51,482
about how they interact with the game.

1021
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:55,524
A while back at DICE, I've shared this letter.

1022
00:55:59,257 --> 00:55:59,957
I'm just going to read it.

1023
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:02,659
Your game practically changed my life.

1024
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,821
It was the most fun I had with him

1025
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:06,522
since he had been diagnosed.

1026
00:56:07,543 --> 00:56:09,024
My father passed in the spring of 2012,

1027
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:12,467
only a few months after his diagnosis.

1028
00:56:13,368 --> 00:56:16,630
Weeks after his death, I could finally return myself

1029
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,511
to play video games.

1030
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:19,312
I tried to play Journey,

1031
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,834
and I could barely get past the title screen

1032
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:23,295
without breaking down into tears.

1033
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:26,738
In my dad's and in my own experience with Journey,

1034
00:56:27,098 --> 00:56:27,859
it was about him.

1035
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:30,400
and his journey to the ultimate end.

1036
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,782
And I believe we encountered your game

1037
00:56:32,862 --> 00:56:34,242
at the most perfect time.

1038
00:56:34,903 --> 00:56:37,825
I want to thank you for the game that changed my life,

1039
00:56:38,225 --> 00:56:40,446
the game whose beauty bring tears to my eyes.

1040
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:43,828
Journey is quite possible the best game I've ever played.

1041
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:46,770
I continue to play it and always remembering

1042
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,932
what joys it brought and the joy it continues to bring.

1043
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:54,454
I'm Sophia, I'm 15, and your game changed my life for better.

1044
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:56,976
And, and, and...

1045
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:11,812
And seeing this letter, somehow it brought back to me about this fan art.

1046
00:57:12,592 --> 00:57:15,853
I think, you know, it is what life is about.

1047
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,654
We are only here for such a short amount of time.

1048
00:57:19,154 --> 00:57:23,415
We happen to be all living in the same era, and let's help each other.

1049
00:57:23,835 --> 00:57:25,216
Let's make each other's life better.

1050
00:57:25,716 --> 00:57:30,797
And that's why I think, as a game developer, you know, that's the best thing we could do.

1051
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:33,178
And that's why I love making games, you know.

1052
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:35,558
And that's why, you know.

1053
00:57:37,131 --> 00:57:37,236
So.
