00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:10,616
Welcome to this presentation entitled Community Marketing and Management at your best and

2
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:11,456
worst of times.

3
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:16,239
A title that just rolls off the tongue and definitely fits on a presentation slider.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,221
My name is Malin Kastegian.

5
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,703
I am a product marketing manager at Paradox Interactive.

6
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:29,727
And I've been with Paradox now for five years, which makes that my second longest relationship

7
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,788
ever, and the longest when I married.

8
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:33,962
Ah, thank you.

9
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:37,524
Somebody told me don't try to make jokes in the business lane.

10
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:38,525
It doesn't work.

11
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:42,208
But I'm thinking this is mostly community managers

12
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:43,488
and marketing people.

13
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,969
And we have fun, right?

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:46,931
Good.

15
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,972
OK, cool.

16
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,913
So I have about 30 slides to go through,

17
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:52,615
and I've never managed to do it on time.

18
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:53,635
So we're going to kick off.

19
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:57,258
I'm going to tell you what a product marketing manager is,

20
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:58,819
because it's kind of a weird title.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,661
What it means is that I am responsible for.

22
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:06,833
Coming up with, creating, and executing

23
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:09,454
the marketing campaigns for a selected amount of titles

24
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,115
at Paradox Interactive, and to make sure

25
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,196
that we meet our sales goals, and that we

26
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,876
make the best possible foundation for the game

27
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:18,677
to get to market.

28
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:22,178
So I work with games from before they're even

29
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:25,279
signed until they're released, and a couple

30
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:26,259
of years post-release.

31
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:29,120
But I started as a community manager.

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,081
And Paradox Interactive, oh.

33
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:38,980
the clicker works. If you don't know about us, we are a Swedish-based publisher. Currently,

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,064
we are 300 employees with an internal development studio, most called Paradox Development Studio,

35
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:52,688
that are mostly famous for our grand strategy titles. Crusader Kings 2, Europa Universalis

36
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:57,010
4, and Stellaris are some of the more notable ones, together with Heart of Iron.

37
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:58,793
but we're also a publisher,

38
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,554
and we publish third-party games

39
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:03,136
together with different studios.

40
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:06,118
So we just launched Surviving Mars yesterday.

41
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:07,879
No, sorry, last week.

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,022
Jet lag, Stockholm is several hours away.

43
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:13,303
Together with Hair Me Month Games,

44
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:15,465
and I'm currently working on BattleTech

45
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,726
together with Hairband Schemes.

46
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,547
We've also launched Pillows of Eternity

47
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:19,608
together with Obsidian,

48
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:22,470
and one of the games I'm gonna cover a lot in this talk,

49
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,032
which is Cities Skylines together with Colossal Order.

50
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:29,618
And I said that Paradox is a company of 300 people.

51
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:32,320
That wasn't the case when I started five years ago.

52
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,141
Back then, we were around 80 people.

53
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,203
I think I am employee 73.

54
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:42,346
And the company has changed a lot,

55
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:44,388
and it's changed how we do marketing,

56
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:47,930
because we started our marketing based in our community.

57
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,892
And then we kind of grew into a company

58
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,653
that had actual marketing budgets

59
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:54,014
that we could do bigger things with.

60
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:56,473
All right, I'm getting ahead of myself.

61
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:58,334
What are these two games I'm going

62
00:02:58,374 --> 00:02:59,495
to be covering a little bit?

63
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:03,417
These are the two games I'm going to be talking about a lot

64
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:03,818
today.

65
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,500
Europa Universalis IV is a grand strategy game

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,141
where you play a nation in the world

67
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:11,802
and you attempt world dominance.

68
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,104
It's developed by our internal development studio, Paradox

69
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:15,825
Development Studio.

70
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:20,527
And then City Skylines, which is a city builder game currently

71
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:24,110
available for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.

72
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:27,338
It released four years ago now.

73
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,259
And it is a city builder game.

74
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:31,620
It's kind of straightforward.

75
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:37,242
But what is community marketing and community management?

76
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:39,883
That just sounds like somebody is trying to make fetch happen.

77
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:42,724
It's kind of a weird hybrid of buzzwords.

78
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,424
But this is where I should have talked about you

79
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:45,845
about the history of Paradox.

80
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:49,726
Our community is actually older than our company,

81
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,487
which is kind of weird.

82
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:53,047
But we went through a couple of iterations.

83
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:56,897
Currently our community is around three million people

84
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:58,317
just on our own channels.

85
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,078
When we started a couple of,

86
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,100
like when I started five years ago, it was way smaller.

87
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,261
We were looking at half a million to a million.

88
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:12,983
And we work with something where we take the knowledge

89
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:14,864
that we have from community management,

90
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:15,944
the community marketing,

91
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:19,366
and bring that into our marketing campaigns.

92
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,562
So we use what we learn from community management

93
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:24,483
and make that translate into marketing.

94
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,883
And we do that in three different ways.

95
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:30,986
It's either when we try to market a game to a new audience.

96
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,187
So a game where we already own the community,

97
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:35,468
but we have a new audience that we would like to reach

98
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,549
with it, which is the case for Rupert and Versailles 4.

99
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:40,730
Or a new game where we don't have the audience,

100
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,471
but there is a clear lookalike product,

101
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:44,712
like Cities Skylines and SimCity.

102
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,553
Or a title if you have a completely new game

103
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,054
that fills a hole in the market.

104
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:54,444
So I'm going to talk about how you can reach a community

105
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:57,726
or new audience for these three types of games.

106
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,727
How to utilize what you can learn about that community

107
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:02,648
to make your marketing competitive.

108
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,789
And why should you do it?

109
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:06,990
This was supposed to be the takeaway for the entire talk

110
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,231
and I put it here so you can technically leave

111
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:09,952
after this slide.

112
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,333
I wouldn't advise it, but you could.

113
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,535
Marketing with a community in mind

114
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,596
can make your campaigns competitive

115
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,437
even if your wallet is not.

116
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:22,038
If you have a strong community presence,

117
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:25,700
if you know what kind of asset works with your community,

118
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,460
either the community that you own

119
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,641
or the intended community that you want

120
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,982
or your intended audience,

121
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:33,142
you can make yourself compatible

122
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,884
even if you can't pay your way to success.

123
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:40,445
Because most of us here aren't the big five

124
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:44,087
and we probably can't just pay for the space

125
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,988
that we need in order to get the game to be successful.

126
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,609
We need to actually like...

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,321
work with other tools.

128
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:57,865
I can talk about marketing as,

129
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,407
like basically how to create an audience.

130
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:06,711
So, forever, but I'm going to focus on one specific thing,

131
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,712
and that's language.

132
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:12,275
When we talk about community management and marketing

133
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:13,576
at the best and worst of times,

134
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:15,157
an important thing to keep in mind

135
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,559
is that the best of times don't just happen.

136
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:22,460
It's something that you need to work for and you need to build a platform for.

137
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,061
So we're going to take a look at how you build that platform for the three different categories

138
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,041
that I mentioned earlier.

139
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:34,423
Language is one of the most important parts of building your platform.

140
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:39,844
And a language in this context isn't just your spoken language or written language.

141
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:44,885
It's everything you use in order to communicate something to an audience.

142
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:53,442
So it's everything from images to music to GIFs or actual words or single words.

143
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:55,863
It could just be the tags that you use for your game.

144
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:58,423
That is part of your game language.

145
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:04,925
And the language of a community can be very different and very individual based on a community.

146
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:09,346
And if you can replicate a community language, you're kind of already...

147
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:14,087
You get a couple of extra steps. Sorry, Sweden.

148
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:20,633
I'm gonna take a breath and just keep going with this.

149
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,075
It helps you to gain an advantage on the market.

150
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:24,895
Sorry, I'm really nervous.

151
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:26,676
I've actually never done one of these talks before.

152
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:30,799
So study the language of your intended audience.

153
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:34,501
What this means is if you are looking at your own community,

154
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,102
make sure if you are a marketing person,

155
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:38,843
talk to your community manager.

156
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,420
what is your community actually saying and doing?

157
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,741
What are their in-jokes?

158
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:45,382
This is an in-joke that we have

159
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,203
from our grand strategy community.

160
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:51,245
They usually say that because they spend

161
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:52,866
so much time playing our games,

162
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:55,267
they are always gonna be alone.

163
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:57,388
Or like their wife got really mad at them,

164
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,189
or their partner got really mad at them

165
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,711
because they were staying up all night playing CK2.

166
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,594
So we made these very specifically catered Valentine's card

167
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:08,595
that was based on their inside joke.

168
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:12,869
which worked because we knew their language and they understood it

169
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:17,893
because it was really easy for this to be interpreted as sort of dismissive

170
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:21,296
if you don't know the community it's coming from.

171
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:25,100
Marketing towards an existing community

172
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,602
was something that we did when we launched EU4.

173
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,832
So we already had our grand strategy community,

174
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:32,874
and they were big and they were really excited

175
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:33,874
about a new product,

176
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:37,116
but we were seeing some discourse

177
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,298
around their grand strategy titles that are basically,

178
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,940
I'm too dumb to play grand strategy games.

179
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,481
I can't play them.

180
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,682
I'm not smart enough.

181
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:50,688
And that's a big problem for us because we want more people

182
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:52,069
to get into our games.

183
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,089
We don't want to feel that they're too dumb.

184
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,849
And this was something that we kept seeing

185
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,290
on different places, both on forums, on Reddit,

186
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,990
and other places.

187
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,211
So what we did was we created this marketing asset.

188
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:04,191
It was originally titled,

189
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:06,671
Are You Too Dumb to Play Rupert and Rosales 4?

190
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,152
But we changed it later to,

191
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:10,832
So You Think You Can't Play Empire Building Games?

192
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:15,853
It's basically that fear that they are too dumb

193
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:17,013
to play it addressed.

194
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:24,732
in a floor chart that also actually talks about the features of our game in a really

195
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,412
creative way.

196
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:32,235
And we made sure that this was up everywhere where our fans were and where these discussions

197
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:32,795
were happening.

198
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:36,077
So not just on our own forum, but also on Reddit and other subforums.

199
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,658
So we actually could share this broadly with our audience.

200
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:42,340
Another thing that we noticed that the community really liked to do

201
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:46,957
The main thing they talked about together was user stories.

202
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:50,079
They were talking about their alternate history stories,

203
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,360
their conquests.

204
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:55,503
And this was a direct thing that we used

205
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,924
when we made our trailers.

206
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,706
So we basically made our trailers

207
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,689
based of the stories we saw on our forums

208
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,411
of an alternate history Sweden

209
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,793
where we never conceded Denmark

210
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,314
and suddenly we are an empire.

211
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:14,658
A good thing to keep in mind with this though

212
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:16,239
is to do it with finesse.

213
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,579
These are two different kind of assets

214
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:21,140
where the flow chart is very internal.

215
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,920
If you're not part of this community,

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,760
it's going to be really hard to understand

217
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,821
why we're doing this.

218
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,181
But we kept the announcement trailer

219
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:30,842
or the release trailer really accessible.

220
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,042
So you can watch that.

221
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:34,082
You've never seen anything from EU4 before.

222
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:35,963
You can understand what's going on in it.

223
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,663
And make sure you differentiate these types of assets

224
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:41,184
because otherwise you will accidentally make stuff

225
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:41,784
that are too.

226
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,801
niche for a broader market.

227
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:49,404
So that's how we worked with a community

228
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:50,584
that we already owned.

229
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:51,765
And that's easy, right?

230
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:53,206
You already have the insights,

231
00:10:53,246 --> 00:10:54,627
you have your community managers,

232
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,468
you have your forums, you know what they like.

233
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,770
But what about the people that are new to you?

234
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:01,212
What if you have a game

235
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:04,374
that doesn't have a lookalike product in the market

236
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:08,397
and where you don't own the community?

237
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:09,077
What do you do?

238
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:16,429
Something that we like to do is to talk about what your game gives to players.

239
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,550
This is using City Skylines as an example.

240
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,013
City Skylines wasn't a gap in the market type of game.

241
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:25,554
It had a very easy competitor to look at.

242
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:29,437
But we're not just talking about your game.

243
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:31,078
That's the important thing.

244
00:11:31,118 --> 00:11:35,581
Don't just benchmark or look at the community surrounding your competitor's

245
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,182
game or different games.

246
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,883
Look at what your game actually does for a player.

247
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:44,040
City Skylines is, you can build and manage a city.

248
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,340
That's our core player loop,

249
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,580
and that's what people really like,

250
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,901
so we have some clear competitors there with SimCity.

251
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:50,942
But you can also be creative,

252
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:52,983
and you can build whatever you want,

253
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:53,783
and you can mod it,

254
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:55,384
and you can do all of these sort of crazy things.

255
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:58,145
So there, we're competing with Minecraft.

256
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:01,246
But we're also technically competing with knitting,

257
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:04,207
because that's also a creative pastime.

258
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:08,978
If you have a slow moving city builder game,

259
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:11,199
that is kind of a relaxing experience.

260
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,660
So we will also relax our players.

261
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,060
And in that case, we're competing against

262
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,882
taking a long bath or playing Stardew Valley.

263
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:23,523
Or you just want to do something over a weekend.

264
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:26,224
I'm free, I'm just gonna get really into this.

265
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:28,244
And Cities Skylines can do that too.

266
00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:30,665
It can be a game where you can just play it

267
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:34,286
for hours on end and it has no real ending.

268
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:35,487
So technically.

269
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:38,736
you are now competing with a 50-year-old TV show

270
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:40,817
that has absolutely no ending.

271
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,360
So it's just a way of thinking about your game

272
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:48,983
and as not just a game, but also as an experience.

273
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:52,366
And taking that when you look for new audiences

274
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:53,526
and new communities.

275
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,769
Like, maybe Minecraft isn't a competitor

276
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,430
in any way to Cities Skylines,

277
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,993
but maybe we can provide the same sort of experience

278
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:02,793
as it could do.

279
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,355
Like, we're never gonna put marketing money.

280
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,752
on advertising on Minecraft videos,

281
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:11,954
but we might just wanna put something in there about,

282
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,676
you know, wanna relax a little bit, wanna chill,

283
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:17,698
take a bath in cities.

284
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,882
Cities, of course, had a very clear competitor.

285
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,764
We had very clear competitors in other city-building games.

286
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:29,007
So something we did when we started working with cities,

287
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:30,528
again, this was five years ago,

288
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,389
and Paradox was a vastly different company.

289
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:37,112
We had a hard time reaching outside of our grand strategy

290
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:37,633
audience.

291
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,234
We weren't always publishing grand strategy games,

292
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:42,674
but we still had a problem getting those players

293
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:45,175
to actually be invested in our product.

294
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:48,177
So what we started doing was that we actually,

295
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,757
when we signed Cities Skylines, we

296
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:52,278
started going through other city builder communities.

297
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,799
The example here is from SimCity 4,

298
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,561
but we did a lot more than just looking at their Steam hub.

299
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:02,682
And we started looking at what their games did.

300
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,931
What kind of jobs did they do?

301
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,032
What kind of language was their community speaking?

302
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:11,893
What kind of words did they use to describe their product?

303
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,334
What kind of images were they putting up?

304
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,515
And can we do the same thing?

305
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:20,156
Without lying, do we do the same thing as them?

306
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:21,537
And we started ticking boxes.

307
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,377
We do this, we do this, we don't do that.

308
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,538
And it turns out we can be pretty similar.

309
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,640
We can use their image language.

310
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,522
in our community and announcement assets.

311
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,644
So this was actually learnings from the community

312
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:38,946
that we used in the announcement for Cities Skylines.

313
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,128
Just to make sure that we kind of got that thing.

314
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:45,231
But something that also happened,

315
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,195
especially around seeing how the state of SimCity

316
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:54,238
was at that point, and the state of the online feelings

317
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:56,940
towards SimCity, was that when we did this,

318
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,702
it was very clear what we were doing.

319
00:14:58,742 --> 00:14:59,883
We were very clearly.

320
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:04,344
presenting ourselves as another city-building game,

321
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,165
as kind of like as an alternative.

322
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:09,088
And it went really well.

323
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:10,989
It did everything we wanted it to do.

324
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,871
But it also created some comments like this.

325
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:21,417
Because we were currently saying

326
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:23,339
that War Game was available offline,

327
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,100
which was not like a great thing.

328
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:28,439
But it did work, it got us internet attention.

329
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:31,761
But it also meant that we were getting a lot of negativity

330
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:36,405
for something that, instead of marketing what we did well,

331
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:38,347
we were marketing what somebody else

332
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:40,769
had perceived to fail at.

333
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,932
And that builds a toxic community,

334
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:45,193
and that's not what you want.

335
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:49,436
Because we worked really hard

336
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:54,320
with making cities a cute, happy city builder.

337
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:56,325
It is a friendly community.

338
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:59,367
It is a cute city builder with massive cities

339
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,409
and cute tilt shift and a bird that wears hats.

340
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,731
And this is the kind of tone that we wanted

341
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:09,133
because we really wanted to make sure

342
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,974
that with a game that had so much modding,

343
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:13,936
we needed to have a supportive and nice community

344
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,297
that could help one another.

345
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:18,118
Because if they were building stuff on negativity,

346
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,659
they would be a negative community.

347
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,121
And that would hurt us in the long term.

348
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:25,538
So we have spent a lot of time actually just framing this,

349
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:27,998
and today it is for actually a really good community.

350
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,819
But I think it's really important to remember this thing.

351
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,960
In an online world, your community becomes a part

352
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,180
of your brand, and building a good community

353
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,281
should be part of your marketing strategy.

354
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,661
So if you are a marketing person,

355
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,822
talk to your community manager

356
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:45,082
when you plan your marketing campaigns.

357
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,563
Because who hasn't heard of great games

358
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:49,963
with terrible communities,

359
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:52,284
where you kind of like really wanna play it?

360
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,172
but you also don't want to be a part of the community.

361
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:58,636
And we don't want that, and that is something

362
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:02,320
that we can't let toxic players control our games.

363
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:03,761
We should do that.

364
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:09,607
Also, something that is really, really important to mention,

365
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,369
I added this slide just today

366
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,631
because I forgot to mention it,

367
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,593
is that if you're doing...

368
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,251
If you are replicating other communities,

369
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,412
if you're looking at other people's languages

370
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:22,314
and using that to create your marketing strategy,

371
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:25,216
make sure you do something differently.

372
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,858
Whatever it might be, it could be something small.

373
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,179
If you wanna have examples,

374
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:32,160
I can give you that after the session,

375
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,361
but I'm running low on time already

376
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,282
to get through all of this.

377
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:38,163
Because if we don't do anything differently,

378
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:40,905
we end up making the same content for the same people

379
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,686
over and over and over again,

380
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:44,707
and that's not where we want the industry to go.

381
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,733
So hopefully you have now, you got the best of times, right?

382
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,314
You've done your foundation work,

383
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:55,175
you have created some happy communities,

384
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:57,557
and now people are really interested in you and your game,

385
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,858
and you're speaking their language,

386
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,059
and you've defined the tone,

387
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:01,721
and you have that in your marketing strategy.

388
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,623
So during the best of times, what do you do?

389
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:07,245
This is the times where your community is the most happy,

390
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,147
the most creative, and the most engaged.

391
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:11,769
And here is where you can kind of future-proof

392
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:13,771
your community for the worst of times,

393
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:17,093
which will come if you have a big community.

394
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,530
I'm not saying if, I'm saying when it's gonna happen.

395
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,891
Just big communities, it happens.

396
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,412
Incentivizing good behavior is something

397
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:30,592
that is really, really important

398
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,993
when your community is at its best.

399
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,013
Incentivizing good behaviors could be everything

400
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:38,774
from just uplifting people that are being helpful

401
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:40,754
and like thumbing up them,

402
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,115
or somebody that shares the kind of screenshots

403
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:44,175
that you want them to share,

404
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:46,615
or somebody that's creating mods.

405
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:54,366
just make sure that your community knows what kind of behavior and actions and language you like

406
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:57,168
and you think should be associated with your brands.

407
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,508
And this is done really easily.

408
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:00,950
It might sound like controlling,

409
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,933
but it's actually just making sure that you don't just focus on the people that is complaining about your product

410
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:08,814
because especially if you're a community manager,

411
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:14,577
it's really easy to spend your days replying to the people that have problems or concerns

412
00:19:14,677 --> 00:19:15,998
or are just angry in general.

413
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,537
So I think it's very important to just remember

414
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,638
to talk to the people who like you as well.

415
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,001
Informing the community at Paradox,

416
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,322
we work a lot with transparency with our community.

417
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:32,124
So it's very important to us,

418
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:33,965
and hopefully it should be to you too,

419
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:36,607
to be transparent with information to your community

420
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:38,428
to the point where it makes sense.

421
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:41,229
This is really good,

422
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,031
and very good for reaching your target.

423
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:48,955
If your community reaches places that you don't,

424
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:53,297
then you can use this and the transparency and information

425
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,619
to make sure that your message goes with them.

426
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:59,381
Our DLC policy is a really good example of this.

427
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:02,383
We've had a DLC policy or an expansion policy

428
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:03,964
that we've had for almost 10 years.

429
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:06,445
And currently with a new influx of players,

430
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:08,407
we're seeing a lot of negativity around it

431
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:11,108
because there is a lot of negativity about DLCs in general.

432
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,250
But we have been consistent in our messaging around

433
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:17,109
these DLCs for almost 10 years.

434
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,070
We've said the same thing.

435
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,071
It helps us develop the games further.

436
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:23,333
It helps us move forward with production.

437
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:27,275
And by giving that message to our core fan base,

438
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:32,177
we see that they reply those things at places we can't reach.

439
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:35,739
We can't reach the comment section of a PC Gamer article,

440
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,220
but our community can.

441
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,902
We can't reach competitor sites' Facebook pages,

442
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:42,243
but our community can.

443
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:43,123
And...

444
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,442
If they are informed, they can help you spread your message.

445
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:49,543
This is also really important to make sure

446
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:51,444
that they know what you stand for.

447
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:53,845
So make sure they know your community guidelines

448
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:56,847
and make sure they know your values

449
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,229
because they can help spread those as well.

450
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:00,829
And it's really important to make sure,

451
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:02,971
again, stuff doesn't turn toxic.

452
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,793
Create with the community, this is just fun.

453
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,744
Whatever they're currently doing that you like,

454
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,004
for cities, for example,

455
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,445
we really like when they create mods,

456
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:15,586
so we try to incentivize mod making through newsletters

457
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:19,847
or presentations, or we just want them to give,

458
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:24,469
we give them awards, actually, for mods created.

459
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:28,071
Or if it's art, have them make art, make art competitions.

460
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:31,092
Just uplift artists on social media.

461
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,253
Maybe pay them to do something official,

462
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,114
just to make sure that your community knows

463
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,194
what kind of content.

464
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,032
that you really enjoy and help them feel like

465
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:43,014
they are being seen when they produce it.

466
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:45,556
Because this is like, I love community creation.

467
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:48,699
That's like one of the best things about being in games

468
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,340
is seeing what other people are capable

469
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,221
to do with those games.

470
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:55,985
Yeah, this is the same takeaway.

471
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,586
Engaging with the community can make

472
00:21:57,606 --> 00:21:59,868
your marketing competitive even if your wallet is not.

473
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:03,471
I left it in intentionally because I think it's important

474
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:04,451
and I'm gonna say it twice.

475
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,342
So now we get to the worst of times.

476
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:12,846
Our worst of times came in July last year,

477
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,529
when Europa Universalis 4 was being review bombed

478
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,710
based on pricing changes that we made

479
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,973
on regions that weren't using the euro,

480
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,214
the dollar, or the pound.

481
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:26,436
It kind of started slow,

482
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:28,498
with just a few people upset about it,

483
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,740
and then it snowballed into this spike

484
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:34,723
that you see here on the Steam Charts.

485
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:36,244
And.

486
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:41,725
It kind of hit us in a bad time because if you've known a Swede, you know that we are not available in July.

487
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:43,665
It's summer and we're out of there.

488
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:48,967
So we had a lot of people that had to work a lot of long hours to kind of work with us.

489
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:53,228
So what do you do when something like this happens to you?

490
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,970
Evaluate what's going on.

491
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,611
Who is doing it? Why?

492
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,972
How many are there?

493
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,751
How many is really crucial in community management?

494
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:12,534
Because you don't know if it's 10,000 people

495
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,756
or 100 people on 1,000 accounts.

496
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,718
De-escalate the situation.

497
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,459
Open up a line of communication,

498
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:21,860
a single thread usually on your forum,

499
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:24,522
or somewhere where you can actually direct people

500
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:27,304
that have questions or concerns or are just angry

501
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,805
to make sure that they know they are being heard.

502
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:36,915
but also so that you can actually see where all the feedback is happening and that will help with your evaluation and

503
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:43,198
It's also very important at this stage to not promise anything because you don't have haven't done your evaluation yet, and you're not

504
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:45,759
Necessarily sure about what's going on

505
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:52,222
When you have done your evaluation what happens again simultaneously with the de-escalation it's time to react

506
00:23:52,642 --> 00:23:54,923
What's the correct course of action for this?

507
00:23:56,228 --> 00:24:00,511
If these slides seem familiar, it might be because you've seen the series Mindhunter,

508
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:05,974
and I stole it from that for when they're teaching people how to negotiate in hostage situations.

509
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:14,599
So, what we did was that we actually admitted that we made a mistake.

510
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,663
We rolled back the price changes, and we did offer some compensations to players who had

511
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:23,645
actually bought something during this change.

512
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:25,806
And we also said...

513
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,528
that we will inform you about changes earlier,

514
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,172
and we won't ever promise

515
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:33,555
that we won't do pricing changes again.

516
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,902
But what did we learn from this experience?

517
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:44,784
Internal communication, if you're at the company where not all of you are in the same room or in the same Slack channel

518
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:47,126
and you can easily like see each other in the eye,

519
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:50,889
internal communication is really important when something like this happens.

520
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:56,093
Because usually you will talk to the involved parties and the community team

521
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:58,295
and those will be the people who are working on the problem.

522
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:03,199
Our community team did a hell of a good job with this situation.

523
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:08,223
They worked 24 hours basically with just talking to people on the forum and social media.

524
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:12,099
But we forgot that we have a lot of developers

525
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,640
and other people within our company

526
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,942
that are actually pretty prominent on the internet

527
00:25:17,002 --> 00:25:19,983
and who was getting information

528
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:23,085
and this kind of negativity directed towards them as well.

529
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:26,307
And we didn't have an internal way

530
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,408
of giving constant information

531
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:30,049
and updates about this situation.

532
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,272
Another important thing, if you're a community manager,

533
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:36,853
you already know this, but if you're not,

534
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:40,334
It's really important to set internal expectations

535
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,675
on what happens if you make changes

536
00:25:42,735 --> 00:25:45,137
to something that has gone bad.

537
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:48,158
So let's say, for example, with the price rollback,

538
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,039
of course that didn't mean everybody was happy again.

539
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,501
It was a step in the correct direction

540
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:56,102
for making them happy, but if a house is on fire,

541
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,283
putting out the fire doesn't make the house whole again.

542
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:01,805
You need to actually put down some work.

543
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:04,953
And that's very important for people to know internally

544
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:09,375
because if you're not on online or with your player base a lot,

545
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:11,576
people have a tendency to be able to think

546
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:12,556
that it's just a quick fix

547
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:14,537
and everything will go back to normal.

548
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,899
So that's a good, if you're a community manager,

549
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:19,700
make sure to actually tell your marketing people this,

550
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,622
that set the correct expectations internally.

551
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:25,443
Another thing was transparency.

552
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:28,805
Something that we saw from our own community was that.

553
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:35,492
When the dust settled, people weren't that upset about the price change.

554
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,533
They were upset that it came from nowhere.

555
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:42,296
Because we have been consistently informing our community about upcoming

556
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:45,297
changes like this before, but we didn't this time.

557
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:49,059
And they saw that as us changing as a company, and

558
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,121
saw it as kind of a betrayal towards them.

559
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:54,883
So we need to be more transparent and make sure that the thing.

560
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:57,806
we weren't being consistent in our language,

561
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:59,868
we weren't being consistent in our actions,

562
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:01,549
and that upset our community,

563
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,232
and that upset sort of like their trust in us.

564
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:06,794
So that's also something,

565
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:10,217
if you're being transparent with your community,

566
00:27:10,257 --> 00:27:12,219
remember to constantly be transparent about it.

567
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,001
If anybody here works with PR,

568
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:15,502
this is also a good learning for PR.

569
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,984
For example, if you have, for us,

570
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:21,588
pricing for expansions is sometimes a sensitive subject.

571
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:24,524
So we will go out and tell people about pricing

572
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,145
at the earliest possible convenience,

573
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,947
just to make sure that that discussion is happening early

574
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:30,067
and not on launch day.

575
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,911
Marketing towards and managing a community is angry.

576
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:37,412
This is where the hard work pays off.

577
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:40,094
I'm just gonna quickly show you this slide.

578
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:41,915
This is the sentiment.

579
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:44,257
This was posted on a Battletech video

580
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:46,018
that was released two days ago.

581
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,920
And the first one's serious.

582
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,381
He's like, I can't wait for the useless DLC to come.

583
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:54,849
And Daydreamer tells them that, yes, we confirmed DLC.

584
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:57,331
And then we have Moon Howler Coyote,

585
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:58,692
who comes in and says,

586
00:27:58,772 --> 00:28:01,113
I can't wait for their useless DLC to come.

587
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:03,595
I love expanding my games and playing it for years.

588
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:05,697
This is our message.

589
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:07,358
This is the thing that we've been telling them.

590
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:11,261
The DLC policy helps us expand your game.

591
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,223
So this is where it paid off.

592
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:15,524
Right now we're seeing,

593
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:18,086
like we're slowly gaining back the trust of our community

594
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:19,366
through action.

595
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,212
and through people like Moonhawkayody,

596
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:24,853
who comes in and helps us spread our message where we can't.

597
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:29,036
I am rapidly running out of time,

598
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:30,717
so it's gonna be a really quick summary.

599
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:35,400
Community is more than the product of your marketing,

600
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,421
it can be one of its core pillars,

601
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,482
and it can make you competitive.

602
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:42,504
I've seen that three times now, so it must be true.

603
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:46,026
And this was supposed to be the last slide,

604
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:48,728
but then I thought, ah, let's add another one.

605
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:50,964
Don't fake it.

606
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:54,926
If you honestly do not care about your community,

607
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:59,588
if you don't care about how well it's thriving

608
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:01,970
or what it's doing, that's fine.

609
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,150
That's you do you.

610
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,151
But don't pretend to do it.

611
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:09,113
If your game doesn't fit those jobs

612
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:11,754
or kind of fits within the community

613
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:13,375
that you want it to fit within,

614
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:15,296
don't try to force it in there.

615
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,357
Try to be honest with the people online

616
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:19,778
and be honest towards the product that you are marketing.

617
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:24,067
because people online are annoyingly smart and they will catch you doing it.

618
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:26,034
Thank you.
