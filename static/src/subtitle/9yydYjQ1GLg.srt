1
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:07,048
All right, everyone.

2
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,950
Hello, and welcome to Designing AI for Competitive Games.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,930
Thank you all for coming out.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,851
We really appreciate it.

5
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:16,172
So first, I'd like to introduce the two of us.

6
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:17,033
My name is Derek Neal.

7
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:19,994
I'm currently the executive producer for Maximum Games.

8
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:21,515
But in a previous life, I was working

9
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:24,417
for Iron Galaxy on Killer Instinct and the Shadow System,

10
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:25,837
among other things.

11
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:26,878
With me is Bruce Hales.

12
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:29,259
He's a software engineer for Iron Galaxy

13
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:30,940
and the architect of the system.

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,122
So for those of you that don't know, Killer Instinct is a fighting game, kind of in the

15
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:39,784
veins of tradition set up by Street Fighter and things like that, published by Microsoft

16
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:44,926
and Iron Galaxy has taken over development of the title ever since the season two launch.

17
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:50,468
So one of the things that we've noticed, I have a long history in fighting games, I worked

18
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:54,050
for Capcom before this, I've been in the competitive fighting game scene, and one of the things

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,631
that I've noticed just going through this is that...

20
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:59,813
The AI that's in games often doesn't do a lot

21
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:02,715
to prepare users for online competition.

22
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,236
So I wanna tell you guys a story.

23
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:05,237
This is Bob.

24
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:07,719
Bob is a new user of one of these competitive games,

25
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,200
in our example, a fighting game.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,500
He goes into the game,

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,662
he starts playing the single player mode and he loves it.

28
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:15,004
The AI is fun and interesting, it's challenging.

29
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:16,745
He learns strategies and tactics to beat it,

30
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,066
gets better at the game.

31
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:19,927
And by the time he's done with that experience,

32
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:21,908
he feels like he's really good at this game.

33
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:23,809
After all, he can trounce the AI, he gets through it,

34
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,330
he's like, I'm ready, I'm gonna go online,

35
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,571
I'm gonna play some real people now.

36
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:28,592
But when Bob goes online and he starts

37
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:29,813
playing against those real people,

38
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:32,354
he quickly finds that it's a totally different world

39
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:32,754
out there.

40
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:35,335
The kind of game that the human players are playing

41
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:37,596
is just dramatically different from the kind of game

42
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:38,777
that the AI has been playing.

43
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:40,077
And the strategies and tactics that he's

44
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:42,759
learned that are effective against the AI

45
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,000
aren't effective against those human players.

46
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,242
As a result, he winds up getting destroyed,

47
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,424
he feels frustrated, and he quits the game.

48
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:51,065
I'm sure you guys have seen this sort of thing

49
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:52,907
happen before, it's happened to tons of my friends

50
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:55,349
when I've tried to get them into fighting games.

51
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,312
And so, this got us wondering, is this a problem

52
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,614
that the AI could help to resolve?

53
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:03,276
Are there strategies or tactics that we could use

54
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:04,457
in order to make it better?

55
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,079
And so we kind of looked at what are some of the

56
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,901
common problems, what are some of the common reasons

57
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,042
why this happened.

58
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:16,269
And by and far, the biggest one is that the AI is fundamentally playing a different kind of game than players are.

59
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,973
Players are guessing and forming strategies and coordinating with each other.

60
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:26,820
But by and large, the AI has perfect information about the world and is just making decisions in a very, very different way.

61
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,026
So the kinds of strategies that it employs just don't reflect the same kinds of strategies that human players have.

62
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:36,425
So we've kind of distilled all of these observations

63
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:39,228
down to a handful of topics that we'd like to cover today.

64
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:41,931
So first of all, the fact that AI fighters

65
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:44,253
traditionally don't have the same limitations players do,

66
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:47,216
things like reaction times and fidelity of input.

67
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,758
They also make decisions in a very different way

68
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:50,959
than players make decisions.

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,881
And they don't tend to strategize

70
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,663
or socialize the way that players do.

71
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:57,644
Another thing is that even in AI that's really good,

72
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,065
really challenging, really fun,

73
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:00,585
at the time that the game ships,

74
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:02,546
over the course of the game's life cycle,

75
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:03,826
players develop new strategies,

76
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:04,766
they get better at the game,

77
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,807
they come up with new tips and tricks,

78
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,607
find bugs and exploits.

79
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:11,548
And as they do that, the way the game is played changes.

80
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:13,369
But traditional AI doesn't.

81
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:14,749
Traditional AI remains static,

82
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:17,090
so even something that was a great AI

83
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,750
at the time that the game launched

84
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,831
might quickly become outmoded or obsolete

85
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,811
as players learn more about the game.

86
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,591
So what was our solution to this?

87
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:28,614
Our solution to this was what we called the shadow system.

88
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:31,477
And what we're basically doing is crowdsourcing

89
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,680
the AI development to our player base.

90
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,941
So we're looking at all the players,

91
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,543
all of the things that we're doing,

92
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,465
and we're learning behaviors from the players

93
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:41,267
and letting them train the AI that's in the game.

94
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:44,790
Now the cool thing about these shadow fighters is that they're not superhuman.

95
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,692
They have all the same limitations and restrictions, they make the same mistakes that people do.

96
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:52,775
They're super easy to train, you can make a functional AI that will do whatever you

97
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,076
want it to do in literally minutes.

98
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:58,899
They learn strategies, tactics, social behaviors even.

99
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:02,841
They'll disrespect each other, they'll, you know, be cautious or aggressive.

100
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:05,143
They have personalities that they learn from players.

101
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:07,125
And the other thing is that because they're

102
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,067
learning from the player base all of these behaviors,

103
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,349
they also change as players change.

104
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,211
When players learn new combos or develop new strategies,

105
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:18,333
those strategies then get added to the AI's repertoire.

106
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:28,038
But rather than just talking about this ourselves, we wanted to show you guys the reaction of some of the players that first got a chance to play with the system

107
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:33,880
and when they actually started playing against a Shadow that had been trained off of their own performance.

108
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,641
So I'm going to go ahead and play this video here.

109
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:43,224
So essentially what Shadows is, it's a system built into the game that I like to compare to Skynet.

110
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:45,325
It's essentially Terminator in real life.

111
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:48,386
Okay, I gotta be defensive with him.

112
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,661
That was easy for him.

113
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:05,361
Damn.

114
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,682
Destroyed me.

115
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:14,667
And the craziest part about it is as I went further and the computer got smarter, it did

116
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,468
exactly what I was going to do at that exact moment.

117
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:24,054
oh dear

118
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:24,234
nah

119
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:28,435
unlucky guess

120
00:05:28,435 --> 00:05:28,815
oh

121
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:31,636
that was sneaky

122
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:34,096
oh shit

123
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,237
damn it, no

124
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,277
yeah

125
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:38,197
nope

126
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:42,238
get the fuck outta there

127
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,221
Oh, oh man. Park. It's getting really fucking close. It is, Mark. This is a very... Oh no! Fuck!

128
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:58,923
Oh shit. Oh man. Damn. Dude, that's like one hit away. Come on in. Holy shit. Jesus.

129
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:05,165
Holy shit. Like I had to focus. Like I'm, I was literally, like I had the fight stick and I was like...

130
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:08,598
Like, I didn't blink.

131
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,562
I was gonna go next door to the Gunners booth and ask them to give me a pair because my eyes were hurting,

132
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:16,185
because I wasn't blinking. I was staring and waiting because I had to-

133
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:21,090
The fucked up part about all of it was I had to think about what I was going to think about

134
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,891
before I was gonna think about it.

135
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:26,354
Like, that's- that's what it felt like. I had to think twice.

136
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:42,775
Damn you, stop being so defensive!

137
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:43,216
Oh my god!

138
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:43,396
Heh.

139
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:43,796
Oh my god, no.

140
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,378
He's just like me.

141
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:47,620
Heh heh heh.

142
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,366
I don't think there's a reason for anyone to feel like they are bad at this game.

143
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:57,871
I think Iron Galaxy and Microsoft are giving everyone the tools that they need to learn this game.

144
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:06,915
The Shadow Lab has helped me improve my character to some sense because I'm noticing mistakes I be doing that I don't be noticing when I be playing.

145
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:09,417
They fight me, you know, he's very aggressive.

146
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:14,101
And this whole Shadow thing works. I love the way it is.

147
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,424
Man, I'm fighting other people's Shadows from around the world.

148
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:20,166
It is going to change how we play Killer Instinct.

149
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,468
It's going to change how fighting games are developed.

150
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:27,072
It's going to change how fighting games grow as a community.

151
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:32,796
It is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life.

152
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:38,236
All right, so obviously that guy was pretty excited

153
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,036
about the system.

154
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:42,357
But after we released it, we did do some surveys

155
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:43,918
and things to try and get some ideas

156
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,158
of how people were using the system.

157
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:47,539
We wanted to share some of that data with you.

158
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,079
So first of all, as you can see from the pie chart,

159
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,140
most of the people that responded to our survey

160
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,761
were more hardcore users, but amongst that demographic,

161
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:56,782
almost 80% of them reported using this mode.

162
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:59,783
And almost 50% of them said they used this mode regularly.

163
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:01,884
That compares to only 46% of them who say

164
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:04,226
they actually play the game online.

165
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:06,627
So more people were actually self-reported

166
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:09,169
using this mode than playing the game online.

167
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,891
The other thing is that the responses from the survey

168
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,692
were pretty much all give us more.

169
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,353
We want to see more integration of this.

170
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,294
We want to see more ways to interact with it,

171
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,716
more features that use it.

172
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,777
We were inundated by feature requests

173
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:25,879
as opposed to complaints that the AI is terrible or whatever.

174
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,182
So, with that said, we'd actually like to show you guys real quick what it takes to

175
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:35,205
train one of these by training a shadow live in front of you right here, right now, and

176
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,126
showing you the process.

177
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:38,969
So, for that, I'm going to hand control over to Bruce.

178
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,112
As I pick up the controller, the shadow is going to be learning from me.

179
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:42,472
All right.

180
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:47,056
So, I'm going to go ahead and set us up so we're in game.

181
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:59,338
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna train a shadow

182
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,299
for you in real time.

183
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:04,299
So throughout this process, we're gonna incrementally

184
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,220
build up a shadow that's able to handle itself

185
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,560
in a variety of different situations.

186
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,501
As we record this, I want you to keep in mind

187
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,841
that Derek is playing the character in blue.

188
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:16,322
So we're gonna be looking at the character in blue

189
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,442
to basically train the shadow,

190
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:21,263
and then we're gonna see the actions play back

191
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:22,483
on the character in red.

192
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:24,843
That's gonna show us what the shadow has picked up

193
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:25,303
or learned.

194
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:33,509
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and reload the match, and Derek is going

195
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,598
to go ahead and give his shadow examples of being aggressive.

196
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:43,049
The first thing that Derek is going to do is give his shadow examples of how to be aggressive.

197
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:48,131
How to do basic attacks, how to do combos, how to approach the enemy and how to move around the screen.

198
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:54,514
So one thing that's important to keep in mind is that we need to give the shadow data from multiple ranges.

199
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:59,456
We need to show the shadow how we attack when we're up close, how we attack when we're far away.

200
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,118
and we need to show it examples of how to jump

201
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:03,739
and then do attacks.

202
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:08,803
So now what we want to do is we want to give it

203
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:13,927
examples of how to basically attack

204
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:17,289
against an opponent that's being a bit more defensive.

205
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,290
So I'm gonna go ahead and take control

206
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,710
and start blocking.

207
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,731
The input's dead.

208
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:22,253
We'll plug it in.

209
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:23,174
Resume real quick.

210
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:36,135
Okay, we'll just go ahead and commit this.

211
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,918
So now that we've got some offensive data,

212
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:43,880
basically some examples of being aggressive,

213
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,502
we want to go ahead and commit that

214
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:47,383
and see if the shadow is able to pick up

215
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:48,103
on what we were teaching it.

216
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:49,404
So we can see that the shadow is able to pick up

217
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:50,204
on Derek's basic locomotion,

218
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:52,786
it's able to pick up on some of his combos,

219
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,748
it's jumping and attacking.

220
00:10:55,748 --> 00:11:00,472
It's even picking up on some of his standing around

221
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:02,753
when we were kind of,

222
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:04,332
messing up the demo a bit.

223
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:08,976
So, that's cool, but what happens if we do something

224
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:10,637
that the shadow hasn't seen before?

225
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,659
Like what happens if we jump in and attack it with a kick?

226
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,940
The shadow's never seen this situation,

227
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,341
so it doesn't know what to do.

228
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,742
That's not really a problem.

229
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:20,544
All we have to do is kind of give it an example

230
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:22,745
of what to do in that situation.

231
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,947
So I'm gonna go ahead and reload the match

232
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,969
and give Derek an example, a chance to show his shadow

233
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,690
what to do in that situation.

234
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,111
So he's just gonna do anti-airs when the shadow jumps in.

235
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,677
Of course, we have to wait for the shadow

236
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:38,478
to cooperate with us because sometimes

237
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,139
it's just going to want to attack us.

238
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:55,613
So now that we've got a couple examples

239
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:57,254
of anti-airs in there, we wanna go ahead

240
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:59,216
and save that out and see again if the shadow

241
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:01,037
was able to pick up on what we were showing it.

242
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:21,398
So we can see that it's able to understand things

243
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:23,579
like anti-airs and able to pick up on that behavior.

244
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,379
But what happens if we show it another situation

245
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,560
that it hasn't seen?

246
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,600
For example, what if we try to do projectile attacks?

247
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,060
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna reload this

248
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,161
and I'm gonna give Derek a chance to show his shadow

249
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:38,542
how to throw projectiles.

250
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,462
So now that his shadow has a couple examples

251
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:44,603
of throwing projectiles, we're gonna go ahead

252
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:46,903
and reload it and...

253
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:50,923
give Derek a chance to...

254
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:56,945
So this is going to give Derek a chance to basically

255
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:59,206
show his shadow how to react to projectiles,

256
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:04,087
how to jump over projectiles, how to counter projectiles.

257
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:07,188
So now that we have some of that data,

258
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:12,130
we're going to go ahead and commit that

259
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,992
and see if the shadow is able to pick up on that as well.

260
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:22,529
So now what we have is we have a shadow that basically

261
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,171
knows how to defend against projectiles,

262
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,953
knows how to defend against anti-airs,

263
00:13:28,953 --> 00:13:31,334
and also knows how to attack, attack still.

264
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:34,036
So basically kind of in just a short amount of time,

265
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,637
we've been able to create a shadow that kind of,

266
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:39,219
we could kind of send out

267
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,120
and players could fight against a bit.

268
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,241
So what's also cool about this is not just that we've

269
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:49,205
created something that's functional,

270
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:52,969
but we've created something that was also able to capture

271
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:54,211
Derek's style of playing.

272
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:56,613
So we have something that's able to handle itself

273
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,516
in a variety of situations, but also was able to capture

274
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:01,378
Derek's style, which is really powerful.

275
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:05,699
because that would work for any other player, right?

276
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,939
Every player has a unique style,

277
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:11,040
and this is going to organically pick up on that style

278
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,820
without anybody having to come in

279
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,161
and sort of ad hoc program that style into it.

280
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:16,021
So now we're gonna go ahead and dig a bit

281
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:16,421
into how this works.

282
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:16,461
So.

283
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:31,042
I'm gonna give a quick overview of the system.

284
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:34,950
So, I think a really powerful way.

285
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,170
Oh yeah.

286
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:45,448
I think a really powerful way to think about this

287
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,229
is to think about replay data,

288
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:50,270
to think about replay systems that we already have.

289
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,591
So with replay systems, we kind of right now just use them

290
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,872
to kind of share experiences with our friends.

291
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:57,973
So I did something really cool

292
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,193
and then I want to send a replay to my friend

293
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:01,454
so my friend can check it out.

294
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:05,636
But what if we took that replay data that we had

295
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:07,616
and instead of just playing it back,

296
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,117
playing back all the replay data,

297
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,778
what if we looked at it and we tried to play it back

298
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,339
in the right situation?

299
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,879
So for example, in that replay data

300
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,140
we could have information recorded about

301
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,741
how much health somebody had or what distance they were

302
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,022
from the enemy at a certain point in time.

303
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:24,003
We could use that information to basically

304
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,784
jump around in the replay and find the right piece

305
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:29,625
of the replay data to play back at runtime

306
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,246
to produce behavior at runtime.

307
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,721
So what we're seeing here is kind of a visualization

308
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:38,221
of that process.

309
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:40,022
We have basically a bank of a bunch

310
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,522
of different replay segments,

311
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:44,003
and the idea is that the shadow is always looking

312
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,844
for the best replay segment to play back

313
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:49,164
in context at runtime.

314
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:51,525
So in this, we're just finding that replay segment,

315
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,745
playing it back at runtime,

316
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,806
and then the behavior is whatever we get

317
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,867
when we play back that part of the replay at runtime.

318
00:15:59,176 --> 00:16:02,517
So a big part of this that actually makes it work

319
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:06,839
is that sequential actions are very important.

320
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,361
So even though we are jumping around in the replay,

321
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:14,242
we're basically, we want to keep playing parts

322
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:16,383
of the replay back that will look right.

323
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,285
So we don't want to just jump around arbitrarily

324
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:22,546
or sort of just if the world state changes just a tiny bit.

325
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:26,234
Health changes a tiny bit, we don't just want to jump around.

326
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,576
We want to basically continue playing back

327
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:32,118
the current part of the replay until something changes

328
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:32,579
dramatically.

329
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,620
Something changes dramatically, then we'll

330
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,243
consider jumping around to a different part of the replay.

331
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:41,305
This is kind of crazy, but a lot of stuff

332
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:44,668
is captured just by playing back parts of the replay in context.

333
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:46,809
So lots of what we think about is

334
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:50,452
very complicated or high-level behavior,

335
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,752
planning that a player might be doing

336
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:55,173
can be sort of captured indirectly

337
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:57,734
by just playing back things in context at the right time.

338
00:16:57,734 --> 00:17:02,557
So we can kind of see an example of that in this next slide.

339
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:07,060
This is an example of a player fighting his own shadow.

340
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,162
And it's not really an example of what I would say

341
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,683
is like a high-level player.

342
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:14,985
It's just a player that kind of plays very stylistically.

343
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:18,827
He jumps around like he doesn't really know what he's doing.

344
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:21,905
And it's like he's not even trying to kill the enemy.

345
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:24,466
But what's really cool is you can kind of clearly see

346
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,527
that those kind of unique locomotions,

347
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,268
they're happening on both the shadow

348
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:31,189
and the player at the same time.

349
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:35,071
And this is captured just by playing back those pieces

350
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:36,791
of replay in context at the right point in time,

351
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,992
and making sure to maintain the sequences.

352
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:43,034
You would expect maybe that we would see

353
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,615
sort of jarring shifts in behavior or something like that,

354
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,596
but it actually, in practice, if you do it right,

355
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:48,957
it turns out to look seamless.

356
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:58,545
So, I want to talk about human limitations.

357
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:03,688
So, lots of times we tend to ignore human limitations

358
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:05,429
when we're designing traditional AI.

359
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,191
In particular, in fighting games,

360
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:11,173
one thing that we tend to ignore is reaction time.

361
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:15,355
So the graph up here is basically just a distribution

362
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:16,176
of reaction time.

363
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:19,778
The data was collected from basically a very simple task

364
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:23,700
where we would show basically a flashing green icon

365
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,882
and users had to press a button as fast as possible

366
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:28,443
when the icon flashed green.

367
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:31,503
So how, what was the response time that it took them

368
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:34,804
to hit the button after it flashed green?

369
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:38,345
So, hundreds of thousands of users did this,

370
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:40,285
and then we have their data aggregated here.

371
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,446
What this graph is saying is that the vast majority

372
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,527
of people have a reaction time somewhere between

373
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,187
200 and 320 milliseconds.

374
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:50,968
So why this might be important for a fighting game,

375
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:52,248
and in particular Killer Instinct,

376
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:55,329
is because the vast majority of actions in Killer Instinct,

377
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,670
the vast majority of things like attacking an opponent

378
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,410
or hitting an opponent.

379
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:03,066
actually hit in less than that amount of time.

380
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,768
So what that means is that a big part of the game,

381
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:08,050
almost half of the game, is not reactable.

382
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,491
And yet when people play the game,

383
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:11,713
it seems like it makes sense.

384
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:13,594
People feel like they're doing something.

385
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,095
It feels compelling, they're playing it,

386
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:17,157
and they feel like they're in control.

387
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:21,140
But if the stuff isn't reactable, how is that possible?

388
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,462
Well, it turns out that

389
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:27,227
for non-reactable situations like the situation

390
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:29,569
on the right, the player is basically playing

391
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,870
a guessing game.

392
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,772
So you can see the enemy basically doing a pressure string,

393
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,215
a string of attacks while you're blocking.

394
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:39,176
And you have to basically guess

395
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:40,997
when the enemy is going to stop doing,

396
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:42,979
if the enemy is going to stop doing the pressure string

397
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:45,060
or if he's going to continue doing the pressure string.

398
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,584
And that guess lets you know when you should do

399
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,385
tiger fury in the middle of the pressure string.

400
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:55,968
The thing is that you can't react to the enemy stopping the pressure string.

401
00:19:55,968 --> 00:20:00,250
So you have to guess based on the history of fighting this opponent in the match,

402
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,352
how aggressive is he, how long is he going to continue the pressure string.

403
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:08,395
This is kind of what people are talking about when they talk about mind games in a fighting game.

404
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:12,917
And this kind of mind game, this kind of thing

405
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:16,298
that's happening at the margin of human reaction time

406
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,718
doesn't just happen in fighting games.

407
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,458
It happens in other competitive games.

408
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,319
In Counter-Strike, there's lots of headshots

409
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,540
that seem impossible, basically.

410
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,161
But then when you look at what's really going on,

411
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:31,322
it's basically high-level players pre-aiming

412
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:35,223
and pre-shooting because they know that their enemy

413
00:20:35,223 --> 00:20:36,804
is going to end up in a certain location

414
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:37,944
at a certain point in time.

415
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:43,014
So, basically, keeping in mind,

416
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:45,016
reaction time is very important

417
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:46,398
in designing these kinds of AIs.

418
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,100
Otherwise, you'll miss out, basically,

419
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,323
on all this interesting behavior

420
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:55,288
that players have at those margins of reaction time.

421
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:55,368
So,

422
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,085
Because of the way the shadow system works,

423
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,846
because we're just capturing replay data

424
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:02,948
and playing it back in context,

425
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,969
we are capturing when players react

426
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:06,250
and when players don't react

427
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,972
based on the state of the world.

428
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:11,114
So that means that if a player doesn't react

429
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:13,656
when, doesn't react in certain situations,

430
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,718
doesn't respond to an attack in certain situations,

431
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,260
we don't have any data for it,

432
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,442
so we never get basically, you know,

433
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:23,043
the instant hit headshot or something like that

434
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:25,285
because we just have what the player did in context.

435
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:28,911
we get this human limitation just as a consequence

436
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:31,054
of how the system works and records data.

437
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:32,415
So this is kind of an example from Counter-Strike

438
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:36,341
of sort of what happens when you kind of ignore

439
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:42,169
human limitations, just kind of the traditional example

440
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:43,731
of like an aimbot or something.

441
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:50,421
So somebody just walks, gets headshot instantly,

442
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:51,802
it's super frustrating.

443
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:54,945
The way that we traditionally deal with this, right,

444
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:59,649
is we make it less frustrating by adjusting the aim accuracy

445
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,951
or randomly dropping shots occasionally

446
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:03,233
or something like that.

447
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:06,095
And that can work great for difficulty adjustment,

448
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:07,917
but it doesn't capture

449
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:13,120
human limitations in the same way that humans

450
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,800
have those limitations.

451
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,122
So like we were saying with pre-aiming,

452
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:18,383
it's possible in Counter-Strike for players

453
00:22:18,383 --> 00:22:20,984
to get an impossible shot,

454
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,445
I mean a shot that's below reaction time.

455
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:26,427
But if we just do something like have a difficulty slider,

456
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:30,169
it doesn't capture that aspect of human behavior.

457
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:34,692
So what we want to talk about now is decision making.

458
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:37,514
Basically, what is it like when you build an AI

459
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:40,136
with a shadow system versus building an AI

460
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,338
with basically traditional methods?

461
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,831
So with the traditional approach,

462
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,373
we kind of decide on some stuff that we want to create.

463
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:50,075
We say, OK, let's make a aggressive AI.

464
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:51,196
Let's make a defensive AI.

465
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:55,639
And then we either use some ad hoc solution,

466
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,921
or we use a behavior tree, or we use a state machine

467
00:22:57,921 --> 00:23:00,143
or something to try to explicitly encode

468
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:02,625
those behaviors that we're interested in creating.

469
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:07,734
So this stuff works great, obviously.

470
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,715
It's what we always do.

471
00:23:09,715 --> 00:23:12,998
We can get a lot of range and difficulty and everything.

472
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:16,380
One problem with it is that we're always

473
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,921
limited by developer resources.

474
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:19,362
There's only so much we can do.

475
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:23,065
We have to decide what things we want to model,

476
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:25,306
and then somebody has to sit down and do them.

477
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:28,911
And like we've talked about earlier in the introduction,

478
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:31,615
obviously the game continues to evolve

479
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:32,696
after being released.

480
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:35,400
And if we don't have some solution that's sort of automatic

481
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,803
we're not going to be able to keep up with the game

482
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:38,725
after we release it.

483
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:44,574
This is opposed, as opposed to the shadow system

484
00:23:44,574 --> 00:23:47,397
where instead of basically explicitly creating

485
00:23:47,397 --> 00:23:51,420
these behaviors, explicitly creating a offensive

486
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,103
or a defensive AI, the designer or the developer

487
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,505
takes a higher level approach and designs things

488
00:23:57,505 --> 00:24:00,148
called similarity functions, weights, and heuristics.

489
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,990
And we'll dig into what each of those are in a second.

490
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,812
So first of all, there's this idea of similarity.

491
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,513
When I was talking about the concept of picking

492
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,535
the right part of the replay, I was talking about

493
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:13,898
we need to find something from our bank of replays

494
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:16,059
that is similar to the current situation.

495
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,322
So what similar means is kind of defined by the designer.

496
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:23,805
So you can imagine kind of a simple Euclidean idea

497
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:26,347
of similarity, where you have two dimensions of health

498
00:24:26,347 --> 00:24:27,047
and distance.

499
00:24:27,447 --> 00:24:30,010
And each of those dots in the graph is basically,

500
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,151
you can imagine, a replay segment.

501
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:35,594
So for example, the one that has 100 health

502
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:39,197
and 0.5 distance corresponds to a part of the replay

503
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:43,841
where the enemy's world state was that.

504
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:50,847
So think of the dot on the far right as being the current

505
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:55,649
as being the current runtime situation, basically.

506
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:57,510
So what we want to do is we want to find the dot,

507
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,853
the replay segment that's closest to that runtime situation,

508
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:03,195
which happens to be the one that is closest to that,

509
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:08,499
that's immediately to the left of it.

510
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:12,140
Basically, it's up to the designer

511
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,183
to say what that means.

512
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:16,226
In this case, it was just the Euclidean distance.

513
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,029
But it could be just absolute value,

514
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:20,753
or it could be some crazy thing that a designer or developer

515
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:21,755
comes up with.

516
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:24,439
You just need to come up with some idea of similarity.

517
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,322
So once you've created your similarity metrics

518
00:25:28,322 --> 00:25:31,866
for health distance or whatever you're interested in,

519
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:34,989
whatever you're interested in using

520
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:36,810
to compare two different situations,

521
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,553
you need to combine all of those similarity metrics

522
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:41,294
to basically get an aggregate score.

523
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:43,835
So you can imagine that you have things like health,

524
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,596
distance, time, or meter, ammo.

525
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,777
Now that you have all these different similarity metrics,

526
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:49,697
how do they matter relative to each other?

527
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:51,498
Is health more important than ammo?

528
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:54,459
Is timer more important than distance?

529
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,519
So another role of a designer or developer

530
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,000
when using the system is to basically adjust

531
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,181
all of these weights so that they have

532
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,921
the right relative impact.

533
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:07,662
So this is something that kind of requires domain expertise.

534
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:10,663
It requires kind of an intuition for how the system works.

535
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:14,436
You might just have knowledge because of how well you know the game,

536
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:17,106
that distance is more important than health, for example.

537
00:26:19,102 --> 00:26:23,645
So it's worthwhile to think about how this kind of approach

538
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:25,746
could be used in a different kind of game.

539
00:26:25,746 --> 00:26:28,648
So if we think about something like Counter-Strike,

540
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:31,850
instead of using the traditional difficulty sliders of,

541
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,992
okay, maybe I'll fail to hit the enemy every once in a while,

542
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:37,373
or maybe I'll fail to get a headshot every once in a while,

543
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:40,835
what if we track things like visibility,

544
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:43,277
like maybe there's occluding objects on the screen,

545
00:26:43,277 --> 00:26:45,638
or how far away the opponent is,

546
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:48,780
or what the relative angle is to the opponent.

547
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:51,282
If we have all that information being tracked

548
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:53,203
for each of the players and then what they did

549
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:56,105
when the world state, what they did

550
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:57,225
in those different world states,

551
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:59,166
then we can capture things like some players

552
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:02,388
being less sensitive to the angle of the opponent,

553
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,910
some players not just having tunnel vision basically.

554
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,871
We can capture that part organically.

555
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:10,713
So this gives us something that's a bit different

556
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,074
than the difficulty slider, right?

557
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:14,275
It gives us sort of the way that humans fail

558
00:27:14,275 --> 00:27:16,096
at this particular task.

559
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,997
Some humans have tunnel vision and they only focus

560
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:20,459
on what's happening right in the center of focus.

561
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,740
And if we record this kind of data,

562
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,721
that would allow us to capture that kind of human failing.

563
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:30,874
So the other piece of the puzzle is heuristics.

564
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:32,295
So basically, one thing that we want

565
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,896
to be able to do with a system like this

566
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:37,619
is allow the shadows to adapt during a match.

567
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:41,222
So one of the ways that we accomplish this

568
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:44,284
is we basically try to identify trends in a match.

569
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:49,167
For example, how often is my enemy blocking low

570
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,568
versus blocking high?

571
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:54,572
So you can imagine that we just look at that,

572
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,634
create a number that represents the relative ratio

573
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,596
of attacking low versus attacking high,

574
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:01,439
and then in addition to other parts of the world state,

575
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,742
like health and everything, we record that.

576
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:06,044
And then what that means is that when we go through

577
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:07,906
the process of finding the best thing to do

578
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:10,448
in the current situation, we can use this heuristic value

579
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:11,830
as well as the other world state value

580
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,831
to select it correctly.

581
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:16,092
So if that value is updating at runtime,

582
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:18,714
we can see, okay, what did I do in a situation

583
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:22,475
where my enemy was blocking low a lot?

584
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:25,337
And it also works, obviously, for the cases

585
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,878
when a player doesn't do anything

586
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:30,519
or isn't even sensitive to that kind of adaptation.

587
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,220
So, for example, if a player ignores the fact

588
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,782
that his enemy is blocking low versus blocking high,

589
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:39,323
it'll just record that he does whatever in both situations

590
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:42,005
and it won't really change the outcome at all.

591
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,351
So the last thing that we want to talk about is sort of,

592
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,952
we think of as human strategy.

593
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:55,073
In Killer Instinct, what this means is

594
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:57,414
like high level behaviors like rush down

595
00:28:57,414 --> 00:29:01,095
or footsies and zoning and mix ups.

596
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:02,435
In other games like Counter-Strike,

597
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:06,197
it might mean things like coordinating with your friends

598
00:29:06,197 --> 00:29:08,217
like around an objective or something like that.

599
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,038
Like if you're trying to defuse a bomb,

600
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,858
you want some of your friends to basically

601
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:12,879
defend you or something.

602
00:29:14,943 --> 00:29:20,629
So the shadow system is able to organically capture a lot of,

603
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,311
or in fighting games at least,

604
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:23,952
it's been able to capture basically everything

605
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:26,775
that we think of as a high-level behavior.

606
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:28,457
I like this video a lot because...

607
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:38,440
It shows us an example of basically a tournament level player fighting against his shadow.

608
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,761
So this is somebody that's at the top of this game.

609
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:44,884
He basically, every sort of part of the game that there is to know and exploit, he knows.

610
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:48,687
He has all these kind of crazy things in his arsenal.

611
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:54,912
And it's really exciting to see that his shadow basically is able to capture all of that and play it back.

612
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,671
Like, when I look at this, I can't tell the difference really between the shadow and the

613
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:01,792
competitive player.

614
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:05,072
Even if you guys aren't that familiar with fighting games, it's kind of compelling to

615
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:08,633
look at just the locomotions that are going on.

616
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:12,394
Just like, it looks kind of like a player is playing.

617
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:16,515
So I think this is a pretty exciting match, so what I want to do is just let the video

618
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,375
play through and let you guys see what happens.

619
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:50,457
So in this case, the Shadow actually lost,

620
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:53,038
but I mean, it was a pretty close fight, right?

621
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,359
Like, the reason why it was able to put up

622
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,779
that close of a fight is that the Shadow

623
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:58,840
really did pick up on basically like,

624
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,541
everything that that tournament level player

625
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,561
was capable of doing.

626
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:04,842
So I think it's pretty compelling evidence

627
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:07,003
that basically, Shadows are able of learning

628
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:08,403
these behaviors that we kind of think of

629
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:10,244
as being exclusive to players.

630
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:12,684
These higher level behaviors like rush down

631
00:32:12,684 --> 00:32:15,025
and zoning and footsies in the context of a fighting game.

632
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:18,056
This is another video I like a lot.

633
00:32:18,056 --> 00:32:19,476
Kind of shows how shadows can capture

634
00:32:19,476 --> 00:32:20,257
sort of social behaviors.

635
00:32:20,257 --> 00:32:22,178
In this example, kind of taunt them.

636
00:32:22,178 --> 00:32:28,202
So this is another video of a player fighting his own shadow

637
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:31,443
and it's kind of funny because sometimes players

638
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:33,144
can be assholes in fighting games

639
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:34,865
and this guy is about to get kind of a dose

640
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:35,606
of his own medicine.

641
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:51,453
So it's worthwhile to think about how this stuff might apply

642
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:55,556
to Counter-Strike or a game besides a fighting game.

643
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,279
So this is just a video of a bot match in Counter-Strike.

644
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,121
And the thing that stands out to me with this

645
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:04,943
is that it's almost like all of these AIs

646
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:08,226
are playing a different game, basically.

647
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:10,407
They're not really aware of each other,

648
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:11,488
they're not coordinating,

649
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:13,730
they can get in front of each other sometimes.

650
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,481
So, is there something the shadow system could do

651
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:21,042
to maybe help with this?

652
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,243
Obviously we can do a lot of stuff explicitly

653
00:33:23,243 --> 00:33:24,603
to make the coordination better,

654
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:27,705
we can hand offer AIs to make the situation better,

655
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,126
but how could the shadow system help this kind of a situation?

656
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:39,978
So kind of like the aiming example,

657
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,959
we can think about things that we would track

658
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:45,782
to basically help the shadow be able to identify situations

659
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:47,424
that make sense for coordination.

660
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:52,508
So you can imagine a situation where in the past,

661
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:55,650
you were kind of at a bomb site or something like that,

662
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,471
guarding your friend.

663
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:58,132
Your friend was defusing the bomb or something

664
00:33:58,132 --> 00:34:00,034
and enemies were about to rush in.

665
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:02,075
If we look at things, like if we record things

666
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,476
like the status of the objective,

667
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,258
the fact that, you know.

668
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:07,219
your friend's at the bomb site, your friend's

669
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:08,179
defusing the bomb.

670
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,380
If you record the fact that you're close to your friend

671
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,621
that's defusing the bomb, and we record the fact

672
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:15,382
that an enemy's in there, just like all the other stuff

673
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:19,784
that we've seen, we can be able to identify at runtime

674
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:21,804
when we're in a similar situation

675
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:23,685
and pull out the correct part of the replay

676
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:26,126
that basically will allow us to respond appropriately

677
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:27,627
in that situation.

678
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:29,788
So in this way, just by basically

679
00:34:30,488 --> 00:34:34,912
looking at the right factors in the world state,

680
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:37,334
we can kind of get this coordination,

681
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:40,256
not for free, but kind of cheaply,

682
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,398
because we don't necessarily have to

683
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,740
explicitly design the coordination,

684
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,702
we can just sort of capture it indirectly.

685
00:34:46,702 --> 00:34:50,525
So, finally it's worth thinking about

686
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,447
this whole metagame aspect.

687
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:57,058
When we, at the start of the game,

688
00:34:57,058 --> 00:35:01,040
despite how much time we spend creating and handcrafting AI

689
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,241
and everything like that, a couple of months after release,

690
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:06,622
everything is going to be a lot different than it was

691
00:35:06,622 --> 00:35:10,104
initially, because players figure out different strategies.

692
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:14,127
they figure out things in the game that basically we can

693
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:16,268
never figure out because we have 200 testers,

694
00:35:16,268 --> 00:35:20,469
they have hundreds of thousands or millions of testers.

695
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:24,750
And what that means is that there is behaviors in AI,

696
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,451
behaviors that would make sense for AI

697
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,352
that we never thought of.

698
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:31,333
And we don't get a chance to come back to that usually.

699
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,013
It's just too late at that point.

700
00:35:33,013 --> 00:35:35,074
We designed the AI for release,

701
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:36,574
now a couple months after release,

702
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:38,715
it's too late to fix anything or update anything.

703
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,060
So one thing that's nice about something like

704
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,201
the shadow system is that it's live.

705
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:48,442
It continues to change and update as players play the game.

706
00:35:48,442 --> 00:35:51,684
And as a result of that, it's able to sort of stay current

707
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:53,805
and make sense as the minigame evolves.

708
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:57,446
So with that, I'm going to hand it back off to Derek,

709
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,967
and he's going to kind of talk about some sort of future

710
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:01,768
directions for systems like this.

711
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:08,625
Hello again everyone.

712
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,947
So as Bruce mentioned, I wanna go ahead and talk about

713
00:36:11,947 --> 00:36:13,447
some of the possible applications for this.

714
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:16,489
So as you guys saw, iteration times for a system like this

715
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:17,190
are really short.

716
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,271
Once you have this kind of system in place,

717
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:21,732
it's possible for a designer or content creator

718
00:36:21,732 --> 00:36:25,714
to just sit down and record an example of someone

719
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:28,316
throwing a bunch of fireballs in order to create

720
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:29,537
an AI opponent that will run around

721
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:30,777
and throw a bunch of fireballs.

722
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:32,478
And this can be done in minutes.

723
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:35,979
This opens a lot of doors to do some pretty interesting things.

724
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:39,801
So here are some of the ideas we have for things we'd like to inspire you guys to go

725
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:43,022
out and maybe create some things like this.

726
00:36:43,022 --> 00:36:45,482
So first of all, it's really helpful for training, right?

727
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:50,444
You can pull down shadows of competent, experienced teams, highly rated shadows from good players,

728
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:53,045
that sort of thing, and use them for a training gauntlet.

729
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:58,266
You can also kind of have a very gradual difficulty ramp going up through those where you have

730
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:00,707
weaker shadows that's like playing against a weaker player.

731
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:02,633
and then the player goes through the gauntlet

732
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:04,960
and starts playing against better and better players

733
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,247
in order to prepare themselves for online competition.

734
00:37:08,283 --> 00:37:11,664
content generation for tutorials very much the same way.

735
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:14,405
If you want to teach a player how to deal with projectiles,

736
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:18,106
one of the best ways to do that is to make an opponent

737
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:20,106
that throws a bunch of projectiles at him

738
00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:22,207
and let him learn how to defeat that opponent.

739
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,708
And you can do that just by having a designer play the game

740
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:28,068
to create those AIs that rush down or throw projectiles

741
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:32,129
or run away that are very aggressive or very defensive

742
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:33,470
or have any number of behaviors

743
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,030
that we can basically imagine.

744
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,701
It can also help with single player difficulty, right?

745
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:41,022
You can start people out in the campaign mode

746
00:37:41,022 --> 00:37:42,282
with fighting against opponents

747
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:43,463
who not only play like humans,

748
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:45,564
but are at an appropriate difficulty level

749
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:46,924
for beginner players.

750
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:48,905
And then slowly, gradually ramp that up.

751
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:52,687
And you could even pull down from the cloud,

752
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,728
from the crowdsourced AI,

753
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:56,989
you could have actual players' data

754
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:58,710
being pulled into your single player mode,

755
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,371
forming the bosses and opponents and enemies

756
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:02,912
that now the player is learning to fight against.

757
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,411
Another thing that's really cool with this

758
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,413
is self-reflection, giving players the ability

759
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,075
to play against themselves,

760
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,857
identify what their own weaknesses might be.

761
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,759
Also, if you're online and there's no one else

762
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,221
to play against, there's gaps in the matchmaking pool,

763
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:19,864
you can pull down shadows and have players play against them

764
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,106
while they're waiting on players to show up.

765
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:25,528
You could even have players drop in and drop out of matches like that.

766
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:31,933
So if I see that my friend is playing against my shadow, I could jump in and take over for it and beat him up.

767
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:37,657
And similarly, if my connection drops or I have to quit the game, my power goes out, whatever,

768
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:42,400
my opponent's experience doesn't have to be interrupted because my shadow could take over for me

769
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,062
and could seamlessly pick up and start resuming the fight.

770
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,223
Finally, some stuff that's interesting and kind of theoretical about this, nothing is stopping us from combining replay banks from different players.

771
00:38:54,223 --> 00:39:00,886
So you can kind of create a Frankenstein monster that has the head of one player and the legs of another player by combining data from their matches.

772
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:13,712
So if you have a bunch of top players in the community and people want to see, you know, what if we had someone with the execution of Justin Wong and the aggressive tendencies of Alex Valle or whoever your famous players are in your communities,

773
00:39:13,712 --> 00:39:14,493
you could combine them.

774
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:18,394
combine those people together and let people play against those kind of mixes.

775
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:22,776
And then finally, there's potential to have AI-only tournaments.

776
00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:23,996
And these can be running 24-7.

777
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:29,318
Players could bet on them, wager on them, or train up their own shadows in order to

778
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:32,479
enter them into these tournaments for prizes.

779
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:35,600
So these are just some ideas that we had of things that could be done with this system.

780
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,481
And we're really excited to see what ideas you guys come up with to do with something

781
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:39,962
like this.

782
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:43,679
So of course another thing that I'd like to mention

783
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,880
is that it wasn't just Bruce and I that was working on this.

784
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,581
There was a great team at Iron Galaxy

785
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:49,463
supporting and helping us develop this.

786
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:51,324
We want to give a shout out to all of those guys,

787
00:39:51,324 --> 00:39:53,265
many of whom are in the front row up here right now,

788
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,947
and just say thank you so much

789
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:56,227
for all of your help and support.

790
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,328
We couldn't have done it without you.

791
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:57,368
Uh.

792
00:39:57,368 --> 00:39:57,468
Ha ha.

793
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:57,568
Ha ha.

794
00:39:57,568 --> 00:39:57,708
Ha ha.

795
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:57,829
Ha ha.

796
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:58,449
Ha ha.

797
00:39:58,449 --> 00:39:58,529
Ha ha.

798
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:58,949
Ha ha.

799
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:08,276
Ha ha.

800
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:08,516
Ha ha.

801
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:08,736
Ha ha.

802
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:10,157
So with that, we're happy to take questions

803
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:10,918
if anyone has any.

804
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:18,142
Hi, how did you decide how many actions to keep track of

805
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:20,362
for each, I guess, data sample?

806
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:23,963
Are you unifying them, or is it a certain amount of time

807
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,984
or number of actions?

808
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:28,204
For each data sample?

809
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:31,805
For each data, so you know that the player saw some situation,

810
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,626
and they did a couple of moves.

811
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:36,646
They did three, four moves, or they only did one move.

812
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:37,186
They just jumped.

813
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:39,447
And how do you decide how much of that

814
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:42,608
to store and replay back for that particular scenario?

815
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:45,592
Yeah, so we didn't decide.

816
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:48,676
So basically, it seems kind of terrible,

817
00:40:48,676 --> 00:40:53,383
but you can have 90% of the data could be locomotions

818
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,586
or something like that, for example.

819
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,990
We aren't doing anything where we basically look at.

820
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:01,833
The fact that you have a bunch of strings of locomotion,

821
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,015
so we start to compress it by throwing out a bunch of them

822
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:04,796
or anything like that.

823
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,718
One of the reasons that we don't do that is it

824
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:10,561
starts making it so that we have to do more explicit modeling.

825
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:11,822
So in the case of locomotions, it

826
00:41:11,822 --> 00:41:13,744
seems like it might be simple.

827
00:41:13,744 --> 00:41:16,326
But lots of times, if you're doing a locomotion,

828
00:41:16,326 --> 00:41:20,090
are you engaging in some sort of high level play or plan

829
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,371
or something like that?

830
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:23,893
Are you staying carefully out of range,

831
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:25,214
playing footsies with the enemy?

832
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:28,536
So because we didn't want to do that explicit modeling,

833
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:30,497
it sort of just captures everything.

834
00:41:30,497 --> 00:41:33,698
Another reason for this is kind of just the whole idea

835
00:41:33,698 --> 00:41:37,199
of just playing back whole parts of a replay.

836
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,101
Because things like the exact frame timing of things

837
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:44,042
are so important for correct execution of combos

838
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:46,963
and stuff like that, compressing together multiple sequences

839
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:50,124
into the same sequences poses certain challenges.

840
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:51,985
Not that it's impossible or anything like that,

841
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:54,526
but there were worries that we had that made it

842
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:55,407
so that we didn't do it.

843
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,998
So just real quick, when do you stop then?

844
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,918
Because you don't play back the whole match.

845
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,579
Let's say you play back five moves,

846
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,959
and when do you switch to some other situation?

847
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:04,199
Oh, OK.

848
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,199
I see what you're saying.

849
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,260
I see what you're saying.

850
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,340
So you can imagine that there is a certain weight given

851
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,301
to the current situation.

852
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:17,802
So we're calculating a score, basically,

853
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,802
of the current situation for the current plan

854
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:21,282
compared to all the other things that you

855
00:42:21,282 --> 00:42:23,002
could be doing at the moment.

856
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:24,863
Obviously, there's lots of situations.

857
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:28,246
In our specific game, there's lots of situations

858
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,908
where you just don't want to interrupt anything.

859
00:42:30,908 --> 00:42:32,850
But where you're in a situation where

860
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,651
you might want to interrupt kind of your current plan,

861
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:36,212
it's just sort of a weight comparison

862
00:42:36,212 --> 00:42:39,635
against the score of the different possibilities

863
00:42:39,635 --> 00:42:40,516
that you might be interested in.

864
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:40,776
Testing.

865
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:41,036
Testing.

866
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:41,616
Yeah.

867
00:42:41,616 --> 00:42:42,237
I think it was on.

868
00:42:42,237 --> 00:42:43,758
Does that answer the question?

869
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:43,938
Yeah.

870
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:44,118
I think.

871
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,340
So, A, are you aware of salty bets?

872
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:50,720
Yes.

873
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,280
Okay.

874
00:42:51,280 --> 00:43:00,466
And B, do you envision not having to ever go back to zero now that you have all of this

875
00:43:00,466 --> 00:43:06,510
data that is on this title, but basically you now have your encyclopedia for the next

876
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:13,014
title, and what points do you think that you'd actually have to hard reset in order to clear

877
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:14,935
the slate, and how much is that?

878
00:43:15,336 --> 00:43:20,384
Coloring is is that positive or negative that you're going to have to worry about for future titles?

879
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:20,584
Yeah

880
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:25,933
We kind of are worrying about this right now just because our we have a game that kind of has lots of

881
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:26,814
game balance patches

882
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:33,271
So the way that we are handling it is maybe not ideal,

883
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:36,813
but basically, shadows kind of prefer data

884
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:38,454
that they've done recently.

885
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:40,915
So if we throw out another patch,

886
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:44,298
and some stuff is kind of gameplay breaking,

887
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:46,319
so some setups and some combos don't work anymore.

888
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,680
It's almost like your shadow will sort of stop using them

889
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,261
because you'll still be playing the game

890
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:53,621
and showing your shadow examples of how

891
00:43:53,621 --> 00:43:55,282
to do things the right way.

892
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:58,423
So over time, sort of the old bad data will get pushed out,

893
00:43:58,423 --> 00:44:01,404
and the new fresh data will get pushed in.

894
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:04,805
There's weaknesses with that approach, obviously,

895
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:07,366
but it's what we're working with right now.

896
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,381
Hey man, how do you handle asymmetry?

897
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,823
So for example, all the examples you had

898
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:14,425
was a character training against itself.

899
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:18,489
So how do you train against different characters?

900
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,472
So that's a really good question.

901
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:24,776
So with the way the system is currently set up,

902
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:30,209
All the data is recorded specifically per matchup.

903
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,251
So that means that the data that you

904
00:44:33,251 --> 00:44:36,374
have in a Jago versus Jago situation

905
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,515
is specific to the Jago versus Jago situation.

906
00:44:38,515 --> 00:44:42,779
And the data that you have in a Jago versus Orchid situation

907
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:44,380
is specific for that situation.

908
00:44:46,322 --> 00:44:49,023
So that doesn't mean that data doesn't translate at all.

909
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,166
It's just something that we've done to be able to better

910
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:58,530
capture very match-up-specific behaviors that players do.

911
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:03,033
That being said, we have an onboarding experience

912
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:07,175
where you fight basically against Dojo Master Jago.

913
00:45:07,175 --> 00:45:11,598
And he only has data fighting against another Jago player.

914
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,091
players, when they're starting out a Shadow of any type,

915
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:16,392
play against him.

916
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:18,633
And he more or less works.

917
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,654
He's still able to play competently and everything

918
00:45:21,654 --> 00:45:22,695
like that.

919
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:26,897
It's just that he doesn't have specific strategies

920
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:28,417
against all the different matchups.

921
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:32,399
Hey, can you talk a little bit about the size of data

922
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,980
that represents a Shadow?

923
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,383
Yeah, so probably from each match,

924
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:40,163
you can get around.

925
00:45:42,728 --> 00:45:47,772
up to, say, 800 different events or something like that.

926
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:53,717
And we probably, in aggregate, have somewhere between 20,000

927
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:57,320
to 40,000 events that we're considering per shadow

928
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,741
when it's running live.

929
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:02,424
So in the grand scheme of things, maybe not that large.

930
00:46:02,424 --> 00:46:02,644
Thank you.

931
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:09,329
So you talked a little bit about how it kind of learns

932
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:10,930
and it scales up as you get better,

933
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,512
and it kind of keeps you getting better.

934
00:46:13,512 --> 00:46:17,235
But as a player, what if you are, for example,

935
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:19,477
testing out a new shadow, and it already

936
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,099
knows how to fight that shadow.

937
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:22,700
But let's say your friend is playing,

938
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,102
and they're not very good.

939
00:46:25,102 --> 00:46:27,063
Is it able to scale down as well?

940
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:30,907
Yeah, so if you do something like give the controller

941
00:46:30,907 --> 00:46:32,708
to your mom or something like that,

942
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:35,450
or put the controller down and walk away.

943
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,559
you're going to hurt your shadow a bit, basically.

944
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:42,422
So it will even pick up things like standing around,

945
00:46:42,422 --> 00:46:47,246
or just jumping around, or just doing crazy things, basically.

946
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:50,689
Like, you can just go on live and encounter

947
00:46:50,689 --> 00:46:54,913
a shadow that just does nothing but run away from you and jump.

948
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:55,133
So.

949
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:57,730
There's a question there of, should we

950
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,351
detect these bad shadows and throw them away?

951
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,751
But right now, we're not doing any of that,

952
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:05,252
and we're not trying to say, oh, is this good data,

953
00:47:05,252 --> 00:47:06,893
or do we want to throw out this data?

954
00:47:06,893 --> 00:47:09,273
Basically, the players control over the process.

955
00:47:09,273 --> 00:47:10,974
At the end of a match, a player can say,

956
00:47:10,974 --> 00:47:12,415
OK, I want to keep this data, or I

957
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:14,415
don't want to keep this data.

958
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,216
So it's sort of a player's decision

959
00:47:16,216 --> 00:47:19,717
if they want to save the game when their mom played it

960
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:20,477
or something like that.

961
00:47:20,961 --> 00:47:28,483
Okay, so basically you get the choice of whether or not you keep what you currently tested with and fought the shadow with,

962
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:34,885
or you can choose something else later, so that way if you wanted to keep your mom's play session against the shadow,

963
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:40,107
you could keep that simpler AI versus something maybe where you're more skilled.

964
00:47:40,415 --> 00:47:43,037
Yeah, just to be clear about the process,

965
00:47:43,037 --> 00:47:44,098
right now it's only additive.

966
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:49,061
So you can't go back and then just pick these three

967
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:53,084
replays in the past, even though that's technically possible.

968
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:55,506
The interface doesn't allow for that.

969
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:57,307
It's just after you record a match, you can say,

970
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,789
do I want to append this to my shadow data, essentially.

971
00:47:58,789 --> 00:47:58,909
OK, OK.

972
00:47:58,909 --> 00:47:59,189
Thank you.

973
00:47:59,189 --> 00:48:04,153
What's the performance hit doing all those, I guess,

974
00:48:04,153 --> 00:48:06,614
lookups or whatever the mechanism is

975
00:48:06,614 --> 00:48:09,276
versus a traditional behavior tree or something else?

976
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:21,133
It's probably going to be very dependent on how large that behavior tree and everything

977
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:28,375
is, but in this particular case for our system, it's running in under a millisecond in Xbox

978
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:34,156
One, even when there are, say, a fully trained shadow, like a mature shadow that has 20,000

979
00:48:34,156 --> 00:48:38,517
to 40,000 or whatever different things that it's considering at a time.

980
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:41,383
Maybe not something that's possible

981
00:48:41,383 --> 00:48:44,706
when you have 40 shadows running,

982
00:48:44,706 --> 00:48:47,970
unless it's very highly optimized.

983
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,233
But I think it's definitely possible to,

984
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:52,895
if it's something that you really,

985
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:55,718
if you really want to use this with a bunch of characters,

986
00:48:55,718 --> 00:48:57,940
I think you can get it to run fast.

987
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,002
I think it's cheaper than doing

988
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,004
like animation sampling, for example.

989
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:02,551
Thank you.

990
00:49:02,551 --> 00:49:02,731
Cool.

991
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,494
So I'm going to get a little mathy.

992
00:49:05,494 --> 00:49:08,596
So I was curious if the choice of the best move,

993
00:49:08,596 --> 00:49:10,898
whether it was the best move or was it probabilistic,

994
00:49:10,898 --> 00:49:13,019
so that you had a little bit of randomness.

995
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:13,940
What was your choice there?

996
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,360
Yeah.

997
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:19,985
So basically, you calculate all these scores

998
00:49:19,985 --> 00:49:24,068
for all the replay segments that you have.

999
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:27,834
And then you can imagine like you have

1000
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,816
a sorted list of scores, right?

1001
00:49:29,816 --> 00:49:33,399
So there's a question of if I have something where,

1002
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:35,521
say I have a situation where I have two scores

1003
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:38,063
that have the value zero.

1004
00:49:38,063 --> 00:49:40,445
Or I have a bunch of scores that are just sort of

1005
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,887
different by very, very small amounts.

1006
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:45,309
Do I want to just sort of pick the one that maybe

1007
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:47,231
is kind of by accident the smallest score?

1008
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:49,853
Or do I want to sort of randomly select between them?

1009
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,635
So what we do basically is we,

1010
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:57,944
we basically find the smallest score, the best score,

1011
00:49:57,944 --> 00:50:01,025
and then we sort of pick randomly from a neighborhood

1012
00:50:01,025 --> 00:50:01,746
around that score.

1013
00:50:01,746 --> 00:50:06,588
So you could imagine that everything

1014
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:10,290
that's within 10% of that best score is kind of fair game.

1015
00:50:11,503 --> 00:50:14,226
And then, as an aside, the score itself,

1016
00:50:14,226 --> 00:50:16,469
I think you said it wasn't like a Euclidean distance.

1017
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:18,172
You just added up all the individual scores.

1018
00:50:18,172 --> 00:50:19,894
Is there a reason why you went with that instead

1019
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:21,196
of like a traditional Euclidean distance?

1020
00:50:21,196 --> 00:50:24,320
When I was saying Euclidean, I just meant for that.

1021
00:50:25,267 --> 00:50:28,147
just thinking about it as like Euclidean distance.

1022
00:50:28,147 --> 00:50:30,868
But there's no reason behind that.

1023
00:50:30,868 --> 00:50:34,709
The reason why we're doing this stuff this way

1024
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:36,209
is kind of just borrowing.

1025
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:39,250
If you want to look up more about the people that

1026
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,030
sort of did this stuff for real, search

1027
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,231
for instance-based learning or case-based reasoning.

1028
00:50:43,231 --> 00:50:46,251
It's something people have been doing for 40 years,

1029
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,132
but just hasn't really, I guess, found its way that much

1030
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:50,372
into games.

1031
00:50:50,372 --> 00:50:51,473
Bye.

1032
00:50:53,013 --> 00:50:55,334
Yeah, if you dig into that, then you can actually see

1033
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:57,954
what the technical definition of similarity is

1034
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,895
and stuff like that, and whether or not it's a real metric

1035
00:50:59,895 --> 00:51:01,455
and that kind of thing.

1036
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:04,156
Yeah, in machine learning, you usually end up

1037
00:51:04,156 --> 00:51:06,037
picking just the squared distance instead,

1038
00:51:06,037 --> 00:51:07,837
because that's typically an L2 thing.

1039
00:51:07,837 --> 00:51:09,118
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1040
00:51:09,118 --> 00:51:09,578
Cool, thanks.

1041
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:12,598
Hi.

1042
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:15,420
For games of sort of a different nature, say a card game,

1043
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,202
where your game state is less continuous

1044
00:51:18,202 --> 00:51:23,445
and it's more discrete but with a lot more different actions,

1045
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:27,828
would you suggest using the shadow system to develop an AI?

1046
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:30,850
Or is your data going to be too sparse because

1047
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,891
of the number of unique scenarios you get into?

1048
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,233
And would you rather do, would you

1049
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:38,534
suggest something more like a simple min-maxing

1050
00:51:38,534 --> 00:51:41,156
over optimal game states?

1051
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,578
Yeah, I guess I don't really have,

1052
00:51:44,578 --> 00:51:46,018
maybe Derek has a better intuition.

1053
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:48,939
Yeah, so I definitely think this approach could

1054
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,700
be used to do a card game.

1055
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:56,521
But because in most card games, the number

1056
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:59,162
of options that are available to the player is relatively small,

1057
00:51:59,162 --> 00:52:00,762
it's not too hard to simulate forward

1058
00:52:00,762 --> 00:52:02,803
like a large number of turns or something

1059
00:52:02,803 --> 00:52:04,303
and could then compare those.

1060
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:07,204
So because the space that you're dealing with is pretty small,

1061
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:08,685
I think it's probably unnecessary.

1062
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:10,765
but you could definitely get something like this

1063
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:13,345
working in a card game if there were traits

1064
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:15,666
about personality that your card game might capture.

1065
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:19,627
So where it would be most useful is if different players

1066
00:52:19,627 --> 00:52:21,527
had different options that would show them

1067
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:23,847
as being aggressively bluffing or something like that,

1068
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:26,348
or being very conservative or very defensive.

1069
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:29,208
Then a system like this could help capture those behaviors

1070
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,449
that might be hard to, you'd otherwise have to do

1071
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,949
some explicit modeling to try and create

1072
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:35,590
different types of AIs that play that way.

1073
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,235
But if all you're interested in is in getting an opponent

1074
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:42,040
in a card game that plays kind of well,

1075
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,185
I think it's probably good enough to just do a search tree

1076
00:52:45,185 --> 00:52:47,669
and find a good resulting board state

1077
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:48,991
and then go with that line of play.

1078
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:49,211
Thanks.

1079
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:54,267
Thank you for the talk, it's very informative.

1080
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:55,609
It's kind of a two-part question.

1081
00:52:55,609 --> 00:53:00,994
The first one is you mentioned significant situations that get captured

1082
00:53:00,994 --> 00:53:05,418
and then you capture the behavior at that point.

1083
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:07,820
How do you define what a significant change is?

1084
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:12,365
Are there numeric sliders for each metric, like angle of view or distance,

1085
00:53:12,365 --> 00:53:16,168
or is it some other more specifically programmatic process?

1086
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:28,363
So it's a fully manual process where you have to rely on the intuition of somebody that's really familiar with the game.

1087
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:36,208
Derek is basically an ex-tournament player, and he was the design guy on this.

1088
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:40,911
So he knew, oh, we should probably be tracking distance or something like that.

1089
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:46,271
Yeah, so what we wound up doing was actually setting values

1090
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:49,492
for each of the different states that constituted

1091
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,512
a big divergence, right?

1092
00:53:51,512 --> 00:53:53,353
So for example, not everything that we track

1093
00:53:53,353 --> 00:53:55,353
is a numerical metric.

1094
00:53:55,353 --> 00:53:58,054
So for example, we have the current player state.

1095
00:53:58,054 --> 00:53:59,614
Is he standing up or is he knocked down, right?

1096
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:03,155
And so the weight that's associated with those is very high.

1097
00:54:03,155 --> 00:54:05,376
And then we bias, the way we continue playing back

1098
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:07,956
a sequence of actions is we add a bias

1099
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:09,656
to the next action that's in sequence.

1100
00:54:10,197 --> 00:54:13,243
And so when the deviation in those other metrics

1101
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:16,109
based on their weights is bigger than that bias,

1102
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:17,792
then it will naturally break and cause it

1103
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:19,115
to select a different action.

1104
00:54:19,364 --> 00:54:20,065
Okay, thank you.

1105
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:26,390
And the other one, do you think there's like a market for gamers of all levels, amateur,

1106
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:33,635
intermediate, pro, super expert, to become kind of pseudo developers in that they'll

1107
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:38,439
play the game and the game AI when it's launched will just mimic the behavior of them?

1108
00:54:38,439 --> 00:54:39,840
So it's like you're playing as a real human.

1109
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:43,090
Yeah, not only that, I think there's potential for players

1110
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:46,914
to use tools like this to create community tutorials,

1111
00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:50,158
to create community training content or challenges,

1112
00:54:50,158 --> 00:54:52,500
things like that, where they could deliberately train an AI

1113
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,103
that has certain behavior, and then that could go out

1114
00:54:55,103 --> 00:54:56,725
as a challenge for other players to play.

1115
00:54:56,725 --> 00:54:59,728
So I think there is a lot of potential for the community

1116
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:02,251
to develop content using systems like this.

1117
00:55:02,489 --> 00:55:07,952
Yeah, so right now, obviously, it's kind of just a process

1118
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:09,133
where we're sort of doing it almost

1119
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:10,614
in the background for them,

1120
00:55:10,614 --> 00:55:13,835
but it could be a more sort of driven process

1121
00:55:13,835 --> 00:55:16,377
where we could prompt players to do specific activities

1122
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:18,518
at a certain point in time,

1123
00:55:18,518 --> 00:55:20,259
and basically do things that would help us

1124
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:21,880
curate the shadows a lot better.

1125
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,354
Thank you.

1126
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:27,738
How do you handle strategies at different time scales?

1127
00:55:27,738 --> 00:55:29,782
So you might decide, for the next minute,

1128
00:55:29,782 --> 00:55:32,047
I really need to focus on attacking this one guy.

1129
00:55:32,047 --> 00:55:33,229
But then during that minute, you're

1130
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,952
going to switch tactics depending

1131
00:55:34,952 --> 00:55:35,714
on what they're doing.

1132
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:39,821
Right, right, so most of that is captured by heuristics.

1133
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:43,324
So for example, somebody that has a lot of insight

1134
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:45,086
into the game like Derek can say,

1135
00:55:45,086 --> 00:55:47,027
okay, something that's important for my shadow

1136
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:49,149
to keep in mind throughout the course of a match

1137
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:52,972
is how often my opponent is blocking high versus low,

1138
00:55:52,972 --> 00:55:55,755
or how often he's doing reversals on wake up.

1139
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:58,377
So you come up with this heuristic

1140
00:55:58,377 --> 00:56:01,940
and basically just a way of tracking fluctuating value

1141
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,642
throughout a match and recording it.

1142
00:56:04,782 --> 00:56:06,824
in addition to all the other world saves I've done.

1143
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:10,947
OK, so you're never combining different replays.

1144
00:56:10,947 --> 00:56:12,548
So when you switch to a new replay,

1145
00:56:12,548 --> 00:56:14,749
it doesn't remember what it was replaying before.

1146
00:56:15,422 --> 00:56:18,023
So it doesn't remember what it was replaying before,

1147
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:20,684
but it remembers the heuristic summaries

1148
00:56:20,684 --> 00:56:21,965
of what's been going on in the match.

1149
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:24,206
So that's how it keeps track of the higher-level strategy.

1150
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:26,947
Yeah, which includes what it's been doing before.

1151
00:56:26,947 --> 00:56:27,987
So it knows how many fireballs it's

1152
00:56:27,987 --> 00:56:31,269
thrown because it's keeping track of basically a fireball

1153
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:32,389
count as part of the world state.

1154
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,091
And it knows that when the fireball count is high,

1155
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,611
you tend to do these kinds of actions.

1156
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:38,172
Or when the fireball count is low,

1157
00:56:38,172 --> 00:56:39,653
you tend to do these kinds of actions.

1158
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:41,933
So if it's done a lot of actions in the past that

1159
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:43,754
are fireballs, and the player has a habit where

1160
00:56:43,754 --> 00:56:46,255
he tends to throw a bunch and then rush in,

1161
00:56:46,255 --> 00:56:48,416
it'll know that history of it's already

1162
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:49,356
thrown a lot of fireballs.

1163
00:56:49,356 --> 00:56:51,257
And so it will tend to pick actions

1164
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:53,537
that were done in that state, like running forward

1165
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:54,058
and rushing in.

1166
00:56:54,058 --> 00:56:57,559
OK, so you kind of have to know what likely things that people

1167
00:56:57,559 --> 00:56:59,820
are going to want to keep track of so you can create that world

1168
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,100
state.

1169
00:57:00,638 --> 00:57:02,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you definitely need somebody

1170
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:03,860
that has a lot of intuition in the game.

1171
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,901
With a large enough data set, it might be possible

1172
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:09,262
to identify some of those things programmatically.

1173
00:57:09,262 --> 00:57:11,403
Like you might be able to have some kind of algorithm

1174
00:57:11,403 --> 00:57:13,484
that is able to identify those trends

1175
00:57:13,484 --> 00:57:16,206
rather than having a designer specify them.

1176
00:57:16,206 --> 00:57:18,567
But for this specific implementation,

1177
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:20,948
I specified those heuristics basically.

1178
00:57:20,948 --> 00:57:21,848
All right, thank you.

1179
00:57:23,463 --> 00:57:25,924
Do you think of something inherent to fighting games that

1180
00:57:25,924 --> 00:57:28,704
makes a system like this viable, like presently,

1181
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:30,865
but would make it not viable for something

1182
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:33,566
with a crazy possibility space like RTS, MOBA, et cetera?

1183
00:57:33,566 --> 00:57:38,007
I think that elements of it could

1184
00:57:38,007 --> 00:57:40,928
be used sort of without great difficulty

1185
00:57:40,928 --> 00:57:42,989
kind of in any kind of game.

1186
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:45,950
I don't think, so Derek and I might,

1187
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,750
I think Derek and I actually disagree on this.

1188
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:51,236
I think it would be very challenging, if not impossible,

1189
00:57:51,236 --> 00:57:53,598
to just take this thing and kind of just get it working

1190
00:57:53,598 --> 00:57:55,378
in an RTS without a ton of effort.

1191
00:57:55,378 --> 00:57:58,500
That being said, I do think you could do something

1192
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,761
like use this maybe just for the high-level strategy

1193
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:06,343
selection, or use it for maybe just sort of reactive

1194
00:58:06,343 --> 00:58:08,825
movements in a MOBA or something like that.

1195
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,503
At least if you were going to go ahead and trying to do it,

1196
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:17,266
like with a game that has to ship that's like a MOBA

1197
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:20,349
or something like that, I think that I, to be on the safe side,

1198
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:23,051
would try to sort of target small pieces of the game

1199
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:25,934
like that instead of trying to just use it for everything.

1200
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:28,717
I don't know if you have anything to say about that.

1201
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:41,818
Like Bruce said, I don't actually agree. I think that it's a comparable task personally to implementing it in a MOBA or an RTS or something like that.

1202
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,899
But as Bruce said, use it at your own risk.

1203
00:58:43,899 --> 00:58:44,980
Thank you.

1204
00:58:48,976 --> 00:58:49,156
Hi.

1205
00:58:49,156 --> 00:58:54,762
So if I understood correctly, you're actually

1206
00:58:54,762 --> 00:58:58,066
not doing any kind of utility function for this.

1207
00:58:58,066 --> 00:59:01,449
You're just taking replays, and you're not really

1208
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:05,473
caring too much about the outcome of those options

1209
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:10,178
when evaluating the choices available to shadow, right?

1210
00:59:10,178 --> 00:59:11,380
We're not doing any what?

1211
00:59:11,707 --> 00:59:17,476
utility function. Basically, just comparing the result and seeing, okay, so this combo

1212
00:59:17,476 --> 00:59:23,525
chain dealt a lot more damage, therefore it's useful, or it led to a knockout, so it's going

1213
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:25,268
to leave me in a good spot, things like that.

1214
00:59:25,658 --> 00:59:26,318
Yeah, you're correct.

1215
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:27,659
We're not doing anything like that.

1216
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:31,001
I think it's definitely, once you have this data,

1217
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,522
you definitely could do things like that.

1218
00:59:32,522 --> 00:59:34,163
You definitely could say, OK, we want

1219
00:59:34,163 --> 00:59:37,425
to make shadows that are like the player,

1220
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:40,167
but we're going to throw out a lot of the stupid things

1221
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:42,868
that players do just so it's a better version of the player

1222
00:59:42,868 --> 00:59:44,189
or something like that.

1223
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:46,630
And I can definitely see adding in sort of a.

1224
00:59:47,663 --> 00:59:51,026
things to, you know, oh, that combo does really low damage,

1225
00:59:51,026 --> 00:59:52,047
so we're just gonna throw it out.

1226
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,509
Or once you do this certain sequence of actions,

1227
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:56,351
it always leads to your shadow getting hit,

1228
00:59:56,351 --> 00:59:57,752
so we throw out that sequence of actions.

1229
00:59:57,752 --> 00:59:59,794
I think that's definitely something that you could do

1230
00:59:59,794 --> 01:00:00,995
if you have this data, it's just not something

1231
01:00:00,995 --> 01:00:02,157
that we're doing at the moment.

1232
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,267
Yeah, I'd also just like to point out that it's a very

1233
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:08,309
common technique in AI development to kind of forward

1234
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:11,131
simulate, look at the ending state, and then assign it a

1235
01:00:11,131 --> 01:00:13,472
score and say, was this a good result or a bad result,

1236
01:00:13,472 --> 01:00:14,753
right, and so do I want to do this?

1237
01:00:14,753 --> 01:00:17,315
One of the reasons we really don't want to do that is

1238
01:00:17,315 --> 01:00:20,397
because we're not interested, at least in this case,

1239
01:00:20,397 --> 01:00:22,458
in creating perfect play, right?

1240
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:24,179
We don't want the best result.

1241
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:26,360
We want the most human result, which is kind of by

1242
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,762
definition, whatever a human did in this circumstance,

1243
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:29,242
right?

1244
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:32,205
So at least for our implementation here,

1245
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:35,588
I think it's better for us to just play back

1246
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:39,051
what the people did, rather than trying to figure out

1247
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:41,554
what would have been a better thing than what they did

1248
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,715
to do in this situation.

1249
01:00:42,715 --> 01:00:43,235
All right.

1250
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:44,937
All right, thank you.

1251
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:45,317
All right, thanks.

1252
01:00:45,317 --> 01:00:46,018
Thanks for coming, everyone.
