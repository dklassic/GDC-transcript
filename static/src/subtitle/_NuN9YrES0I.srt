1
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:07,731
All right, this is a quick timeline of my history as a game developer.

2
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:11,374
I worked on small teams, large teams, and all by myself.

3
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:15,477
I've created 17 mobile games as a solo developer, and

4
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:16,858
most of those were self-published.

5
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:21,061
A bunch of icons are probably a terrible way of showing games, so

6
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,843
here are a few games I'll be talking about today.

7
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,966
All right, let's go back here.

8
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:20,089
Okay, so in the middle of last year,

9
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,170
my work at Revival Productions was coming to an end.

10
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,151
I had stopped rating games for about three years

11
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:27,132
to work on a spiritual successor to Descent.

12
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:30,114
I knew I wanted to go back to rating games full-time,

13
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:32,195
but I wasn't sure if I could still make a living

14
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:33,936
doing paid games on mobile like I had in 2014.

15
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,718
When I was looking through my previous games analytics

16
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:40,499
on the App Store, something stood out.

17
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,444
This last column over here, that's the sessions

18
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:45,966
that players have played the game in the last year.

19
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:50,111
And Inferno 2, my best-selling game by a large amount,

20
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:53,194
is actually played three times less than Sliders,

21
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:54,455
which is down near the bottom.

22
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,478
Sliders is an infinite puzzle game,

23
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:58,940
similar to Tetris in a few ways.

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,543
I wanted to make a sequel, and it seemed like a good idea

25
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,924
to make Sliders 2 a free game.

26
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:06,345
So I studied lots of free games and watched lots of videos

27
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:07,746
about how to make free-to-play games.

28
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:09,487
I'll come back to how that worked out

29
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:10,427
for a slide just two later,

30
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,028
but let's step back for a second

31
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,570
and ask why I chose mobile games over other platforms.

32
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:17,551
Actually, the reason is simple.

33
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:21,494
Touch Arcade and Pocket Gamer consistently cover my games,

34
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:23,035
and Apple gives them minor features.

35
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,896
I spent a long time working on Overload

36
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,117
with the guys at Revival.

37
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:28,358
It's an awesome game,

38
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:31,620
but very few people knew about the game,

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,880
and the sales reflect that.

40
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,915
It reminded me how hard it is to get attention,

41
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:38,036
and that I should take whatever attention I can get.

42
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,378
And just for reference, the mobile version of Inferno 2

43
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:44,039
has sold about 50 times better than the PC version.

44
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,221
When people talk about discoverability,

45
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:50,682
they often mention reaching out to content creators

46
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:53,024
and building a community, but not me.

47
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:54,885
I don't like spending time talking to people.

48
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:57,846
I'm not sure there, I'm sure there are other things

49
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,327
that are worth.

50
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:00,882
doing on a game that takes a month.

51
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,024
I'm not sure these things are worth doing

52
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,164
on a game that takes a month or two.

53
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,366
If you make free-to-play games,

54
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,386
you need to make a good game,

55
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:10,307
and you need to do a lot more stuff on top of that.

56
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:13,329
This is just the ASO side of things.

57
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,410
You need to think about the icon, the title,

58
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,871
the screenshots, the description, the video.

59
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,632
You can optimize those things.

60
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:21,733
This is stuff I don't want to do.

61
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:23,894
I don't want to spend time doing anything, really,

62
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:25,054
besides making a game.

63
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:26,355
So I just do a good first pass,

64
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:28,436
and I don't spend any time refining.

65
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,741
But if you want to do well with free games,

66
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,282
you should be doing this stuff.

67
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:36,245
So if I don't like spending time on major aspects

68
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:38,166
of making my game successful, why am I up here?

69
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:42,069
My goal is not to make the most amount of money possible

70
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:42,730
with my games.

71
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,172
My goal is to make as many good games as I can before I die.

72
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:47,193
Like that's my goal in life.

73
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,294
That's my bucket list is to make lots of good games.

74
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,817
So I've made that the core of my strategy.

75
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,478
Like I basically say.

76
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:58,004
If I make lots of games that are decent,

77
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,587
people will follow me and then they'll buy more of my games

78
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:02,628
and I can keep making games.

79
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:07,071
So first I create lots of small titles quickly.

80
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,392
I have lots of experience.

81
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:09,593
I'm able to focus.

82
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:10,614
I'm impatient.

83
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:15,657
The next game is always appealing to me.

84
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,399
That's the fun part of game development

85
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,219
is working on the games.

86
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,781
Then I create all the stuff that I don't enjoy doing,

87
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,003
though I do enjoy making trailers, more or less,

88
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:24,344
except for the capturing the footage part.

89
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:28,225
Then around launch, I email about a dozen press people

90
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:30,026
and do some social media posts.

91
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:33,327
And I usually contain this to a dozen people

92
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:34,007
because those are the people

93
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:35,368
who consistently cover my games.

94
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:37,769
I usually spend about a day promoting the game

95
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:39,010
when it's about to launch.

96
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,951
And the days after the launch,

97
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,292
I usually update the game to deal with feedback

98
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:44,712
and refine it based on reviews.

99
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:46,573
And then I move on as fast as possible.

100
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:50,915
I'm usually excited to work on something new.

101
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,456
In fact, I've probably worked on the new game for...

102
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,723
the next game for a week by the time the previous one is released.

103
00:04:57,684 --> 00:05:01,528
This cycle does not include contacting people at the App Store or Google Play.

104
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,069
I've never talked to those people.

105
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,874
But obviously they see the games on Touch Arcade and Pocket Gamer because I would say

106
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:11,478
like 15 of the 17 games I've released on the App Store have been featured.

107
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,501
The only forums I use are Touch Arcades.

108
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,023
I just respond to the people there because they like my games.

109
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,750
And then I also do a weekly blog post,

110
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,931
but it's more for me than anyone else

111
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,872
because it just helps me sort out my thoughts.

112
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:28,194
And this is what happens when I get into a good cycle.

113
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:31,656
This is the sales chart from my iPhone releases in 2014.

114
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:34,698
It's not very impressive,

115
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:36,539
but keep in mind that the Android versions

116
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,180
were adding a decent multiplier on top.

117
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,181
I didn't realize it at the time,

118
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,922
but I averaged $10,000 a month

119
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,223
between these four releases on those two platforms.

120
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,062
And my next game was Inferno 2, which outsold all these games combined.

121
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:53,827
Stopping to do another interesting project is one way to screw up the cycle,

122
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:55,248
and that's what happened with Inferno 2.

123
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:56,949
But there are other ways to do it.

124
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,911
You can also do your trailer too early,

125
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,814
and you end up making a second one, like I did with Scorcher.

126
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:06,217
You get too ambitious, and you end up with an alpha trailer early on,

127
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:09,440
and then nothing close to a finished game, like Gigatron,

128
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,341
because I ran out of money.

129
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,316
or you can usually end up doing too much at once,

130
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:14,897
and it's hard to finish something

131
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:16,458
when you're doing multiple things at once.

132
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:18,538
I can usually handle two projects at once,

133
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,039
one that's starting and one that's finishing,

134
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,180
but I can't handle more than that.

135
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,940
I have trouble.

136
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,442
So keep in mind that I make arcade-y action and puzzle games.

137
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:30,263
My deeper and more relaxed action games

138
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,244
that I've actually sold better,

139
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:33,465
well, that usually involves more complexity

140
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:34,425
and a longer dev cycle.

141
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,148
Many other genres are actually better suited

142
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:38,769
to paid games for small developers,

143
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,810
such as adventure games, role-playing games,

144
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:42,392
and other story-based experiences.

145
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:44,994
I'm not against doing larger games,

146
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:47,395
but all my games have either been less than two months

147
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,576
or more than 10 months.

148
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,298
Something in between is probably the sweet spot for me,

149
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,919
and I'll try to aim for that in the future.

150
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,563
Now everyone knows that free games are winning the battle

151
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,744
for market share, and paid games are going extinct.

152
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,626
This graph is from three years ago.

153
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:02,126
It's 92 to 8%.

154
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,532
And it's only gotten farther than that since then.

155
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,815
Very few developers are making only paid games on mobile.

156
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:10,696
And the main reason,

157
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,579
these are screen caps of today's top charts

158
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,841
with a grossing chart on the right.

159
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:19,142
Minecraft is a top selling paid game

160
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:21,284
and it's ranked number 62 in the grossing chart.

161
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:26,228
The next game after Minecraft is ranked number 224.

162
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:29,010
And this chart doesn't measure ad revenue,

163
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:30,151
just in-app purchases.

164
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:32,915
So there's plenty of ad-based games that are way above

165
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:34,235
Bloon's TD6.

166
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,457
There's no question paid games are a bad idea if you're

167
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:38,437
trying to make a lot of money.

168
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,219
If that's your only goal, you should make free games.

169
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,299
And I'll get back to that.

170
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,641
Let's see how paid games have done for rating games over the

171
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:46,381
past seven years.

172
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:52,344
Inferno Plus is the third game I launched as rating games and

173
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:53,265
my most successful of 2012.

174
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:57,267
It got some press coverage, but no Apple feature that I

175
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:57,727
can remember.

176
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:01,311
It wasn't a significant launch, but it's had a pretty long tail

177
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,372
because it's a pretty good game.

178
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:07,818
After moderate success in 2012, converting four games to iOS,

179
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:10,301
I spent about 10 months on a larger game called Bomb Cats.

180
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,845
It was a huge disaster and the most stress

181
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,306
I felt as a developer in my life.

182
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,829
It's still painful to talk about, to be honest,

183
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,471
but just search my blog if you want to learn more.

184
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:20,012
Let's move on.

185
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:25,030
After Bombcat's failure, Crush was a desperate attempt

186
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,751
to get some money back while I also worked on Android ports

187
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,391
of all my games.

188
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:31,632
It was a pretty simple game, so I tried launching it at $0.99

189
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:33,653
to see if maybe $0.99 games were better for me,

190
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,473
because all my previous games had been $1.99.

191
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:39,074
It was my fifth solo release, and I still

192
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:41,635
couldn't break the top 200 in the paid game sales charts.

193
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:45,456
The Android ports ended up doing pretty well,

194
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:48,157
and I signed a contract to work on a game with Cartoon Network.

195
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:49,557
So Raiding Games was able to continue

196
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:50,678
despite Bombcat's failure.

197
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,911
After the Powerpuff Girls game,

198
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,092
which was another 10-month project like Bomb Cats,

199
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:57,532
I went back to smaller games.

200
00:08:58,532 --> 00:09:00,112
Joy Joy was the second release in 2014,

201
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,393
and probably the start of what I would call

202
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,453
the golden era of rating games releases.

203
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:06,754
I got the usual amount of coverage

204
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,374
and some actual good featuring by Apple for the first time.

205
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:13,755
It had a solid launch week and my first game

206
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:16,235
to break the top 200 in the paid sales games charts.

207
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:20,396
Fluid came the month after with pretty consistent results.

208
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,003
June had fewer game releases that year,

209
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,224
so even though it sold less,

210
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:25,925
Fluid got a higher ranking on the charts.

211
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:28,667
I'm gonna tie all these rankings together at the end,

212
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,168
so you'll see why I'm covering that.

213
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:34,290
Super CrossFighter, same year, another month later,

214
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,491
also got good coverage.

215
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:38,432
It was a remaster of a game I did three years before that,

216
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:40,434
but it still got featured by Apple,

217
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,275
and it had a sales spike the week after

218
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:44,416
because it was released a little bit in a weird time.

219
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:47,778
In my best US sales day so far,

220
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,279
thanks to that feature, and it broke the top 100.

221
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:54,019
Then came Inferno 2, and I finally had my first hit game.

222
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,641
It got the number three slot on the new games list,

223
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:58,762
the highest of all my games.

224
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,604
Notice that it took over 1,000 sales

225
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:04,426
to reach number 44 on the top rankings.

226
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:09,510
In September of the next year, I launched Devastator.

227
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,171
It got a good feature by Apple,

228
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,772
though not quite as good as Inferno 2.

229
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,175
Notice that it reached almost the same paid game sales rank

230
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,496
with under half the number of sales.

231
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:22,383
We can start to see the effect of fewer paid games being released

232
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:24,904
because this game sold way less than Inferno 2,

233
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:26,665
almost got the same ranking.

234
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,387
The sales, of course, dropped off a cliff

235
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:30,988
because this game was way too hard at launch.

236
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:35,491
But it also only took five weeks to make,

237
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,892
so why did it launch 11 months after Inferno 2?

238
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,574
Well, I started working on Overload

239
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:42,795
before I knew how successful Inferno 2 was going to be.

240
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:46,383
I was a huge Descent fan and had worked on Descent 3,

241
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:49,763
so it was a very cool opportunity to work on Overload,

242
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:50,703
a spiritual successor.

243
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:54,784
The next year after Inferno 2 was pretty messy

244
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:55,764
in terms of development,

245
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,204
and was probably my least productive

246
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:58,405
since I started reading games.

247
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:01,985
After Devastator, I went back to Overload

248
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:03,406
with more people helping out,

249
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:05,786
and Revival decided to do a Kickstarter.

250
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:08,066
This was two years after Kickstarter had peaked.

251
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:10,947
These pics are from the Overload Kickstarter campaign

252
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:13,227
when we decided not to shave, until we made it.

253
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,676
It was the second most stressful time in my life

254
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:19,498
as a developer, and we only made it with two hours remaining

255
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:22,740
and it was not worth it, I have to say.

256
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,242
Like we promised so much stuff from the Kickstarter

257
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:27,263
that we ended up taking like a year longer

258
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:28,844
than it would have taken to make the game otherwise.

259
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:31,906
And that year cost way more than what the Kickstarter made.

260
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,229
On the positive side, dissent fans loved the game

261
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:37,470
and I learned a lot about Unity

262
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,272
and became a better programmer because of Overload.

263
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,841
So getting back to paid games, we now fast forward

264
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,743
to my first paid release since Devastator.

265
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:47,804
This game released two weeks ago,

266
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,086
and I have to admit I was a bit worried

267
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:52,067
that it wouldn't make it out in time for this talk.

268
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:55,509
It looks like a normal launch sales curve to me,

269
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,451
except for a bigger than usual Saturday spike

270
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:59,512
thanks to an extra feature on that day.

271
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,754
It's doing about as well as I expected, to be honest.

272
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:05,856
The game stands out visually, but it's also score-focused,

273
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:08,338
and score-focused games don't sell that well

274
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:09,178
in my experience.

275
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,988
They're just a little too hardcore for most people

276
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,809
and it doesn't have quite the same appeal

277
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:14,690
to a broad audience.

278
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,173
It has significantly fewer sales than Inferno 2,

279
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,295
but a much better chart ranking.

280
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:21,576
And this is four years,

281
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,058
four and a half years after Inferno 2 launched.

282
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,601
So let's look back at a bunch of numbers

283
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,102
to see how many downloads it takes

284
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,244
to get a certain slot in the top paid charts.

285
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,066
If you look at the early years versus 2019,

286
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,208
you can see it takes a lot fewer downloads

287
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:37,028
to get into the top.

288
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:41,206
Like number 25 is 664 downloads,

289
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:44,127
and I bet in 2013 that would have been like rank 100.

290
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:52,151
So this chart kind of graphs the approximate sales

291
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:53,712
to chart ranking.

292
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:55,773
It used to take over 200 downloads

293
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:57,914
to get into the top 200 games in 2013.

294
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,576
And now if you get 200 downloads, you'll be in the top 80.

295
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:04,124
The top yellow line shows how many downloads you need

296
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:07,026
to get to reach the top 50, and that's down below,

297
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,369
it's around 300 games now, 300 downloads a day.

298
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,831
So why are the top games selling less?

299
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:16,414
Because people are making less of them.

300
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:18,616
Everyone is making free games,

301
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:20,358
and not many are making paid games.

302
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,360
Because there are more free games,

303
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,781
and many more of them are good,

304
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:27,303
many people are less willing to pay for paid games.

305
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:31,218
To be honest, it's hard to judge based on one game released this year,

306
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:33,880
and I need to release more to make any definite conclusions.

307
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,981
But I don't think paid games are dead, they're just neglected.

308
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:40,623
Now let's look at a comparable free game which released four months ago.

309
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:46,806
This is Slytris 2's launch, which got a similar level of coverage and featuring as Scorcher.

310
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:51,628
The overall revenue is actually very similar to Scorcher's for the first five weeks,

311
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:53,008
just a bit more smoothed out.

312
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,731
Notice that it was getting around 6,000 downloads a day,

313
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,912
but never broke the top 200 in free games.

314
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:04,556
When I said the games had a similar level of featuring,

315
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:05,536
I wasn't underselling it.

316
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,298
They literally had the same slot in the new games list.

317
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,801
And usually I found that the slot on the new games list

318
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:14,922
directly corresponds to how many downloads

319
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:16,543
I'll get for my game, regardless of quality.

320
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,780
I'm not sure if Apple meant to give them the same slot,

321
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,301
but it sure makes for a nice comparison.

322
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:22,741
The games are different,

323
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:27,883
and I'd still expect a reasonably similar sales

324
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:29,664
between the two, so let's compare more directly.

325
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:34,086
These are the first week downloads in the US only

326
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:35,366
with the same featured slot.

327
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,027
Slyder 2 released at a better time of year

328
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:41,108
in late November, but Scorcher had a better bonus feature.

329
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:43,910
I'm not sure this ratio is totally accurate.

330
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,898
But it feels about right to me.

331
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:47,779
And for lower price games,

332
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:49,841
the ratio will be a bit closer than 20 to one.

333
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:52,243
The important thing, aside from the ratio,

334
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:53,744
is where the games ended up on the charts.

335
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:56,566
There are just a lot more free games

336
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:57,686
getting tons of downloads,

337
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:59,768
so it's a lot harder to get onto the top charts there.

338
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,591
Long term, Slydris 2 has continued to do pretty well.

339
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,633
For people who figure out the game,

340
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,135
it's very satisfying and enjoyable to play.

341
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,197
It was my first game to get a significant Apple feature

342
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:13,618
beyond a good launch slot.

343
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,212
It got Game of the Day in the US in January,

344
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,033
a bunch of other countries in February,

345
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:19,633
and then China in March.

346
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,454
It was like getting three extra launches for the game.

347
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:25,854
The best revenue day was actually from the China feature,

348
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:26,874
mostly due to ads.

349
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,475
So here's the total stats for Sliders 2

350
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:32,735
up until last week.

351
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,556
Given the quality of the game and the downloads,

352
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:39,296
these revenue numbers actually seem pretty low.

353
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:42,097
The reason is the retention and ad revenue numbers

354
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:44,057
aren't good enough for a game of this quality.

355
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:46,970
I'm happy with the downloads and overall results,

356
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,810
but I've been lucky.

357
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:50,372
And those numbers up here,

358
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:51,893
especially the ones at the bottom,

359
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,054
they could be even worse, and I'll show you why.

360
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:56,416
This is Pivotal.

361
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,517
This was Touch Arcade's game of the week

362
00:15:58,537 --> 00:15:59,178
the week it came out.

363
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:00,419
It's not a bad game.

364
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,220
It was featured in the New Games We Love list,

365
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,142
and it got quite a few downloads the first week,

366
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:08,104
but it was just a little too hard for people to figure out,

367
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,605
for lots of people to figure out,

368
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:11,126
and not quite as good as Sliders 2.

369
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,487
This is what happens when you don't really know

370
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:14,248
how to make a free game.

371
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:17,087
If it had been paid, I would estimate it would have made

372
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:20,108
three times as much, if not more, than this amount.

373
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:24,689
So making free games is harder than paid games

374
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:25,350
in a few ways.

375
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,731
You have to be more hardcore about ease of use issues,

376
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,932
and refining the UI flow, and keeping things simple.

377
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:34,433
This is the easy stuff, the stuff as a developer

378
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,113
that you can handle.

379
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:38,795
It requires a shift in mentality, but it's not painful.

380
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,116
Now we're getting to the more painful stuff.

381
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:45,095
Doing a free game means you have to think about ads,

382
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:46,835
or in-app purchases, or both.

383
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:49,816
You'll feel more constraints on the genre

384
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,497
and the expected complexity of your game.

385
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:55,138
The game systems will be warped to fit the need

386
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:57,759
to retain users and generate revenue.

387
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,400
Ad-based games need to be simple and easy to get into,

388
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,361
and in-app purchase games need to be deep and content heavy.

389
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:07,542
You also need to be obsessive with your stat tracking.

390
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,471
This page right there, it updates in real time.

391
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,714
You can see every dot pop up for every time

392
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:14,317
someone installs your game or starts your game.

393
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:16,980
And it's kind of, it's not good for your mentality.

394
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,803
I looked at this page multiple times,

395
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:20,145
especially when Sliders 2 launched.

396
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,008
I was like, I can't do this.

397
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:23,590
I can't handle this as a solo developer.

398
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:28,865
So after launch, you'll get emailed by lots of ad companies

399
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,006
offering to boost your revenue,

400
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,227
saying you're not making enough money.

401
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:32,908
Do you use multiple companies

402
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:34,429
or do you stick with one for simplicity?

403
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,051
How much do you negotiate?

404
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:38,433
How much time is required to set up all this stuff

405
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:41,756
to make them negotiate with each other in real time?

406
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:43,817
Then there are the reviews.

407
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,600
Some negative reviews provide critical info

408
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,420
about a bug or issue,

409
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,662
but many others are not as fun to read

410
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,763
and they might be useful,

411
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,305
so you have to suck it up and just read them anyway.

412
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,610
And all that ASO and UA stuff that I mentioned before,

413
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,811
that needs to be done too.

414
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:00,611
Making free games is overwhelming,

415
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:03,052
and I have a simple recommendation if you want to do them.

416
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:09,073
If you don't enjoy obsessing over optimization and stats,

417
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:10,334
get someone to help you.

418
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:13,694
It could be a partner, a publisher,

419
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:15,535
a co-developer, or a consultant.

420
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:17,415
If you're doing free games,

421
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:19,176
I'd almost say this is a requirement.

422
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:21,736
Let someone else who knows what they're doing

423
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:22,917
handle the stuff that sucks.

424
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:25,268
You'll have to share some of the money,

425
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:26,809
but there will probably be a lot more of it.

426
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,331
This is what it feels like to make a paid game in 2019.

427
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:34,032
It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,

428
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:36,293
but you have to go into it with the proper expectations.

429
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:38,393
There are still some players

430
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:39,934
who will love and prefer paid games.

431
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,055
There are lots of them on Touch Arcade.

432
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:45,396
And you'll probably be able to make more of these games

433
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:46,697
if that's important to you.

434
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:52,043
And comparing these two games, Sliders and Scorcher

435
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,284
had similar featuring and revenue numbers

436
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:55,165
in the first few weeks.

437
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,367
It's still too early to tell what the long-term sales will

438
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:00,348
be, and Sliders 2 has had lots of help

439
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,749
after those first five weeks.

440
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,090
But working on Scorcher was more enjoyable,

441
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:06,831
and the launch was way less stressful.

442
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,233
And I would have enjoyed working on Sliders 2

443
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:11,394
more if it were paid and made the same amount of money.

444
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:15,336
I don't like that nagging feeling that I need to keep working on a game.

445
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,760
I like finishing things and feel good about finishing things and moving on to the next

446
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,040
thing.

447
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,402
And I'm always excited about the new game that's coming up.

448
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,482
More game ideas.

449
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:25,364
I finally get to work on this thing.

450
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:32,569
So if you're doing paid games, you probably need to get an Apple feature to be successful.

451
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:33,410
That's not new.

452
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,233
That's been true for eight years, probably.

453
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:41,416
You'll also have a lower cap on the revenue you make, but you might enjoy working on the

454
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:41,837
game more.

455
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,520
There are fewer paid games, but I don't think the good ones

456
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,641
are necessarily selling less,

457
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:47,922
there's just a lot fewer of them.

458
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:52,186
On the other hand, I studied free games for many months

459
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:54,989
before doing Pivotal on Sliders 2, and I still sucked at it.

460
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,252
It takes a certain mentality to do free games well,

461
00:19:58,512 --> 00:19:59,733
and it's hard to do by yourself.

462
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:02,896
Get an expert to help you, and you'll be less stressed

463
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,197
and probably make a lot more money.

464
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm not saying this because I have anything to sell,

465
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,841
I'm not an expert.

466
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:11,446
But I've talked to other developers and other publishers

467
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,127
and other people who do this sort of thing,

468
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:14,987
and I'm like, you guys just know so much more

469
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,948
about this than I do, and you actually want

470
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:18,188
to do that stuff, and I don't.

471
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:22,769
And before I end, I have a couple more quick slides.

472
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,990
Earlier I recommended not doing an early trailer,

473
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,131
but sometimes it works out,

474
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:29,672
if you have the right game and trailer.

475
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:32,772
I have around 2,000 followers on Twitter,

476
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:35,093
but a tweet with the trailer from Speed Demons,

477
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:36,954
which was this game, got over 12,000 views

478
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:37,614
in the first week.

479
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,721
It was the most liked and retweeted thing I've done

480
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,622
by a factor of like five.

481
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:45,723
And it opened up new opportunities for rating games.

482
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:48,965
But it was a risk spending that much time on a trailer

483
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:50,046
that early in development.

484
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:51,907
It just happened to work out this time.

485
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:56,369
Let's take a look at some total sales numbers as well,

486
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,470
because everybody likes stats.

487
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,351
These charts are a few days old,

488
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:01,232
so scorcher sales are a little bit off.

489
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,013
And the free games only show in-app purchases only.

490
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,674
I don't know what happened with Google Play this year,

491
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,015
but it's been sucking for me.

492
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:12,998
Regardless, my better games have had better long-term sales

493
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:14,619
and that's pretty encouraging, I think.

494
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,860
Because if you look at the top charts,

495
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,282
those games have had good reviews in general

496
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,922
and have continued to sell pretty well.

497
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,283
And when a new game comes out,

498
00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:24,364
those are the games that get the bigger boost.

499
00:21:27,406 --> 00:21:28,206
And a little while back,

500
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,167
someone put together a comparison of first week

501
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,389
versus first year sales for a bunch of Steam games.

502
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,811
Simon from GDC asked me to do the same thing for my game.

503
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:37,471
So here are six games in order of release.

504
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:40,395
The ratios are actually lower than I expected,

505
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:44,238
though the revenue numbers are pretty much what I would expect.

506
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:47,040
The biggest two factors in what affects the ratio

507
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,362
are the perceived game quality and style of game

508
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:52,224
leads to better long-term sales, and the games

509
00:21:52,264 --> 00:21:54,386
with the lower ratios usually had better features

510
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,066
in their first week.

511
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,509
Even though Devastator at the bottom has the lowest ratio,

512
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,511
that's because it got a really good feature,

513
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:03,113
and then people really didn't like the hardcoreness of it

514
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:04,754
after it was no longer featured.

515
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,360
So I don't think it's a time thing that affects the ratio.

516
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,542
I think the ratio is still the same over time.

517
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:13,384
And that's it.

518
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,866
And we're just on time, perfect.

519
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,451
So if you have any questions,

520
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:25,672
there's a microphone right there.

521
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:27,793
I'm happy to answer any questions now,

522
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,554
or if you want to talk outside, that's fine too.

523
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:34,438
All right, we got someone coming.

524
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:43,054
So I'm curious, who you recommend getting help from?

525
00:22:43,074 --> 00:22:47,118
Do you have partners that you've enjoyed working with and what do you think?

526
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:51,581
Who would I recommend?

527
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:53,503
Anybody who does free-to-play games.

528
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:55,765
If you have a good game to show off,

529
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:58,387
you could contact any publisher.

530
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:01,290
There's lots of other small developers who are doing

531
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,951
free games and making lots of money.

532
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:04,012
You could contact some of them.

533
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:08,872
Like I'm not one of those guys, but I've had people contact me.

534
00:23:09,532 --> 00:23:11,733
It's not like I've reached, I haven't really reached out to anyone.

535
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:16,414
People will just, if you get your game featured on Apple, people will just email you.

536
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:21,715
And some of them will actually play your game and then like tell you what they like about it

537
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:23,816
and then offer to help you make it better.

538
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:27,276
And I usually don't respond to those things, but some people are more persistent

539
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:32,318
and sometimes they are obviously another developer who has interest in the game.

540
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:32,478
So.

541
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,321
That's what really happened with SlideDress,

542
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:36,163
is multiple people emailed me about it,

543
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:38,804
and it's like, this game should be doing better.

544
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:40,806
I'm like, okay, sure, tell me how.

545
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:44,649
And so, that'll happen eventually, but not right now.

546
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:47,871
Yes.

547
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,155
Since you don't like doing ASO and all that stuff,

548
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:56,157
how discoverability has never been a problem for you?

549
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,599
How would you learn ASO if you've never been a publisher?

550
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:00,245
No, no.

551
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:03,746
Since you never liked doing ESO and doing the screenshots

552
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:06,786
and icons and truly like doing a lot about them,

553
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,847
you always focus on the content of the game.

554
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:12,548
So why discoverability has never been a problem for you?

555
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,689
It's never been a problem because when I first,

556
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:18,829
my first few games weren't actually that successful,

557
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,831
but they got the attention of Touch Arcade consistently.

558
00:24:24,611 --> 00:24:27,292
Like my first game, Fireball,

559
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,572
it hasn't sold that terribly well, but it was a good game.

560
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:32,365
and the people on Touch Arcade's forums liked it,

561
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:33,906
and they would keep talking about it.

562
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:36,507
And then my next game was pretty good,

563
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:37,548
and it got more attention.

564
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:40,950
And so Touch Arcade just kept consistently covering my games

565
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,951
because I was consistent in putting out good games,

566
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:43,972
and I did it pretty fast,

567
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:47,814
which most people don't do the games quite as quickly.

568
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:51,642
So because I was able to do the games consistently and fast,

569
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:52,963
I just kept getting coverage.

570
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,003
And then eventually Apple started picking up on that

571
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,204
and started featuring the games.

572
00:24:56,884 --> 00:24:58,904
And so now I have a pretty reliable,

573
00:24:59,004 --> 00:25:00,885
I put out the game, I tell TouchHourGate about it,

574
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:03,145
I tell Pocket Gamer, they cover the games,

575
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:04,366
Apple features games,

576
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:05,726
somewhere on the new games we love list,

577
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:08,007
usually not that high, but depends on the game.

578
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:11,948
So it's just been a cycle of putting out lots

579
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:14,208
of quality games to get to the point

580
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:15,329
where people will pay attention

581
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:16,549
to the new games that I put out.

582
00:25:17,905 --> 00:25:19,165
So it's, I don't really,

583
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:22,346
like I think I've gotten a little better at the screenshots

584
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:23,746
and like the descriptions and stuff,

585
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:24,967
but I don't really know for sure.

586
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,147
Like doing the trailers I think helps

587
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:28,888
because those are actually on the store now,

588
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:31,428
but beyond that, I don't think I'm like that much better

589
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,149
than what I did in 2013 or 2014.

590
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,289
Okay, pretty lucky you are.

591
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,410
Thank you.

592
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:43,931
Okay, looks like it.

593
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:44,772
Thanks for coming.
