1
00:00:01,545 --> 00:00:05,627
In the arms of the angel,

2
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:11,810
Far away from here,

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,773
From this dark, cold hotel room,

4
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:23,696
And the endlessness that you fear,

5
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:30,199
You are pulled from the wreckage.

6
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:36,184
of your silent reverie.

7
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:42,729
Here in the arms of the angel,

8
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,572
may you find

9
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,494
some comfort.

10
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,471
Hi, I'm Sarah McLachlan. Will you be an angel for a helpless artist?

11
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:02,552
Every day, innocent artists are abused, beaten, and neglected.

12
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:07,374
And they're crying out for help.

13
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:10,436
Please join us at the Technical Artist Boot Camp at GDC 2017.

14
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:11,116
For just a pass to GDC.

15
00:01:16,215 --> 00:01:21,778
Only 60 cents a day, you'll help rescue artists from their abusers and provide support with

16
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:26,761
VR projects, procedural content generation, simulations, advanced shader techniques, and

17
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:28,982
tech art and academia and love.
