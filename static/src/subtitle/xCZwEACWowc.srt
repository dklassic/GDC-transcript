00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:10,459
Hello, I am Katherine Himes, a game designer and computational linguist.

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,220
Also, I am allergic to summer, so fingers crossed I don't sneeze.

3
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:22,482
I'm here to talk about the potential for games as a form of community-driven care,

4
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:28,684
specifically exploring the topic through a collaboration and co-design project in making

5
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:33,666
games both with and for people with aphasia, which is an impairment of language.

6
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:41,899
This talk is being given amidst the pandemic and right now it feels inevitable to be asking

7
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:49,184
ourselves how we might use our energy and skills, whatever they are, at GDC specifically as game

8
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:56,408
designers to contribute to important human-centered questions. The hope is that this talk is helpful

9
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:02,712
in showing one way to apply game design through a deep community collaboration in service of the

10
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:03,233
public good.

11
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:12,710
There is a well-established movement for games that are designed with a goal that is different

12
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,053
than entertainment. Sometimes these are called serious games or games with a purpose, and that

13
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:25,517
isn't to trivialize fun or self-expression in games, in fact pretty critical for most any game

14
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:31,760
to be interesting. Rather, these games are designed to accomplish something specific outside of fun.

15
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:38,680
In the domain of therapy, one motivating question may be how might the context of play

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,624
positively affect patients or facilitate community support or

17
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:48,827
help people to make a change in their personal health or behavior?

18
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:55,881
There is a wide world of game development looking to design games for applications in health,

19
00:01:56,481 --> 00:02:02,427
for care, for rehab, and the idea of playful medicine or playful therapy is here and happening

20
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:09,013
right now. A couple of examples for you. Last June, the FDA approved the first ever digital

21
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:14,718
therapeutic video game that was clinically shown to improve attention span in kids with ADHD.

22
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:21,815
Stroke patients can be prescribed game-based therapy to recover movement and motor function

23
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:29,798
at home. This is really hard to do. These games have to clear all of the hurdles of proving medical

24
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:37,201
efficacy while still being fun, but they open up a world of experience-based therapy through games.

25
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:44,366
This talk will focus on the project Aphasia Games for Health,

26
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:49,951
which was a collaboration over the last year where Aphasia community members,

27
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:57,038
medical professionals, and game designers came together to make games that explore the potential

28
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:01,682
for play as a community-driven form of care. And by that I mean playable at home,

29
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:07,687
in support groups, out in the wide world without the need for a specialist to run it.

30
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:15,457
Here I'll focus on the co-design process itself. It's going to be a fly overview of what it is to

31
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:21,463
work across different backgrounds, expertise, and communication needs to produce games.

32
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:26,307
I am a game designer and linguist by trade and only one member of this team,

33
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:29,810
but you'll get to see more of our co-design group later on.

34
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,780
First, some brief background.

35
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,602
Aphasia is a language disorder caused by stroke or other brain injury that affects a person's ability to communicate.

36
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:45,123
This is an impairment of language.

37
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:48,845
There's no one single experience of aphasia.

38
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:53,666
Someone with aphasia may have difficulty in speaking, understanding, reading, or writing.

39
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:59,084
But living with aphasia can have a big impact on many parts of social and professional life,

40
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:03,767
which just gets in the way of expressing oneself and connecting with others.

41
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:08,890
Across the US, there are over 2 million people living with chronic aphasia.

42
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:16,455
People with aphasia often report that they don't have enough healthcare access for meaningful treatment.

43
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,014
And when they do receive language rehab, it is typically limited in scope.

44
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:26,221
So think 10 hours of speech-language services in the first year after a stroke.

45
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:29,124
And then a really high drop-off beyond that.

46
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,293
But rehab helps.

47
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:37,377
There is strong evidence that speech and language therapy can improve communication

48
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:41,279
well into the later phases of recovery.

49
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,902
So given all this, there's growing interest in the aphasia community

50
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:50,144
to find new ways to receive community-driven therapy

51
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:54,687
that's done at home, without a clinician, for long-term language recovery.

52
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:05,620
Why consider games for this? Reasonable question. Games designed for aphasia rehabilitation have

53
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,902
some exciting potential here. First, we have prior evidence that games can be built to include

54
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:17,983
therapeutic rehabilitation principles, but also be played and run at home by non-professionals.

55
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:24,184
They can be made to be flexible to the needs of different players, flexible in format,

56
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:34,263
made available in person or online, which is important for many folks who live outside of major cities or with limited transportation options.

57
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:43,590
Compared to other treatments, games can be scoped to be significantly cheaper, with a single purchase allowing for long-term play.

58
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:50,055
Also, games can be social while doing all of this, and by being fun,

59
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:55,188
They can be built to help people connect and keep engagement up.

60
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:05,110
So taken all together, this is a compelling case to explore aphasia games for health.

61
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,371
Will Evans, a professor and speech-language pathologist out of the University of Pittsburgh,

62
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:17,432
spearheaded the effort to assemble a co-design group to make card-based games

63
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,633
playable in person and online.

64
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:24,004
that can incorporate mechanics that are helpful for aphasia treatment.

65
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:30,348
Now, many folks in the aphasia community are already playing all sorts of games.

66
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:36,072
Sometimes they're used in modified forms as exercises in aphasia support groups.

67
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:41,856
The question here was to ask, can we add to this by designing games intentionally

68
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:45,499
from the ground up that meet some of the needs of the aphasia community?

69
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:54,378
To make games like this, we wanted to bring together different kinds of expertise.

70
00:06:55,438 --> 00:07:02,002
In particular, insight about the lived experience of aphasia that can come from aphasia community

71
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:02,403
members.

72
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,026
We needed a way to evaluate the therapeutic foundation of a game as it's being developed

73
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:13,089
and iterated on with knowledge from speech-language pathologists.

74
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:24,372
And we also wanted to build scalable, playful systems around all of these ideas that can be woven into a game, as contributed by professional game designers.

75
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:35,441
So, together, we formed a single co-design team that collaborated to produce new games for health for the aphasia community.

76
00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:40,464
And these partnerships included aphasia community members from ARC,

77
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:47,186
that's aphasia recovery connection, which is a nationwide support group of 9000 plus people.

78
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:53,228
Speech language pathologists from the language rehab and cognition group at the University of

79
00:07:53,288 --> 00:08:00,571
Pittsburgh and independent game designers from both industry and academia. Each game featured

80
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:03,692
a lead designer and then was made in partnership with the whole team.

81
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:15,130
So before starting out, we needed to draft a set of design principles that would ground what we make.

82
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:22,052
Simply outlining what an aphasia game for health would aim to do is a challenge in and of itself.

83
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:29,175
Based on deep dives into research, literature and interviews with members of Aphasia Recovery Connection,

84
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,797
here are some elements that we wanted each of the games to incorporate.

85
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:37,678
First, we wanted games to have a therapeutic foundation

86
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:42,343
by using one or more of these behavioral rehab activities

87
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:44,545
that are backed by evidence to treat aphasia.

88
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:48,409
They should have a way to adjust difficulty.

89
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,352
That means that people with really different profiles

90
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:52,993
of aphasia can play the game,

91
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:56,817
and also that a single individual can keep on playing

92
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,019
as their own experience changes over time.

93
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:04,775
We wanted each game to allow for performance feedback during play,

94
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:08,877
which is a real standard component of therapy that you can mechanize

95
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,818
or support through the structure of a game.

96
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,040
We'd like these games to be playable and replayable

97
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,502
so that they can be a part of long-term therapy.

98
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,683
And, of course, these games needed to be accessible.

99
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:25,046
They have to target the common scenarios around social access and community constraints.

100
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:27,988
How many people are playing? Who are you playing with?

101
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:29,269
As examples.

102
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:37,565
All of this together, it's a tall order, and it's important not to overpromise what any one game can do.

103
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:41,986
But knowing what to strive for is a first step.

104
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:46,827
There are many more steps to actually show that a game is therapeutic or that it's broadly accessible,

105
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:51,108
especially across the community with really different needs and experiences.

106
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:57,198
So in the next few slides, I'll put a spotlight

107
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,819
on some of the ways that we structured co-design

108
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,000
to both be accessible and functional

109
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,181
across really different kinds of expertise.

110
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,222
So for a creative collaboration,

111
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,742
bringing all of this different experience together,

112
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:14,283
it has the potential to be utter chaos.

113
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:19,005
We needed to spend serious time and energy upfront

114
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,285
figuring out how we were going to work together.

115
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:28,367
Though this collaboration has lasted more than a year, the heart of design happened over a summer.

116
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:33,390
So over the course of three months, we held a series of workshops and interview sessions

117
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,332
that involved our whole group of co-designers. Workshops were done remotely over video conference

118
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:46,376
and were used to do brainstorming, game design, pitching, structured playtesting, feedback,

119
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:48,537
and of course just general hangouts.

120
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:52,896
Each workshop followed a similar format.

121
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:57,079
An overview of a game idea in progress was presented,

122
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:59,100
the basic explanation of the rules,

123
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,223
then game designers would model an example turn of gameplay,

124
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:08,767
and then community members with aphasia would be invited to playtest and comments, give suggestions.

125
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:15,384
After playtesting, aphasia community members would share their immediate thoughts, feedback

126
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:21,148
on whether or not the game was fun, what was simple, what was challenging, and then together

127
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:26,853
with feedback from our speech-language pathologist, the designer would iterate and present a revision

128
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:27,814
at the next workshop.

129
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:34,119
This was done through three cycles of design idea, workshop presentation, and revision

130
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:37,882
until finally a playtested prototype was made.

131
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:49,760
During co-design, one of the first things we had to think about was how to make this accessible for our team members with aphasia.

132
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,162
We employed a whole range of adaptive techniques to help with communication in our workshops.

133
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:03,985
Many of these come from standard FAIR that online aphasia support groups are already using today.

134
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:12,061
We were, one, doing video conferencing, and that forced by the pandemic, but that ended up being

135
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:18,245
helpful. We used different modes of communication at the same time to help with participation.

136
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:25,789
Slowed speech and writing together were especially effective. Someone would type keywords from

137
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:31,392
speech into a chat window to help cue a conversation so everyone could follow along.

138
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:36,928
People could share pictures and visual aids to make explanations clearer,

139
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,429
even at the earliest stages of game design.

140
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:46,051
And timing for meetings was needed in order to not cause mental fatigue.

141
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:51,473
Afterwards, recordings were shared with everyone to allow people to review a

142
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:52,933
particular workshop if they wanted.

143
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:57,875
And along the way, we had regular active conversation with our team members,

144
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,296
with Atheja, to ask what else they may need.

145
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,094
Cross-training was another one.

146
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:10,297
We recruited game designers who had really strong design work

147
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:13,019
and an interest in this language-related play.

148
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,242
Some of these designers had experience with aphasia

149
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:18,143
through their family,

150
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,225
but we knew that there was a lot more to know,

151
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,867
even while working within a co-design group.

152
00:13:24,228 --> 00:13:27,610
So prior to starting any kind of active development,

153
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,113
game designers followed a month-long preparation program

154
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:33,155
of sorts, done part-time.

155
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,834
They were given lectures on aphasia from the rest of the core team.

156
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:43,597
They attended separate online conversation groups led by the aphasia recovery connection,

157
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:48,479
typically involving around 20 people with a wide range of aphasia profiles.

158
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,642
The idea here was that this allows for exposure to a larger range of people who might benefit

159
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,263
from the designs we would later make.

160
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:11,407
And then before starting with the core team, designers were then asked to attend an aphasia group where people with aphasia play existing games together like bingo or trivia, some of which are regularly led by some of our team members.

161
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:21,531
So here's one tangible example of how we tried to make the creative development across expertise actually work.

162
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:29,568
Game designers were given a design brief with details on project goals, but also existing

163
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:37,037
therapeutic activities that might be mechanized in future design choices. We wanted games to

164
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:40,782
feature one or more evidence-backed behavioral rehab activities.

165
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:52,118
The majority of activities are all around providing context that allow people to practice speaking, processing, or combining elements of language together.

166
00:14:52,138 --> 00:15:00,926
This wasn't an exhaustive list by any means, but it was some important tools as considered by our speech-language pathologists.

167
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:10,052
So after that brief window into co-design, I'll give you a high-level peek into the game prototypes that we made

168
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:15,274
and point out at least one way that they followed our game design principles.

169
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:23,079
First up, The Minister's Cat, led by game designer Meg Baker.

170
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:31,623
This is an evolution of a 19th century perler game. It's a memory letter game for two to six players.

171
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:40,243
where players will tell small stories about a minister's cat featuring a word that matches a pre-assigned letter.

172
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:47,493
So it's meant to be a storytelling game using repeated phrases along with nouns provided by the player.

173
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:54,158
Every sentence is prompted by this deck of themed cards that come with a base sentence.

174
00:15:54,278 --> 00:16:00,105
So think the minister's cat eats, the minister's cat wears, then players take turns creating

175
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:06,954
sentences in rounds and flesh out the story of their cats. It was a big cat fever of the summer,

176
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:07,655
as you can tell.

177
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:14,390
For this game, I'll point out an example mechanic that's based on behavioral rehab principles.

178
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:20,873
So one standard rehab technique is to modify the difficulty for a task by cueing.

179
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:25,935
That means offering clues, perhaps around meaning, the type of bird, or...

180
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:30,247
Sound starts with a P, something like this.

181
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:39,353
And this led to a mechanic in this game where players are asked to recall words with cueing

182
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,935
that are based on sounds constrained by some topic.

183
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,237
For example, you know it has to do with food and then start to B.

184
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:57,180
Audition is a memory and improv game led by game designer Cleo Yunsu-Davis.

185
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:05,086
Players take on the role of an actor who is auditioning for a movie and the acting coaches

186
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:10,530
who are trying to help them, but the problem is that neither the actor nor the coaches

187
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,951
have memorized the script.

188
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:18,814
So the actor has to do their best to improvise a monologue that includes the key words from the script,

189
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,737
while these coaches are helping them by prompting those words.

190
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:33,524
Another example of our design principles in action is that this game incorporates a mechanic based on adaptive levels of difficulty.

191
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:39,868
In particular, it mechanizes different player roles of both actor and coach.

192
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,454
that allow for different kinds of challenge around what kind of pressure you want to be under

193
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:47,876
and how you're prompted to say things on the spot.

194
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:55,240
Do you see what I see? Led by game designer Tim Hutchings.

195
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,402
It is a video chat game that combines storytelling,

196
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:03,364
20 questions, and environment interaction at a distance.

197
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:09,888
Great for play over Zoom. Players will join this video chat from a room in their home.

198
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:16,759
And then one player is the chooser and selects an item in the background of another player's video chat window.

199
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,301
The other players will ask simple yes-no questions in order to try and guess what's been selected.

200
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:28,543
And the person whose object was chosen then tells everyone something special about it.

201
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,700
It really gives a nice alibi to share something personal with the other players.

202
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:38,482
Variations also layer on this game in terms of new rules to increase the difficulty.

203
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:40,883
Like you might have an off-limits danger item.

204
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:49,707
An example mechanic based on the design goals of long-term engagement is that

205
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:54,268
every time you play it's different based on the background content,

206
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:58,190
which players can modify or replace with even virtual backgrounds.

207
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,725
So next up, I want to actually show you a clip of this game being played by a subset of our co-design team.

208
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:11,229
This includes Trish, Dee, and Jill, some of our team members with aphasia.

209
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:17,253
Carol, who is the co-founder of Aphasia Recovery Connection, and Will, our speech-language pathologist.

210
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,380
Great.

211
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:32,655
All right, who wants to be the chooser?

212
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:35,216
I will.

213
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:46,761
Awesome, Trish is the chooser. Remember, now we are guessers and we can ask yes or no questions

214
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:55,465
like is it green or is it round, but we can't ask whose background is it behind.

215
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:58,847
Let's get started.

216
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,902
Is it on a table?

217
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:07,023
No.

218
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:12,167
Is it a square?

219
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:14,489
Yes.

220
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:22,194
Is it on a wall? Yes.

221
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,957
Is it a mirror? Yay!

222
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:36,576
And now, since Jill guessed and it's behind Jill,

223
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,798
Jill can tell us the story of the mirror.

224
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,763
Well, I like mirrors

225
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:52,387
because my grandson is 17 months old

226
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:56,490
and he loves to look at himself.

227
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:58,111
Of course.

228
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:58,491
Good, good.

229
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,252
Good job, team.

230
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:11,482
Awesome. Let's play another round. Okay, who wants to be the chooser? D.

231
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:15,243
All right, D's the chooser.

232
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:25,346
I know what I'm looking. I have chosen my thing.

233
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:29,647
So we can start asking questions.

234
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:32,148
Okay, is it...

235
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:36,789
Um big? No.

236
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:46,992
Is it a squam? No.

237
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:54,194
Is it bigger than a chair? No.

238
00:21:57,214 --> 00:22:00,355
Can you drink out of it? No.

239
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:06,176
Hmm.

240
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:09,840
Really?

241
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:18,347
Is it white?

242
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,632
Uh, I think so.

243
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:28,736
Is it round? No.

244
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:40,209
Is it on a table?

245
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:44,912
Uh

246
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:47,194
No

247
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:01,285
Is it on a wall? No. Oh, maybe

248
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:07,670
Is it more than one color? No

249
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,551
Is it...

250
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:17,253
Wait a minute.

251
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:22,015
Counter.

252
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:22,636
Counter?

253
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:23,856
Yes.

254
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,002
Is it my iPad or the...

255
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:40,436
iPad.

256
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:41,156
iPad?

257
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:41,957
Yes.

258
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:42,498
Yay!

259
00:23:50,845 --> 00:24:00,146
Yes. I didn't know if it was white or gray. I couldn't see it. It was white or gray. So yeah.

260
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:07,668
That was okay. The way you said it, we knew that it was close to white.

261
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:08,748
I was the apple.

262
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:33,238
And this, um, the, my colleagues, this is me.

263
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:34,819
What?

264
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:35,780
Wait, wait, wait.

265
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,201
I have to make it bigger.

266
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:40,263
Wow.

267
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:44,526
Which one are you of the six?

268
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:45,167
Yeah.

269
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:47,408
Oh, oh, wow.

270
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,026
Oh, so is it like a picture frame?

271
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:50,747
Yeah.

272
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:53,389
Oh, that's awesome!

273
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:54,549
Very cool!

274
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,110
Wow!

275
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,678
I love the personal stories that people can share in that game.

276
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:13,001
And so hopefully that gives you a taste of some of our game prototypes.

277
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:17,764
Here I will share a brief reflection on co-design.

278
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:25,523
First off, for collaborative co-design, there is a real lift with cross-training for everyone.

279
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:31,564
Some of this we anticipated ahead of time, for example, for our game designers getting

280
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:36,765
more formal background on aphasia, and others we had to incorporate along the way.

281
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:42,807
We found that both our speech-language pathologists and team members with aphasia could benefit

282
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:46,488
from more background on the game design process itself.

283
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,903
What to expect, how to give clear, actionable feedback, and all of that.

284
00:25:52,883 --> 00:26:00,346
We ended up holding a separate, accessible training session for all non-professional game designers, which helped with future workshops.

285
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:02,607
Another takeaway.

286
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:10,502
was around the impact of small decisions from a design perspective having big implications for

287
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:16,567
the ultimate therapeutic status of a particular game. We had a speech-language pathologist who

288
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:21,231
could help actively guide in making therapeutically motivated choices,

289
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:26,115
but we found we really needed even more detailed back and forth.

290
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:33,132
For example, in the audition game, where a player improvises lines based on card prompts,

291
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:39,274
the choice of what counts as a line has real stakes for who can play in the actor role,

292
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:45,557
and the choice also changes what skills and abilities are being targeted for improvement.

293
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:53,841
And lastly, we learned some things about game design-specific adaptations to make the process more accessible.

294
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,804
We already talked about the general adaptations we used to support our team members with aphasia.

295
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:06,868
We also found that there were specific activities in game design that needed their own attention

296
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:12,772
to make sure everyone could fully participate. A lot of this was around playtesting games at

297
00:27:12,812 --> 00:27:19,876
various stages of development. Two most useful techniques were the liberal use of visual aids

298
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:22,498
and example turn demonstrations.

299
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:28,215
even for ideas that were in really early stages or in flux.

300
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,036
So some of the suggestions that we got

301
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:33,117
from our team members with aphasia

302
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,958
also directly shaped the rule explanations

303
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,699
that we drafted for our prototypes.

304
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:43,882
Results from this effort.

305
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:48,024
We have three free publicly available game prototypes

306
00:27:48,304 --> 00:27:49,204
that you can check out

307
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:51,725
along with illustrated game instructions.

308
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:58,925
We have a website with more details on where people can sign up for playtesting or to follow along.

309
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:07,467
We also have some great game recommendations offered as videos by our team members with Aphasia, based on what they like to play.

310
00:28:08,347 --> 00:28:12,268
And some of them have also started designing their own games outside of this collaboration.

311
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:18,529
Lastly, you can also find some training materials and more background info.

312
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:24,491
We're proud of this work, but it's a start.

313
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:32,542
We plan to do more playtesting with aphasia support groups to iterate on these games.

314
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:37,028
These games are based on therapeutic ideas.

315
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:43,502
Actually proving therapeutic effectiveness is a much higher bar, and they need to be evaluated

316
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:49,546
through rigorous clinical trials research in order to meet it. We're looking into funding sources to

317
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:55,190
print and distribute these games beyond the free downloads that are available today, and we're

318
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,573
thinking of ways to help out gaming communities that exist already in aphasia support groups.

319
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:02,214
Takeaways for you.

320
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:10,021
This is a brief window into one project around Games for Health that was made through collaborative co-design.

321
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:20,466
So more generally, there is a growing interest and real momentum in many areas that are looking to game design as a potential form of community-driven care.

322
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:26,548
And with the right collaboration, you as a game designer can use your skills to contribute.

323
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:33,134
If you'd like to learn more about this particular project, check out aphasiagamesforhealth.com.

324
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,741
Big shout out to the many people involved along the way.

325
00:29:41,384 --> 00:29:42,786
Thanks and see you later.
