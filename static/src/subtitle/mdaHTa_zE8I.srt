1
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:09,137
Okay. Well, I'll get started then.

2
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:12,159
Thank you for joining me today.

3
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:15,260
My name is Terence Weinzerl.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,841
I am...

5
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:19,622
You can find me online,

6
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:23,023
at TypeTerence, on Twitter and Instagram and stuff,

7
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:27,225
so feel free to say hi or send me a question later

8
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:28,146
if it comes up.

9
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:36,014
I'm a type designer, which means that I design typefaces and build fonts.

10
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:39,895
So I'm not a game designer.

11
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:45,255
So that's kind of my disclaimer, is that, you know, the stuff I'm going to talk about

12
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:53,817
today is my opinions and my observations about video games and typography in them.

13
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,058
So I work for a company called Monotype.

14
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:04,517
And that's where I work.

15
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:10,839
But Monotype is known for designing user interface typefaces.

16
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,060
So our famous projects are Seago for Microsoft,

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,520
as seen on the Xbox.

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,801
And we've done a lot of stuff for Google, too,

19
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:23,842
like Open Sans and some interface fonts for Android and stuff

20
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:27,383
before they switched to Roboto or Chrome OS fonts.

21
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,844
We also recently designed a typeface for Sony called SST,

22
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,026
which is used on the PS4

23
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:41,170
and in the PlayStation Store on PS3, too.

24
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:51,904
pretty cool. My recent claim to fame, actually, is custom fonts for dominoes. And they use

25
00:01:52,464 --> 00:02:01,710
this set of fonts on, for branding and packaging and advertising and stuff. So, that was fun.

26
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:08,915
But I actually spoke at the GDC before, in 2012. I spoke about localization.

27
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:14,033
And I was really surprised that I got good grades,

28
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:15,754
and they put me on the deck of cards.

29
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:20,579
So I hope that my sequel today will be just as good.

30
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,043
So don't forget to fill out the evaluation things.

31
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,410
I've done a few custom fonts for video games, of course.

32
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:36,353
I did this one for a skateboarding game.

33
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,146
And I've done this one for a racing game.

34
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:45,990
But I've been a casual gamer for, you know, two-thirds of my life.

35
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,073
So this intersection of typography and video games is my jam.

36
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:54,096
So I'm really excited to be here.

37
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:56,917
And I'm glad you came with me.

38
00:02:56,957 --> 00:03:01,240
So that's what I'm here to talk about today.

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,623
How to choose the best typographic system for your global game.

40
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:08,708
So I'll talk about a couple different things.

41
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:12,350
Um, the mood and, and style of typefaces.

42
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:16,854
I'll talk a little bit about how to use typography in a game.

43
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:19,516
And then I'll talk a little bit about, um,

44
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:23,539
anticipating or, or dealing with localization stuff

45
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,160
and kind of how that relates to fonts.

46
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,963
So I have good news and bad news.

47
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,918
there's no exact science to choosing typefaces.

48
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,600
Much of it is instinct and gut feeling,

49
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:39,583
and part of it is knowing what might work

50
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:41,184
with the content and context.

51
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:45,007
It's a skill that will improve with experience.

52
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:46,468
The more you do it, the better you get.

53
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,930
So, ask yourself, how does the type feel?

54
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:53,074
Is it slow, is it fast, is it light, is it heavy?

55
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,922
Think about the images that will accompany the text,

56
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:03,106
or the objects, or places, time periods, or attitudes.

57
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,449
What typefaces would your characters use

58
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:08,610
if they had to choose?

59
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:17,522
In a game like Far Cry 3, the distress and static of the type describes the insanity

60
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:20,085
and the instability of the antagonist.

61
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:25,930
And they use quotes from Alice in Wonderland as a metaphor for his descent into madness.

62
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:29,533
So we have this gritty, broken world that you're in.

63
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:33,358
And if you notice, there's a little icon in the corner there

64
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,359
of, like, a mirror image of guns.

65
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,920
It looks like a butterfly.

66
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:42,863
And so that fits with this tropical island world

67
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:46,246
that they're in, and they use this as a design element

68
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:47,406
throughout the game.

69
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,888
They have a mirror image of the guns here,

70
00:04:50,388 --> 00:04:52,770
or even how they treat the type, too.

71
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,332
So they have the type mirrored from the center.

72
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:57,492
And...

73
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:00,112
I thought that was just a really good,

74
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,653
just a really good repeating design element.

75
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,335
Perhaps you have a story like Battlestar Galactica.

76
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,797
You have this type style that's futuristic.

77
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,538
A geometric sans serif is almost a given

78
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:16,459
for the side of a spaceship.

79
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:19,500
But the people in the story are also

80
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,261
greatly influenced by tradition and antiquity,

81
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:23,902
or Greek mythology.

82
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:30,062
So here, they're using the shape of a Greek delta for the A,

83
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:31,884
which is a nice twist.

84
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,086
So maybe the people in the story

85
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,848
are so influenced by ancient Greece

86
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,453
that they incorporate the Greek alphabet somehow.

87
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,417
And I think a detail like this can add a richness

88
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:45,760
to the story and the experience of the game.

89
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,308
Your 12-year-old player will still be able to read it,

90
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:53,751
but your, you know, 30-year-old college graduate player

91
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:56,152
is going to delight in the detail.

92
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:01,556
So classifications and time periods

93
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:05,118
are origin points that help us describe an organized type.

94
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,241
These are genres of typefaces.

95
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,203
But they're also not cut and dry.

96
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:13,824
So there's a lot of exceptions and overlaps.

97
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,162
just like music or video games.

98
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:23,243
Knowing the main genres and descriptors

99
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:27,284
can help you choose fonts by giving you a starting point.

100
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,726
And there are a lot of books and resources

101
00:06:31,786 --> 00:06:35,206
on the topic and stuff. I have some recommended resources

102
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:39,288
on my blog, too, if you look it up. But just like games and music,

103
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:42,048
there's exciting things that happen in between the genres.

104
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:46,452
Of course, there's a rich history to type,

105
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:50,714
and even long before Gutenberg and the first printed books,

106
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:55,796
organizing type as we know it today with paragraphs and punctuation,

107
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,818
you know, developed over hundreds of years with calligraphy and manuscripts.

108
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:04,640
And those traditions were, you know, soaked in into printing.

109
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,161
That's what people were used to reading.

110
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,583
There's actually a game that will teach you about typographic history.

111
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,226
And while you play it, it's called Typewriter.

112
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:20,671
And it's a platformer where you're using a little bit of punctuation,

113
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,573
like a car colon.

114
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:27,034
thing, and you run and jump through puzzles and props

115
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:31,455
in this typographic and pretty historically accurate world.

116
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:34,056
A little European modernism here.

117
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:36,517
Pretty sweet.

118
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:41,479
I don't have enough time to go into all of the genres

119
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,899
and stuff in depth today, but I wanted to zoom in on a few.

120
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:50,199
So, back in the day, this style was called grotesque in Europe,

121
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,261
and gothic in the Americas.

122
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:57,326
And, they have, like Helvetica, and trade gothic, for example.

123
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,530
And there are some differentiators between a grotesque and a gothic,

124
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,331
but it's pretty scientific.

125
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,613
They're like fraternal twins, if you think about it that way.

126
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:08,456
It's definitely the most popular genre in the last 50 years.

127
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:13,213
But there's no such thing as a neutral typeface, though.

128
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:14,694
I wanted to emphasize that.

129
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:16,856
There's only common ones.

130
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:20,458
So these feel neutral because we see them so often.

131
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:22,119
They kind of disappear.

132
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,720
Because they're so common.

133
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:26,582
Not because they are inherently neutral.

134
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:32,846
So everything, no matter how plain it seems,

135
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,648
carries some connotation with it.

136
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:41,252
A humanist sans serif kind of has a little bit more handwriting influence to the shapes,

137
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:46,294
less mechanical, and they're very popular with corporations and branding because they

138
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:51,795
look clean and efficient and friendly, something like Gil Sans or Myriad, for example.

139
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:58,377
Geometric sans are, you know, as they're described, geometric.

140
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:04,498
They can be very elegant or futuristic, and there's also a pretty wide range of geometric

141
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:04,918
moods.

142
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:11,202
Square Sans is futuristic and mechanical too, like, you know,

143
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:15,143
Bank Gothic on Call of Duty and movie posters,

144
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:16,624
a typeface like Giro Style.

145
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:21,425
Very popular on cars, as we'll see later.

146
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,766
Serif... oops, I'm sorry.

147
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:26,307
Serif typefaces have their own...

148
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:30,048
their own serious and bookish look,

149
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,209
or, you know, when used in games, historical.

150
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,607
or classical Final Fantasy, for example, it feels cinematic.

151
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:42,030
Or a newer game, 1886, The Order, has a very bookish

152
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,231
and cinematic feel, too, with the use of serifs.

153
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:51,274
And slab serifs on the bottom there are, of course, popular with cowboys and sports.

154
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:56,266
Script typefaces, again, have a bunch of their own subgenres,

155
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:58,347
and there's a pretty big variety of those, too.

156
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,230
But they can look luxurious or formal,

157
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,472
or very informal, like handwriting.

158
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,655
Most commonly in the game world is casual scripts

159
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,537
and really comic book lettering styles.

160
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:12,678
Very popular.

161
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:18,142
But typefaces can help set the mood and the tone of voice.

162
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:20,464
But they can also be very flexible

163
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:22,846
depending on the content and the context.

164
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:27,629
But it really breaks down to these formal qualities and also stereotypes.

165
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,613
And these stereotypes are developed over a long period of time

166
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:36,076
because they get used over and over again.

167
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:43,221
So this looks sci-fi because we've seen those type styles used in so many sci-fi things.

168
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,943
It's okay. It makes sense.

169
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:47,442
It's not a bad thing. It's just a thing.

170
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:51,023
Lord of the Rings, kind of this fantasy style

171
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,824
with a calligraphy called Unchill.

172
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:58,845
And we see these typographic stereotypes everywhere.

173
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:01,606
Not just games. Right. Police cars.

174
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:05,927
A pizza place. Right.

175
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:07,648
Or whipped cream.

176
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:12,918
You know, these stereotypes act as a visual shortcut

177
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,879
for our memory, and we recognize patterns.

178
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,880
So we're able to guess the content based on the typography,

179
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,980
or at least get a clue.

180
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,821
So this is essential graphic design.

181
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,361
This is communicating an idea visually.

182
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,142
That's what typefaces are good at.

183
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,243
So, uh, see what I did there?

184
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:41,393
Tiny Wings is a, a simple game. And the menu is pretty atmospheric, but the type style

185
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:47,698
is a perfect match for the character and the style of the game. Right? Round, soft, fluffy.

186
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,864
This, along with the, the color and the music choices, gives this game a sophistication

187
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:58,546
to an otherwise a simple mechanic. But they're just using one typeface.

188
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:04,558
Pretty simple.

189
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,822
Kingdom Rush, as another example,

190
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:10,829
has consistent franchise and brand typography.

191
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:12,992
When I flip through these, you can kind of...

192
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:18,782
see the similarities. It's funny, it gets crazier. This is the first one. And then the

193
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,943
last one is just a lot more, it just gets crazy.

194
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:26,465
But this title is actually, you know, lettering. Not a font, of course. It's, you know, drawn,

195
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:32,326
drawn by hand there. But it looks like Saturday morning cartoons, with this chunky, bouncy

196
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:38,508
sans-serif style. This could be a package of sugar cereal. I love it.

197
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,060
The focus, though, is very much on the illustrations.

198
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:46,243
And type is just a detail in their illustrations.

199
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,485
The style, the type style is integrated and harmonious.

200
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:54,068
And on the map, we actually have multiple typefaces.

201
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,552
And again, the type is just a detail in their illustrations.

202
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:07,096
But even in, even in gameplay, they use little animations of onomatopoeias.

203
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:12,017
that float off of the action. It's comic book DNA.

204
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,543
In a game like Portal 2, they use a typeface

205
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:21,826
called Univare, which is exemplary of the grotesque

206
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,048
genre, like I mentioned, similar to Helvetica.

207
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,672
And it looks medical and corporate here. And it's

208
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:33,756
contrasting with this torn-up world that they're in.

209
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,563
And it's accented with airport-style iconography,

210
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,366
which is in tune with the style of the type.

211
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:48,272
So we can actually use these two design principles here

212
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:50,335
to help us direct our typeface choices,

213
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:51,796
harmony or contrast.

214
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:56,316
In a game like Device 6, we have a, it's a puzzle game,

215
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:58,717
kind of mashed up with a book. I'm kind of doing

216
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:01,058
crops here, not one for one screenshot.

217
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:05,059
The serif typeface and that cream paper-like background is

218
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,760
very intentional, to make it look like a book.

219
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,621
If this were a white sans serif on a

220
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:13,223
black background, for example, it would feel very, very different.

221
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,032
So typography is literally a main character in this game.

222
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:20,615
But even if type is more of a supporting role,

223
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:22,416
and that's kind of the usual cases,

224
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,158
you still want it to be the best supporting role.

225
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,962
The detailed audio and the parallax scrolling in the game

226
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:36,145
contrast nicely with the otherwise pretty flat reading experience.

227
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,615
In Splinter Cell Conviction, the type is,

228
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:44,676
melds with the environment here.

229
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:46,997
And so it's not merely a necessity

230
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:48,498
that's tacked on top of the image,

231
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,601
but a design element that's considered and integrated

232
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:55,823
to harmonize.

233
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:58,705
And this approach has, you know,

234
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,266
an augmented reality feel to it

235
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:02,948
and aids the player so they don't have to dig through

236
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,550
the menus to know what the objectives are.

237
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:11,438
grid racing game. A perfect example of Harmony, too.

238
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,340
The typefaces that they use are very popular with real

239
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:21,383
cars. Eurostyle and Futura. So the realism goal is

240
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:26,245
supported by the typeface choices. And this 3D menu

241
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,826
mimics the modeling and the lighting of the cars.

242
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:32,668
So it's integrated into the world. It's big and

243
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,929
loud, but it, but it blends right in.

244
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:43,732
Assassin's Creed is using that kind of style contrast here, similar to Portal 2, for example.

245
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:50,354
And you have this, you know, another gritty textured world, and it's contrasted with a

246
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:55,555
clean-cut humanist sans-serif here that looks very much like a modern UI.

247
00:15:57,075 --> 00:16:03,177
And you might expect an old-world stereotypical typeface in a menu in a game like this, but

248
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,437
we're surprised by the opposite.

249
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,871
A couple more there.

250
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,873
Okay, so let's look at a couple of mechanics.

251
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,395
Legibility versus readability.

252
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:22,137
Legibility is being able to differentiate

253
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:23,298
one letter from the next,

254
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,060
like an eye exam at the optometrist, right?

255
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,181
Readability is more about comfort.

256
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:31,923
You read best what you read most.

257
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,205
For example, OCR is legible,

258
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,487
but not very comfortable to read.

259
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:43,684
Sans serifs are usually easy to read for short periods of time,

260
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:49,175
and serif typefaces are easiest to read in long form, like a book.

261
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:53,455
But when we look at typefaces that are designed

262
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:56,157
for user interfaces, or just OSes,

263
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:59,399
we see that most of them are humanist sans serifs, actually.

264
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,801
And some disputed grotesques like Helvetica and stuff.

265
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:05,642
But striking similarities.

266
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:08,084
I, you know, I realize that, you know,

267
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:10,786
an OS needs to be a lot more, a lot more, you know,

268
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,246
bland than a game does.

269
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,708
But it's very interesting to see patterns.

270
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,215
So when we take a closer look at readability,

271
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,795
we see that type size, the contrast,

272
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:28,556
and the viewing distance are really important factors.

273
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:30,817
And by contrast, I mean the difference between

274
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:33,678
the text color and the background color.

275
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:37,159
Different than the sort of style contrast

276
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,639
I was talking about a minute ago.

277
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,921
And often a complaint with type is the usage.

278
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:46,121
It's too small, it's too big, it's too thin, too heavy.

279
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:50,003
But just when in doubt, remember that comfort is king.

280
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,482
And we see a lot of discussion around viewing distance

281
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,402
with responsive web design

282
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,023
and changing typography for different screens

283
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:01,784
and the reading scenarios that they suggest.

284
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:03,905
So you can ask yourself,

285
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:07,906
is the text comfortable to see and read at this distance?

286
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:11,008
And it can help to get fresh eyes on it, too.

287
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:12,348
I know if you're, you know,

288
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:14,009
working on a game for months and months,

289
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,650
you know, it might be good to, you know,

290
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,050
ask someone who hasn't seen it,

291
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,011
is this comfortable to read?

292
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:24,902
And part of the challenge is this device proliferation

293
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:27,687
and the quality of screens on different devices,

294
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:30,372
and then managing the content for all those screens.

295
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,138
This is the challenge of the 21st century typographer

296
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:34,799
and designer.

297
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:39,349
You've seen this scenario where a, a phone game

298
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,731
is scaled up to a tablet without any design

299
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,673
changes and it looks horsey. Right. The buttons and

300
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:47,254
the type are huge. Or vice versa with a

301
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,797
tablet game. That's been scaled down to a phone

302
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:52,698
and you have tiny type and tiny buttons.

303
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,060
So typography is very size sensitive.

304
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:03,880
A hierarchy, another mechanic, creating contrast between levels of importance. And this is

305
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:10,084
kind of the idea between headlines and text sizes. Every, every, every magazine, everything

306
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:17,088
with type, uses hierarchy. This lets you scan for the information that you want. For example,

307
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:25,734
we have an exercise game. EA Sports Active. A rounded humanist sans serif is friendly

308
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,155
and serious, but not harsh.

309
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:32,725
Size, color, proximity to the icons is creating the hierarchy here.

310
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:34,607
Pretty simple.

311
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:41,873
A first-person shooter like Borderlands 2 usually has a complex inventory and menu system.

312
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,361
There's a lot going on here. Tabs, icons.

313
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:49,542
Maybe four or five different sizes, type sizes.

314
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:52,544
But they have a nice hierarchy with the

315
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:55,965
brightness and the contrast and all the blues, with

316
00:19:56,005 --> 00:20:00,206
the yellow highlights. Essentially a, a really beautiful spreadsheet.

317
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:05,928
Even more typographically complex, something like Civilization has, you

318
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,989
know, a range of problems to solve.

319
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,052
becomes a balancing act of showing enough relevant information

320
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:16,316
without, you know, without clouding the gameplay.

321
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:19,659
Only one typeface, though, not even a bold,

322
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,361
but they use a lot of color coding for the hierarchy.

323
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:27,986
And clarity. Again, another, another beautiful spreadsheet.

324
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:32,753
A pitfall to look out for would be information overload,

325
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:34,014
like a pinball table.

326
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,177
Everything is the same size, the same contrast,

327
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:38,418
they're using every color.

328
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,781
Maybe this helps distract you, so that you,

329
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:45,163
you miss the ball, and that you have to put more quarters in.

330
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:48,886
So, you know, I guess you can use,

331
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:52,409
you can use confusion and panic to your advantage

332
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:53,990
as a game designer, I suppose.

333
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:56,152
Or to get more quarters.

334
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:02,368
The most commonly overlooked typographic detail I see

335
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,212
is kerning, and it's cousin tracking, also known as

336
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:10,175
letter spacing in CSS. But letter spacing is a

337
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,619
generic term. Kerning or tracking could be described as

338
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:18,223
letter spacing. I see some smiles. So, that's good.

339
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,043
I'm a kerning fan.

340
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:25,388
So, kerning is the adjustment between two letters.

341
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,308
Just two.

342
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,489
And that's why they call it a kerning pair.

343
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,391
You can have positive or negative kerning values.

344
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,853
And these values, as they're added by a type designer like myself,

345
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:38,574
are stored inside the font file.

346
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:41,996
Some apps like Photoshop or Illustrator

347
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,018
would allow you to manually override those default kerning values.

348
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:53,330
Tracking, on the other hand, is the adjustment between all of the letters, positive or negative

349
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,031
in the same way.

350
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:59,774
The font has a default spacing built in at zero here, and the app that's using the font

351
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:00,434
can adjust it.

352
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:05,077
Like, for instance, by adding two hundred units between each default value.

353
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:10,881
So negative tracking usually does more harm than good, as you can see on the top.

354
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:15,264
One metaphor to help with spacing is to think about

355
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:17,506
the area or the volume between the letters,

356
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:19,588
filling up with water.

357
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,652
So you want them to be as even as possible.

358
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:27,416
So it's not about measuring one extreme point to the next,

359
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,297
but it's about balancing the negative space

360
00:22:29,338 --> 00:22:30,038
between the letters.

361
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:36,057
Here's a couple of real-world examples.

362
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,399
I don't mean to pick on anybody, right?

363
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,382
We're all friends, so just constructive criticism.

364
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:46,184
But just a little nitpick in plants versus zombies.

365
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,426
It's pretty mild, barely noticeable.

366
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,227
Maybe I'm hypersensitive to it.

367
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:54,931
But there's just a couple little gaps there.

368
00:22:59,574 --> 00:23:01,695
And also Call of Duty,

369
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,717
in this word multiplayer here.

370
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:07,618
So what's going on is actually the lack of kerning

371
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,599
is exaggerated by the negative tracking.

372
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,601
So it's not just indie games, right?

373
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,542
But big, big budget games too.

374
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:21,544
So my point is that good typography

375
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:25,246
is about the perceived quality of the game.

376
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:28,479
It's, it's packaging, in a way. It's part of the packaging.

377
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,286
And, you know, the typography is part of that whole experience of the game.

378
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:39,575
So a little bit about localization and how fonts relate to localization.

379
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:45,065
When you see the phrase Latin in font packaging,

380
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:48,827
they're talking about the official name of our alphabet,

381
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,649
not necessarily the language of the Roman Empire,

382
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,490
but that's what it's named after.

383
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:57,032
So that's why sometimes it's just called Roman.

384
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:01,147
That's the origin. Many languages use Latin.

385
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,509
You know, English, French, Spanish, German.

386
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,271
All of them, some with accents.

387
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,694
Accents are called diacritics sometimes.

388
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:11,816
So even a font with a modest range of accents

389
00:24:12,237 --> 00:24:15,139
can cover languages of millions of people in,

390
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,181
in Europe, in the Americas.

391
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:21,420
Greek is a smaller part of the European market,

392
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:23,983
but it has its own alphabet as well.

393
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:28,248
There's a script called Cyrillic, which is used for Russian,

394
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:30,351
and some others around Western Europe there.

395
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,085
And these three scripts, Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, as you can see on the left there,

396
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:41,589
they're all kind of similar in size and read from left to right.

397
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:46,433
But of course, that's not always the case with other languages around the world.

398
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:52,259
You know, Hebrew and Arabic, for example, read from right to left.

399
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,583
And so there are extra challenges or specific challenges

400
00:24:58,183 --> 00:25:00,206
for localization with any one of those

401
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:01,747
different writing systems,

402
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:05,511
especially when they don't fit with our Latin model.

403
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,431
Forgive me if this says anything bad or dirty.

404
00:25:10,471 --> 00:25:12,792
I just kind of popped a couple of those things in there.

405
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:13,933
So forgive me.

406
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,114
But these are also, also, they're all 72 point.

407
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:22,176
So when you're designing with another language,

408
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:27,698
the type size is not necessarily a one-for-one match with other scripts.

409
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:37,273
So, my point being here is that, uh, if you know in advance the game is going to be translated,

410
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:42,039
you'll want to leave, uh, you know, design your assets to leave a little bit of room

411
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,465
above and below the letters, uh, to make room for these, these accents.

412
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:47,406
Okay?

413
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:52,052
A little bit about character sets.

414
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:54,933
Running out of time, so I might have to power through.

415
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:59,116
But there's usually packaged in different ways.

416
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:01,237
I wanted to show a couple acronyms.

417
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:05,339
STD is short for standard, which is usually

418
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,080
the smallest available retail package.

419
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:09,481
Pro has more.

420
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:10,442
Comm has more.

421
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:16,305
They're just different sizes and ultimately different language support.

422
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:21,008
You might have a font, for instance, that has

423
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:24,252
Greek and Cyrillic and Latin all designed to match

424
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:26,916
in the same font file. It might be packaged as

425
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:32,304
WGL, W1G, or something like Pan-European. And that would

426
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:32,564
cover.

427
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:35,948
you know, almost all of Europe.

428
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:40,510
China is a hot topic, so I wanted to mention these.

429
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,931
SC for Simplified Chinese, or TC for Traditional Chinese.

430
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:48,831
With Simplified Chinese, it might be packaged as PRC,

431
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:51,292
which stands for the People's Republic of China,

432
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:53,252
China's official name.

433
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,113
Or with Traditional Chinese, it's HK for Hong Kong.

434
00:26:58,134 --> 00:26:59,794
And I believe those are, you know,

435
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:02,635
it's with the regional preferences, right?

436
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,002
So, in a way, you could also have, say, for example,

437
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:14,145
a simplified Chinese font that has just standard Latin

438
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:16,426
packaged with it, or something like,

439
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,548
I'm just giving you examples of how,

440
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:21,089
kind of, it's kind of a little bit modular,

441
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:24,431
where you can package different language coverage together.

442
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:31,026
Licensing and cost is always a big question.

443
00:27:32,148 --> 00:27:35,514
So it's hard to talk about it.

444
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:38,879
But let's just pretend fonts are coffee for a second.

445
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:47,951
Free fonts can have pitfalls, and, like, misincurring or punctuation, or they might be free for

446
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:50,232
personal use, but not for distribution.

447
00:27:51,732 --> 00:27:54,613
Some free fonts are designed by professionals, however.

448
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:57,034
You know, there's some good open source fonts.

449
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:03,037
But just be aware of, of who you're getting it from, and, you know, check the license

450
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:05,618
to see what, what you can and cannot do with it.

451
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,953
And, you know, fonts are valuable pieces of software,

452
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:11,833
just like games.

453
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:16,436
So, you know, piracy is a problem in the font world, too.

454
00:28:18,177 --> 00:28:20,679
Commercial fonts are almost always of higher quality

455
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,959
and consistency.

456
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,860
You know, like a branded cup of coffee.

457
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:25,782
You usually get what you pay for.

458
00:28:27,362 --> 00:28:29,824
Custom fonts are actually more common than you might think.

459
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:33,886
You can check out a blog like Brandenew, for example,

460
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:35,167
and they talk a lot about...

461
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,451
you know, about branding and stuff,

462
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:41,293
and you'll see just how frequent that is.

463
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:45,254
Custom fonts can sometimes be more expensive,

464
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:46,815
but you get exactly what you want.

465
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,697
So here's just an example of a custom font.

466
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:53,858
It was just Latin to begin with,

467
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:56,300
and they added Greek and Cyrillic

468
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,080
to ship it to more markets,

469
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:02,242
and they also added these platform-specific icons to it.

470
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:05,524
So scalable vector assets inside the font.

471
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,229
And we see this on the web frequently too,

472
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:14,050
with icon sets and within a font.

473
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:17,872
So almost all type foundries will do custom fonts,

474
00:29:18,572 --> 00:29:23,853
and there are both AAA and Indie size type foundries.

475
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:28,094
So contact your favorite type designer or whoever,

476
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,495
and I'm sure they'd be happy to answer questions

477
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,716
about their fonts or help you pick something

478
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,296
if you're stuck or whatever.

479
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:37,017
So, the recap.

480
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:39,979
We talked about mood and the style of the typefaces,

481
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,402
stereotypes, using harmony or contrast

482
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,763
with the rest of your game.

483
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:49,646
Talked a little bit about readability, hierarchy,

484
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:51,987
and spacing specifics.

485
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:55,510
And then how fonts relate to localization

486
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,591
and packaging and cost.

487
00:29:58,392 --> 00:29:59,653
So, that's the show for today.

488
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,673
Thank you.

489
00:30:00,693 --> 00:30:01,154
Thank you.

490
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,516
Thank you.

491
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:04,716
Thank you.
