1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,322
I'm Ilian Mellon, or Natsali Lahet outside of the internet.

2
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:11,123
I make art that people call games.

3
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:14,465
I started doing this in the late 90s, early 2000s.

4
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:17,367
And at that time, it was considered net art.

5
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:19,048
But my interest in art on computers

6
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:20,689
has always been more complex than that.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,031
My most recent project is Everything is Going to be OK.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,661
As you can imagine, this sort of work isn't exactly financially sustainable.

9
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,121
It doesn't pay for itself.

10
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:39,082
People do support it and sometimes pay with a pay-what-you-want option, but I largely

11
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,762
pay for making this out of my own pocket.

12
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:46,323
The pattern my career has taken over the years is to do contracting work, mostly web development,

13
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:47,363
to pay for making this.

14
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:51,704
I live as meagerly as possible so that all my resources can go into this.

15
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:53,104
This is my passion.

16
00:00:53,184 --> 00:00:54,325
It's something that I have to do.

17
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,965
I view myself as an artist, and making this is my drive.

18
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:04,747
The conversations of business and financial success surrounding my art have been a strong point of contention throughout the time that I have been doing this.

19
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:10,629
To me it's not about the money, to everyone else it should be, otherwise I am a failure as a functional member of society.

20
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,530
Good work is often measured against how much money it has made in order to be considered good.

21
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,696
That being said, I'm not a business success,

22
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:27,698
but I am going to discuss my own personal measurement

23
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:29,579
for success and the success of my art.

24
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,041
I very much believe that some of the important things in life

25
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,482
can't be quantified by monetary value,

26
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:36,543
and art is one of those.

27
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:40,005
To me, art is about dissent, raising questions,

28
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,126
pointing at the beauty of life, or making

29
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,607
the darkness in life tolerable.

30
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:47,169
It's uniquely expressing views and giving a voice to topics

31
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,329
that need to be expressed.

32
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,211
Sometimes these topics aren't popular.

33
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,795
There's a comfort zone of acceptable or successful content that people are willing to consume,

34
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,377
and I feel like art is about challenging that comfort zone and pushing for more.

35
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:02,380
Art like this doesn't sell like entertainment does.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,562
Most art relies on grants or external support to exist.

37
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:11,146
For example, my grandfather was a popular sculptor in Slovenia.

38
00:02:12,617 --> 00:02:15,238
His work was strongly anti-capitalist.

39
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:17,940
Most of his best was socialist-inspired commentary

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,461
about, for example, rich people putting poor people

41
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,222
into meat grinders in order to make meals

42
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:23,242
for the rich upper class,

43
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,463
poor people carrying crosses up a hill

44
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:27,784
with rich people depicted as devils in top hats

45
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:28,825
mocking them, and so on.

46
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:31,246
As you can imagine, his work would sometimes

47
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:32,006
get him in trouble.

48
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,208
This was true for many artists coming from his background.

49
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:36,468
Art raised dissent.

50
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:38,549
On the other hand, this dissent wasn't

51
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:40,230
a sustainable financial model.

52
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,593
But this is why our society needs art.

53
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:45,816
Art is a conduit for social change.

54
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,372
Despite the obvious financial or social setbacks,

55
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:55,853
artists will make art anyway.

56
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,896
This is not sustainable for me, but making art matters to me

57
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:01,878
because art is vital for the health of a society.

58
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:04,881
So here's an interesting challenge worth considering.

59
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,203
Art like this will often not be recognized

60
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:09,825
in the historic time frame that it is made in and for.

61
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:12,407
It will often be laughed at, but these struggles

62
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,449
can lead to social change and inspire others

63
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,551
to work outside of established comfort zones.

64
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,834
Some messages are too political, too edgy, too controversial, but need to be said anyway.

65
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:26,838
It's difficult to weigh money as a metric for success against art like this.

66
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,702
The going stereotype is that many artists die in poverty.

67
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:34,366
What we laugh at today ends up being the misunderstood genius of tomorrow

68
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,008
whose work, after death, makes money.

69
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,803
Were they a failure while alive?

70
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:41,826
Can we recognize this work while it's socially relevant?

71
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,788
Did sales define their art's value?

72
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,711
You cannot place a price on things like dissent,

73
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,813
yet artistic dissent is a critical component

74
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,095
to the health of a society,

75
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:51,556
and things like this improve life.

76
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:54,598
Here, I don't think money can define value.

77
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:57,719
For example, you cannot financially measure sentimental value.

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,922
One item might be priceless to one individual, and to everyone else it is trash.

79
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:07,744
Applying a price on some things may even diminish their value because it does not take into

80
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:11,565
account things like human impact, social impact, sentimental value, or personal worth.

81
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:16,313
My first project was released in 1999.

82
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,894
It was political commentary about poverty, war,

83
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:20,215
homelessness, and refugees.

84
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,376
And yeah, that's the name, Blue Suburbia.

85
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:25,937
Most of it was presented as interactive literature,

86
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:28,058
a combination of an animated feature

87
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:30,599
that you interact with and experience the writing in.

88
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
You unravel messages as you interact.

89
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:34,961
Over the years, I have received what feels like

90
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,782
thousands of messages from people saying

91
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:38,983
that it has helped them, touched them,

92
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:40,604
changed their life, made them want

93
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:41,785
to pursue a creative career.

94
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,567
and often help them through some serious dark times.

95
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:46,849
I used to get about a message every day

96
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,171
because the project had a stylist email form

97
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:50,512
that fit one of the environments.

98
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,095
I've also received a handful of messages

99
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:54,876
from people that said that it saved their life.

100
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,201
If you make work that speaks to a deeper human condition

101
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:02,964
and admits a type of brokenness in our society,

102
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:05,106
I feel like it's a message of solidarity

103
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,047
for others that are undergoing the same.

104
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:12,128
Many of these emails were very personal, but there is something about art that gets people

105
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,770
to open up and examine their lives.

106
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,432
Art like this makes people feel less alone.

107
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:20,696
The topic might be dark, but the fact that it admits this darkness speaks to a type of

108
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:20,957
hope.

109
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,600
Even when admitting hopelessness, that admission gives people hope.

110
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,563
Like I said, it speaks tremendously to solidarity.

111
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:33,068
It was a lot to take in at the time, but at the same time, it showed me how important

112
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:34,349
it is to make stuff like this.

113
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:42,623
One conversation that I think about sometimes was a kid in Japan that emailed me thanking me for this project.

114
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:47,164
They said that they were inspired to make a virtual simulation to help their friend stop self-harming.

115
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:51,685
Their idea was if they could do it in a virtual environment, they wouldn't do it in real life.

116
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:56,766
On the surface, this is very grim, but this was a real problem that they wanted to fix.

117
00:05:57,307 --> 00:06:02,788
This is exactly what art is suited for, addressing issues that you won't be able to address in any other capacity,

118
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:04,408
especially in a consumer entertainment.

119
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:09,398
It's about challenging social stigma and talking about things we don't talk about.

120
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,091
It was a very personal conversation, but this is exactly the value measurement that I quantify art against.

121
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:18,336
The human value is the true value here.

122
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:21,599
My peers would criticize me for throwing my talents away

123
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,220
on social criticism in my art.

124
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,362
For example, why does something this beautiful

125
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:28,345
have to be so depressing, anti-capitalist, heavy-handed,

126
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:29,766
have this kind of message?

127
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,348
At the time in these commercial circles,

128
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:34,950
it was very uncool to talk about social injustice,

129
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,171
poverty, war, and so on.

130
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:38,432
This was a very commercial crowd.

131
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,093
They were, by popular standards,

132
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,513
very successful in their business.

133
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:45,174
Why risk appearing opinionated and controversially so

134
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:46,075
if you can make money?

135
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:48,115
Challenging things is risky,

136
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:51,136
but it is exactly this risk that makes art so valuable.

137
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,071
So it was an interesting contrast.

138
00:06:55,272 --> 00:06:57,793
To my peers, I was a failure and wasted talent.

139
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:59,974
To people that played this, I changed their lives.

140
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,015
So how do you place value on this?

141
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,416
If I quit pursuing this art, I would

142
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:07,158
be a successful creative professional.

143
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:10,059
If I pursued this art, then I am socially

144
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:12,381
viewed as lacking ambition or wasting my talent.

145
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:15,902
How our culture dictates value has always fascinated me.

146
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:20,024
If we didn't measure value by money, then I feel like art would matter more.

147
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:24,666
Money serves a purpose, but it isn't the end-all defining factor of success.

148
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:29,368
To me, lives touched, people influenced, making the world better is what matters.

149
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:32,510
As artists, we have a social responsibility to do that.

150
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:37,254
I realize how cheesy that sounds, but this is why I do it.

151
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:41,116
I believe artists should exercise their talents in a way that will make the world better,

152
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,917
bring social change, or challenge people to be better.

153
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,418
We assert humanity through our work.

154
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:51,820
There's something valuable to be learned from art and artistic descent in regards to how

155
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,581
we measure business success, financial success, or even entertainment success.

156
00:07:56,341 --> 00:08:00,843
The bigger picture here being how we can help society and benefit those around us through

157
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:01,203
our work.

158
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:02,823
Thank you.

159
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,456
Robin Baumgarten from Wiley Game.

160
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:19,682
Hello everyone.

161
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:26,868
So I'm going to talk to you today about hardware games and how I make them and how I live of

162
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:27,008
them.

163
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:31,152
And yes, that's what it's going to be about.

164
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:39,935
So it's me. I'm living in London. I used to do mobile games, but now I'm knee-deep into experimental hardware games and

165
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,679
most recently also doing that full-time, and I'm gonna

166
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:47,424
talk to you today about how that came to be and

167
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,186
How it works for me

168
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:50,888
doing this stuff

169
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,170
So first of all, I have been doing experimental art

170
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,492
and experimental games, hardware games,

171
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:59,453
for about five years, six years.

172
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:01,374
This is the first thing I showed.

173
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:03,396
That was the first alt-control GDC.

174
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,097
It's like a dozen sliders.

175
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:06,638
So only eight of them.

176
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,021
But, can I turn down the volume, please?

177
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:13,743
So it's like automatically moving little sliders.

178
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:17,586
Yeah, it was a cool little experiment,

179
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:19,567
but it was just kind of very self-contained.

180
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,451
good start to experiment with this. Another thing I built...

181
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:32,419
is this moving knife on a motor.

182
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:34,600
This is not a commercial game.

183
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:41,767
But yeah, it's set up so it doesn't quite cut through the skin.

184
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,069
I built this with three friends at a game jam,

185
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:51,932
and it's quite a nice experiment into pain.

186
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:56,035
Another thing I built, and I'm showing this this year

187
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:57,737
at the Alt Control GDC exhibition,

188
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,018
it's called Wobble Garden.

189
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:00,400
So it's like a lot of little springs,

190
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,142
and they kind of light up and are pretty.

191
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:08,972
So you can see it from tomorrow at the old control GDC exhibition amongst a lot of other cool exhibitions

192
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:12,576
But yeah, so these are my experimental games

193
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:18,802
They're on my website. There's other experiments and I mostly make them like as part of game jams or kind of

194
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:24,427
Just to to see what I can do with force feedback or different sensors and so on

195
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:28,659
And one of those experiments that I did at a game jam

196
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:29,920
is called Line Wobbler.

197
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:32,804
And that's what I'm going to talk about today, mostly.

198
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,688
So that is a one-dimensional dungeon crawler.

199
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,791
And I made it about three years ago at a game jam,

200
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,333
together with Matthias Maschek.

201
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:42,829
And it works like this.

202
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,931
So it's basically, you have this green line,

203
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,432
and you're trying to reach the top.

204
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:48,752
And there's different obstacles on the way,

205
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:49,533
these little red dots.

206
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:53,976
And you can defeat them by wobbling this spring joystick.

207
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:57,498
And there's different levels, like this is waterfalls,

208
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:58,498
or more enemies.

209
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:01,340
And you can see how you have to shake the controller.

210
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,361
And yeah, it started as a little experiment,

211
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:06,502
but the feedback for this was very positive.

212
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,482
So I decided, okay, maybe there is something here

213
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:11,763
that I can take further and show it at more places.

214
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:14,604
And that's what I've been doing basically

215
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:15,544
for the last three years.

216
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,465
Yeah, if you wanna know more about the making of this game,

217
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:23,206
I gave a talk last year together with Alex Fleetwood.

218
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:25,186
He works on Beasts of Balance,

219
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,067
which is a cool hybrid stacking game.

220
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:30,768
And that's the title of the talk.

221
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:34,030
And yeah, so there I talk about the making of

222
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,793
and the challenges in the industrial design as well.

223
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,756
For example, making custom springs in a spring factory

224
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:42,298
because the normal ones weren't strong enough,

225
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:45,361
especially when kids play it or drunk people.

226
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:48,904
And yeah, and iterating the designs

227
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:50,886
through a lot of playtesting like this.

228
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:56,331
It's a very helpful cat at the local hack space.

229
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,422
But yeah, so if you have these games,

230
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:03,286
there's different ways you can approach taking them further.

231
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:08,150
And one, so like this three ways I've kind of outlined here.

232
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,773
So that is doing small scale installation art.

233
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:13,155
That's basically what I'm doing.

234
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:15,817
And I'm gonna explain how you can take a prototype

235
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:17,859
to this installation art.

236
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:25,626
process. Another option is licensing it out, so like arcades, toy companies, so talk to

237
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:31,471
Hasbro briefly and Bandai Namco, but it didn't work out with them. But it's definitely a

238
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:37,155
way to go and I know they're looking for hobbyist inventors for their new toys at all times.

239
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:38,296
It's another way.

240
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:39,958
And Kickstarter mass production is another way.

241
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:42,900
So that's what the Beasts of Balance guys did fairly

242
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,520
successfully.

243
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,762
But it's a lot of business overhead.

244
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:49,104
And all the parts involved are not that interesting to me.

245
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,505
That's why I haven't done it, basically.

246
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:52,287
But it's definitely a viable way to go.

247
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:56,290
So however, if you do like keep it small

248
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,872
and do this like art route, in quotes, I guess,

249
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:03,315
there is like a thing I call the exhibition progression.

250
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,366
and it's basically showing it at more and more general events.

251
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:11,007
So I started out showing line mobiler and other stuff

252
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:15,350
at like alt control GDC, which is like one of the best ways

253
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,372
to show weird stuff, and it doesn't really

254
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:20,294
need to be finished or, I mean, maybe finished, but.

255
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:24,317
not very well polished.

256
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:27,079
Berlin is an amazing festival.

257
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,701
If you haven't been to Berlin, it's

258
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:33,023
a good way to see the city and see Europe's best festival.

259
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:35,805
Fantastic Arcade shows weird stuff.

260
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:38,627
And then once you've shown it a few times or even before,

261
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,609
you can show it at more normal conventions,

262
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,431
like Eurogamer Expo, Gamescom, Tokyo Game Show.

263
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,833
And they are becoming more receptive to weird art,

264
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,334
like experimental hardware games.

265
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:54,318
and you don't necessarily need to send them a build. It's like, often it works with trust,

266
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:58,461
I guess, or if you have shown it before, they believe that it could be a thing that runs.

267
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,273
Yeah, or more general artsy events are possible too,

268
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:07,194
so like music film festivals, South by Southwest,

269
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:09,314
although I had big issues with Line Mobile

270
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,734
at South by Southwest because it didn't fit

271
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:11,355
in the game category.

272
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,715
It said, oh, you should just submit it to the design track,

273
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:15,015
and the design said, oh no, this is a game,

274
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,236
you should submit it to the game track.

275
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:19,376
So it's like somewhere in between, which is kind of fun,

276
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:22,037
but it's, yeah, so I haven't shown it there.

277
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:24,439
Maker Faires, another cool way to show games.

278
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,902
There's a lot of kids there strongly playtesting your game.

279
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:31,525
So this, for example, was at the DigiPlay Spaces,

280
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,706
which is part of the Toronto International Film Festival.

281
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:36,208
It turns out film festivals have really good budgets,

282
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:39,531
so they usually pay more for showing stuff.

283
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:42,854
So this was one of my favorite exhibitions, actually.

284
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:43,334
So it's like.

285
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:46,936
really well curated and they flew me in.

286
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,717
So if that would happen every month I'd be sad,

287
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:50,958
but it only happens once.

288
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,680
So yeah, and then later on you can show it at museums.

289
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,421
So once you've shown it enough,

290
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,882
then chances are curators will have noticed your game.

291
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:05,921
they contact you or I can contact them to show it at more general museums.

292
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:09,924
So that leads into how can you get paid for doing this.

293
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,647
And so contacting museums is the first step.

294
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:16,711
So for me it has mostly been passive, so I can't really give you much advice on that.

295
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:22,416
So I have been emailed by curators, but they said they have seen it at Indiecade and all these events.

296
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:26,400
So showing it as much as you can is definitely one way to attract their attention.

297
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:28,662
The next step is negotiating price.

298
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:31,383
So that's always a kind of like a weird black box

299
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:32,863
of figuring things out.

300
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,564
Luckily for me, one of the first things where I showed it,

301
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:38,426
they said, oh, we have a fixed price of 500 euros.

302
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:41,087
We're going to give you for a one week showcase.

303
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,527
And I said, yes, this is very good.

304
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:46,912
I send it to them and that's kind of been my benchmark from then on.

305
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:50,916
So sometimes I try to go up and then usually it would work.

306
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:55,401
So I'm kind of still figuring out where to price it.

307
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,403
And it obviously depends on the size of the museum.

308
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:03,845
Maintenance is a big issue. Obviously if you do hardware things, things break constantly.

309
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:06,967
You don't only have software bugs, but you also have hardware bugs, and then figuring

310
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:11,829
out which of the two it is is often very tricky. I had a lot of issues with the spring, for

311
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,152
example, that used to break all the time because people would pull on it instead of doing what

312
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:16,552
they should.

313
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:21,152
But yeah, so for funding, there's several ways.

314
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,032
And I'm going to go through them fairly quickly.

315
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:25,633
So commission installations is one way to do it.

316
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,154
This is, I think, my favorite thing I've done so far.

317
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:31,995
It's a Christmas tree installation of line wobbler.

318
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:36,796
So this is like a double helix, 25 meters long of LEDs.

319
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,157
And line wobbler, you can play line wobbler on it.

320
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,518
And it looks a bit Christmas-y because I changed the colors

321
00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:42,178
to be flickering.

322
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:44,699
So this is like a short video of it.

323
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:45,439
Yes.

324
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,546
So it's kind of empty because we have to set it up

325
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,627
like at 2 AM in the morning when the station is closed.

326
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,389
So it's like very long nights.

327
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,091
But I was sponsored by the London Games Festival.

328
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,133
So I approached them about something else.

329
00:16:58,453 --> 00:16:59,954
But they said, oh, yeah, actually, we are also

330
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:02,016
talking to train stations right now.

331
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:05,518
And then they give a demo at a train station

332
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,300
of their portfolio.

333
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,781
And someone said, hey, this looks

334
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,463
like a Christmas tree installation or decoration.

335
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:12,584
And we don't have a Christmas tree yet.

336
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:16,546
So it came together fairly randomly and outside my control.

337
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:19,087
But it's a cool thing also if you

338
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:21,908
want to go further into installation art,

339
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:22,788
like light festivals.

340
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,290
One of rentals, that's the thing I've done most.

341
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,531
It's good for short events.

342
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:29,891
There's usually no maintenance issues

343
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:33,233
because it only takes a short time.

344
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:35,414
Or they only have it for a short time,

345
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:36,674
and you can reuse the kits.

346
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:39,150
Another thing is selling.

347
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,013
So I'm still haven't really fully figured out how to do that.

348
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:46,818
I mean, I'm doing it, but like maintenance is a big open question.

349
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,920
You know, what should be the warranty?

350
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:51,283
How long should I support it?

351
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:54,126
Should I make lots of spare parts all the time?

352
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:59,728
And production of the kits itself is a question that I haven't figured out.

353
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:03,149
I'm making them all by hand right now, and it takes about one to two days for each copy.

354
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:05,029
So that drives the price up, obviously.

355
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:08,070
And then the price itself is an open question, because, like, you know, museums,

356
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,490
you should add the artist fee.

357
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,971
If it's friends or idols you look up to, maybe it's lower price.

358
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,492
So Tim Schafer really wanted one, and of course I sold him one at cost,

359
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:20,733
and he has one now, so I'm quite happy about that.

360
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:25,772
Leasing is another option. I haven't really looked into that much because it's

361
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,876
It is tricky to set up a good contract for that

362
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:34,380
But it makes the maintenance burn clear and it's easier to plan for venues as well

363
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,963
And it's a more regular way to get income

364
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:41,161
And yeah, so just quickly going forward,

365
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,902
I want to do bigger installations in the future,

366
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,244
like Festival of Lights could be really cool,

367
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:48,187
and arcades and bars are the next step for line wobblers,

368
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,309
so I need to make it really spill-proof

369
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,931
and angry, drunk people-proof.

370
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:55,733
That's gonna be a very interesting challenge,

371
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,595
and obviously making new games along the way.

372
00:18:58,696 --> 00:18:59,997
That's all for me, thank you.

373
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:08,429
Okay, nice.

374
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:10,330
Hi everyone, what's up GDC?

375
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:14,512
My name's TJ Hughes, I'm a game developer

376
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:16,334
and technical artist from St. Louis, Missouri.

377
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,115
Midwest represent, yo.

378
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:23,253
So I'm gonna do, that's where I started my solo company,

379
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:24,674
Terrifying Jellyfish, as you can see here.

380
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:28,318
But yeah, I'm gonna do nine takeaways in 10 minutes, rather.

381
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,841
So without further ado, so yeah,

382
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,863
these are just gonna be all anecdotal takeaways

383
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:37,967
that I've learned from working on a experimental game.

384
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:39,909
So here we go.

385
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:44,574
So just a little bit about my game.

386
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,175
So it's a food art game called Nour.

387
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:51,216
And it's a game where you just play with your food as if

388
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:51,977
you're a kid again.

389
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:54,918
You just mash buttons and have fun.

390
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,878
So there's no goals or objectives to obstruct you

391
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:59,759
from the fun that is just throwing noodles and other

392
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,360
food items into just a ball of food horror.

393
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:06,342
And it's controlled by a MIDI Fighter 3D.

394
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:07,322
So that's this device.

395
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:08,503
It has 16 buttons on it.

396
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,763
And they all glow and are shiny.

397
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:16,778
And so it's usually a controller used by like producers to make music and stuff like that

398
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:23,363
But you can already see why this is like a game that required an alternative approach to be brought into existence

399
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:28,366
So take away number one the fact that your project is weird isn't a disadvantage at all

400
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:34,671
When you tell people about your experimental game, it's probably a breath of fresh air like they're probably

401
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:35,551
like

402
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,851
it's okay to receive a surprised or incredulous reaction

403
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,371
to someone seeing your game idea.

404
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:46,453
This was actually an advantage during Norse Kickstarter

405
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,774
because while people are exploring the video game section,

406
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:52,694
I think the last thing they expected to see

407
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:54,335
was a bowl of ramen.

408
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:56,916
Like, does this even belong here?

409
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:01,237
And so, never have a negative or deprecating attitude

410
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:02,577
towards your game's unusualness.

411
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:06,977
Takeaway number two, when your game is satisfaction

412
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:10,178
or feedback based, players expect that feedback immediately.

413
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:11,459
And I learned this the hard way.

414
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,999
Once I was demoing Noor at a bar last year

415
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:16,280
and someone came up to play the game's bubble tea scene.

416
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,521
It's the scene where you just like mash buttons

417
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,021
and like throw boba into a cup

418
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,941
and like it's nice and fun, right?

419
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:25,082
At the time the scene wasn't complete yet.

420
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:28,763
For some reason, this infuriated that man.

421
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:31,224
Which shouldn't be because if anything,

422
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,385
Noor's supposed to be like calming and relaxing.

423
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:36,446
But so some of the buttons were reacting as expected,

424
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:40,287
but the ones that didn't react yet

425
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:44,569
seemed to have elevated him into a state of rage and rudeness.

426
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:47,870
And so he actually kind of raised his voice at me.

427
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,290
He said something along the lines of, OK,

428
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:52,311
when I press a button, I expect something to happen.

429
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:53,432
I need this feedback.

430
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:58,455
And before his state of rage reached like violent levels,

431
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,178
I had to just like quickly explain to him like,

432
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,300
yo, yo, the game's super early in development,

433
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,781
not every button works yet.

434
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:06,823
Like, I totally get what you're saying.

435
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,364
And he's like, yeah, okay, okay, I get it.

436
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:10,105
But still, people are gonna expect it.

437
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,226
They're gonna expect something to happen.

438
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:19,223
He then apologized if he seemed abrasive, but in that moment I knew what it felt like

439
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:22,625
to be an Overwatch developer when Mercy got nerfed.

440
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:27,849
So that was probably the most valuable piece of feedback I've ever received from a playtest

441
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:28,189
session.

442
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:33,252
Give player input equal and apparent feedback or you just might start a bar fight.

443
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:37,545
Number three, use your game's uniqueness

444
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,887
to carve out a niche that no one knew existed.

445
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,929
A guy who's been on the Food Network

446
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:44,050
tweeted about my game.

447
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:48,894
I think how it happens, I tweeted at Guy Fieri

448
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:51,376
saying, hey, I'm making a food game,

449
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:52,236
you should check it out.

450
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:54,418
But of course, he didn't respond.

451
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:56,800
He's a busy dude, he's a living meme,

452
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,141
he's not gonna really see that.

453
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,363
But it got enough retweets that someone who's been on the Food Network got tagged in it

454
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:09,066
and he actually checked it out and thought it was super cool, which that was awesome

455
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:14,310
to me because here's a crossover I never thought would happen, a prestigious chef tweeting

456
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,350
about a weird indie game.

457
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:20,234
Say Noor wasn't about food and it was a space-themed turn-based strategy game.

458
00:23:20,654 --> 00:23:24,917
If a Food Network chef tweeted about it, that'd be cool, but it probably wouldn't be the most

459
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:27,679
valuable piece of endorsement that you get during your campaign.

460
00:23:28,902 --> 00:23:30,724
So, from that I learned just like,

461
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,806
don't limit your outreach to just folks in the games industry,

462
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:37,089
expand your reach to like people in completely different industries

463
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:38,851
or adjacent industries.

464
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:40,852
Like you never know whose interest you might pique.

465
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:44,816
Number four, don't be scared to have unusual inspirations.

466
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:48,238
A lot of games are derivative of a format.

467
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,640
Some games focus on...

468
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:54,054
The first person shooter format, some take from cinema, like Heavy Rain.

469
00:23:55,415 --> 00:24:01,398
But my game is inspired mostly by Instagram videos and Tumblr posts of really well photographed food that I collect.

470
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:06,100
So you kind of believe I was kind of stumped the first time someone asked what inspired Noor.

471
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,742
But I have a candid response I go with now.

472
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,100
uh... at the time is just like i i don't know it's a kind of subconscious i just

473
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,381
like to see a lot of cool pictures of internet so and i can i want to replicate

474
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:22,223
and three d uh... and this kind of show me like if there's a feeling or mood or

475
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:25,703
an aesthetic that you want to capture an interactive form uh... don't hesitate to

476
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:28,964
chase it like no matter what uh... medium it was introduced to you in

477
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:31,405
uh... number five

478
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:35,527
don't be afraid to take feedback from how you see others play your game.

479
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:40,308
So the MIDI Fighter 3D has an accelerometer in it for tilt controls.

480
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,149
And a lot of the scenes in N.U.R.D. there's this magnet button

481
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:48,150
which will kind of pull everything up into like all one ball in one spot.

482
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,870
But when I saw players press this button,

483
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,791
I noticed they would also tilt the controller,

484
00:24:53,011 --> 00:24:57,872
like even though like that wasn't a thing that the game reacted to.

485
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:00,892
And like it would be easy to tell them like, hey, that doesn't do anything.

486
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:03,670
But I think a really observant developer

487
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:04,891
should take this as a hint,

488
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,453
because your player's subconscious

489
00:25:06,493 --> 00:25:08,234
is basically designing the game for you.

490
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:12,337
So if there's a functionality the player expects,

491
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,578
I'll gratify them on that,

492
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:16,521
or else I risk almost starting a bar fight again.

493
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:19,323
So the open-endedness of the game

494
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:20,484
really allowed me to do that.

495
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,301
When designing for a Wii controller,

496
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:25,881
you can try making your design flexible.

497
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,643
Since not everyone's gonna have a $200 MIDI controller

498
00:25:28,683 --> 00:25:30,344
sitting around, I made newer compatible

499
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:31,804
with keyboard and mouse.

500
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:33,525
And this was an easy fix.

501
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:36,107
But I still wanted players to experiment

502
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:37,187
with how the game was controlled.

503
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:40,209
So I made the game compatible with any MIDI controller

504
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:40,849
that you plug in.

505
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:44,826
So if you wanted to play N.O.R.A. on like a launchpad or an MPK mini, you can do that.

506
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:49,832
And this kind of became a meta game in itself because everyone was kind of scrambling to see what kind of

507
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:52,395
increasingly ridiculous controllers they could play the game with.

508
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:58,883
Um, it's sort of just like the recent meme where people try to run Doom on the most ridiculous devices they can.

509
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:01,782
Someone asked me like,

510
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:04,364
does this mean I can play Nuer on my MIDI guitar?

511
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:05,564
And I'm like, sure, maybe.

512
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,227
But it adds a lot of potential to the game's virality

513
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,069
because then there's a joy of discovery

514
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:13,930
in finding out the different ways you can play.

515
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,771
And so that's kind of how I use the game's

516
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:17,432
weird control scheme to its advantage.

517
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:21,495
Seven, scope out interest in your game early,

518
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:22,976
collect as much feedback as you can.

519
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,868
When I first showed off screenshots of Nour,

520
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,669
it was before it was even a game really.

521
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:30,550
It was just an art test to see how delicious

522
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,771
I could make a 3D model look.

523
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,472
But any time I'd show people what I've done,

524
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,393
it started with the boba tea scene.

525
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:38,514
The response was always like,

526
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:40,195
oh man, this is making me so hungry.

527
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:42,055
This makes me crave bubble tea.

528
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:44,196
And so I became fascinated with the idea

529
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:47,398
of making people feel hungered through visual stimuli.

530
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:51,480
And this was just a fun side project

531
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,820
for me to experiment with,

532
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,941
but around last year.

533
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:56,607
my tweet of this 3D ramen gif blow up,

534
00:26:56,707 --> 00:26:58,607
and then Polygon decided to cover game,

535
00:26:58,647 --> 00:27:00,508
and that's when I realized,

536
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:03,768
okay, maybe I should make this into a full project.

537
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:07,109
So after seeing how amused the internet was

538
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:10,169
about 3D food gifs, I judged there was enough interest

539
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,750
in the game to justify a Kickstarter.

540
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,850
But this was really ideal because it showed that

541
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,731
my projection for success wasn't based off of chance.

542
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:20,991
It was something that I already knew about the game's hype

543
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:23,552
and how much engagement my game was getting.

544
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:28,124
And so if every project can be that sure of its own appeal,

545
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:30,464
I think that would save a lot of project managers

546
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,165
a lot of stress.

547
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:36,066
Number eight, don't be afraid to put your personality

548
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,107
into all layers of your creation.

549
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,807
So Nour is a very me project,

550
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,528
as you probably see how I'm dressed right now.

551
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,749
And yeah, I try to put as much of myself

552
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,849
into the game as I can.

553
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:49,750
And this not only applies to the game itself,

554
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,131
but just in all ways of how I present it.

555
00:27:54,955 --> 00:27:59,298
I really think that this can help also in the marketing and crowdfunding campaign because

556
00:27:59,318 --> 00:28:02,761
I've always found that things that have a human voice behind them get more engagement

557
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:05,122
than just a company or corporate sounding voice.

558
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:13,988
And so this person-oriented branding logic can apply to many aspects of your project.

559
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:16,486
So for example, during Nurse Kickstarter,

560
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:19,187
one of my reward tiers was called Sweet Doggo,

561
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,848
where you could submit a picture of your dog,

562
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:23,429
I would record a video of me analyzing

563
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,491
and rating that dog on a scale of one to 10.

564
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:29,873
Usually they got an 11, but this was just a fun thing

565
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:31,314
I would do on live streams every now and then.

566
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:35,055
But when I first showed this to peers for review,

567
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:36,896
they were like, are you sure you wanna include this?

568
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,517
But I was just like, okay, this is just me

569
00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:40,438
knowing my audience, and so.

570
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:41,779
I was like, sure.

571
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:44,820
But since it was a joke, I made it a limited tier,

572
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,980
only one person could get it.

573
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,581
But this turned out to be a mistake

574
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:49,361
because it was highly requested.

575
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,602
So I upped the amount and it sold out just immediately.

576
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:56,424
So this told me that there's value in being playful,

577
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:58,164
not only in your game's design,

578
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:00,445
but in every way that you present your game as well.

579
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:05,959
And lastly, number nine, don't be afraid to make a game that isn't a game.

580
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,024
When I was making Noir at some point, I played around with the idea of goals and objectives,

581
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:15,368
but I was more concerned with making Noir a fun and memorable experience for all,

582
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:20,032
rather than just making it fit the standard expectation of what a game is.

583
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:23,923
The goal of Noor isn't objective,

584
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:25,804
it's actually kind of subjective.

585
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:29,286
Objectives and traditional storytelling

586
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:31,888
usually involve conflict, and in games especially,

587
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,509
that conflict is solved through battle.

588
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:37,151
However, I wanted to take the experience of tasting food

589
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:39,052
and abstract that into a virtual experience.

590
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:42,674
But eating isn't necessarily a conflict-driven activity.

591
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:44,575
Like sure, you might have the eat

592
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:45,855
or you'll lose health conflict,

593
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:47,857
but exploring a concept like taste

594
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:49,658
and translating it to visual stimuli

595
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:50,018
is something.

596
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:53,880
that you can't possibly express through a score

597
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,801
or a combat system.

598
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:57,562
And I think that this is where we as developers

599
00:29:57,602 --> 00:29:58,282
have to get clever.

600
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:02,084
So thanks, I couldn't make a sign off screen

601
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,705
so I just uploaded the back of my business card.

602
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:03,965
Thanks a lot.

603
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:04,105
Ha ha.

604
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:04,245
Ha ha.

605
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:04,405
Ha ha.

606
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:04,525
Ha ha.

607
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:05,026
Ha ha.

608
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:05,166
Ha ha.

609
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:05,426
Ha ha.

610
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:11,209
Ha ha.

611
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:11,469
Cool.

612
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:12,129
All right.

613
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:12,289
Ha ha.

614
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:12,409
Ha ha.

615
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:12,529
Ha ha.

616
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:12,729
Ha ha.

617
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:12,849
Ha ha.

618
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:12,969
Ha ha.

619
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:13,130
Ha ha.

620
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,250
Ha ha.

621
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:16,254
Oh yeah, just a quick reminder,

622
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,534
this will be brought up again at the end of the talk,

623
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:20,475
I mean at the end of the panel,

624
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:21,975
but please rate this session.

625
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:25,036
It'll help all of us, and we're good people.

626
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,496
We deserve it in our hearts.

627
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:29,177
Okay, so this is my talk.

628
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:30,757
I didn't realize that we were supposed

629
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:31,937
to give them specific names,

630
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:33,798
so I'm gonna be calling mine Ultra Crime Hell.

631
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:36,539
My name is Heather Robertson.

632
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,559
Hi, I'm Heather.

633
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:39,799
My pronouns are she, her.

634
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,500
One time I was at this big shot industry party,

635
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,480
and this guy that I know walked by

636
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,840
with a couple of CEO types like.

637
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:45,982
falling behind when he just kind of said,

638
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:47,323
hey, that's Heather, she ate paper once.

639
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,446
That was about a year ago and I still haven't recovered.

640
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:52,588
I feel like that explains a lot about me as a person.

641
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:54,770
So I make games.

642
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,751
I make too many games.

643
00:30:56,871 --> 00:31:00,294
These are some of the games that I have made

644
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:00,975
since the start of 2017.

645
00:31:03,838 --> 00:31:06,420
Each of these is one that I am proud of,

646
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,821
except for that one in the top left.

647
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:08,922
That's a B-movie game,

648
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:10,523
but every time you beat it, it gets faster.

649
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:13,346
a pure two hours of shame.

650
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,609
So a quick caveat before we get going,

651
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:18,210
capitalism is super messed up,

652
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:21,133
and I'm super lucky to be in the position that I'm in

653
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:22,755
where I'm able to make all these games,

654
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,117
and even in my position, this is super risky.

655
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,859
I have a lot of fears about how I'm going to be able

656
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:29,701
to pay rent in a couple months.

657
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,683
Burnout is something that you really have to be aware of,

658
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:34,125
and game developers super need a union.

659
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,828
So proceed with caution when implementing what I'm about to tell you about.

660
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:41,970
Which is called the Heather Method because I'm egotistical as hell.

661
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:47,775
So this is how you maintain consistent output while also putting out work you're actually proud of,

662
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:51,017
which is a very difficult thing to do.

663
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,398
So let's look at that graph at the bottom right there.

664
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:59,181
On the top row, you have a developer who puts out a game every couple weeks, every month,

665
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:05,525
and each of those games is very strong, very interesting, and does exactly one thing very well.

666
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:13,807
And then on the bottom you have the developer who spends multiple months or even a year or even multiple years on a single game.

667
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:19,292
And each of those games is long and soulful and has their entire heart packed into it

668
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:22,294
and expresses a lot of things that they've been thinking about for a long time.

669
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:25,196
The Heather Methodist would be both of these people at once.

670
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:28,636
Now this might seem like double the work,

671
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:29,757
and it only slightly is,

672
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:34,099
but these two sides actually feed back into each other

673
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,179
in a really interesting way,

674
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:38,661
because the smaller games that you're working on

675
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,722
can actually be tests for the bigger game.

676
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:42,943
Say in your longer game you want to add, say,

677
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:44,063
a grappling hook mechanic.

678
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:49,066
Now, you could put that into the longer game and see how it works in that environment,

679
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:52,368
but that might involve messing with a very complicated architecture.

680
00:32:52,728 --> 00:32:56,151
So another way that you could do it is just make a smaller game that is specifically about

681
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,031
that grappling hook.

682
00:32:57,111 --> 00:33:03,455
Make it in an hour, a day, a week, no more than a month, put it out into the world, and

683
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:04,856
just see how people react to it.

684
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:10,680
And you can take that test and take the results of it and put it back into the original project.

685
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:22,375
This also gives you a lot of showstopper pieces with the bottom games that bring attention back into the smaller free games that you've been making which get 300 downloads on it because they're free.

686
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:28,318
So I've done this cycle three times so far. I'm currently working on the fourth and fifth iterations of it.

687
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:33,740
On the far left there is Ten Thousand Years, which is a ruins exploration poetry game.

688
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,244
about a nuclear waste disposal site 10,000 years in the future.

689
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:41,749
I made that in 2016, following that up with Secret Spaces,

690
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,612
which is about being gay and in a hole, in 2017.

691
00:33:46,678 --> 00:33:51,642
And following that up with gender act with the incredibly talented Reiner's ACI in 2018,

692
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:56,567
which is a post-apocalyptic gender punk visual novel about making out with monsters.

693
00:33:57,307 --> 00:33:57,728
It's rad.

694
00:33:58,008 --> 00:33:58,909
You get to beat up a tree.

695
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,213
So I'm currently working on the fourth and fifth iterations of the cycle right now with

696
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,638
Extreme Meat Punks Forever, which I'll talk about more later, and Eternity.

697
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:13,683
If you want to hear more about Eternity, which is a stealth horror game about a monster who

698
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,826
can change the past, come to my talk at 1.20 in North Hall.

699
00:34:18,084 --> 00:34:19,365
I got that little promo for ya.

700
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:23,767
Um, so here's how this has been working so far.

701
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:24,528
Pretty well.

702
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:25,948
It's all right.

703
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:29,610
It's good, it's hard, but you know, difficulty's rewarding.

704
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,091
I feel like we're all in this room

705
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:33,232
because we really like doing difficult things

706
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:34,513
for some goddamn reason.

707
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,931
Patreon is 100% of how I make this work.

708
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,992
Patreon is a godsend for this specific creative cycle

709
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:45,472
because it allows you to,

710
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:48,753
because the small games give that consistent output

711
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:51,814
that Patreon really craves and that constant,

712
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:55,074
and the larger games get people interested

713
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:56,215
in your work in the first place.

714
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:59,115
That's how you get your customers who keep coming back

715
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:00,456
with their showstopper pieces.

716
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,272
Now of course this is how it's been going so far.

717
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:07,133
So let's talk about the future for a minute

718
00:35:07,353 --> 00:35:09,974
because this is a cool thing.

719
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:11,155
I made 30 games last year.

720
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,136
I think that's really cool,

721
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:13,857
but I want to outdo myself this year.

722
00:35:14,337 --> 00:35:16,419
And so that's kind of what I want to talk about next.

723
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,319
I am...

724
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,185
making a new game this summer called Extreme Meatpunks Forever,

725
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:27,994
which is a serialized, story-based, hyperkinetic, anti-fascist mech brawler

726
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:31,419
about punk rock cryptids and giant robots made of meat.

727
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:38,405
It is an episodic game, which means that I am going to be putting out a new episode every so often.

728
00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:41,987
Most of the time, when people think of episodic games, they think of games that

729
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:46,130
come out once every few months, like Life is Strange or Kentucky Route Zero.

730
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,291
Please God, give me Act 5.

731
00:35:50,112 --> 00:35:54,095
And this is going to be going at a somewhat faster pace.

732
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:57,177
This is going to be a game that comes out every two weeks.

733
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:05,829
The first season of it is going to be six episodes, and I'm going to be trying my hardest to make my body physically do that.

734
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:12,099
As you can see there, there's visual novel sections and action sections and...

735
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,441
a bunch of weird murder poems, because that's just kind of how I roll.

736
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:22,706
So this is the plan for the next, I don't know, several months of my life, where I am

737
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:26,929
going to try and blend these two sides of development into the same thing.

738
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:31,613
Hopefully this will mean half the work instead of twice the work, but knowing me it'll probably

739
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:32,293
be twice the work.

740
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:38,498
So it's taking the shortness of the short games and the easy...

741
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:45,485
repeat time of the short games and fusing all those short games together into a longer experience,

742
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:50,892
which will hopefully make something that is rewarding, especially over a long period of time.

743
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,502
So there are some questions that I,

744
00:36:56,262 --> 00:37:00,065
like this is an experiment and I do have some questions

745
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:01,666
that I plan on answering.

746
00:37:01,726 --> 00:37:03,827
And hopefully next year I'll be able to give you a talk

747
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:04,748
about how this turned out.

748
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:05,729
I hope.

749
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,631
So first off, is this feasible?

750
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:13,974
Is this something that I can do in the amount of time

751
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,836
that I have been given to do it

752
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:18,177
because I need to pay rent this summer?

753
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,581
Is this reasonable?

754
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:23,943
Is this a thing where I can put it out into the world

755
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:25,504
and get more back than I put in?

756
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:27,125
And finally, will this work?

757
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,947
Can my body physically do this?

758
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:30,188
It's a lot of work.

759
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:31,468
I really hope the answer is yes.

760
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,032
So these are the three questions

761
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:37,513
that I am attempting to answer.

762
00:37:37,653 --> 00:37:40,135
I'm doing a lot of interesting stuff

763
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:43,317
with social media engagement.

764
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:45,879
For example, if you tweet with the hashtag meatpunks,

765
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:47,960
you have a chance for your name

766
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,561
to end up as a character in the game.

767
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,344
And because of the fast iteration time and the serialized nature of the game,

768
00:37:54,364 --> 00:37:58,305
that means that you can tweet about one update and immediately be in the next one,

769
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:01,667
which I feel is a really powerful thing.

770
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:04,388
I really hope that I can build a strong community around this.

771
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:08,390
I'm sort of basing some of this off of the podcast The Adventure Zone,

772
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,350
if any of you have heard of that.

773
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,400
All right, we got like two snaps and a woo.

774
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,180
All right, cool.

775
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:19,801
So yeah, those are the questions that I am going to

776
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,382
attempt to answer this summer.

777
00:38:21,942 --> 00:38:23,882
And right now all that I can truly say is,

778
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,823
let's find out together.

779
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:27,883
All right, thank you.

780
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:29,323
I'm Heather Robertson.

781
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:35,764
Okay, hello.

782
00:38:35,784 --> 00:38:36,705
I'm Heather Robertson.

783
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:45,884
My name is Kaho Abe. I'm a game designer and media artist based in New York City.

784
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:52,176
I design and build games that are physical and are often multiplayer games.

785
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:55,703
I make circuits and build custom controllers for my games

786
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:58,684
with the hope to engage people with each other

787
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:01,326
in ways they wouldn't normally otherwise.

788
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:06,648
And this is the reason why I make games.

789
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:10,250
This spark, this fleeting moment,

790
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,752
whatever you want to call it, between people,

791
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,653
this is really the reason why.

792
00:39:17,448 --> 00:39:18,989
Oh.

793
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:19,769
OK.

794
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,431
This is the reason why I make the games that I make.

795
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,774
Today, I'm going to talk about not so much my games,

796
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:31,397
but the path that I've taken to get to becoming

797
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:32,578
an independent game designer.

798
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:42,607
So I grew up in a Japanese household in the US and we played a lot of games together as a family since we were in a foreign environment.

799
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:49,313
And my mom actually designed a lot of games for her dinner parties and things.

800
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:54,317
And so my parents were always understood the potential of games in these social environments.

801
00:39:56,061 --> 00:40:02,664
I also grew up learning how to code and hacking electronics and things.

802
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:10,488
I just loved making things with the computer and trying to figure out how things worked.

803
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:15,770
And after college, I became a fashion designer.

804
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,651
That was a childhood dream of mine.

805
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:20,152
And I did that for a while,

806
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:22,633
until it became a little bit repetitive.

807
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:26,934
And then so I went to graduate school

808
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:30,316
to learn how to embed electronics into clothing.

809
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:35,118
And I learned how to use sensors and solder circuits.

810
00:40:35,678 --> 00:40:41,445
And while I was there, I took my first game design class.

811
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:46,530
And this was at Parsons Design and Technology.

812
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:48,252
There are people here from there.

813
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:51,836
But, and I took my first game design class

814
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:52,737
in Lake Fortuno.

815
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:55,259
and Katie Salen was the director there.

816
00:40:56,019 --> 00:41:01,222
And so games sort of was something I stumbled upon.

817
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:04,843
And it was great because this is the first time

818
00:41:04,883 --> 00:41:06,284
I felt like I found something

819
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:08,825
that satiated everything in my brain,

820
00:41:10,226 --> 00:41:12,207
all the things that my brain had been craving.

821
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:14,988
You know, games have to do with like systems,

822
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:17,149
thinking, logic, creativity, design.

823
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:20,774
technology, storytelling, all these things that I love.

824
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:24,498
And also the social impact of games really connected me

825
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,462
to my childhood and playing together,

826
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:29,064
games together as a family.

827
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:33,008
This is the wearable tech stuff that I did in school.

828
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:46,893
And then after I graduated in 2005, kept working in fashion design, and I didn't know what I wanted to do with the things that I'd studied.

829
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:58,337
And like an interaction designer was still kind of this vague job title in companies, and I tried a little bit to teach a little bit.

830
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:06,483
I didn't know if maybe joining another corporation would be similar to my fashion career.

831
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:12,166
And then I wanted to look into becoming an artist, but I didn't know what that meant.

832
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:18,349
And so it took a while to sort of interview and find out more about things out there,

833
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:23,972
trying to connect really what I wanted to do with what was out in the world.

834
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:28,474
The biggest change came in 2010.

835
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:36,974
When I became a fellow at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center, this is a non-profit that

836
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:44,138
supports media artists in New York City, that's located in New York City, and it would support

837
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:50,721
me for the next year and a half with my art practice of making social, physical, digital

838
00:42:50,741 --> 00:42:53,123
games in tech and wearables.

839
00:42:54,923 --> 00:43:00,044
And Eyebeam is an organization that also supports open source technology and culture.

840
00:43:00,064 --> 00:43:05,045
So it encouraged me to do, to share my practice with the public.

841
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:17,228
And so I had a chance to really do that through workshops, through talks, through other community involvement.

842
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:22,749
And this is where I started a monthly playtesting event with Come Out and Play.

843
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,391
which ran for about three years,

844
00:43:26,192 --> 00:43:27,834
sort of supporting the community

845
00:43:28,214 --> 00:43:31,178
that existed between art and games.

846
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:35,322
And in 2013, with Eyebeam's support,

847
00:43:35,762 --> 00:43:40,007
I was able to start a free after-school program

848
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:42,690
for high schoolers called Playable Fashion.

849
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:46,095
where they learned about programming, game design,

850
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:49,760
building circuits for custom wearable game controllers,

851
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,302
which is essentially my practice.

852
00:43:52,765 --> 00:43:56,430
And I teach that program now with a collaborator, Ramsey

853
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,014
Nasser, and we've been sharing the content.

854
00:43:59,574 --> 00:44:05,418
with educators and librarians recently in pedagogical development workshops.

855
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:12,603
And at Eyebeam, I was, oh this is from the play testing, I'm sorry.

856
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:16,946
This is from play testing. This is Eric Zimmerman's

857
00:44:18,347 --> 00:44:22,370
game that he was play testing. Oh, Natalie Posey and Eric Zimmerman's game.

858
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:27,096
And this is some content from the after-school program,

859
00:44:27,937 --> 00:44:32,802
just the embroidery hoop with inkjet printed,

860
00:44:33,623 --> 00:44:40,091
sort of almost like a map to guide people through lessons

861
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,174
to learn more about soft circuits.

862
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,771
And then I did another workshop series,

863
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:52,176
six-part workshop series called Beyond the Joystick,

864
00:44:52,617 --> 00:44:55,901
which has grown over the years into a class

865
00:44:55,941 --> 00:44:59,686
that I teach at the NYU Game Innovation Lab, where I'm.

866
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,617
currently an artist in residence.

867
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:08,782
And so it's funny because I never really thought of myself

868
00:45:09,062 --> 00:45:09,862
as an educator.

869
00:45:09,882 --> 00:45:14,165
I like to think of myself as an artist sharing her practice

870
00:45:14,205 --> 00:45:16,306
and exploring ideas with students,

871
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:18,808
no matter how young the students are.

872
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:28,032
What is most surprising is that I found creativity in education and because I view it as sort

873
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:34,415
of that I'm designing an experience for the students and it's been super satisfying for me.

874
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:45,979
So sometime during my career, sorry, sometime during my career I started really,

875
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:46,039
uh...

876
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:53,814
It hit me, especially at IBM, that I need to make decisions.

877
00:45:54,874 --> 00:45:58,037
I have to be creative with my career

878
00:45:58,217 --> 00:45:59,858
as much as I am with my work.

879
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:03,381
And so I would ask myself questions like,

880
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:05,083
where can my work exist?

881
00:46:06,404 --> 00:46:11,248
Is it in economics, art, games, informal, formal education?

882
00:46:11,915 --> 00:46:19,240
in DIY, and it was an important thing for me to realize, to be open to various opportunities,

883
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,642
and to be able to imagine my work existing in different ways and places.

884
00:46:25,264 --> 00:46:31,928
So now my work focuses on costumes as game controllers, exploring questions like when

885
00:46:31,968 --> 00:46:38,492
you dress up as an avatar in a game, when you dress up as the avatar in a game, can

886
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:40,053
you become the avatar?

887
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:45,677
If our costumes are embedded with sensors and we can move and act like an avatar,

888
00:46:46,017 --> 00:46:52,220
does that experience become more dramatic or immersive?

889
00:46:53,361 --> 00:46:55,702
And I'd be lying if I said my career is stable.

890
00:46:56,643 --> 00:47:01,166
Education helps, and also applying to these art grants,

891
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:06,068
contests, and residencies also help.

892
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:13,973
But I've been really grateful for the support structures and for the opportunities that

893
00:47:14,013 --> 00:47:17,615
have allowed me to continue down this path.

894
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:25,800
And when I'm lost, another thing that has helped guide me is asking myself, what makes

895
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,581
my brain happy, right?

896
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:30,583
Instead of following my heart, I follow my brain.

897
00:47:31,684 --> 00:47:36,066
And in the past, like parts of my brain have been happy at different times in my career,

898
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:41,910
but trying to find something that satisfies all of my brain has always gotten me closer

899
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,152
to where I want to go, always.

900
00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:46,252
Thank you.

901
00:47:46,272 --> 00:47:54,998
All right.

902
00:47:55,818 --> 00:47:58,960
All right, everybody.

903
00:48:01,032 --> 00:48:03,854
My name is Tamara DePlantis. Y'all can call me Tammy.

904
00:48:04,554 --> 00:48:07,576
I'm a game developer and a composer from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

905
00:48:08,456 --> 00:48:09,537
I make games.

906
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:15,840
I make games and perform music as Tambalaya, like John Beliah, but with a T.

907
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:19,548
And I'm here to tell you about my alternative path

908
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:20,749
to indie dev success.

909
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:24,351
Now, first things first, before we talk about the path,

910
00:48:24,391 --> 00:48:26,113
we need to define our destination.

911
00:48:27,814 --> 00:48:30,775
As we've already seen in parts of the session,

912
00:48:30,795 --> 00:48:33,177
success is a vague concept, and it

913
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:34,318
can mean many different kinds of things

914
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:35,518
to many different kinds of people,

915
00:48:35,558 --> 00:48:36,539
depending on what you're looking for.

916
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:40,241
So as an artist, I see myself as an artist,

917
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:43,123
I feel that my goal is to express myself.

918
00:48:44,178 --> 00:48:46,259
and to assist others in expressing themselves.

919
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,082
And as an added bonus, to pay rent if I can.

920
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:52,144
So if I can fulfill each of these goals,

921
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:54,146
then I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing.

922
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:56,962
Also, how do I express myself?

923
00:48:57,722 --> 00:48:59,603
I compose experimental music.

924
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,623
I write text scores.

925
00:49:01,703 --> 00:49:03,304
I create generative art tools.

926
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:06,625
I do a whole bunch of strange experimental art stuff

927
00:49:06,785 --> 00:49:08,026
that experimental art people do.

928
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,788
But I'm speaking here today because I compose,

929
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:17,009
I design experimental sound art games for Game Boys.

930
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,910
Here's a couple screenshots of it.

931
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:23,284
So...

932
00:49:23,304 --> 00:49:23,344
Um...

933
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:29,829
So my most well-known game, Machiavelli Arcade,

934
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:31,290
which these are screenshots of,

935
00:49:32,631 --> 00:49:35,514
it's a little bit of each of those things that I mentioned.

936
00:49:35,854 --> 00:49:40,177
It's a Game Boy game in which players improvise chaotic chiptune music

937
00:49:40,518 --> 00:49:43,260
with each other while generating abstract Bayou pixel scapes

938
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,142
interspersed with poetic reflections on Louisiana life.

939
00:49:48,004 --> 00:49:50,666
I have a video for it. We will see if it works.

940
00:49:52,542 --> 00:49:59,544
and makes wonderful sounds. If not, well, you can at least see it over here. Maybe. Or not.

941
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:13,608
Sorry, this is not my computer. Um. There's a wonderful video, I promise. So, um.

942
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:16,392
Yeah, so why develop for Game Boy?

943
00:50:16,872 --> 00:50:22,894
Well, for me, it started off as a kind of just an attempt

944
00:50:22,934 --> 00:50:25,255
to learn C by myself.

945
00:50:25,915 --> 00:50:27,576
Because I'm an art student.

946
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:28,556
I was an art student.

947
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,517
And I thought it would be a fun way to learn C programming,

948
00:50:32,537 --> 00:50:33,818
just make something weird with it.

949
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:39,099
but it became my favorite canvas because of its computational limitations.

950
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,282
There are only so many sounds that the Game Boy sound chip can make, so it becomes a fascinating

951
00:50:43,322 --> 00:50:46,024
compositional challenge for me to use them efficiently.

952
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:51,209
And as I started to release my games, I began to realize that these works had an audience,

953
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:53,070
partially due to the prevalence of chiptune.

954
00:50:54,391 --> 00:50:56,113
Is anyone here unfamiliar with chiptune?

955
00:50:57,094 --> 00:50:58,515
Yeah.

956
00:50:59,015 --> 00:50:59,856
Cool.

957
00:51:00,076 --> 00:51:03,299
So yeah, it's a genre of music, repurposes the aesthetics and hardware of video games

958
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:04,340
to create new music.

959
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:08,387
It's not so surprising in retrospect, but it turns out that the people who are involved

960
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:12,507
first in the sound palette of Game Boys are really interested in programs that stretch

961
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:13,448
its boundaries to the limit.

962
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:15,448
Okay, but why sound art?

963
00:51:15,548 --> 00:51:18,629
Well, as I mentioned, I'm an artist, and that's kind of my background.

964
00:51:18,669 --> 00:51:21,829
I kind of fell into games from the experimental art world.

965
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:26,210
But I made art in the first place because it's therapeutic for me.

966
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:32,271
I make my games to work out my anxieties, my grief, my, you know, hopelessness, feelings

967
00:51:32,371 --> 00:51:33,151
on mortality.

968
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:35,968
And in the case of a Chapelaya arcade,

969
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:39,991
the pangs of homesickness for a southern Louisiana, which

970
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:41,713
is a place I love and a place that I call home.

971
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:47,066
but it's also a place that's rapidly disappearing due to coastal erosion and climate change.

972
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:51,909
And its politics is kind of inhospitable for a wonderful trans woman like me.

973
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:58,173
So when you know that your grandmother's house with all its memories encased within will

974
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:03,516
one day pretty soon probably sink into the Gulf of Mexico, it makes every day away from

975
00:52:03,576 --> 00:52:04,757
it feel so much more painful.

976
00:52:06,078 --> 00:52:08,360
So this is how I dealt with it by making this game.

977
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:12,082
And this generally is how I deal with all of my difficult emotions.

978
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:15,222
So I'm going to keep making these no matter what happens.

979
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:16,983
It's a function of how I process life.

980
00:52:17,683 --> 00:52:20,043
So then the question for me as a working artist

981
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:23,344
becomes how can I use the art that I'm already making

982
00:52:23,804 --> 00:52:26,745
and the skills that I use to make it to help me achieve my other goals.

983
00:52:27,705 --> 00:52:29,366
Well, the obvious first step as a game developer

984
00:52:29,906 --> 00:52:31,306
is to release my games to the public.

985
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:34,047
So I post all my games on both itch.io and GameJolt.

986
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:37,688
You can play them there or download them and run them on your computer

987
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:38,628
if you have emulators.

988
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:42,999
So, they're there for anyone to download and play.

989
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:48,405
I then, you know, as expected, I take my games to festivals or conferences.

990
00:52:50,227 --> 00:52:51,068
Here we have a picture.

991
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:54,712
So there's my rig of...

992
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:01,091
Two Game Boys, Super Nintendo, in this particular rig,

993
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:03,992
they would be playing three different instances of the game.

994
00:53:04,112 --> 00:53:06,292
Everyone is playing their own game,

995
00:53:06,572 --> 00:53:08,153
but cycling through different instruments.

996
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:10,693
So they're playing together as an ensemble.

997
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:13,274
I really wish y'all could see this video.

998
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:20,336
Yeah, so I bring them to festivals, conferences.

999
00:53:20,776 --> 00:53:23,617
I showed it at a Mardi Gras ball last month.

1000
00:53:23,777 --> 00:53:24,637
It was wonderful.

1001
00:53:26,595 --> 00:53:28,796
So yeah, they showcase my games at their events.

1002
00:53:29,616 --> 00:53:31,418
So the catch with these works is that they aren't just games,

1003
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,139
but they're also musical instruments.

1004
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:36,120
So their best experience, I think,

1005
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,081
when approached with that mindset as an instrument

1006
00:53:38,121 --> 00:53:39,502
that you, you know, play with.

1007
00:53:39,977 --> 00:53:42,539
So in releasing these games and having other people play them,

1008
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:44,821
I'm getting my expression out there,

1009
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:46,582
but also the people who play my games

1010
00:53:46,642 --> 00:53:48,283
are finding musical and artistic ways

1011
00:53:48,303 --> 00:53:49,865
to express themselves through playing.

1012
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:51,866
So, checks out.

1013
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:53,247
My doogles.

1014
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:57,391
Another thing about my game's hybrid nature

1015
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,432
is that it opens up a variety of different methods

1016
00:53:59,472 --> 00:54:00,193
for presentation.

1017
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:01,394
So what else do I do?

1018
00:54:01,774 --> 00:54:03,275
Well, the obvious first step as a musician

1019
00:54:03,315 --> 00:54:06,298
is that I perform my games at artistically minded music

1020
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:08,420
venues on that Super Nintendo.

1021
00:54:10,132 --> 00:54:14,015
So, again, I have my Super Nintendo, I hook it up to whatever projector is there,

1022
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:18,058
and then hook it up to the speakers, and I just play through my games

1023
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,780
as a experimental music set.

1024
00:54:23,121 --> 00:54:24,302
Yeah, so...

1025
00:54:26,644 --> 00:54:28,885
And then I play through them in the most expressive way that I can.

1026
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,661
In fact, I've been talking about a Chafalet Arcade as a game,

1027
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:35,263
but it started life as a piece of music for a quartet

1028
00:54:35,403 --> 00:54:37,985
of electronic performers, which by the way,

1029
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,206
premiered across the bay at Mills College in Oakland.

1030
00:54:41,827 --> 00:54:46,190
So then sometimes an event will ask to feature one of my works,

1031
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,231
and for whatever reason, I can't physically be there.

1032
00:54:48,592 --> 00:54:51,634
So in that case, an electronic musician will go

1033
00:54:51,694 --> 00:54:53,375
and perform my pieces for me.

1034
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:57,398
This happened last year with the Laptop Orchestra of Louisiana.

1035
00:54:57,438 --> 00:54:58,178
They wanted to play.

1036
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:04,184
They wanted to play a Chafalaya Arcade as a piece of music, so I sent them the ROMs,

1037
00:55:04,224 --> 00:55:11,150
they got the hardware, and they had performances of a Chafalaya Arcade all around Baton Rouge.

1038
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:24,261
So, this is kind of functionally no different from streaming a game, but the context is

1039
00:55:24,302 --> 00:55:25,262
markedly different, I feel like.

1040
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:27,964
Because in most streams I've seen, although the streamer is in control of the game and

1041
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:31,887
shaping the experience that the viewers are watching, I find they often rhetorically position

1042
00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:35,570
themselves as kind of part of the audience, like, hey, guys, look at this game that I

1043
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:36,010
found.

1044
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:39,733
I'm controlling everything, but we're all going to be part of the audience.

1045
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:43,956
But when someone's up on a stage, and that's a fine way to interact with games and everything.

1046
00:55:43,976 --> 00:55:44,296
It's super cool.

1047
00:55:44,316 --> 00:55:44,657
I like streamers.

1048
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:44,977
And I enjoy it.

1049
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:45,417
It's kinda cool.

1050
00:55:45,437 --> 00:55:45,637
I enjoy it.

1051
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:45,857
I enjoy it.

1052
00:55:45,877 --> 00:55:46,098
I enjoy it.

1053
00:55:46,118 --> 00:55:46,318
I enjoy it.

1054
00:55:46,338 --> 00:55:46,958
I enjoy it.

1055
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:47,198
I enjoy it.

1056
00:55:47,683 --> 00:55:50,104
But being on a stage in a concert hall or a music venue,

1057
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:51,645
it changes that context.

1058
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:54,786
Because in that setting, everyone involved

1059
00:55:54,846 --> 00:55:56,987
is very clear that the people on the stage

1060
00:55:57,007 --> 00:56:01,049
are just as involved in making the art as the people who

1061
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:02,189
thought up the art in the first place.

1062
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,670
So I'm expressing myself.

1063
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:07,011
It's helping the performers express themselves.

1064
00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:08,052
Check.

1065
00:56:09,852 --> 00:56:10,633
So before I go.

1066
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:15,135
I want to address that last goal that hasn't really come up much, paying rent.

1067
00:56:16,256 --> 00:56:17,057
Do my games sell?

1068
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:19,019
Yeah, but not a lot.

1069
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,482
Do I make money from my Game Boy performances?

1070
00:56:23,223 --> 00:56:24,143
Yeah, but not a lot.

1071
00:56:25,985 --> 00:56:31,130
To fulfill that goal, as a game designer, as everybody, I do freelance, I take on short

1072
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:36,235
term programming jobs, mostly helping to design and implement unique generative musical systems

1073
00:56:36,295 --> 00:56:36,655
in a game.

1074
00:56:36,675 --> 00:56:37,616
FYI y'all.

1075
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:38,703
I'm available.

1076
00:56:39,204 --> 00:56:42,188
Just don't ask me to make a PowerPoint.

1077
00:56:46,896 --> 00:56:49,180
And as a musician, I teach piano.

1078
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,141
I'm a piano teacher.

1079
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:53,624
And yeah, and I take on accompaniment jobs

1080
00:56:53,704 --> 00:56:54,564
at Children's Theater.

1081
00:56:55,124 --> 00:56:57,525
And that gives me life.

1082
00:56:57,605 --> 00:57:00,606
It is one of my favorite just jobs, period.

1083
00:57:02,066 --> 00:57:05,347
And I probably wasn't invited here

1084
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:07,048
to talk about that aspect of my life,

1085
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:10,129
but I think if there's anything to learn

1086
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:11,569
from an alternative path,

1087
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,150
it's that I found the one that works for me.

1088
00:57:15,085 --> 00:57:18,388
by identifying the things that make me feel fulfilled

1089
00:57:18,848 --> 00:57:21,430
and saying like, to hell with devoting my life

1090
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:24,653
to an industry, not just this industry, just any industry,

1091
00:57:24,673 --> 00:57:28,036
that I can be successful in different fields,

1092
00:57:28,456 --> 00:57:31,879
you know, searching for my goals and in different contexts.

1093
00:57:32,479 --> 00:57:36,021
And I can use my successes in one field to help set up successes in another,

1094
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:38,582
and vice versa, helping each other build up.

1095
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:44,005
So to my mind, there's no difference between the game design,

1096
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:47,407
the musical instruments, the children's theater.

1097
00:57:48,728 --> 00:57:52,410
There's no difference because they all, for me, reach to the same goal,

1098
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,051
expressing myself, helping others express themselves.

1099
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:57,533
And that shapes not just how I make my art,

1100
00:57:57,893 --> 00:58:01,255
not just how I present my art, but ultimately how I live my life.

1101
00:58:02,057 --> 00:58:05,884
And I highly suggest y'all find the things

1102
00:58:06,245 --> 00:58:08,689
that you want to find and find your own path.

1103
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:09,871
Thank you.
