1
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:10,042
How are you guys doing today? How are all your GDC hangovers treating you?

2
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:14,363
I've been there.

3
00:00:15,764 --> 00:00:19,105
Housekeeping, please silence, mute, airplane mode your phones,

4
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:20,766
close laptop screens if you don't mind.

5
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:25,147
You will be getting an email about how you can rate me, how I did.

6
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:28,288
I hope to earn a good review, but you will be getting that

7
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:30,489
and you are free to describe me as you see fit.

8
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:34,227
I'd also like to say it's a huge honor to be presenting here at GDC,

9
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,228
and I take it as a personal honor that you all came to see my presentation.

10
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:38,428
I know there's a lot of cool stuff going on.

11
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:39,929
I know there's a lot of important meetings.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,111
So I am very flattered that you came here.

13
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,512
And this talk...

14
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:47,032
Oops, getting a little excited with my buttons.

15
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,173
There we go.

16
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,574
So this talk is about choice.

17
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,675
The choices we make as game developers

18
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:55,056
and the trade-offs we have to make to get games made

19
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,677
with the constraints we're all under.

20
00:00:57,897 --> 00:01:00,618
And my favorite quote about this comes from Cliff Bosinski.

21
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,734
It's about the trade-offs you decide on as a designer.

22
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:05,854
It's like playing an RPG where you have 20 points allocated

23
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:07,575
to strength, dexterity, and intelligence,

24
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:08,475
and you can't have it all.

25
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,256
And I love this because you're describing the art of game design

26
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:12,916
in terms of game design.

27
00:01:13,496 --> 00:01:13,996
It's meta.

28
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:18,637
So, often we make these kind of decisions based on instinct,

29
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:19,237
which is fine,

30
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:22,318
but a lot of times we make them because we get backed into them,

31
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:25,699
because of those restrictions.

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,379
We make these choices reactively.

33
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:32,208
What I want to propose today is that there's a framework that we can make these decisions proactively

34
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:37,711
based on who our target end user is, what the competitive set looks like, and what our best practices are.

35
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:42,133
So to open up, I want to start with a tale of two games that are very near and dear to my heart.

36
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,974
Dark Souls and Resident Evil 6.

37
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,276
Both came out in October their respective years.

38
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,956
Both had about two years of development time.

39
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:53,659
Resident Evil 6 outsold Dark Souls by about 70% in terms of physical units.

40
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:57,709
And yet history tends to remember Dark Souls as a critical and commercial success,

41
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,511
and Resident Evil 6 as a critical and commercial failure.

42
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,852
So the relevant question then is,

43
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:06,915
why is the game that sold 70% more units considered the failure of the two?

44
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:08,936
And that's what I want to talk about today.

45
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:10,997
In this presentation, I'm calling strategic design,

46
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:13,419
or why Dark Souls is the IKEA of games.

47
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:14,599
So who am I?

48
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:17,801
I started in the industry about 10 years ago as a humble production intern

49
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,322
at Wide Load Games in Chicago, Illinois.

50
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:21,964
Worked my way up to a studio lead senior producer position

51
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:24,065
on games like Guilty Party, Avengers Initiative.

52
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:27,036
And with our sister studio, Avalanche, working on Disney Infinity.

53
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:36,627
Over that time, I really developed a firm belief that the human cost of making games in terms of layoffs and crunch and health issues and studio closures and uncertainty was a little more than I could stomach.

54
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:42,353
And I decided the best way for me to be able to positively impact that would be to learn as much about business and management as I could.

55
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:45,367
So in addition to working full-time and raising kids,

56
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:46,868
I went to night school and earned an MBA

57
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:47,969
at Northwestern University.

58
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,751
I'm currently working as a consultant,

59
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,172
notably with my friends at Ragtag,

60
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:52,373
as they work to finish Raise the Dead.

61
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,255
I'm also trying to get my own company,

62
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:56,076
Agency Principal, up and running and off the ground.

63
00:02:56,697 --> 00:02:58,398
And I write regularly in my blog, Breaking the Wheel,

64
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:00,500
where I apply these sort of business theoretical concepts

65
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,261
to game development.

66
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,663
So if you enjoy this talk, there's a lot more material there.

67
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:04,979
Shameless plug.

68
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:05,379
All right.

69
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,563
So if you go to business school, you will run into this guy a lot.

70
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:11,125
This guy's name is Michael Porter from the Harvard Business School.

71
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:14,148
He's a Ph.D. in economics and a luminary in the field of business strategy.

72
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,371
And he has two major claims to fame.

73
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:20,715
One is something called a five forces analysis, and the other is codifying what he calls a

74
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:21,776
true competitive advantage.

75
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:25,520
To understand a competitive advantage, you have to understand another of his constructs,

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,022
which is called the productivity frontier.

77
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:32,603
This graph compares the value a product has for the end user versus the cost to make it.

78
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:35,687
That arc represents the line of best practice.

79
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,149
It's the equilibrium point in a market.

80
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,290
You can't do better than that line.

81
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,614
You can't get something that's more valuable for customers without it costing more,

82
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,736
and you can't cut costs without reducing value.

83
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,219
This is like the pinnacle of best practices in an industry.

84
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,283
Eventually a company's gonna figure out how to get past that

85
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:51,244
through some new process or best practice

86
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:53,106
or patent or intellectual property or

87
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,487
access to no-sum resource.

88
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,029
And for a while they're gonna have a market advantage.

89
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,070
They're gonna be able to make things faster for cheaper.

90
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,312
But eventually the market will catch up.

91
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:03,834
And we all as a society

92
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,376
benefit because products overall are

93
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:07,297
better and cheaper, but everybody benefits except for

94
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:08,959
that one company. And Porter calls this

95
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,320
shifting the productivity frontier.

96
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:14,043
The moral of this story is that faster, cheaper, better

97
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:15,324
is only a temporary advantage.

98
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:17,946
You cannot derive a sustained market advantage

99
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,327
from operational efficiency alone.

100
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:20,588
So what do you do?

101
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:22,649
In his landmark article,

102
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:24,730
What is Strategy? Harvard Business Review, 1996,

103
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:26,192
I highly recommend you read it,

104
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:29,874
Porter offers what he calls a true competitive advantage

105
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:30,735
based on three things.

106
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,798
Making trade-offs, I'm sorry, being different,

107
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,519
making trade-offs, and achieving fit.

108
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:39,131
So what do these things mean?

109
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,272
First off, being different.

110
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,914
It means creating something that is unique and valuable.

111
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:45,055
You can do this in one of three ways according to Porter.

112
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,956
You can be few things to many people.

113
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:48,978
His example is Jiffy Lube.

114
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:51,319
They will work on any car, but they will only do car lubricants.

115
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,220
So they don't do body work.

116
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,401
They don't do engine work, just car lubricants.

117
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,542
You can be many things to few people.

118
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:58,363
His example is Bessemer Trust,

119
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,345
which is a full-featured financial services company

120
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:01,825
that will handle all your banking needs,

121
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,627
but only if you have at least $250,000 of liquid assets.

122
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:07,529
Or you can be many things to many people in a narrow market.

123
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,962
Porter's example is Carnal Lake Cinemas,

124
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:12,503
which is a theater chain, full featured,

125
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:15,266
but only operates in cities of 150,000 people or less.

126
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,448
Now to understand why being unique and different

127
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:21,551
is so important, I direct you to the Kawasaki Matrix.

128
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:23,873
This is something that Guy Kawasaki of Apple fame

129
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:26,755
brings up in every talk I've ever seen him give on YouTube.

130
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:28,857
It's a very simple two by two matrix

131
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,379
that compares uniqueness to value.

132
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,661
So if you are valuable but not unique,

133
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:33,962
you have to compete on your margin.

134
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:35,023
You have to give...

135
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:38,598
consumers more for their dollar and get less in return,

136
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,699
which means you have to sell more units to compensate.

137
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,700
Extreme example would be toilet paper.

138
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,701
Very valuable, not unique.

139
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:48,583
So toilet paper companies have to offer more sheets per roll,

140
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:50,684
more rolls per dollar than the competition,

141
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,925
and that's why toilet paper companies make about a penny

142
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:54,886
per package or a penny per roll in terms of profit.

143
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:57,007
If you're not valuable and not unique,

144
00:05:57,027 --> 00:05:58,067
you're essentially the dot-com boom.

145
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:00,228
You're creating a bunch of stuff that's not useful

146
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:01,649
for customers, but makes a lot of money

147
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,410
for hedge fund managers and stock speculators.

148
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:07,059
If you're unique but not valuable, in Kawasaki's words,

149
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:07,979
you're just kind of stupid.

150
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,941
You're making something nobody's gonna buy,

151
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:11,022
and you're spending a lot of time.

152
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,643
Now if you're doing that for your own artistic means,

153
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,865
totally cool, but if you have an intent to sell it

154
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:15,645
and nobody wants to buy it,

155
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:16,826
you're kind of wasting a lot of time.

156
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:20,829
So you want to be here, unique and valuable,

157
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,251
where you can sell things to people that they wanna buy,

158
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,153
you can charge them a price that they think is fair,

159
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,555
but still allows you to maintain a healthy margin.

160
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:30,623
Kawasaki's mnemonic to remember this is,

161
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,905
you wanna be like George W. Bush, high and to the right.

162
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,526
I don't know exactly what he means by that,

163
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,568
but I remember it, so clearly it works.

164
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,049
Next up, trade-offs.

165
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,031
It's important to recognize that doing everything

166
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:42,932
is not strategy, it is indecision.

167
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:46,035
Strategy means often choosing what not to do.

168
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:49,217
Example here, the production triangle.

169
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:50,918
Good, cheap, fast, you don't get all three.

170
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,340
It's hard to have a service

171
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,981
that is both luxurious and fast.

172
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,603
It's hard to have a product that has lots of options

173
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:57,363
and is easy to use.

174
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,730
And you've got to recognize that some activities are incompatible,

175
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,330
like I just mentioned.

176
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,452
Next up is fit.

177
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:07,973
This is a really key concept for a competitive strategy.

178
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,493
Your activities need to fit each other.

179
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:12,715
They need to interact and reinforce one another.

180
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:15,576
So, for example, if you're using multiplayer code,

181
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:17,938
it behooves you to have mechanics that don't require

182
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,658
a high degree of computational precision.

183
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,019
This is why it's really hard to do net code for Street Fighter.

184
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,041
Now, why is this so important?

185
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:27,402
Being different allows you to uniquely serve a target audience.

186
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:30,388
Trade-offs allow you to serve that target audience

187
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:31,828
at a lower cost than anybody else,

188
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:34,529
and fit makes it harder for other companies

189
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:35,249
to compete with you.

190
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,730
They cannot just replicate one part of your value chain.

191
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,970
They have to replicate all of it to replicate your success.

192
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,431
Porter's example was Southwest Airlines.

193
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,952
Now in the 20 years since What Is Strategy came out,

194
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:47,552
they've since changed their MO a little bit,

195
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,493
but back in 1996, Southwest was many things to few people.

196
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,214
It was a full-service airline

197
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:54,954
catering to price-sensitive customers

198
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:55,874
who didn't care about perks

199
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:57,155
and were going between regional airports.

200
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:00,406
Southwest made a lot of trade-offs.

201
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:03,206
They only stuck to regional airports,

202
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:04,747
so you wouldn't find them in O'Hare or LAX.

203
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:06,727
They had no frequent flyer program,

204
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,127
they had no first class seating,

205
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,328
they didn't deal with baggage transfers,

206
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,068
and they only used 737 jets,

207
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,069
which meant they couldn't do long-haul flights.

208
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,989
This would seem to put them at a disadvantage

209
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,370
until you consider the element of fit.

210
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,690
The fact that they're in regional airports

211
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,631
meant they had to pay less for gate rights.

212
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:22,691
They didn't have to negotiate as hard.

213
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,396
The fact that they had no frequent flyer program

214
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,557
meant that they'd streamline ticketing.

215
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:28,277
The fact that there was no first class seating

216
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:29,238
and no baggage transfer

217
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:31,218
meant they could turn around planes in about half the time.

218
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:33,739
And the fact that they only used 737 jets

219
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,279
means that they only had to train their crews

220
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,760
to service 737 jets

221
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,100
and only had to carry parts for 737 jets,

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,081
which reduced their overhead.

223
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,181
And that effect is that Southwest

224
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:44,782
was faster, cheaper, and better,

225
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:46,322
but for the target consumer.

226
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:48,243
They made a choice.

227
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:49,823
We're gonna target these people over here

228
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,204
at the expense of these people over here,

229
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:52,464
which is totally fine.

230
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:55,860
And there's no secret sauce here, there's no trade secret.

231
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,620
They just had very good operational harmony.

232
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:01,722
Now how effective is this?

233
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,223
1993, Continental launches Continental Light

234
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:05,404
with the intent of going directly head-to-head

235
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,344
with Southwest Airlines.

236
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:07,985
But they didn't make the same trade-offs.

237
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:09,905
They kept their frequent flyer program,

238
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,006
they kept first class seating,

239
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:12,186
they kept baggage transfers,

240
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,367
they used different kinds of jets.

241
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:14,707
Total failure.

242
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:17,669
Such a bad failure, they killed it two years later.

243
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,030
Board of Directors fired the CEO over it.

244
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:23,548
Porter's other example is IKEA.

245
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:26,749
Much like Southwest, IKEA is all things to few people.

246
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,870
They are targeting young, price-sensitive customers

247
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,231
who are price-sensitive but not time-sensitive

248
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,691
and have rigid schedules

249
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,832
because they're early in their careers.

250
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,072
They can't dictate their own hours yet.

251
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:37,373
IKEA makes a lot of trade-offs.

252
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,734
They're often located way the hell out in BFE,

253
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,035
so you gotta drive way out to get to them.

254
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:43,516
There's no show people.

255
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:45,716
There's no customization.

256
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:46,737
You gotta build it yourself.

257
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:48,237
They offer food court and childcare,

258
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,038
and they are open late.

259
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,020
Much like Southwest, this would seem to put Ikea

260
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,322
at a disadvantage until you consider the element of fit.

261
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:56,824
So the fact they're in the suburbs means

262
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,587
they can have a really large property for really cheap,

263
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,208
which means they can have bigger parking lots,

264
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:02,429
which makes it easier to park,

265
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,091
bigger showrooms to show more furniture,

266
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,693
and bigger warehouses so they can have

267
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,654
more on-hand inventory.

268
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:10,235
Customers don't mind making the trip.

269
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:11,096
They're not time-sensitive.

270
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:11,777
They just want a deal.

271
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:14,139
The fact that there's no show people means

272
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,799
you have less staff.

273
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,260
You have less operational overhead.

274
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,903
And customers are fine showing themselves around because

275
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:20,953
What you see is what you get.

276
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,094
You don't need salespeople because you can see

277
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:28,636
the Gajora bed right next to the Norenberg lamp on top of the...

278
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:29,877
I can't remember all the names of these things,

279
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:30,937
but you know what I'm saying.

280
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:32,458
Like, you can just see the furniture right there.

281
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:33,979
You don't need a salesperson to describe it to you.

282
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,480
And the fact that there's no customization

283
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,120
means they have streamlined manufacturing.

284
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:40,662
It's really easy to have a streamlined process

285
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:42,743
if you just have to make one kind of a thing over and over again.

286
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,524
It's easy to store and deliver boxes

287
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,746
because they stack really well in trucks and in cars and in warehouse shelves.

288
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:53,360
And time-insensitive customers don't mind building

289
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,740
because they have time, they just don't have money.

290
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:58,202
So those amenities, the food court, the daycare,

291
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,782
the fact that they're open late

292
00:10:59,802 --> 00:11:01,123
would seem like extravagances,

293
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:02,984
but it means that customers can go straight from work

294
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:03,784
because there'll be food there.

295
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,265
They don't have to get a sitter

296
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:07,145
because Ikea will take care of their kids.

297
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:10,226
And they don't have to rush and stress themselves out

298
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:12,227
about finding traffic because Ikea's gonna be open late.

299
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,248
The net effect is, once again,

300
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,849
Ikea is better for the target customer

301
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:17,769
while still being profitable.

302
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:20,972
But it has reduced appeal to time sensitive,

303
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:24,154
price insensitive customers who want customization and high quality.

304
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:26,556
Again, IKEA made a choice.

305
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:29,238
We're going to target these people over here at the expense of these people over here.

306
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,519
That is the essence of strategy.

307
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:35,661
So to the meat of the presentation, why is Dark Souls the IKEA of games?

308
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,283
If it's not obvious by now, I mean that as a compliment.

309
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,885
So let's think of the target audience for Dark Souls.

310
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:43,606
A hardcore gamer, enjoys discovery,

311
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,748
likes pushing the boulder up the hill like Sisyphus.

312
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:49,270
Wants depth and wants thrilling menacing experiences.

313
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,551
These are gamers who want games that are like badges of honor if they win.

314
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:56,733
Now, does Dark Souls meet the criteria for a competitive advantage?

315
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:57,513
Was it different?

316
00:11:58,554 --> 00:11:58,974
Ah, sorry.

317
00:11:59,194 --> 00:11:59,995
Excuse me. Excuse my head.

318
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:00,895
Was it different?

319
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:01,935
Did it make trade-offs?

320
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:02,916
Did it have fit?

321
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:05,264
Dark Souls is definitely different.

322
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:08,225
It was a hardcore, unforgiving, no-frills game

323
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:10,225
in an industry of cinematic mass-market titles.

324
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:12,505
I'm pretty sure that picture is from one of the later

325
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,866
Dark Souls games, but a $200 million person body count

326
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,566
really kind of emphasizes my point here.

327
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,147
Dark Souls makes a lot of trade-offs.

328
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:23,607
Few cinematics, almost no tutorial, one difficulty level,

329
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,408
sparse music, limited multiplayer,

330
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:28,188
and it wasn't exactly using a cutting-edge engine.

331
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,509
Much like Ikea and Southwest, this would seem to put

332
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:33,509
Dark Souls at a disadvantage until you think about fit.

333
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:37,719
So the fact that there's few cinematics and very little tutorial

334
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,461
means you had to figure it out for yourself.

335
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:41,984
Tutorials are a rat's nest of edge cases.

336
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,185
Cinematics can be expensive to produce.

337
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:44,827
You don't have them to lead somebody by the hand.

338
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,168
That means you got to figure it out for yourself.

339
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:50,092
That means it is the difficult game that the target audience really wants.

340
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:51,834
You got to figure out how Dark Souls works.

341
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,037
Or you buy the strategy guide if you're a punk.

342
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:55,678
I bought the strategy guide.

343
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:59,310
It was one difficulty level means you have focus balancing.

344
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,351
You don't have to bounce for easy, medium, hard, extra hard.

345
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,171
There's just the Dark Souls level of difficulty.

346
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:04,892
And that means it's take it or leave it.

347
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:07,333
If you beat Dark Souls, you have to beat Dark Souls,

348
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,314
which means you're one of the elite,

349
00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:10,655
which means it has that badge of honor

350
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:12,335
that the target sect was looking for.

351
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,177
Sparse music cuts costs,

352
00:13:16,197 --> 00:13:18,338
but it also makes the world of Dark Souls

353
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:21,599
feel far more sparse and desolate and menacing.

354
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,360
So it's a cut that made it better.

355
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,321
This is the essence of a competitive advantage.

356
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,694
Limited multiplayer is focused multiplayer.

357
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,056
And the fact that they're reusing the tech from Dark Souls

358
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:32,357
reduces some of their unknowns.

359
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:36,299
Known tech, or you know, experience tech is known tech,

360
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,160
is predictable tech, you know, relatively speaking.

361
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:43,323
These trade-offs combine to create a harsh, uncomfortable,

362
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,284
sink or swim experience, which is exactly what

363
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:46,404
the target audience was looking for.

364
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:49,546
And from software genre experts,

365
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,547
they've been making this kind of game since Kingsfield on the PS1.

366
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,468
This really helps them hone their,

367
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:54,949
hone what they're doing and hone their activities.

368
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:58,306
The net effect is it felt tailor-made for an audience

369
00:13:58,326 --> 00:13:59,647
that often feels ignored or overlooked

370
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,707
by the AAA games industry.

371
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:03,710
And these trade-offs allow Dark Souls,

372
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,371
or From Software, to focus effort

373
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:08,053
without sacrificing quality, again, for the target audience.

374
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,796
And that means that Dark Souls could be more profitable

375
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,637
with a smaller market.

376
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,999
And in deference to Mr. Porter,

377
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,860
I call this notion strategic design.

378
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:19,983
Now, if we contrast this with the other game

379
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,344
from my introduction, Resident Evil 6,

380
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:23,926
and I say this as somebody for whom

381
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:25,407
Resident Evil is my favorite game series ever.

382
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:27,919
Resident Evil 6 tried to do the opposite.

383
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,560
It tried to take a niche brand to the mass market.

384
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:31,182
Producer at the time said,

385
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:32,523
we're making games and we need to have

386
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:33,704
mass market appeal to survive.

387
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:35,726
And that mass market design approach,

388
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:37,247
trying to target as many people as possible,

389
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:39,729
meant that Resident Evil 6 couldn't cut costs

390
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,651
and had a hurdle rate of seven million units.

391
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:43,633
In the intro I said,

392
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:45,455
Resident Evil 6 outsold Dark Souls by 70%.

393
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,897
It would have to have sold an additional 40%

394
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:49,458
to make its own target.

395
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,757
The net effect is best expressed by Resident Evil 7's producer,

396
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:54,978
Masashiki Kawata,

397
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:56,980
by trying to please everyone, you please no one.

398
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,162
And if the direction of Resident Evil 7 is any indication,

399
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:01,623
this was a lesson painfully learned.

400
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:04,486
Now, some of you might be asking,

401
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:06,467
how intentional was this on FromSoftware's part?

402
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:07,688
How intentional were these designs?

403
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,470
Were they thinking, did they read Michael Porter's article?

404
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,791
Were they thinking in terms of cuts and targeting a target market?

405
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,154
The honest, no bullshit answer is, I don't know.

406
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:16,615
I tried to find out.

407
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:18,854
I wrote to Bandai Namco, they couldn't help me.

408
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:22,717
I reached through a press contract to go through some PR contacts at Bandai Namco, they couldn't

409
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:22,957
help me.

410
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,659
If you go to FromSoftware's website, they tell you to go to Bandai Namco.

411
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:26,819
So I ran into a dead end.

412
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,161
But really that's not my point.

413
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:33,504
My point is not that FromSoftware read Michael Porter's What a Strategy and decided to emulate

414
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:33,584
it.

415
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:38,367
My point is that Dark Souls provides a prototype by which you can make these decisions intentionally.

416
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:43,250
I believe that Dark Souls verifies that this framework can apply to games effectively.

417
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,088
So to that end, recommendations in seven timeless quotes.

418
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,390
First of all, he who defends everything defends nothing,

419
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,650
Friedrich the Great, King of Prussia.

420
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,612
I'm gonna reiterate this because it bears reiterating.

421
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:55,893
Strategy means making choices,

422
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:59,354
deciding what to do and deciding what not to do.

423
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:02,756
And always recognize that trade-offs yield benefits.

424
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:04,617
They reduce costs and they make it harder

425
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:05,778
for other companies to compete.

426
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:08,379
And I see lots of cameras going off and that's cool,

427
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,840
but I'm gonna give you a link to download these slides,

428
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,361
so don't stress about getting every frame.

429
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:14,547
Good example here is XCOM.

430
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:17,610
XCOM was XCOM.

431
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,191
If you weren't there to get slapped around

432
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:20,613
by a really hard turn-based strategy game,

433
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,114
it did not make any compromises for you.

434
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:23,796
And that is exactly what it should have done.

435
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:24,937
And that's why it's so successful

436
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,719
and why its fans are so ravenous about it.

437
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:28,220
Because it served them very well

438
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,382
and it didn't make compromises to dilute the experience

439
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:31,283
for that target segment.

440
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:34,426
Next up, know thy enemy and know thyself

441
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,288
and in a hundred battles you will never be in peril.

442
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:36,648
Sun Tzu.

443
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:39,267
So get to know your target audience

444
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:40,167
and figure out what it really wants.

445
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:41,628
This is basic marketing research stuff.

446
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:43,208
You can do persona exercises

447
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:44,669
where you hypothesize a member of the audience,

448
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,909
try to think ahead of what they might be about,

449
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,410
what they're interested in, what their day looks like,

450
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,590
what kind of media they consume.

451
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:51,091
Go out and actually find some of them,

452
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:52,331
do one-on-one interviews, talk to them,

453
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:53,172
see what they're actually about.

454
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,432
You can use more advanced survey techniques

455
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,613
like factor and cluster analysis and conjoined analysis

456
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,693
if you wanna know what the hell that means.

457
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,821
It's in the appendix of these slides which you can download,

458
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:02,742
but I can also talk about it during Q&A if you're interested,

459
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:05,584
but you might need a professional survey company to help you with that.

460
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,026
But you want to use this information to pick your trade-offs and prioritize features.

461
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:11,347
A good example here is Supercell.

462
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:13,889
Supercell knows how to dial in an audience really well.

463
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,651
They kill off anything that's not going to be a huge hit with their audience,

464
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:20,353
and they know how to test and test and retest until they have games that are going to be huge hits.

465
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:24,575
That's why Hay Day and Clash of Clans are still on the top of the charts multiple years later.

466
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:29,426
If I'd asked people what they want, they would have said faster horses, Henry Ford.

467
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,188
So those last few slides notwithstanding,

468
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,231
I am not advocating design by focus group or design by survey.

469
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,032
That is a road to mediocrity.

470
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:40,175
And the reason is because people don't know what they want.

471
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,036
It's your job to show them.

472
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:44,038
This is one case where I think that asshole is absolutely correct.

473
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,861
Now, this sounds pretentious, but I think what Jobs meant is that

474
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,264
most people, most consumers are not professional product developers

475
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:53,325
and most gamers are not professional game designers.

476
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,846
It is not reasonable to ask them to construct things

477
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:58,447
and conceive game designs in their head.

478
00:17:58,487 --> 00:17:59,428
That's not what their training is.

479
00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:01,329
They don't know what they want yet.

480
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,371
But they do know what they like,

481
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,132
and that is a very important distinction to draw.

482
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:07,634
Don't know what they want, but they do know what they like.

483
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,756
So figure out what they're passionate about.

484
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,278
Figure out what needs other games aren't answering.

485
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,280
Tailor your feature set accordingly.

486
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,721
Great example here is Resident Evil 4,

487
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:19,583
which is my favorite game of all time,

488
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:23,145
and kind of my apology for shitting on Resident Evil 6 a little bit.

489
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:24,919
Shinji Mikami had gone to guys like me,

490
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,119
who were huge Resident Evil fans, and said,

491
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,259
what do you want in the next game?

492
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,580
We probably would have said more zombies,

493
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,540
bigger guns, bigger mansions, more puzzles.

494
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,781
Instead, he scrapped that design

495
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,081
and rebirthed both a genre and a game series

496
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:37,122
with one of the most successful games of the last decade.

497
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:40,342
I think he knew exactly what he wanted to do.

498
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:41,963
I think he knew what the audience was interested in,

499
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:43,343
and he was okay with trusting his instinct

500
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,264
to give them something that met their needs,

501
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:46,864
but wasn't exactly what they asked for.

502
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:50,445
Retreat, hell, we are just attacking

503
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:51,345
in a different direction.

504
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,805
Lieutenant General Chesty Puller.

505
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,320
So, in this concept of strategic design,

506
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm not advocating that you resign yourself

507
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,141
to subsistence revenue or hiding from the competition.

508
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,421
I'm not saying you should get used to

509
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:02,801
scratching a living off bare rocks.

510
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:05,242
It's not, and it's also not about

511
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:06,682
compromising quality to save money.

512
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,323
The goal here is to find underserved niches,

513
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:11,563
make games those niches will love,

514
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,703
and then use trade-offs to make that niche profitable

515
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,144
and make it harder for other companies to compete with you.

516
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,224
Good example here is Gone Home.

517
00:19:19,204 --> 00:19:21,065
Gone Home knew exactly the kind of game it was gonna make.

518
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:23,645
If you read the design, it would seem very humble,

519
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,506
but their dedication to that idea

520
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:27,428
and to serving the people who want to play that kind of game

521
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:29,689
earned them a level of notability and accord

522
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,330
that belied how simple that design was.

523
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,692
And they deserve every bit of that accord, in my opinion.

524
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,915
Music is the space between notes, Claude Debussy.

525
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:40,116
So when you're considering what cuts to make,

526
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:41,457
don't just take a hatchet to your design.

527
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:42,858
Don't just hack things off willy-nilly

528
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:44,259
without thinking through what you're trying to do.

529
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,440
You want to try to cut things that run contrary

530
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,521
to your target feature set to enable it to be,

531
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:50,403
to enable yourself to focus on those targets.

532
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:52,710
Example here, Uncharted.

533
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,751
Uncharted, for lack of a better term,

534
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:56,431
was trying to make the Indiana Jones video games.

535
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:58,833
To that end, they had these very beautiful, refined,

536
00:19:58,873 --> 00:20:01,794
well-shot, well-acted, well-motion-captured cinematic scenes.

537
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,235
It's what we all love about that series.

538
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:05,596
It's easy to forget, and I forgot this

539
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:06,696
till I replayed it a couple months ago,

540
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,017
that game was about four hours long.

541
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,199
They cut quantity to support quality.

542
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,640
It certainly did not hurt the franchise's

543
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,900
long-term prospects, as we all know.

544
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:18,842
The enemy of art is the absence of limitations.

545
00:20:18,902 --> 00:20:19,443
Orson Welles.

546
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,077
According to his friend, Henry Yagam.

547
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:22,958
We don't actually know if he said this, but it's still a good quote.

548
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:26,880
The idea here is not to constrain creativity.

549
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,181
Don't be a glass half empty person.

550
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:32,684
The idea is to focus attention, efforts, and resources where they will provide the most value.

551
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:35,065
Both to your gamers and your company.

552
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,968
Good example here, the Doom reboot.

553
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,788
Now, Doom eschewed a lot of features that prevailing logic would tell you modern shooters need.

554
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:46,409
There was no romance, there was no ill-advised stealth section,

555
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,790
weren't a ton of cinematics.

556
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,893
It was a very focused design that was all about kill things dead real good.

557
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,454
And that focus did not hurt the game.

558
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:57,917
That focus made it an exceptional shooter that stands out drastically in the current field.

559
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:02,160
Finally, the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.

560
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,001
Elie Wessel.

561
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:05,503
Now, a lot of things, a bunch of professional...

562
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:10,088
entrepreneurs and marketers and product developers get wrong is they get way too hung up about

563
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:13,248
if people are going to hate their product, or in this case, hate their game.

564
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:18,069
But in order for one niche to love your game, you have to accept that another niche is probably

565
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:18,510
going to hate it.

566
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,531
And that shouldn't bother you because if the people who hate your game are diametrically

567
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:27,972
opposed to your target audience, the fact that those people hate it is perversely supporting

568
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:28,312
evidence.

569
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:29,712
It means you're probably on target.

570
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:32,653
What should freak you out a lot more than hate is indifference,

571
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:35,716
because indifference means that people can't even be bothered to hate your game.

572
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:36,537
They don't even care.

573
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:40,741
So always remember that passionate fans are what create valuable brands.

574
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:44,244
This is why engagement is far more important than traffic at a website.

575
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:45,846
A million people showed up to your site.

576
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:46,666
Who cares?

577
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,348
Did they read anything? Did they buy anything?

578
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:49,349
Did they sign up for a mailing list?

579
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:50,630
Did they post about it on Facebook?

580
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,551
Did they tell their friends about it?

581
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,274
Having a thousand people who are highly engaged is way more valuable

582
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,595
than having a million people show up and go,

583
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:03,095
Now, another thing professional entrepreneurs, marketers, product developers get way too hung up on

584
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:05,596
is the size of the target audience, whether it's too small.

585
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:09,779
But it's important to recognize that your target audience is not the same thing as your addressable market.

586
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,941
Your target audience builds your addressable market.

587
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:15,802
How? Through good old-fashioned word of mouth.

588
00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:17,603
Your fans will evangelize for your game.

589
00:22:17,623 --> 00:22:22,266
And it's important to remember that word of mouth is the most valuable form of marketing there is.

590
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,848
And it's the most valuable because it's the only form of marketing you cannot buy.

591
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:26,768
You have to earn it.

592
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,733
You can try doing stealth and astroturf things, but you will get caught.

593
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:33,194
So you can only get word of mouth the old-fashioned way.

594
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:35,275
But your fans are only going to evangelize for you

595
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:38,097
if they're passionately engaged because you made something that they love.

596
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:43,480
So examples here, Abound, Kerbal Space Program, Counter-Strike, League of Legends, Halo,

597
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,261
Minecraft alone demonstrates this point for me.

598
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:53,785
So, if you want to be the next Ikea or Dark Souls,

599
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,024
or Star Wars, or Apple, or Harry Potter, or Nine Inch Nails.

600
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:04,769
Don't spend so much time worrying about making something that everybody's going to buy.

601
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,754
Focus instead on making something that a segment of people will really love.

602
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:13,918
And with that, I will turn it over for questions.

603
00:23:14,178 --> 00:23:16,100
But first, here's my contact info.

604
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,241
If you scan that QR code, you'll get my contact details.

605
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:20,132
Two underscores, don't forget it on the Twitter.

606
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:21,693
You don't want to get the one underscore Justin Fisher.

607
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,214
He hasn't tweeted in like seven years.

608
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:25,716
And that bit.ly link will give you annotated slides

609
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:27,157
if you're interested.

610
00:23:27,237 --> 00:23:29,579
And I'm sharing them under a Creative Commons 4.0 license,

611
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,261
so distribute them at your studios, amongst your friends.

612
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:33,862
Just don't sell them or you gotta give me a cut.

613
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:36,704
And also, if you enjoy my peculiar way

614
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:38,045
of looking at the world, I'm doing another session

615
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,646
on Friday about applying operation science

616
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,267
to game development.

617
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:42,688
So if you've got production nerdy friends

618
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:43,829
who are into production nerdy stuff,

619
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,231
I welcome them with open arms.

620
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:48,702
So any questions at the mics?

621
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:51,444
Oh, thank you.

622
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:55,888
Applause

623
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:00,991
I see one person walking up.

624
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:05,075
Hi.

625
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:05,595
Hello.

626
00:24:05,935 --> 00:24:10,098
I'm just wondering if you think, because Dark Souls is a console game.

627
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:19,186
Do you think that console exclusivity plays into what you're talking about as far as like a limitation that could be beneficial?

628
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:26,676
It can be, yeah. I mean it should be where and who you target should be interrelated with your console, your platform choices.

629
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:28,499
Like Halo is a great example of...

630
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:32,063
You have one console that would seem to put you at a disadvantage,

631
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,643
but it also allows you to focus your design on what you're trying to make

632
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:38,524
and focus your technical efforts on what the specific hardware requirements are.

633
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:39,705
So yeah, definitely that.

634
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:43,966
If you're doing that in an intelligent way, you can really limit the ability,

635
00:24:43,986 --> 00:24:45,566
the potential for analysis paralysis.

636
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,127
Does that answer your question?

637
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:48,127
Yep.

638
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:48,927
Thank you.

639
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:54,548
What are your thoughts on, like...

640
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:59,631
identifying these niches based on sort of your own personal experience and anecdotal

641
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:05,733
evidence versus like market research, because I often find that producers and that they

642
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:06,873
want that market research.

643
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:07,533
Yeah.

644
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:11,514
It's hard to do.

645
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:14,756
I mean, if you have lots of marketing muscle and dedicated marketing departments, it's

646
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:16,236
a lot easier to kind of defer that work.

647
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,132
I think it's games to me are not like consumer products.

648
00:25:22,152 --> 00:25:23,172
They're all micro startups.

649
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:28,435
So to me, it's the same thing as how base level startups in their early phases try to find customers.

650
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:28,975
You go out and check.

651
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:32,497
She who are you talking to who you who and whose hands are you putting builds?

652
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:38,460
Who are you testing with like don't undervalue the ability of shoe leather to start answering these questions for you and.

653
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,403
If you're targeting the right people, if you're looking at those people who are really interested in being

654
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:45,165
at the ground floor, who like to be at the cutting edge of game development,

655
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:48,909
don't underestimate the ability of you to flatter them by bringing them in early.

656
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:51,471
And that's how you can start building that base level of word of mouth.

657
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,093
If somebody's like, hey, these guys brought me in, they asked my opinion, they let me see things,

658
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:58,297
that can be a great way to start building that following.

659
00:25:58,317 --> 00:25:59,438
Does that make sense?

660
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:00,158
Yep.

661
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:03,641
Cool, thank you.

662
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,904
I just have one question about like, if you're...

663
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,860
You're building a game and you launch it and it's sort of like a good minimum viable product.

664
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,421
It's the Dark Souls of whatever you're doing.

665
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:18,164
If it has success and you continue updating it, you slowly add more and more features

666
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:21,866
and cruft and it suddenly becomes not that experience.

667
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:27,610
What do you think about that and how would you manage that type of game design and development?

668
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,033
I think that sort of iteration, and there's plenty of examples of it, there's nothing

669
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,193
wrong with evolving and...

670
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:36,976
And bringing in more people over time.

671
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,937
I mean, I think that, and especially for like businesses,

672
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,238
that's kind of what you want to do.

673
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:43,058
So to me, there's nothing bad about it,

674
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,279
as long as you're being intentional about it.

675
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:46,479
Like, okay, we think this has a broader appeal

676
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:48,960
to these people, and hopefully this feature set.

677
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,301
But if you don't want to do it as like a panic routine,

678
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:52,101
like we aren't selling enough,

679
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:53,762
so let's just rope in more people

680
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:54,642
without a really strategy.

681
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:56,163
Let's just make it as mass market as possible.

682
00:26:56,763 --> 00:26:57,623
That's where you're running into trouble.

683
00:26:57,843 --> 00:26:59,043
Or if you're really diluting what...

684
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:01,654
the core of what your game is, that core value proposition,

685
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:04,535
and kind of messing it up with putting too much extraneous crap around it.

686
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:06,656
That's where you can start running into problems.

687
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,397
So, to me, it's an analysis-driven decision.

688
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:13,278
Like, bringing more people, talk to them, have them play it, see what they think.

689
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:15,239
Are sales getting better or worse?

690
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,579
You still, like you feel, are honoring the core values of the product.

691
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,320
And that's how I would approach it.

692
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:19,740
Thanks.

693
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:19,900
Sure.

694
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,522
This is somewhat related to that, maybe a little bit theoretical, but...

695
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,972
Do you think it's possible to take what Dark Souls did in terms of trade-offs

696
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:33,113
and refocus that on a different audience, maybe even a larger audience?

697
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:38,175
If you start selling groceries in an Ikea format, do you get Trader Joe's?

698
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:38,775
Like, will that work?

699
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:40,216
Yeah, I think so.

700
00:27:40,316 --> 00:27:42,817
I mean, again, as long as you understand what your targeted audience is looking for

701
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:46,778
and what trade-offs are either acceptable or in some ways preferable to them,

702
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:47,939
like the Dark Souls difficulty thing,

703
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:50,660
then yeah, I don't think the lesson from Dark Souls

704
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,881
is that people want really hard games that are in a medieval setting with monsters.

705
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:55,842
I think the lesson is that people want games that are made for them.

706
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,163
And that make them feel like somebody is paying attention to them and wants to service them specifically.

707
00:28:00,823 --> 00:28:03,625
So if you can figure out what makes people feel like they're being serviced specifically

708
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:07,387
and that their needs are being answered, then it could work for any genre, any game.

709
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:08,608
You just have to balance.

710
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,829
The more people you get, the less...

711
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,991
The more people you're trying to target, the less specific you can get to their needs.

712
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:14,292
And that's where the balance point is.

713
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:18,394
And that's where you need to focus on your trade-offs and where your specific value point is.

714
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:19,755
Does that make sense?

715
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:20,335
Thanks, yeah.

716
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:20,496
Sure.

717
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,958
So if you think about Dark Souls in terms of...

718
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:30,470
strategically delivering a project or product to a niche audience that were kind of forgotten

719
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,090
by the industry.

720
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,891
Do you think that strategical advantage might get lost now that we as an industry are maturing

721
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:41,893
and not forgetting about audiences and trying to balance out the products and therefore

722
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:46,334
strategical advantage will only come from creating new genres and new products for audiences

723
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:47,534
that haven't been catered to at all yet?

724
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:53,017
No, I don't think it only needs to be new products

725
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:56,019
because if Dark Souls was a constantly evolving,

726
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:58,021
constantly new content coming out kind of thing,

727
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:00,283
like an Uber, like it just constantly persists,

728
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:02,505
then yeah, I think you would need to constantly find

729
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:04,086
new things to go to, but

730
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:07,729
Dark Souls can coexist in a world with Niall.

731
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,751
And those two things, you don't say like,

732
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,392
oh, I'm going to buy fewer copies of Dark Souls

733
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:12,694
because Niall is not here.

734
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:14,535
It is scratching the same itch,

735
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:15,536
it's serving the same audience,

736
00:29:15,616 --> 00:29:16,677
it's got a different bend to it.

737
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:19,047
At that point, you gotta figure out,

738
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,708
your competitive set is not just everything that's out there,

739
00:29:20,728 --> 00:29:22,570
but what's coming out proximate to your release

740
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,231
and what's gonna get buzzed around the same time as you.

741
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:27,774
So that's where that strategic plan has to come in too.

742
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,575
Like, whose needs am I servicing?

743
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:30,716
And not just are there other games,

744
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,958
but are there other games that will be high profile

745
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:33,619
at the same time?

746
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:34,780
Does that answer your question?

747
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,440
A little bit.

748
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,262
I guess, you know, this industry's quite known

749
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:39,644
for fast follow, so Dark Souls does well,

750
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:41,105
then everyone wants to make a good-sized game,

751
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:42,866
and no one's making AAA games anymore,

752
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:44,868
so then 10 years later, oh wait,

753
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:46,689
we should make a cinematic AAA game,

754
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:47,510
you know what I mean?

755
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:47,610
So.

756
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:50,126
That goes to my point when I was making the other guy of

757
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:52,588
the lesson of Dark Souls is not like make Dark Souls,

758
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:53,509
it's make games for people.

759
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:56,411
And the lesson of Halo was not people want guys in green

760
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:59,514
shoots blowing up aliens, it's that console gamers

761
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:00,314
also like to shoot things.

762
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:02,956
So it's figuring out what needs they're addressing

763
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:06,559
and not focusing on the topical sort of cosmetic trends

764
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:08,160
of what made Dark Souls, but really digging into

765
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,401
the strategic nature of it.

766
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:15,152
The fast fall itself is, you know, it's a investment strategy.

767
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:17,432
Like, there's less risk here, but there's also less upside

768
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:19,113
because now you're competing on margin again.

769
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:23,854
So you have to be aware of that when you're making these decisions.

770
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,054
And one of the best lessons I learned in business school

771
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:28,315
is that there's not really good or bad decisions usually,

772
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:29,195
they're all trade-offs.

773
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,456
And you've got to figure out which trade-off is most suitable to you,

774
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:35,237
most honors your core values, most honors your strategic goals.

775
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:37,677
So there's a trade-off there between known...

776
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:41,862
And unknown and compete on margin versus unique and valuable.

777
00:30:41,902 --> 00:30:43,724
And you got to decide what the right balance point is for you

778
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:45,766
and what's right for your customer base

779
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,608
and your game and your project and your finances.

780
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:49,349
Does that better answer it?

781
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,330
Yes.

782
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:51,091
Thank you.

783
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:52,032
Please.

784
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:52,953
Hey, great talk.

785
00:30:53,013 --> 00:30:53,233
Thanks.

786
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:53,673
Thank you.

787
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:58,427
How important do you think it is, or I guess I'd like to know your thoughts on

788
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,028
changing these design principles from game to game

789
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:07,251
versus companies that make their whole kind of image in

790
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:09,032
one style of game over and over.

791
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:13,114
Yeah, the trick you, so again, that's another trade-off.

792
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:15,895
If you keep making the same game like From Software, you get to,

793
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,356
you can establish a lot of best practices, you accrue a lot of

794
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:22,338
intelligence about it, you accrue a lot of, what's the word I'm looking for?

795
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:26,560
A core competency about what that thing is the trick there though is.

796
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:29,404
For instance destiny bungee.

797
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:34,610
It's going to be hard and can take a long time before destiny ever gets mentioned without halo coming up.

798
00:31:35,391 --> 00:31:37,033
It's going to be very hard for like Shinji Mikami.

799
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,105
He made The Evil Within, which is very similar to Resident Evil 4.

800
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:43,287
He's going to have a hard time making any game like that without them somebody bringing in,

801
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:44,528
oh, this is the guy who made Resident Evil 4.

802
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:48,209
So the more you stay within your comfort zone, the more you're going to live in your own shadow.

803
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,772
And that's not, again, that's neither good nor bad, but that's a trade-off you've got to consider.

804
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:58,995
You know, how much do you want to be beholden to your legacy versus how much do you want to stick within your core competency where you can maximize your efficiencies?

805
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:03,175
But like IKEA, we all know IKEA's principles,

806
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:06,256
and they're not starting new businesses or new stores

807
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:07,557
that have totally different principles.

808
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:09,878
I'm wondering, do they really succeed

809
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,739
because it's so consistent and we always know?

810
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,960
Or can you make games that are,

811
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,221
I mean obviously you can make games that keep changing it up,

812
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,062
but I just wonder how important it is

813
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:21,303
to basically know your shtick and own it

814
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:23,104
and put your stake in the ground

815
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:24,625
so people stay away from your space.

816
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:30,362
I mean, yeah, the more formidable you are, the more of an expert you are,

817
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:34,426
like, it's going to be hard to go head-to-head with Cliff Buzinski on a third-person shooter.

818
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:38,091
Kind of thing, so, yeah, it does become easier to claim, to stake out your claim.

819
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:41,915
And make it known that I own this, and the more you show up here, the more

820
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,478
you reinforce my position as the industry leader.

821
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:47,782
Like, the more somebody, like when Resident Evil was at its heyday in the PlayStation era.

822
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:49,972
The more games that showed up that were survival horror,

823
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:53,193
the more they reinforced, A, the name survival horror,

824
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,654
and B, reinforced Resident Evil as the premier game in that genre.

825
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,615
Like, we own it and we define these terms.

826
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:00,795
And when that market started getting crowded,

827
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:03,516
they reinvented it and redefined what survival horror is,

828
00:33:03,556 --> 00:33:06,017
but still, you know, Dead Space comes out,

829
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:07,157
Resident Evil 4 still comes up.

830
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:08,938
Gears of War came out, Resident Evil 4 came up.

831
00:33:10,977 --> 00:33:12,297
That's, again, that's part of the trade-off.

832
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,097
Like you secure that position and people,

833
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:15,218
everybody who shows up to your party

834
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:16,358
reinforces that you're the head of the party,

835
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:16,898
which is a good thing.

836
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:19,439
But you also, if you want to go start a new party

837
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,439
that's kind of on the same,

838
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:22,500
playing the same dance list or music list,

839
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,020
you're also going to be in your own shadow.

840
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,320
Does that answer your question?

841
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,080
Yep, yep, thank you.

842
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:29,561
Hey, quick one.

843
00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:33,542
Can you think of any games that did appeal

844
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:34,843
to everyone that said we're going to,

845
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,883
anybody with a screen in front of their face,

846
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:38,124
whether, you know, whatever they're doing,

847
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:39,304
they're going to play this game,

848
00:33:39,344 --> 00:33:39,984
they're going to enjoy it.

849
00:33:40,522 --> 00:33:44,024
It definitely works. I mean, Rock Band, Wii Bowling, Super Mario Bros.

850
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:45,605
Like, there are definitely examples.

851
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:48,486
And, again, trade-offs.

852
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,507
You should not target a broad spectrum

853
00:33:50,547 --> 00:33:52,929
just because some dork at GDC said so.

854
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:55,270
It's just be aware of the trade-off you're taking.

855
00:33:56,392 --> 00:33:57,972
You know, the more you make a game for everybody,

856
00:33:58,133 --> 00:33:59,353
the less you make a game for anybody.

857
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:02,395
And there is a balance point in what your game design is,

858
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:05,436
how broadly acceptable it is, how big that market is,

859
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,938
the likeliness of that market to buy with a game being

860
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:09,038
as not specific as it is.

861
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:10,959
Like, these are all numbers that need to factor

862
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:11,560
into your calculus.

863
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,220
So it can totally work.

864
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:14,261
I mean, we've seen it work.

865
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:17,743
So the goal is not to say, like, you have to do this,

866
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,865
but what I want to reinforce is that you should be intentional

867
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:22,926
about this decision and really think about the consequences

868
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:23,466
of your trade-offs.

869
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:24,586
Does that make sense?

870
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:25,827
Yeah, thank you.

871
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:25,927
Sure.

872
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:30,135
I thank you very much everybody. I really appreciate.
