1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,192
So, interviews are split, thank you.

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,973
That's it, I'm done, mic drop.

3
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:14,937
Interviews, I think, are generally split into two sort of things.

4
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:16,799
There's two major things that you're looking for.

5
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,520
The first is the technical side,

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,123
the second is more of the personality, do they fit into the culture side.

7
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,544
So, I'm going to be focusing on the tech,

8
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:26,306
and Brian's going to focus on the other stuff.

9
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:27,828
So it's hard, right?

10
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:32,092
Interviews are super hard to be in and to give.

11
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:33,814
You're in this panel of people trying

12
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:36,016
to decide within just a few hours,

13
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:39,099
is this person the right person for our team?

14
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,902
Can this person do the technical stuff that we want, right?

15
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:42,263
It's hard.

16
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:44,765
And programming is a very time-intensive task.

17
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:48,410
So it's how can you really tell in just a few hours

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,552
what, how someone's really worth

19
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,054
when it could take weeks for them

20
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:54,856
to even spin up totally on your processes.

21
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:55,918
Plus, I mean, you're super,

22
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:58,701
a lot of people get super nervous in these interviews.

23
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,863
So it's sitting there going, oh God.

24
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:03,285
And so how do you try and ignore some of that stuff?

25
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:05,668
Well, I think it starts with the big question

26
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:07,670
of what are we even testing for?

27
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:10,302
So for me, there are three things that I care about

28
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,583
when I'm dealing with interviews.

29
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,164
The first is, can they write usable code?

30
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:15,545
Can they write code that I can use

31
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:16,466
and ship and send somewhere?

32
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:24,392
What are their knowledge of just CS, computer science concepts, as well as programming and

33
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:26,774
general like AI and all that kind of stuff.

34
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:28,916
And finally, can they iterate?

35
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,717
So basically it boils down to, can you do the thing?

36
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:31,998
Do you know about the thing?

37
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:33,799
And can you handle someone constantly changing the thing?

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,942
Those are the three major sort of things that I try and search for.

39
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,159
And I do this with a, there's three sections

40
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,859
of a typical interview that I tend to go through.

41
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,580
There's a phone screen, there's a programming test,

42
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,960
and then there's an in-person interview.

43
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,680
And so I'll start with the programming test,

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,381
which is can you write usable code?

45
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:55,181
So the programming test basically is a simple take-home test.

46
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,562
It allows them to work in their own environment.

47
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:00,263
It allows them to, they can use Visual Studio

48
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:01,563
with whatever settings they want.

49
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:02,923
They can do anything.

50
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:03,503
They're in a,

51
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,329
a more calm environment than if I was sitting

52
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,395
here with my arms folded staring at them.

53
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,880
You give them some simple framework, SDL or whatever,

54
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,644
and I just tell them, get this working.

55
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:18,208
It's usually triangles, some squares, stuff like that.

56
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,889
Then I hand them a game design and say, here you go.

57
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,829
Make this, you have four hours, make this thing.

58
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,310
Treat it as if this is shipping code.

59
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,271
And so all of the stuff that's gonna be on this test

60
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:29,851
are the things that I actually care

61
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:31,872
that they know how to write code for.

62
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:35,573
Usually there's some math stuff on there, some AI stuff.

63
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,914
And I make them, I want to see what kind of technical decisions that they make.

64
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:42,336
I want to see what data structure did you choose.

65
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,797
A common thing that I ask for is collision detection.

66
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:49,259
Did you just do the n-squared method or did you do some spatial partitioning or something

67
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,359
a little more fancy?

68
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:51,459
Where did you spend your time?

69
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,480
And all of that.

70
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,082
So it gives us a context to really start some conversation.

71
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:00,044
When I bring them in for the in-person interview,

72
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:01,806
if I bring them in, then that's usually

73
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,508
the very first thing that we talk about.

74
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:05,770
Here's the code that you gave us. Let's talk about these things.

75
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,433
Why did you make this decision? Why did you make that decision?

76
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:12,597
So the major things that I look for are consistency.

77
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:14,178
I don't care what your coding style is,

78
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:16,000
but one thing I think hopefully we can all agree on

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,482
is that whatever your coding style is, it should be consistent.

80
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:20,999
I look for readability and maintainability.

81
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,700
Can I actually read your code?

82
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,102
Or using a lot of just single letter variable names

83
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:26,443
and that kind of stuff.

84
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:29,424
Maintainability, can I, if this was a system

85
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:31,966
that you wrote in a game that I'm having you work on,

86
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,887
can I go in there and make changes as well?

87
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:36,089
just good technical choices,

88
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,870
did you make reasonable data structure choices,

89
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,131
algorithm choices, that kind of stuff,

90
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,592
and scalability.

91
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:45,136
If I say, hey, what if we take these five agents

92
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:46,597
that are running around that I had you build

93
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:48,218
and now we wanna make it 5,000 agents?

94
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:49,679
How would we change that?

95
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:52,041
So again, this gives us a context for conversation

96
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,883
and gives me a view into how they write code

97
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:59,626
and what they should consider a production environment.

98
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,090
So that's the programming test.

99
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,352
And that's how I determine whether or not

100
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:04,093
they can write usable code.

101
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,777
So I think things like whiteboard questions

102
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:07,357
and stuff like that,

103
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:08,639
where you're sitting in front of a whiteboard

104
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,243
and it's like, write a binary search on a whiteboard

105
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:12,525
with all of us staring at you.

106
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:13,145
That's useless.

107
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:14,848
I don't know what that's really gonna tell you.

108
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:16,190
If that's super important to you,

109
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,532
have them do it in the programming test.

110
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,071
The next step is CS Concepts.

111
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,592
So I do this partially in the phone screen

112
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:23,933
and partially in the in-person interview.

113
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:26,355
My easiest questions and stuff are on the phone screen

114
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:29,618
because we're just gonna end the conversation

115
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:31,639
if you can't pass some of these tests.

116
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,581
And I'll start with my very first question.

117
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,763
I always ask this question, every interview in Canada.

118
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:37,444
So if any of you happen to interview with me,

119
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,285
you'll get this question too.

120
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,707
So I guess you get a little bit of an inside track.

121
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:41,467
And here it is.

122
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:42,728
Ready?

123
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:45,896
What is the difference between an array and a linked list?

124
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,317
And why would I use one over the other?

125
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:48,879
That's my very first question.

126
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,781
And here's the crazy thing about this question.

127
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:52,744
I would say about 50% of entry-level candidates fail

128
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:55,507
this question, which is alarming to me.

129
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,649
About 10% of experienced candidates fail this question,

130
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,514
which is equally alarming to me.

131
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:03,596
I like this question because it's

132
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:07,433
it gives me a bit of a view into how they think about things.

133
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,955
So for a new person, new engineer, just out of college,

134
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:11,555
I expect the asymptotic answer.

135
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:14,177
I expect, oh, I can index into an array in constant time.

136
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:16,458
But if I try and find the nth element of a linked list,

137
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,358
it's big O of n, and so on.

138
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,500
I expect those types of responses.

139
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,541
Whereas a more experienced engineer,

140
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,522
I expect things like, well, an array is much more cache

141
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:25,423
friendly, for instance.

142
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:27,404
Whereas a linked list implemented with just node,

143
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:29,725
node, node, node, well, that's all over memory.

144
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:33,566
by by cache. And then of course we ask the questions like,

145
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,287
hey, how can you solve for that kind of stuff?

146
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,047
What happens if you bring a linked list into an

147
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:38,408
array and so on.

148
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:41,469
So I start with this question, and I build

149
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:44,129
from that question to other questions. Then from there

150
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:46,070
you ask the questions that are, that are interesting,

151
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,131
right. Data structures, so like hash tables, trees, graphs. What

152
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,071
are these things? Why would I use these things?

153
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,332
And in the in-person or phone interview,

154
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:55,812
I'm never making them actually write code.

155
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:58,073
I'm making them, why would I use these things?

156
00:05:58,073 --> 00:05:59,293
What are these concepts?

157
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,053
Breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra.

158
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:04,894
These tools that we tend to use, why would I use this stuff?

159
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:06,654
What's the difference between breadth-first and depth-first?

160
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,735
Here's a graph on a board.

161
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:13,296
Draw for me what the node expansion would look like.

162
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,136
And AI concepts, A star, utility theory, behavior trees,

163
00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:16,836
that kind of stuff.

164
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,630
One of my other very favorite questions,

165
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,094
which I'll also give you, is describe a use for A star

166
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,516
other than pathfinding.

167
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:28,859
Do they know that A star is not just a pathfinding algorithm,

168
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:30,922
right, it's a graph search, it's a generic graph search.

169
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,965
You need some kind of source, some kind of destination,

170
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,948
some kind of heuristic that can get me there,

171
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:36,929
that can estimate.

172
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:37,029
Cool.

173
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:42,289
So these are conceptual questions.

174
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:43,670
These are not implementation questions.

175
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,831
These are why would I use this thing, right?

176
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,192
When should I apply this thing?

177
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:48,253
Have you heard of this thing?

178
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:51,855
These are not questions that are deep, technical,

179
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:53,196
like write the code for this.

180
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:55,858
Because if they're sitting there in front of this panel,

181
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:58,239
that's not gonna simulate what they're actually

182
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,120
gonna be doing in real life.

183
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,541
That's for the programming test.

184
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,422
Leave all that stuff on the programming test.

185
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,364
That if it's super important to you that they do that.

186
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:10,756
So the next thing I want to talk about is the iteration side of things.

187
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:11,897
This is the third thing.

188
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:16,340
So iteration is, games are incredibly iterative.

189
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,223
That's, it feels like that's all that we do is iterate, right?

190
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:22,365
The Sims 4 AI is something like 10,000 lines of code.

191
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:26,808
So if I just took that code right now and just typed it in,

192
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:28,069
that's not going to take very much time.

193
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,391
It's the iterations, the two years of iteration

194
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,693
that we spend over and over and over and over.

195
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:35,855
How many times have I rewritten that freaking formula?

196
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,456
Just to make it feel right.

197
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:40,213
So iteration, it's important.

198
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:42,874
So usually what I do is I show them some kind of architecture.

199
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:43,714
Here's my AI architecture.

200
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,456
I describe it to them and I say, what do you like

201
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:50,318
and what do you not like about this cool AI architecture?

202
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:53,340
Then I just start throwing everything I possibly can at it.

203
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,682
Basically, I play the world's shittiest designer.

204
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:59,563
So I gave them this architecture,

205
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,364
and I try and break it in every possible way

206
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,645
that I can to see how do you handle

207
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:06,587
not only the failure of breaking this architecture,

208
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,208
of your architecture starting to fall apart.

209
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:10,289
But how do you handle me as a designer making

210
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,010
all these design changes?

211
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,431
Because again, that's life, right?

212
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:14,672
A designer is going to come and say, you know,

213
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:15,753
I really like this.

214
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:17,434
But I think we should change it to do this.

215
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:17,994
How easy is that?

216
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:18,995
How hard is that?

217
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:22,417
How easily can I make relatively large,

218
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,738
from a behavioral point of view, changes?

219
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,740
And so either they're going to handle it or they can't.

220
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,121
They're going to be the board cube on the left,

221
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:29,902
and they're going to be perfectly fine.

222
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:32,404
Or they're going to fall apart completely on the right.

223
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:33,084
So that's what I do.

224
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:37,367
I spend those are the three main pillars of things

225
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:37,968
that I look for.

226
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:42,736
Now, I want to talk about interviewing anti-patterns.

227
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:43,856
That's the next big thing.

228
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,357
Interviewing anti-patterns.

229
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:49,538
So these are the types of things that I've done.

230
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:50,958
I think probably all of us have done this.

231
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,339
And certainly all of us have been in these

232
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:53,559
types of interviews.

233
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,100
And I've found that they've provided basically no utility

234
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,600
in terms of whether or not this person's going to be a

235
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,060
good engineer.

236
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,942
So the first one is questions that test whether or not

237
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,502
you've gotten this question before.

238
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,563
This is one of my favorites.

239
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:07,023
Oh, God.

240
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:07,143
OK.

241
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:12,172
This is one of my favorites, and I've gotten this twice now, at least two or three times now.

242
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:15,157
And I, I have people ask this question quite a bit. Here it is.

243
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:16,620
Detecting cycles in a linked list.

244
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,682
This question.

245
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:21,419
Right, we all know it's Floyd's cycle finding algorithm, right?

246
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,341
It's the two, it's the two pointers that sort of race each other.

247
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:28,585
Like, there's a, there's a, a constant time memory solution for this.

248
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:31,427
But here's the thing, like, what are you really testing for here?

249
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:33,849
Right, linked lists were invented as a thing in somewhere around 55, 56,

250
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:36,891
and Floyd's algorithm was invented sometime in 67.

251
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:40,094
Like, really? You're gonna expect somebody who has never heard of any of this stuff

252
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:42,596
to find something what took us over a decade to figure out.

253
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:45,238
That's, I don't know what you're really testing for here

254
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:46,979
when you're doing this kind of stuff.

255
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:49,339
Also, and I'm gonna actually ask this,

256
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,000
how many of you by show of hands

257
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,241
in some production environment

258
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:54,222
have actually implemented this algorithm?

259
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:54,603
I'm curious.

260
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:54,703
Zero.

261
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:59,046
What the fuck are you testing for?

262
00:09:59,046 --> 00:09:59,986
Right?

263
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:01,107
I hate this question.

264
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:02,148
This question is useless.

265
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:05,670
Do things that you're actually paying them to do, right?

266
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,751
Okay, second question.

267
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:10,654
Questions that test your memorization.

268
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:14,525
So this is like API questions, unless you need an API expert,

269
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:16,586
like deep API questions.

270
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:18,607
And so I was once asked, this is one of the stupidest

271
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:22,890
questions I ever got, was what does cster do on the

272
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,011
string class?

273
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:24,391
Really?

274
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:24,471
OK.

275
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:28,479
Mathematical formulas, I don't like,

276
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,040
Bezier curve is another good one.

277
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,603
I don't, I couldn't, I couldn't recite that right now,

278
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:33,664
but I can look it up in two seconds,

279
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,286
and I can tell you why or when to apply

280
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:37,507
that particular thing.

281
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:38,648
What does it actually do?

282
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,930
What are the various tuning values for it, and so on.

283
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,993
So having somebody explain the purpose of these formulas,

284
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,155
great, anything I can look up in two seconds,

285
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:46,655
what's the point?

286
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,936
They'll just look it up.

287
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,478
In a real, in the real world environment,

288
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,059
they're just gonna look that stuff up, and they should.

289
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,022
Again, the exceptions are if you need an expert in that particular thing.

290
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,443
So if you're working on a Unity game and you need someone who has really deep knowledge

291
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,063
of Unity, great.

292
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:01,604
Ask all of the Unity questions you want.

293
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:03,825
Okay, esoteric language questions.

294
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:06,946
This is basically the same type of thing.

295
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:12,609
So these are like language, like deep, deep language questions that, does it really matter?

296
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,531
I mean, I can tell you I learned C sharp

297
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:18,311
because I got hired on The Sims Medieval, which used C sharp.

298
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,332
I learned Python, that I know Python,

299
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:22,352
because I got hired on The Sims 4 that used Python.

300
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:25,312
That's how I've learned, with the exception of C++

301
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:27,373
and x86 Assembler, that's the only,

302
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:32,054
I've only learned languages because I've been hired

303
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:33,554
on a project that used them.

304
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:35,974
So, unless you want a language expert,

305
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:38,075
or they have it on their resume and there's gotchas,

306
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:40,615
for instance, Lua's one-indexed arrays, thank you,

307
00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:45,657
Then I don't think that it's useful to ask these types of questions at all.

308
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,258
I don't know what it's really going to get you.

309
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:50,979
Again, if you're hiring an expert, all language questions are fair game.

310
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:51,019
OK.

311
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,380
Finally, clever puzzle questions.

312
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,161
Right? These are like, why are manhole covers round?

313
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:58,222
How many gas stations are there in San Francisco?

314
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:01,143
And this is maybe where I'm going to get the most pushback.

315
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:05,235
These types of questions, I get why they're asked.

316
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:09,178
Right, so like how many gas stations are in San Francisco?

317
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:11,060
Or I think the original one was in Seattle,

318
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,361
because I think it was a Microsoft question.

319
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:16,685
So this question is basically asked to see

320
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,928
how do you think about this sort of super abstract problem?

321
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:21,289
But I think there are better ways

322
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:23,832
to handle these types of questions, right?

323
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:29,467
For example, one of my co-workers, Peter Ingerbretson,

324
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,028
who I did a lot of these interviews with

325
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:33,949
when I was at Maxis, he has a famous question,

326
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:35,710
which is his sock question.

327
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,691
And he starts it off, prefaces it with,

328
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,292
this is not a trick question.

329
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,933
How do you sort your socks when you first wake up?

330
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,974
Or when you first get them from the dryer?

331
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:49,096
And then goes into more questions beyond that.

332
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:50,997
So you can make these types of questions work,

333
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:53,137
but just asking them open-ended abstractly,

334
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:53,998
I don't think buys you anything.

335
00:12:53,998 --> 00:12:55,619
OK, real fast, the conclusion.

336
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:58,540
Use programming tests to gauge their ability to write code.

337
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,941
The in-person interview should be about high-level CS concepts,

338
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:04,362
AI concepts, that kind of stuff, iteration ability,

339
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:07,564
and please avoid those four anti-patterns that I created.

340
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:09,245
And this is Brian.

341
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:09,645
Thank you.

342
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:09,845
Thank you.

343
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:10,085
Thank you.

344
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:10,305
Thank you.

345
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:14,187
Thank you.

346
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:14,787
How much time?

347
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:15,187
I don't know.

348
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:17,929
All right, hi.

349
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:22,013
So I'm gonna, I'm Brian, this is Rez.

350
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:26,856
And you people are beautiful.

351
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:30,079
I'm gonna be doing the other half of the talk,

352
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,381
which is the more squishy side of the interview,

353
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:34,242
where I'm gonna try and talk to people

354
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:37,465
and find out who they are as a person,

355
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:42,709
instead of as a coding gent or gentess.

356
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:45,612
Jesus, what's the version of that?

357
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:47,723
Or a lady.

358
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:50,766
So anyways, three clowns and an AI programmer

359
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,367
walk into a bar and the joke is basically,

360
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:55,930
can you tell the difference?

361
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,592
Why is hiring a great AI person hard?

362
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:01,475
Is it literally because AI programmers are that special,

363
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:04,337
that we're that rare, that it's just hard to find us?

364
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:06,139
I don't think so, it's the other direction.

365
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,222
It's because AI in general is a super broad subject.

366
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:11,484
You could be talking about navigation or...

367
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,826
you know, animation or cognition or decision making or,

368
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,866
and I'm not even gonna get into like,

369
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:21,387
the different genres of games have very, very deep levels

370
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:22,628
of knowledge in each sort of thing.

371
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,048
So it's a super broad subject.

372
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:27,829
You need a lot of design sense.

373
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,270
Some AI challenges have to require design changes

374
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,791
in order to solve really.

375
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,231
You not only have to be a computer scientist,

376
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,472
you have to be a cognitive scientist.

377
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,512
And so you can really understand how the brain works

378
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:37,333
so that you can like,

379
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,014
trick it better into thinking that you're making an intelligent system.

380
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:45,418
And you need somebody who can basically talk to anybody else on the team, because a lot

381
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:52,086
of AI systems that really, really come together well are a very hardcore gelled version of

382
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:52,386
code art.

383
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,522
audio, the whole nine yards, like coming together at one.

384
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:59,165
And finally, you kind of have to write really high quality code because

385
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:03,249
the AI programmers are kind of up on the top of the totem pole of the whole

386
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:06,592
code stack. And so, if somebody throws a bad animation in there,

387
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:09,794
the AI is broke. If somebody puts some bad markup data in a level,

388
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:12,817
the AI is broke. And if you don't write high quality code,

389
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:16,472
they're going to actually think the AI is broke over and over and over again.

390
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:22,378
Whereas if you can get your code good high quality and then make good debug systems,

391
00:15:22,378 --> 00:15:26,362
you can actually start having the rest of the people in the totem pole debug their stuff

392
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:31,106
instead of always just basically assuming it's your stuff.

393
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:31,887
So it's a hard problem.

394
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,821
So you're going to interview somebody.

395
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,422
Be prepared is my first thing.

396
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:38,184
A candidate's going to come in.

397
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,126
They're going to want to have a lot of questions

398
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:41,767
about what kind of genre you're working on,

399
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,889
what the team size is, what kind of autonomy

400
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:46,331
they can prepare for, all of this.

401
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:48,353
Sorry about the little purple thing.

402
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:50,215
That's a little scene in a sec.

403
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,986
And then the other thing you should also do is not only know all this stuff about your game,

404
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,688
you should actually look at the person's resume ahead of time.

405
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,230
Most people don't do this. I have no idea why.

406
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,713
This is actually some random candidate's resume. I don't know who this is.

407
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,434
It's mine.

408
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:12,065
I usually just go through it and do some quick check boxes so that I know things that I want

409
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:15,086
to ask them about, like what projects they've worked on in the past.

410
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:18,788
I want to quickly skim through and see what their role progression has been over the course

411
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:19,769
of their career.

412
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:25,572
Usually, what I'm looking for is discontinuity in the graph of their things.

413
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:30,274
So if they go from college to CTO back to janitor, I kind of want to ask them about

414
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:30,474
that.

415
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:31,555
That might be a good thing or bad.

416
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:32,075
I don't know.

417
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,436
And then finally I quickly scan through

418
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:36,877
and find other words that I don't see in a lot of resumes

419
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:39,117
like this particular person published a book

420
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:42,238
and he also has led teams and he's also done design work.

421
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:44,459
So I'm gonna ask about that

422
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,179
when I get into the room with them.

423
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,040
Don't read their damn resume in front of them.

424
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,581
It takes up a lot of time

425
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:53,402
and it shows a lot of disrespect.

426
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:55,002
You don't have much time with a person

427
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:56,802
and we're trying to find,

428
00:16:56,802 --> 00:17:00,484
we're trying to find out a lot about this person

429
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:01,684
in a very short period of time.

430
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:07,491
And I don't have really cool ways that you supposedly went to college for to do it

431
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,173
when I'm talking about these more soft human skills instead.

432
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:17,296
So, get in the room, and the first thing, like Rez was saying, is determine their nervousness level.

433
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:20,573
Again, we have a very short time,

434
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,334
and I need to break that down really, really fast,

435
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,656
because I'm gonna ask you to confide a lot in me

436
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:26,977
over the next hour, let's say.

437
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:30,600
And so one of the things I've determined, actually,

438
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,341
with personality, because I'm not gonna have them

439
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:34,262
do whiteboard tests, I'm not gonna have them do,

440
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,643
is if they're really, really super nervous,

441
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:36,844
I'll just say, hey, do you wanna walk?

442
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:38,626
The little bit of physical activity

443
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:41,187
actually sucks the nervous energy right out of them.

444
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:43,269
I actually had one interview where I walked in,

445
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:45,871
it just happened to be on Halloween,

446
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,052
and I came in dressed as Thor.

447
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:50,919
and gave the interview.

448
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,883
And I said, you know, I'm sorry about this afterwards.

449
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:56,185
She goes, actually, I was super nervous,

450
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:59,489
but then when you came and dressed as Thor,

451
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:00,530
it just all went away.

452
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,872
So now I do that all the time.

453
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,332
No, I'm just kidding.

454
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:06,309
So basically what you wanna do is quickly transition

455
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:07,770
into a full-blown conversation.

456
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,051
This should be a very pleasant conversation.

457
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,032
Shakespeare is always good with the words.

458
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:14,952
You know, try to be pleasant and witty

459
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:16,393
and make it an open sort of notion.

460
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:19,614
It's a very trusting environment, but it should be novel.

461
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:22,055
If things feel too rehearsed,

462
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:23,676
people are gonna pick up on that really quick.

463
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:28,014
But this is where you really need to know something about yourself as an interviewer.

464
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:31,576
If you're not the kind of person that can walk up to anybody and start a conversation,

465
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:36,379
if you're not the kind of person that feels comfortable sharing so that they'll feel comfortable

466
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:40,181
in return sharing, things can get really weird really fast and you don't want to do that.

467
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:42,963
So maybe you're not the right person for this part of the interview.

468
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:45,937
Biggest thing you want to find here is,

469
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:48,382
does this person fit into the team?

470
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:51,286
Is he a good ingredient in the team stew

471
00:18:51,286 --> 00:18:52,949
that you've currently got going?

472
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,632
So I ask a couple of questions,

473
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,475
usually about what's the worst project

474
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:57,757
they've ever been on and the best project

475
00:18:57,757 --> 00:18:58,438
they've ever been on.

476
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,800
depending on how the conversation is going so far,

477
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
is which one I ask first, right?

478
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,861
And the thing is that these actually give you

479
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,241
very different notions back about the person.

480
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,782
The worst job, it could be because

481
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,822
the game sucked or the team sucked.

482
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:15,803
And in either case, I wanna know if they have any notions

483
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:16,703
as to how to fix things.

484
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:18,683
I also wanna know how much smack they're gonna talk about

485
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:23,244
their ex-employee or ex-peers or their employer.

486
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,705
I kinda wanna get a sense of like,

487
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,965
how sort of spiteful people are, if you will.

488
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,863
You know, games are a high-tension environment and this is going to come up.

489
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:36,326
I don't know that I want somebody that's going to walk around for the next 20 years telling

490
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:39,568
everybody what a POSI is because of one thing that I made him do someday.

491
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:45,031
I want to know if they'll take any personal responsibility for if things went bad, if

492
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:48,554
they have any thoughts of it, or if they're the kind of person that just blames everybody

493
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,374
else.

494
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:52,017
And then finally, I have to know their pet peeves.

495
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:55,400
Pet peeves are actually the thing that in many cases will ruin an entire project for

496
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,760
people.

497
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,164
It turns out that this person just absolutely can't stand being in the dark, and the whole

498
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:01,465
team loves to have the lights out.

499
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:04,308
and I know my team actually has the lights out

500
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,089
and so if that's his pet peeve,

501
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:07,931
it's probably not gonna work out.

502
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,073
In the other direction, the best job ever

503
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:12,355
tells me their passions and what they think,

504
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:13,736
what's most valuable to them.

505
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:15,638
They might actually tell me,

506
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:17,760
I've had this multiple times where a person tells me

507
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,061
that his favorite job ever.

508
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,704
had constant year-long crunch,

509
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:23,666
and he hated half the people on the team.

510
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,668
But goddamn if he didn't love the game,

511
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:27,009
and they shipped on time!

512
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:29,572
And so like, I know exactly what that person values

513
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:32,255
and what he's gonna overlook every other bad thing

514
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:33,877
if he just gets that one thing, right?

515
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:38,155
Secondly, it tells me where in the hierarchy they really want to be.

516
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:42,277
Type A, type of very, very go-getter people

517
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:45,680
will rarely ever tell you that their best job was whether they were a foot soldier.

518
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,381
But they will tell you that, you know,

519
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:50,563
somebody took a chance on me and gave me this huge pile of responsibility

520
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:51,704
and it was the greatest job.

521
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:55,086
And so now you know kind of what they think of themselves

522
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,008
as far as what they're capable of

523
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:59,469
and also where in the hierarchy they see themselves.

524
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:05,896
Anytime you're talking about projects, though, please make sure you very explicitly ask them what it was that they did themselves.

525
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:13,665
Otherwise, you might get a story about their favorite job, and it turns out that they were an embedded QA on it for a week, you know, 20 years ago, and they just still love that job.

526
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,528
Just make sure that you find out.

527
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:22,034
Next area I go into is I ask this question, what kind of work do you want to do here? This just gives me their expectations.

528
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:24,477
And again, it goes back to that broad AI notion.

529
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:27,439
I want to know if what they think of as game AI

530
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:30,320
is what I think of as game AI.

531
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,121
And I tend to just let them go on this for the longest time

532
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:36,322
because even if they don't have a perfect fit for my team,

533
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:38,863
there's a lot of other roles potentially in the company.

534
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:40,824
And so I let them go as to what kind of work

535
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:42,124
they actually want to do,

536
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:44,726
because that role might be down the hallway.

537
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:47,106
And so even if they don't fit specifically on my team,

538
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,807
I can go get them to somebody else real quick.

539
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,512
And then finally, to Rez's Microsoft questions,

540
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:55,653
the puzzle questions.

541
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:57,975
I don't really believe in them either

542
00:21:57,975 --> 00:21:59,636
when it comes to technical code

543
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:01,698
or how abstract problem solving happens.

544
00:22:01,698 --> 00:22:04,260
But when it comes to getting to the deep notions

545
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,501
of what personality are,

546
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:07,803
I actually agree with personality style

547
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,084
Microsoft questions, if you will.

548
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:10,565
So I'll ask questions like,

549
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,447
how often do you change the layout of your living room?

550
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:13,948
This gives me a little bit of a notion

551
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:15,789
as to their OCD nature,

552
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:18,572
how much of like the control of their environment

553
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:19,573
they kind of have.

554
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:20,613
And to a certain extent.

555
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:26,155
This actually has a pretty good correlation with how they feel about code refactoring.

556
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:29,317
Do you like 20 problems or one problem with 20 parts?

557
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:31,217
This is a sort of a question that says,

558
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:34,418
do you mind having a bunch of tasks that could go in a million different directions,

559
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:38,900
or do you absolutely kind of need this tethering one direction that you can always steer back towards?

560
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,621
I find that people that are going to be doing prototyping enjoy more 20 problems,

561
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:46,443
versus people that are more production-oriented want one problem with 20 parts.

562
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:49,561
When's the last time you changed somebody's life?

563
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:51,504
This is a sneaky way of finding out

564
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,885
how good of a leader they are,

565
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:54,287
even if they've never had a lead role.

566
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:57,331
Sometimes it doesn't take much to change somebody's life,

567
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:59,894
and the people that actually have cool answers

568
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:03,378
to this question are probably good people

569
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:04,360
that you want on your team.

570
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:07,237
When was your favorite childhood toy?

571
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:08,958
If you're outside playing sports

572
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,778
versus inside playing with Legos

573
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:13,240
versus you had a bunch of action figures and dolls

574
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,800
and you were doing more story-based stuff,

575
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,042
I wanna kinda know the deep lizard-level brain

576
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,083
of what you think of as play.

577
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,924
Because I know what this company thinks of as play

578
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:23,845
and I wanna know if you're compatible with that

579
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,666
and I also wanna know if the thing that really drives you

580
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,368
is exploration or social dynamics

581
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:32,149
or building, those sorts of things.

582
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:34,746
How many books did you read last year?

583
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,327
This is kind of a general one.

584
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:39,590
I know a lot of really smart people that don't read at all,

585
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,413
but everybody I know that's a voracious reader

586
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:43,073
is really smart.

587
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:45,934
And typically, if you're a voracious reader

588
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:48,616
and you don't know exactly what it is that's going on,

589
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:51,077
you'll probably go pick up a book and read about it

590
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:52,799
and learn about it and be good.

591
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,000
And if you have that voracious reading habit,

592
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,361
I find that those type of people,

593
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:59,102
especially in an environment that's a little bit chaotic,

594
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:00,263
I don't have to worry about them as much

595
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:03,145
because they'll just read the damn wiki or something

596
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:04,686
and figure out how to make things happen.

597
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:08,242
and tell me something there's no way I would ever guess about you.

598
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:11,266
If I actually have spent some time with you and we do have some trust,

599
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:14,490
I find this is a cool question that they'll give me an answer to

600
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,874
that there's no possible way that I could ever know how to ask them.

601
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,717
And so they'll give up information that's cool or deep about them

602
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:23,460
that like I couldn't have thought otherwise.

603
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:25,615
So then I turn it about, of course.

604
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:28,476
I always give them, this is a conversation, right?

605
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,857
So I'm always asking them questions that they can answer,

606
00:24:30,857 --> 00:24:32,918
but at the end, give them extra time.

607
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:35,279
And now slam right up against the edge of your NDA

608
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,700
because this is the place where you wanna show

609
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,461
the company's flaws, you wanna say, hey, you know what?

610
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:42,402
No place is perfect, but here's why

611
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:43,823
working here is good anyway.

612
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:46,284
The company is good, the project is good,

613
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,625
the people are good, and therefore,

614
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,385
the flaws aren't the problem.

615
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:55,433
Also, I have a lot of excellent answers to why do you work here, because everybody asks

616
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:56,154
this question.

617
00:24:56,154 --> 00:25:01,661
It's sort of like the easy, I'm going to ask the interviewer the question question.

618
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:04,945
And please don't have a rehearsed answer because it comes off as very...

619
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:11,600
It comes off as rehearsed and it's insincere.

620
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,382
And again, human beings are just gloriously good

621
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,864
at doing insincerity.

622
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:18,026
And remember the doorknob questions.

623
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:19,567
This is a medical thing.

624
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,669
People will go to the doctor,

625
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:24,231
they'll say they have something that's untoward,

626
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,913
wrong with them, so they don't want to say it

627
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:27,574
because they're embarrassed.

628
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:30,035
They'll say, I have stomach pain and a headache,

629
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:32,336
some generic thing, and they'll hope the doctor can find it,

630
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:33,796
and of course, he never does.

631
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:35,977
And then he'll go, okay, and he'll walk over to the door,

632
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:38,418
and he'll grab the doorknob, and he'll turn around and say,

633
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:39,578
so is there anything else?

634
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:41,338
And there's some actual statistic

635
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:44,559
that some large percentage of all diagnoses

636
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,600
happen with the doctor's hand sitting on the doorknob

637
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,281
going, are we done now?

638
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,282
And that's actually right when the person says,

639
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:54,602
oh well, I'm having, hmm, hmm, hmm, all right?

640
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:55,883
And then that's when it comes out.

641
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,109
So usually what happens at the end of the interview is I basically say,

642
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:04,840
you know, here's my, you know, I have to go now, but here's my, my.

643
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,819
my email address, an hour from now when you think of a question,

644
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:12,141
or tonight at 3 AM when you wake up with this question in your mouth,

645
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:14,202
please just shoot it off to me and do it.

646
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:16,703
More times than not, that is the question.

647
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:19,064
The answer to that question is the one that

648
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:20,665
gets the person to actually join the company.

649
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:23,467
That's the one that they really have a deep fear,

650
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:25,868
or they really have and they didn't think of it on the time,

651
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:28,910
because maybe we did have a good conversation and it took too long.

652
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,531
Anyway, so that's the last part of that.

653
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,952
So any questions?

654
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:46,807
if you're right in the back with your hand on the doorknob.

655
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:47,028
Hold on.

656
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:49,249
Yeah, go ahead.

657
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:50,810
We got you.

658
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,892
I put my hand on the doorknob.

659
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:55,693
He put his hand on me.

660
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:57,814
I am apparently the doorknob.

661
00:26:57,814 --> 00:27:00,496
So, yeah, we've got two, three minutes.

662
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,017
Come back up here so you're on camera when you're answering.

663
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:06,479
So we'll start here, and it depends on which way you turn to in your second.

664
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:08,938
Sure, Jim Whitehead from UC Santa Cruz.

665
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:10,859
So I'll ask kind of on behalf of my students.

666
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:12,940
Seems like a lot of what you were talking about

667
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,581
was aimed at people who had a little bit more experience.

668
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,262
And I'm just wondering if there were things

669
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,143
you could say more to someone who's fresh out,

670
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:22,665
entry level, who is also going through this process.

671
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:25,766
Like trying to get a job, basically, that sort of thing?

672
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:27,647
Right, yeah, like maybe they've done a game project

673
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:31,589
as an undergraduate, they've done the AI on that.

674
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:38,612
Not like they've worked on some shipped triple-a title, but they would certainly love to break in and they love it. Yeah

675
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:45,076
I had a whole extra five minutes where I was going to literally go through just that that

676
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:45,497
I had to cut.

677
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:51,919
Very briefly, for technical stuff, when it comes to students, make sure that you study

678
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,100
up on those things that I had mentioned.

679
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,982
Those are things that you could ask for, but the hard part is, especially entry-level jobs,

680
00:27:57,982 --> 00:28:03,544
I'll have thump, here's 60 resumes that are all, I have a four-year CS degree and have

681
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:05,505
done a student project or something.

682
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:06,445
So it's really about...

683
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,347
It's really about those projects, those student projects.

684
00:28:09,347 --> 00:28:14,110
And that's, in fact, I hired a student of yours once,

685
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,411
based specifically on their final project.

686
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:19,073
At least that's what made me bring him in

687
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,114
for the in-person interview and all that stuff.

688
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:22,475
So those personal projects,

689
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:24,896
that's how you break out of that paradox of the industry

690
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:27,078
of must have experience making games

691
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:28,919
before you can come into the industry

692
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,880
and get experience making games,

693
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,861
is those projects are the magical ones.

694
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:35,783
I have a lot of other things that I could say.

695
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:36,683
Let's talk afterwards.

696
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:38,024
I'd love to.

697
00:28:38,024 --> 00:28:39,646
Yeah, on my side, it's mostly the same.

698
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:42,668
I will talk to them about how they work together

699
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:44,669
with their teams on their school projects,

700
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:47,412
because I'm trying to test interpersonal communication

701
00:28:47,412 --> 00:28:50,374
issues and how you deal with people that just don't want

702
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:52,615
to do anything, and those sorts of issues,

703
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:54,977
which are exactly the same if you're in college

704
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,398
or you're at Ubisoft.

705
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:56,578
Yeah.

706
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:58,260
All right, thank you.

707
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,920
Thanks.

708
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:03,848
Hi, so I've been on both sides of being a person who's

709
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:07,932
interviewing people and also a person who has interviewed.

710
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:11,956
And for both sides, I've run into situations where someone

711
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:14,879
can kind of talk the talk without walking the walk.

712
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:18,902
So they're able to kind of say the right buzzwords, answer

713
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:21,185
the questions, like this.

714
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:21,785
Kind of.

715
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,862
faking their way through the interview.

716
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:28,024
Do you know of any red flags for both the interviewer

717
00:29:28,024 --> 00:29:30,566
and the interviewee that kind of dictate,

718
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:34,068
oh, this might be a bad job, or oh, this is a bad candidate,

719
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,969
and they're trying to kind of talk their way

720
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:38,471
into a position that's not good?

721
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:39,572
So technically?

722
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:42,894
Like they're failing technically when they get on the team?

723
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:46,496
Right, but they're actually able to kind of list off the skills

724
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:48,057
and answer a couple of technical questions

725
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:50,178
because they've actually researched

726
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:52,060
or they've been to panels about.

727
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,615
how to do a 10-hour interview.

728
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:57,376
So they're regurgitating what's in a book, basically,

729
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,217
or what they've heard at a talk.

730
00:29:58,217 --> 00:30:02,338
That's why the programming test is critical.

731
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:05,940
And that's why I also give it as one of the very first things

732
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,281
that I do is I hand them this programming test and say,

733
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,022
write code.

734
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:11,943
And it's not something that they're

735
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,163
going to be able to look up.

736
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:13,703
It's like.

737
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:17,186
here's an actual thing that I need you to do that is somewhat

738
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:21,089
related to the game itself. So, you know, they can sit there and use every buzzword

739
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,110
that they want in terms of utility theory, but if I say,

740
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,212
here's a little project, build me a little utility system

741
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:30,255
for these autonomous agents so that I have a virtual city working,

742
00:30:30,255 --> 00:30:32,697
then they're going to be able to do it or they're going to fall apart.

743
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,258
And I've had the opposite be true, by the way, as well,

744
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:37,499
where they can, and more often where they,

745
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:39,661
I had a candidate who fell completely apart

746
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:41,061
in the in-person technical interview,

747
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:42,662
but when we gave him the programming test,

748
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:44,923
it was really solid, we hired him, he was great.

749
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:47,364
Okay, so you see the actual technical test

750
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:49,866
as an absolute must-win interviewer?

751
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:50,946
Yeah, oh, absolutely.

752
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:52,907
Because I've had that same problem

753
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:54,788
when I don't give the programming test.

754
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,389
If someone will come in,

755
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:57,950
they sort of know what they're talking about,

756
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,571
and then, but they can't walk the walk.

757
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:02,092
They can't actually write the code.

758
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:02,712
All right, thank you.

759
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:03,832
You're welcome.

760
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:04,596
And that's it.

761
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,962
Thanks, guys.
