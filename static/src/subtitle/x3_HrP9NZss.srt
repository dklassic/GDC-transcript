00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:04,013
This is episode one of the GDC podcast.

2
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:07,317
Hey guys.

3
00:00:07,878 --> 00:00:08,559
So we're going to wait.

4
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:12,643
I like your radio voice.

5
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:14,946
Sometimes it just comes out.

6
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:36,258
I'm your host, or co-host, I suppose.

7
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:39,541
Chris Graft, I'm editor-in-chief of Gamasutra, and I'm joined by...

8
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,823
Oh, Alyssa McAloon.

9
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:50,091
I am the news editor and associate publisher who frequently forgets her titles at Gamasutra.

10
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:51,793
That's good, that sounds important.

11
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:52,978
It's really embarrassing.

12
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:53,119
Yeah.

13
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:55,601
We actually have a guest but he, we told him just to lurk in the background for the next

14
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:59,644
few minutes and then we're gonna bring him out like a big surprise as if his name isn't

15
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:01,326
gonna be in the description of this podcast.

16
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,187
Ruining all the mystery of the podcast production.

17
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:03,488
But you can...

18
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:04,329

Bye!

23
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:10,094
Bye!

24
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:10,194
Bye!

25
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:10,274
Bye!

26
00:01:10,294 --> 00:01:10,374
Bye!

27
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:10,774
Bye!

28
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:10,914
Bye!

29
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:10,994
Bye!

30
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:14,577
You can hear him giggling in the background.

31
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:19,059
So yeah, this is the GDC podcast, so maybe for a couple of minutes we should

32
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,382
talk about GDC and let's just talk about this podcast.

33
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,284
This is the first one. I mean, GDC is what, Alyssa, is it

34
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:31,547
100th anniversary? Oh yeah, at least. Okay, yeah, so the GDC

35
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:35,429
podcast, I mean, I think that we kind of were like, hey,

36
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,392
we want to do a podcast. It's what, uh, we want to get

37
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:39,972
into radio.

38
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:43,864
Well, there's a lot of interesting developments in GDC this month.

39
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:48,446
There's a lot of interesting GDC-adjacent people that you wouldn't otherwise get to

40
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:51,847
talk to unless you tune into a stream or read one of GDC's many blog posts.

41
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,528
So this gives you a more portable medium to do that.

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,491
Oh my gosh, that was really good.

43
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:57,432
Yeah, off the cuff too.

44
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,893
Yeah, that was way better than my explanation.

45
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:06,216
Yeah, so Game Developers Conference, even though it only comes around once a year, it's

46
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:11,839
something that, believe it or not, people are working on it all the time, all year round.

47
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:16,001
People's entire careers are based on this one week.

48
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,482
Isn't that absolutely mind boggling?

49
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:22,125
It sure is. It is mind-boggling. What are we doing with our lives?

50
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:28,690
So yeah, but it's practically here, right? It's March 16th to the 21st, so mark that down. 2020.

51
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:38,337
Clear your calendars for GDC 2020. I don't even like saying 2020, like the year. It doesn't roll

52
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:44,762
off the tongue at all. Yeah, and it just feels like so past the year 2000. I'm looking forward

53
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:46,683
to 2021. It's exciting. That just sounds like...

54
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:54,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's sequential too. Yeah, I mean, once you get to 2020, I feel like

55
00:02:55,031 --> 00:03:00,976
you can start saying, legitimately saying, 2000 was the turn of the century. Like,

56
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:05,781
I was wearing JNCO jeans at the turn of the century. That type of thing.

57
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:09,284
I don't want to talk about what I was doing. Because I was eight years old.

58
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:15,867
Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, geez. I'll let you all try to figure out if I was joking about wearing

59
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:20,929
JNCO jeans. Real quick, some GDC stuff that's actually going on. Things are starting to

60
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:30,794
ramp up, right? You've got IGF submissions are open now for the 2020 IGF, right? So you

61
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:34,895
should submit to that. I think you can find where to do that with a quick Google.

62
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:37,637
Yeah, accepted now through September 30th, 2019.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,741
Oh my gosh, you are like ready.

64
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:42,722
I got the links, yeah.

65
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:44,602
Oh my gosh, yeah, and this is like the,

66
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,023
yeah, this is the first time we're doing this too.

67
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:49,284
Okay, only downhill from here.

68
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:54,046
So ramping up, we're also gonna be XRDC.

69
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:56,127
It's like a sibling event.

70
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:58,828
It's for VR, not just VR games,

71
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:02,629
but other stuff that you do with visual computing.

72
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:05,570
That is happening in October.

73
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,911
So yeah, we should come to that.

74
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,693
October 14 through October 16, looks like.

75
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:13,854
Oh, that's good.

76
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,055
Here with the notes, I'm here to cover.

77
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:17,558
No, this is working out great for me.

78
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,020
I don't have to hardly prepare.

79
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:21,482
Oh, we also opened up...

80
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,844
This is important.

81
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:28,650
So we're opening up our coffer papers for...

82
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,532
Actually, we already opened it up.

83
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:38,034
For our core concepts line of GDC talks and don't be afraid of core concepts.

84
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:39,035
That's just another word.

85
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:45,477
We've, uh, we've renamed, uh, the discipline based tracks for GDC.

86
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:50,839
So if you have ideas for our advocacy track, audio, business and marketing

87
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:55,400
design, production and team management, programming, and visual arts, if you

88
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,941
have ideas for talks and you want to share all that knowledge at GDC 2020.

89
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:06,284
Um, yeah, you should definitely submit. We implore you to.

90
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:14,367
Yeah, you can find all this information on gdconf.com. That's kind of weird, isn't it?

91
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:24,591
Is it gdconf.com or gdconf? Yeah, so gdconf.com. Um, and there's all kinds of news just spilling

92
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,572
out of the official Twitter account at official underscore GDC.

93
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,771
You know what else is new?

94
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:35,714
That's not a rhetorical question.

95
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:38,997
Your audio cut out for me there.

96
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:40,838
So I'm not sure what the rhetorical question is.

97
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:41,619
I don't know what happened.

98
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,122
Um, yeah, there's, uh, there's, there was another new announcement

99
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:47,864
and it was advisory board members.

100
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:54,049
So these GDC advisory board members, these are people who help us basically

101
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:54,389
shape.

102
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,034
the content or the hashtag content of the show, if you will.

103
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,077
And that kind of brings us to our guest, our super secret guest.

104
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:09,861
This person is a full-sale Hall of Fame inductee.

105
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,122
He worked at MegaTouch.

106
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,945
Producer id Software, might have heard of him.

107
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:16,986
Epic Games, might have heard of it.

108
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:24,151
He also currently runs a production consultancy, it's called Shonk Ventures.

109
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,451
That's the first big clue.

110
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:26,812
Shonk Ventures.

111
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:30,014
This person is a long time friend of GDC.

112
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:33,596
He's been a CA, he's been a speaker.

113
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:36,158
Now he's on the advisory board.

114
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:43,443
He's also the co-author of books called Gear Up, Advanced Game Development Practices, and

115
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:45,324
another one called Creative Agility Tools.

116
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:49,707
I don't know how this person is bending the space-time continuum to do all this stuff.

117
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:55,971
Not only that, I'm really building this up a lot, so this is going to be huge.

118
00:06:57,352 --> 00:07:05,056
worked on. Credits include Rage, Paragon, Battle Breakers, Doom, Wolfenstein, and about 60 other

119
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:14,441
games, including a little app called Fortnite. Got credit on that. And so here we go. Let's

120
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:22,344
welcome Grant Schankweiler. Wow, that was overwhelming. Did we miss anything?

121
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:26,653
I don't know, I was born at some point.

122
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:27,834
I mean, that's just...

123
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,316
Chris, thank you for the great introduction.

124
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:32,157
That was a lot about me.

125
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,378
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:35,038
No problem.

127
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:39,081
This required so much internet stalking on Alyssa and I's part.

128
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,763
I mean, we started kind of feeling gross about it.

129
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:48,340
Yeah, so tell us a little bit about your background.

130
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,121
You are a producer and your consultancy is Shonk Ventures.

131
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,162
And tell me what you do.

132
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:58,284
Yeah, so I've been I've been making games for a long time.

133
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:02,906
I started actually making games when Pokemon Red came out.

134
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:06,768
My buddy and I swapped games back and forth back then.

135
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:11,230
And and I taught Pikachu Cut, which was apparently the wrong thing to do.

136
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,390
We got in a big fight.

137
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:12,890
We were.

138
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,671
Punching each other was great.

139
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:16,392
And I said, you know what?

140
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:19,274
I think we can make a better Pokemon game.

141
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:24,217
And so we designed our own game called Pokemon Killer, aptly

142
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:28,919
enough, submitted the game to Sony, actually sent paper

143
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,762
designs to Sony, and said, this is going to kill Pokemon.

144
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,283
You're going to be bigger than Nintendo.

145
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,266
They actually wrote back and said, we don't want to get

146
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,307
sued, but keep on designing games.

147
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:42,007
That's cool.

148
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:48,992
And that was it. From there on out, I've been making games. I started modding games and just

149
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:55,697
designing and doing goofy little things. And then I went to Wholesale University to learn to be a computer programmer.

150
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:57,518
And then I

151
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:05,484
started in the industry at Megatouch Games, as you mentioned, where I was a programmer and then quickly realized all the other programmers were

152
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,368
much better than me, and I was not progressing at the rate that I wanted to be. So I

153
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:15,439
So I told the creative director I would help him out with design, and next thing I knew

154
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:22,480
I was a designer, and then I was a lead designer, and then I was kind of running all the game

155
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,640
stuff at that company.

156
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:25,841
So that was crazy.

157
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:30,702
If you don't mind me interrupting real quick, we need to pump the brakes a little bit and

158
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:32,382
go back to Pokémon Killer.

159
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:39,884
And Sony actually must have looked at the design document if they replied to you and

160
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:41,945
said we don't want your game.

161
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,425
Yeah, yeah, which is of course crazy to think about.

162
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:52,111
I don't know if it was just like an intern or someone who opened up this file and was like,

163
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,574
just reply, it's like a kid, you know, make them feel good about their day.

164
00:09:55,994 --> 00:10:01,559
But I really appreciate that and I've had the opportunity to talk to many people who were at Sony back then

165
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:03,901
and say, you know, I want my document back.

166
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:13,803
So far no one has found it, which is probably good because one, it's terrible, and two,

167
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,964
my handwriting has not improved and was really bad back then.

168
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:21,645
It's just got to be framed up in someone's office somewhere, this letter that was sent

169
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:22,105
in once.

170
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:25,546
Yeah, the one thing I remember was that I used red ink.

171
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,906
I don't know why I remember that, but I used red ink because...

172
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:28,326
Killing!

173
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:29,567
Because of the killing part.

174
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:32,147
Yeah, it was a very violent game.

175
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:37,619
Do you think that Ken Kutaragi has that hanging in his family room?

176
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,580
I like to imagine that he does.

177
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,520
I would think that he does.

178
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:52,043
So you're a producer guy and you've done talks at GDC and PAX and other places.

179
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:57,724
And your background, when I'm listening to you talk,

180
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:02,825
obviously you're well-versed in the methodologies of product development and all that.

181
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:03,465
But...

182
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:08,286
You talk about the fundamental stuff, like the foundational things. Can you

183
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:15,168
tell us like the most important parts of being a producer? Yeah, so the most

184
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,268
important thing that I always tell you know when I when I start working with a

185
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:21,729
junior producer is first off your communication skills, right? You have to

186
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:26,310
be able to communicate with people at their level and their

187
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,071
language, so I recommend all of my junior producers.

188
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:34,531
Learn a little bit about coding, learn a little bit about design and art and stuff.

189
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,073
I'm not asking them to become those things, but at least be able to speak the language.

190
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:42,396
I often tell them to do the thing that I do, which is like,

191
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm not a senior artist, can you speak to me like I'm five and explain to me what maps are, or whatever it might be?

192
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:56,384
Because you want to start to progress to the point where you aren't interrupting meetings because you just understand things.

193
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,865
So communication is the first one.

194
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:03,829
The second one is just understanding that people are people, and that is ultimately

195
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:04,309
our job.

196
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:06,091
Our job is people first.

197
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,375
So focusing on people and making sure that they have what they need.

198
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:14,759
Another thing I always tell people when they become producers or junior producers is, congratulations,

199
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:15,860
you're now the lowest of the low.

200
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,121
People think producers are the lowest of the low.

201
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:17,422
It's not true.

202
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:17,702
It's not true.

203
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:17,982
It's not true.

204
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:18,282
It's not true.

205
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:18,563
It's not true.

206
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:18,843
It's not true.

207
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,123
It's not true.

208
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:19,403
It's not true.

209
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:23,357
Our job is anything from getting coffee to making big decisions.

210
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:28,338
And we do that for everybody, even if they're considered more junior than us on the org

211
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:28,698
chart.

212
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,419
So I tell people, in a lot of ways, you're a servant.

213
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,199
You're a butler.

214
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:54,013
And you're also a little bit of a camp counselor because people will come to you and complain.

215
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,594
So those are like the core basics.

216
00:12:56,934 --> 00:13:02,777
If people understand that, then I can teach them how to be at least a decent leader based

217
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:06,878
off that and I can teach them all the processes of game development.

218
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,720
And those are things that you just learn as you make games.

219
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,082
But the core stuff, if you're not a good communicator and you don't understand people at a basic

220
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:18,083
level, then you're really going to struggle to be a producer.

221
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:25,672
It seems like humility and empathy are some core parts of being a leader as far as a producer

222
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:25,892
goes.

223
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:31,537
Yeah, which is interesting because then you talk me up and that makes me feel really narcissistic

224
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:34,139
and so I have to bring in the humbleness now, right?

225
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,761
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,341
Hey, great work.

227
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,242
Hey, you still suck.

228
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:48,719
Yeah, so you did something like a while ago, I talked to you a little bit about it at GDC,

229
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,301
and you left the game industry for a little bit, am I getting that right?

230
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:55,101
Yeah.

231
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:55,882
What did you do?

232
00:13:56,562 --> 00:14:02,004
Yeah, so I left Epic and took about a six month sabbatical.

233
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:09,918
And I wanted to, I won't say I wanted to understand myself or anything like that, but I weirdly

234
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:15,342
have had a job since I was very young, illegally at eight years old, and then I went to college

235
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:19,044
and then started making games and I realized I was starting to feel a little bit of burnout

236
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:23,387
and I was talking to different mentors that I have about burnout and realized that that

237
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:23,848
was coming.

238
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:29,892
And so I wanted to figure out if I could be happy doing something other than making games.

239
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:36,909
And so what I decided to do was just travel around the world and do odd jobs.

240
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,274
And that got to the point where I was, you know, staying with friends and building them a new restroom,

241
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:47,297
to, you know, working on construction sites in Indiana,

242
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:51,741
to going to New Zealand and hiking for a few weeks.

243
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:57,786
And then ultimately I ended up on an island called Lord Howe Island off the coast of Australia

244
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:00,648
that my friends own and was working on a farm.

245
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:06,116
for a while. So that was probably the culmination of it. Oh, the friends on the farm, not the

246
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:14,180
island. That sounds way crazier. So yeah, I worked on a farm and then I came back and

247
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,822
Clint asked me if I wanted to write a book with him and that's when I decided to come

248
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:20,703
back into the industry.

249
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:22,524
And you're talking about Clinton Keith?

250
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:23,924
Yes, Clinton Keith.

251
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:25,605
Yeah, world-renowned...

252
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:31,707
Production guru. Yeah, that was quite the shocking call when he was like, hey, you want to help me with this book?

253
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:37,772
And I was like, I've looked up to you since before I started in the industry. So I talked about a humbling moment

254
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:41,094
Yeah, that was one of them if not for that moment

255
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:44,857
Do you think you would have come back eventually or would you still be on a farm on an island somewhere?

256
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:50,561
Yeah, so interesting thing about that was I was on that farm, but I'd already bought tickets to the next GDC

257
00:15:52,681 --> 00:16:02,347
So I wasn't like, I'd already like volunteered to the SCA and a conference associate and I had bought my flights and hotel rooms and everything.

258
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:08,250
And I was like, I'm going to come back and I'm going to be this really weird person at GDC who's like, I work on a farm.

259
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:17,251
But what happened was I started working on this book and then I was at GDC and a friend of mine asked me to

260
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:20,072
Review some stuff that their company was doing

261
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:25,014
And then they paid me in an Amazon gift card and I was like wait

262
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:30,195
People get paid to like give other people advice and they were like he was like, yeah

263
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,557
In fact, we'd like to hire you to give you a tip for you to like review stuff and give us advice

264
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:37,558
And that's when I started my company was actually at GDC

265
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,796
I think a lot of people are like that, right?

266
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:48,082
I have some information, and you're obviously an enthusiastic guy sharing all of this stuff

267
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:54,827
that you've learned over the many years that you've been in game dev now.

268
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:58,430
People are just kind of like, oh, I can get paid for this?

269
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,173
For my time and all of these 10 years that I've been here, I can actually make a living

270
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:03,494
out of it?

271
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:04,795
Yeah.

272
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:09,279
Yeah, I've been doing it for free for so long that when somebody was like, I'll pay you, I'm like, is that fair?

273
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:20,436
Yeah, yeah, I don't know. I mean, your hands are calloused and your brain has been, you know,

274
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:27,439
just through all of this stuff. Hey, so like going off and doing that and kind of getting away

275
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:34,422
and you know what? Finding yourself, sure. What do you feel like you came away with from all that?

276
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:35,322
Like, what did you learn?

277
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:37,648
I learned a few things.

278
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:42,973
The first one was it allowed me to be creative in ways that I have never been before.

279
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:47,797
I used to write a lot when I was younger and I wanted to take some time off, so I actually

280
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:52,240
wrote a couple screenplays that I expect will never be made because I've never done anything

281
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,620
with them.

282
00:17:54,122 --> 00:18:00,147
But I wrote a couple screenplays just to kind of explore creativity in a different way.

283
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:05,471
I also learned that stress is really...

284
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,274
Fairly easy to defeat when you realize that most things that we're stressed

285
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:13,576
about are not important in the grand scheme of things.

286
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:18,821
This is a little philosophical, but when you're hiking in the middle of New

287
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:23,284
Zealand and you're the only person for like 50 miles around and you're sitting

288
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:28,128
on top of a mountain, you realize how infinitesimally small you are in the

289
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,890
grand scheme of the cosmos.

290
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,053
And so when you think about that and then you think about like.

291
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:37,187
Oh man, our game is broken in X way.

292
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:39,787
You're like, that doesn't really matter.

293
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:42,248
Uh, and so we're all going to be doing it anyway.

294
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:42,348
Yeah.

295
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:47,870
And so you can either go the very nihilistic route or you can go kind of a

296
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,831
positive route, which I do, which is like, Hey, this isn't like as soul crushing as

297
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:53,331
possible.

298
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:55,812
Let's just calm down, relax, and we'll get through it.

299
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:58,353
Um, and, and because of that, I feel like I'm.

300
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:03,910
Even more kind of chilled out when it comes to the hardcore process of making games.

301
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:06,532
So that was definitely a big thing that I learned.

302
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:12,976
As well as just learning a lot about myself and ways that I function well as far as sleeping,

303
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:13,896
eating, things like that.

304
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:18,479
Because I wasn't in a tight bubble of have to wake up at this time and do this and that

305
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:18,939
and that.

306
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:19,980
So, yeah.

307
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,583
I wasn't expecting the first GDC podcast to go full galaxy plane, but I appreciate it.

308
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:28,384
Yeah.

309
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,327
Um, so, all right.

310
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:36,712
We, uh, we talked about philosophical stuff, uh, maybe, which it was just great.

311
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:37,332
I love it.

312
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:40,995
And I think it is important, you know, that's the foundational foundational

313
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:44,318
stuff, uh, working in a, in a job like game development.

314
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:50,503
Um, so now I'm wondering, uh, why you wear a rugby shirts all the time.

315
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:53,146
That's let's get the nuts and bolts of production here.

316
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:56,628
I promise I'll segue into the production stuff.

317
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:59,550
So what's interesting is this is another GDC story.

318
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,492
So when I first started going to GDC in 2008,

319
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:07,736
there used to be a charity poker tournament that was open to anyone.

320
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,657
And I wanted to go.

321
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:13,099
And I was a student, and I was like,

322
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,561
you know, I don't really have any nice clothes.

323
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:18,323
The only thing I have that has a collar is a rugby jersey.

324
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:22,485
And so I wore a rugby jersey, and weirdly...

325
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:28,695
I guess not weirdly, most of the people who were at this poker tournament were people

326
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:32,557
who had been in the industry for a while, had disposable income, wanted to schmooze

327
00:20:32,577 --> 00:20:34,658
with each other and give to charity.

328
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:41,101
And so here I am, this young guy in my rugby jersey playing poker with people and beating

329
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:43,782
them quite soundly because I used to be very good at poker.

330
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:52,526
And I distinctly remember meeting Kenny Young at the time, another GEC advisory board member.

331
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:56,438
And him being like, you're American, why are you wearing a rugby jersey?

332
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:58,079
And I was like, well, I play rugby.

333
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,181
And he was like, oh, that's interesting.

334
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,663
So fast forward to the next day, and I'm walking around GDC,

335
00:21:03,723 --> 00:21:06,665
and Kenny comes over and he's like, hey, you're the rugby jersey guy.

336
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:08,066
And I was like, what?

337
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,168
And then somebody else came over and was like, hey,

338
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:11,328
you're the rugby jersey guy.

339
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:14,911
And that's when I was like, well, I guess I'm the rugby jersey guy.

340
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:17,052
So.

341
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:19,253
So that's my brand.

342
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:28,078
So ever since then, whenever I travel to a new country, I try and get a national rugby jersey or a team rugby jersey from that area.

343
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,440
And that is pretty much my exclusive wear when I'm doing professional things.

344
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,561
I'm even wearing one right now.

345
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:40,644
Other than maybe wearing a GDCCA shirt, most people expect to see me in a rugby jersey.

346
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:43,566
Those are the only two shirts that I've seen you.

347
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:51,888
Yeah, I went to visit friends who I had met through GEC once and I was not wearing a rugby jersey and they walked right past me.

348
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:55,420
And I was like, hey, I'm over here.

349
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,181
And they're like, oh, what are you wearing?

350
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:59,443
And I was like, it's just a t-shirt.

351
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:01,285
Completely unrecognizable.

352
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:03,967
There's like an Archer episode where he opens his closet,

353
00:22:03,987 --> 00:22:06,430
and it's all these like black and like off-black turtlenecks.

354
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,491
And like that's what I'm imagining.

355
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:09,953
It's just a closet, wall-to-wall, rugby jersey.

356
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:10,253
Yeah.

357
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:10,633
Pretty much.

358
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:14,217
Kind of like Steve Jobs and the turtleneck machines.

359
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:14,437
Exactly.

360
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:16,158
Great little networking pro tip.

361
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,099
Yeah.

362
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:17,339
Yeah.

363
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:21,223
So, speaking of rugby, scrum.

364
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:29,109
I mean, what came first, the rugby jerseys or the product development methodology, interest

365
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:29,750
in scrum?

366
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:32,412
That's interesting.

367
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:36,436
So, I've had rugby jerseys since high school, so that one would have come first.

368
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,960
And then I remember studying scrum for the first time in high school.

369
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:50,090
In college, and interestingly, there was like this whole video that they showed and it was a rugby player talking about scrum and agile development.

370
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,532
And I was the only person in the room who knew what he was actually talking about.

371
00:22:54,552 --> 00:22:56,493
So I was like, Oh, I played rugby.

372
00:22:57,033 --> 00:23:02,336
And so yeah, then I was like, well, you know, this takes one of my loves, which is.

373
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:05,399
So, I'm going to try and learn and become a master of this so that I can use it everywhere

374
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,540
and then I have a reason to wear rugby jerseys I guess.

375
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,543
So for our listeners, or maybe even listener, I don't know.

376
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:28,867
This is a brand new podcast, I don't know.

377
00:23:29,087 --> 00:23:32,250
Can you describe Scrum in rugby

378
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,693
and Scrum in product and game development?

379
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:37,434
Sure.

380
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:41,778
So Scrum in rugby is used to restart play.

381
00:23:41,938 --> 00:23:45,461
So just like in basketball when they throw the ball in

382
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,023
or soccer, they throw the ball in.

383
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:49,983
or if there's a penalty, they kick it.

384
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:56,525
In scrum, in rugby, there are a certain type of infraction that need to be restarted through a scrum.

385
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:02,187
I won't explain what all those are, but basically what happens is you have eight players from each team

386
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:07,149
and they bind together very closely and act as a single engine, a single unit,

387
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:11,590
and they slam their bodies into each other in the most violent way possible,

388
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,971
and the ball gets inserted into the middle and they kind of push back and forth for the ball.

389
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:24,147
It's really interesting that they picked that term for agile development for development

390
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:24,607
practices.

391
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:27,949
Oh, I thought we were describing agile game development.

392
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,210
Oh, that was the rugby part.

393
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,691
Really close.

394
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:35,953
And I think it's because ultimately you're taking eight people of very different body

395
00:24:36,013 --> 00:24:41,616
shapes and sizes and turning them into one cohesive unit that can generate power beyond

396
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:44,378
like really beyond a normal person can imagine.

397
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:47,656
And so that's kind of the idea of Scrum.

398
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,618
And I'll kind of just describe Agile development,

399
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:54,841
which Scrum is one of the many terms and types of that.

400
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:58,684
In Agile development, it's about being iterative

401
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,586
as opposed to waterfall development,

402
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,987
which is like, you know, we want to make a game,

403
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:05,809
we wrote a design doc, and then the artist did this thing,

404
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,012
and then they handed the design and the art to the programmers,

405
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:10,753
and the programmers made it, and the game came out.

406
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,655
It's more like we have a set of features.

407
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:18,457
and we design the basics of those features and the artists maybe do a little bit of their work

408
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,699
and while they're doing that we're prototyping it and we're iterating it in that tight loop of maybe

409
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:28,981
two to three weeks and in that you're kind of going in circles. I'm making circles with my

410
00:25:29,021 --> 00:25:31,582
hands here. You're going in circles. I can sense it.

411
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:38,593
You're going in circles where you're like, you know, create, test, re-evaluate, and then

412
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:41,074
you kind of go through that over and over again.

413
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:46,338
And what the value of it is, is that you can very quickly move through things and things

414
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,399
can be more flexible.

415
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,343
The negative of it that a lot of people have is if you don't monitor it closely, which

416
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:54,484
is where Scrum comes in.

417
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,380
Then it just comes to major feature and scope creep where people are like,

418
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,601
we're agile, we can do whatever we want.

419
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:03,922
And then they throw in a new feature in the middle of a sprint.

420
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:08,504
Scrum is a set of rules and practices that go around that,

421
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:12,505
which I won't get into all of them, that help you kind of prioritize and

422
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:16,266
figure things out in a proper way to make sure that you're not overscoping

423
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:18,107
within that process.

424
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:20,628
Give us the one, what's the best Scrum rule?

425
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:22,889
What's your favorite one?

426
00:26:24,336 --> 00:26:29,280
My favorite rule in practice is actually the daily stand up.

427
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,444
So I like having a time to get everybody together to talk about things.

428
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:39,188
That's probably the one that I adhere to the most.

429
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:42,411
Even though everybody does what we call butt scrum.

430
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:45,373
It's scrum butt, I do this, it's scrum butt, I do that.

431
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:49,537
But the one that tends to be done by everybody is that one right there where people are.

432
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:53,530
Getting together once a day and saying what they're working on, where it's at in the process,

433
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,234
and what they're going to work on that day.

434
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:58,120
Alyssa, do you have anything to say about Buzzkram?

435
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,654
Oh, well, no, actually, it's really interesting.

436
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:07,658
I knew nothing about rugby scrum or game development scrum prior to that explanation.

437
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:13,324
And hearing just that brief description of it has helped contextualize some of the things

438
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:16,407
I know about other studio structures and from talking to other game developers and stuff

439
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:16,787
like that.

440
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:20,150
So it's all kind of coming into focus with the understanding of scrum.

441
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:21,734
Yeah, you're welcome.

442
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:24,596
And it's fun to say, scrum.

443
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:25,997
Yeah.

444
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:32,542
Uh, so when you're working at Shonk Ventures and you're talking to clients

445
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:36,905
and they're saying, please deliver us from the mistakes that we made.

446
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:41,028
Um, what, what are the most common production mistakes that

447
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:42,069
you see with your clients?

448
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:43,530
Yeah, that's wow.

449
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,531
That's a great question.

450
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:46,472
Um, so the first.

451
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:53,542
The first common mistake that I see from people is this over-strict adherence to rules that

452
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:55,263
they've created in their own brain.

453
00:27:55,383 --> 00:28:01,206
And what I mean by that is we have to be by the letter with Scrum or Agile, and we have

454
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:03,427
to make sure that we're doing this.

455
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:06,349
And it tends to be at the detriment to the team.

456
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:10,431
And if we go back to what I said your core tenets of being a producer are, which is

457
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:15,994
about communicating and being kind of, you know, just this facilitator and

458
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,222
person who's focused on people, Scrum and Agile tend to cause a lot of problems when

459
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,704
they first come in and people get angry and frustrated.

460
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:30,987
And so what I say is, you know, I actually talk about it in the book, but we call beachheading

461
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:36,549
a new practice where you take a small group of people and you have them learn that practice

462
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:42,232
and then they can kind of change it based on your studio culture and then they are your

463
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:44,493
champions bringing it out to the rest of the team.

464
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:48,854
So that's one of the main things that I tend to see is that people are like,

465
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,597
we decided to become agile and they're like,

466
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:55,120
here's our super strict rule set and they bring it in and everything breaks.

467
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,303
And they're like, ah, and everybody's like heads on fire.

468
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,066
So I'm always like, don't worry, we're going to fix it.

469
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,887
We just got to kind of iterate through with the team.

470
00:29:02,987 --> 00:29:07,752
So the main thing that I usually like help my clients focus on is

471
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:11,155
making sure that the team understands why changes are being made.

472
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:16,835
Making sure that the team understand the goals of that and then understand what the

473
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,655
team actually wants out of these changes.

474
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:24,857
So it's a lot of outsider kind of perspective and bias where I'll talk to the teams and

475
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:30,138
I'll talk to the producers and the leaders and they may kind of be saying the same thing

476
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:34,039
to each other but not really hearing it and then I present it and now everybody thinks

477
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:34,739
that I'm a genius.

478
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:34,919
So.

479
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:42,721
I tend to apologize a lot to especially the producers because a lot of times what I've

480
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:46,122
found is that the producers know the right thing to do.

481
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:48,864
They're just stuck on one or two things.

482
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:53,447
And also there's that relationship baggage that might be in there.

483
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,271
Even if they have a lot of trust from their team, there's still a,

484
00:29:57,691 --> 00:29:59,912
ugh, he's been doing X for this long,

485
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:03,394
or she's been saying it this way for so long now,

486
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:04,535
they want to change it.

487
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:06,976
Whereas I can come in and say,

488
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:09,778
well, this is actually what we need to be doing.

489
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:12,939
And a lot of times it's exactly what they were saying,

490
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:14,420
but people are like, oh, yeah, yeah,

491
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,481
that makes a lot of sense.

492
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:16,441
You worked on Fortnite.

493
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:18,782
And I'm like, whatever, yeah, thanks.

494
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:19,863
Yeah.

495
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:21,164
Just call me the rugby shirt guy.

496
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:21,624
Yeah.

497
00:30:22,894 --> 00:30:26,577
And that's probably something that also benefits from what you were saying earlier, where you

498
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:30,880
have some multidiscipline experience, and I imagine some of that language gets lost

499
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,103
when they don't have the verbiage to describe what they want in the terms for the developers

500
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:36,143
they're speaking to as well.

501
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:36,684
Yeah.

502
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:48,016
Definitely, definitely. And it's one of those things where, you know, I always say that, you know, the best team is a team that is a little, everybody's a little bit well-rounded and a little bit of everything.

503
00:30:48,096 --> 00:31:00,728
Obviously, people are experts at things, but I want everybody on my team to be a game designer and a producer as well as whatever else they are, because I don't think a game designer should be holding the hand and,

504
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:05,664
telling a programmer every single thing that needs to be done in the design.

505
00:31:05,684 --> 00:31:07,645
There should be some creativity in there.

506
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:13,128
And a designer shouldn't be, you know, not caring about the schedule.

507
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:18,431
So one of the things that I tend to do with all of my teams that I work with is

508
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:22,533
try and figure out ways to level up all of the individuals on the team.

509
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:24,274
So it'd be that spending a little bit of time.

510
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,289
every week or every month with the creative director or lead designer kind of explaining

511
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:35,857
what the game is in more detail or having the producers kind of teach tools in a more

512
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:40,703
intuitive way so things aren't super, you know, their JIRA isn't super complicated but

513
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:44,467
it's very simple for people to understand so that they want to be in there.

514
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:49,768
moving things along and making it more interactive and fun for them as opposed to having to walk

515
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:52,010
around every day and be like, did you update your Jira?

516
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,512
Did you update Hansoft?

517
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:54,813
Which I've been that guy.

518
00:31:55,073 --> 00:31:56,835
That's not a fun experience for anybody.

519
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,638
So that's a big part of what I've been doing.

520
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:07,358
So you swoop in and obviously you don't stay, you know, you're a temporary person.

521
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,445
How do you leave the lessons with people and how do you kind of give the producers that

522
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:20,131
you work with and the teams you work with the tools where they will have less disagreements

523
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,253
and they'll be more efficient?

524
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,035
Like, how do you just hand that off?

525
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:32,658
Yeah, so part of it is there is like a monthly or every other week follow up with the key people that I've worked with.

526
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:40,801
So be that someone in leadership or producer, kind of a coaching relationship where we're just having these constant conversations.

527
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:49,524
Jokingly, a big part of why Clinton and I wrote the book was that we wanted an easier way to

528
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:55,640
leave a client. And an easy way to leave a client is, like,

529
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,983
yeah, in a way, right? In a way, like, you know, if you,

530
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:04,288
one, if you can't afford one or either of us, you know, you can just buy the book, which is much cheaper.

531
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:07,772
Or two, you know, we kind of leave and we're like, hey, just a reminder,

532
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,715
here are the six or seven practices that we put in place.

533
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,518
Let's make sure we're on the guidelines of this.

534
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:20,249
But, you know, just like any leaving of a job, I write up documentation.

535
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:24,972
You know, I do like, I wouldn't call it an exit interview, but I do kind of a like, hey,

536
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:25,552
I'm leaving.

537
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:29,054
Here are the things that we accomplished here, the things that still need to be done.

538
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:32,356
Here's how you should do those once I'm gone.

539
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:36,679
You know, you want to leave them wanting a little bit more.

540
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,200
That's how you get repeat clients.

541
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,602
But you want to fix as many, if not all, their problems in one go.

542
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:42,787
Yeah.

543
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,491
You also run, um, game dev drink up.

544
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:47,672
Yeah.

545
00:33:48,172 --> 00:33:51,836
Uh, yeah, I, I, I'm a multifaceted person.

546
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:57,942
Uh, so, so John, Jonathan Hawkins, um, in LA who runs his own studio, he

547
00:33:57,982 --> 00:33:59,623
started the game dev drink up.

548
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:00,664
Oh man.

549
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:04,008
I think it was nine years ago, almost nine years ago.

550
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:07,275
He asked me to...

551
00:34:08,276 --> 00:34:14,122
I kind of took over the Dallas chapter after it had one meeting, and then the guy who was running it left.

552
00:34:14,523 --> 00:34:23,753
So he asked me to run it, and then over time I've just kind of taken on a lot of the responsibilities of setting up the events, helping new chapters start, and things like that.

553
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:26,645
Which is odd because I don't drink.

554
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:28,706
And a lot of people say to me, like,

555
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:30,448
I don't want to go to the Game Dev Drink if I don't drink.

556
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,549
And I was like, I run it and I don't drink.

557
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,050
It's not a requirement,

558
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,251
it's just the name.

559
00:34:37,212 --> 00:34:38,212
And very excitedly,

560
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,774
the first chapter, which is in LA,

561
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:43,336
is having its 100th

562
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:44,536
event in August.

563
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:46,918
So we have been doing it for a long time.

564
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:48,859
I forget how many events we've done,

565
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:49,679
but it's close to 600.

566
00:34:51,692 --> 00:34:55,193
And we've had over 15,000 people attend,

567
00:34:55,253 --> 00:34:57,454
and we're in four countries right now.

568
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:58,215
So, very cool.

569
00:34:58,255 --> 00:34:58,815
That's nuts.

570
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:00,836
So, yeah, I mean, and that's like what you're all about.

571
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:02,317
You know, it's a fun thing,

572
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:04,758
but you're like a community building guy, right?

573
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:06,419
Yeah, that's, you know,

574
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,840
if we get into my grand philosophy

575
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,000
of what's wrong with the world,

576
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,102
it's that we don't live in community anymore, you know?

577
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:14,842
If you're in your town, I mean,

578
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,604
I don't know the person who lives across from me

579
00:35:17,704 --> 00:35:19,625
or beneath me in my apartment complex.

580
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:23,582
You know, I don't know anybody in my kind of area.

581
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,363
We leave the towns we're born in.

582
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:29,867
We don't necessarily go to a religious ceremony or event anywhere.

583
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:31,668
So we don't have a lot of community.

584
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:34,510
So one of the things that I've tried to do my whole career,

585
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,874
starting with my involvement in the IGDA in the early 2000s,

586
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:41,556
was help build communities in any way.

587
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:45,219
And so what the Game Dev Drink-Up does differently than the IGDA,

588
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:48,001
which we encourage all of our members to go to IGDA meetings,

589
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:54,410
is we're not education and we're not about your career, we're literally just about your community and about helping you network.

590
00:35:54,810 --> 00:36:02,795
And what we found, and this is just anecdotal, I haven't done a full study on this, but what we found is that if a city has a gamedev drink up,

591
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:10,339
it is much more likely that developers will stay in that city if they're laid off or there's a closure than if there isn't,

592
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:15,241
because they have a network of people around them that are not just their office.

593
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:22,733
So that's kind of been our goal all along is provide community so that people don't need to uproot their lives every time

594
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:26,576
You know, there's a studio closure or or they get laid off

595
00:36:27,176 --> 00:36:32,540
Yeah for people who are like adjacent to cities that host a game dev drink up or another kind of game dev gathering event

596
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,063
What do you have for advice for them to get the most out of those meetup opportunities?

597
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:38,584
Yeah

598
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:44,448
So first off if your city doesn't have a game dev drink up you can just reach out to the game dev drink up on

599
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:45,268
Facebook or Twitter

600
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,242
And we'll talk to you about setting one up.

601
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:53,367
If you have any other event in your area or you have a game to have a drink of,

602
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:57,491
what I always tell people is just show up and just be friendly.

603
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,333
Don't show up with a resume in your hand.

604
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:02,556
Don't show up trying to impress people.

605
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,838
Just show up and ask people about themselves.

606
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:10,385
I am a little weird, and this is a weird thing to recommend to people when I realize how weird

607
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:10,725
this is.

608
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:15,267
I have done targeted networking, especially when I was younger and looking to learn about

609
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:22,430
the industry, where I would know that certain people would go to certain events at GDC or

610
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,492
the IGDA meetings, and I would go specifically to try and meet that person.

611
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:30,833
I think as long as you're not doing that in a creepy way, like, yeah, I came here to meet

612
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:30,934
you.

613
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:33,395
The way you described it doesn't sound creepy at all, Grant.

614
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:34,315
Not at all.

615
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:38,088
Hey, you're the two who stalked me online, okay?

616
00:37:38,248 --> 00:37:39,409
This is true.

617
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:42,151
But, you know, coming to an event and saying like,

618
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:45,913
hey, you know, I love your games and I wanted to ask you this piece of advice.

619
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:50,797
You know, I've had people do that with me and it's less creepy than,

620
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:52,818
for some reason I get really creeped out when somebody's like,

621
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:54,900
I follow you on Twitter.

622
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,382
And I'm like, whoa, why? Why would you do that?

623
00:37:57,502 --> 00:38:00,764
Yeah, I know that feeling.

624
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:06,382
So be very, very purposeful in what you go to the events for, which is to meet people.

625
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:10,366
And what I always tell people is networking is just a fancy word for making friends.

626
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:14,150
So just go up to people and ask them, hey, what game are you playing lately?

627
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,831
Or, you know, what are some of your hobbies?

628
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:18,113
Just have conversations with people.

629
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:22,336
I feel like it's really easy to look at these networking events, and especially if you're

630
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:22,856
younger.

631
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:26,419
I went to a school with a game development major, so there were a bunch of people being

632
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,780
like, oh, you have to go to these conventions, you have to go to these parties, and you have

633
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,541
to meet these people.

634
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:32,383
And it was this very high stress to-do, to-do, to-do, to-do.

635
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:37,166
And it seems like kind of not doing that is what you're recommending in a way?

636
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:38,907
Don't stress about it.

637
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:40,649
Yeah, don't stress about it.

638
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,391
Don't think of it as a job interview.

639
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:46,673
Just think about it as a place to meet friends.

640
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:49,255
Obviously, you want to maintain a level of professionalism.

641
00:38:49,315 --> 00:38:52,377
If you're going to a networking event, I don't recommend you getting drunk.

642
00:38:53,218 --> 00:38:53,438
Right?

643
00:38:53,558 --> 00:38:56,760
But you can go and have a couple drinks, have a good time.

644
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,942
I know, Chris, we have to talk later.

645
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:04,926
You can have some drinks, you know, have a good time and get to know people.

646
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:15,085
I jokingly say that the real reason I started Game Dev Drink Up chapters everywhere that I've moved is that I'm an inherently lonely person and I just want to make friends.

647
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:22,906
So I started a Drink Up chapter and then people come and hang out with me once a month. And I'm like, look at all my friends!

648
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:32,168
You know what? I meant to bring it up earlier, but I think the first time that you and I met, and I think it might have been the narrative...

649
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:37,872
So, we're going to be talking about the GDC Summit meetup when GDC Online was happening in Austin still.

650
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:43,496
Grant and I were at this place called the Ginger Man down here. I ended up moving here.

651
00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:52,743
I think that there's a Facebook picture of us somewhere. I think that you might actually be carrying me.

652
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,605
So Grant, like the first time I met Grant, he like literally swept me off my feet.

653
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,308
So that's just the kind of guy he is.

654
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:07,172
So there's the header image for this podcast when you get published somewhere.

655
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:08,153
Yeah, we'll find it.

656
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:08,753
Dig that one up.

657
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:10,395
Yeah.

658
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:12,437
Well, we're gonna wrap up here.

659
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:18,803
I do want to talk about, I want to talk about Crunch because, hey, we want to end on a

660
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,664
really happy note.

661
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:26,590
Yeah, but I'd like to talk about that just a little bit because you're a producer and

662
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:33,954
do you think that, do you find that one of your duties, one of your jobs is to totally

663
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:35,774
help teams eliminate that?

664
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:42,998
I think it's about helping teams understand why it exists more than it is to eliminate

665
00:40:43,018 --> 00:40:43,058
it.

666
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:46,619
I mean, I think that that is often a goal, which is let's eliminate crunch.

667
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:54,199
What I can help is not just straight eliminate crunch, but help you understand why crunch has existed.

668
00:40:54,439 --> 00:41:01,381
And Keith Fuller, who also is a consultant and has worked in the industry for a long time,

669
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:06,362
describes crunch in two different ways, which I like to understand as well, which is

670
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:11,843
there's crunch and then there's overwork. And crunch can be voluntary, right?

671
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:14,604
Like, you really want to make this game great, and so you want to work.

672
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,664
a few extra hours and put that in.

673
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:21,346
And I'm usually fine with that as long as it's limited to two weeks.

674
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:23,086
I don't want somebody being like,

675
00:41:23,206 --> 00:41:27,868
I want to make this game great, and six months later I realize that they've been not seeing their family

676
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:30,549
a single day during the week for six months.

677
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,091
And then there's overwork, which is when a studio stands up and says,

678
00:41:35,491 --> 00:41:40,353
Hey, we have to all be here for 12 hours a day, six days a week.

679
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:41,953
And that is...

680
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:46,489
almost easier to fix than the second one.

681
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,749
Because the second one is just people being passionate

682
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:50,850
and helping them understand what their limits are,

683
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,870
which is a lot of kind of talking with people

684
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,431
and understanding them, and especially if they're younger,

685
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:57,751
helping them understand their limits.

686
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:01,512
But overwork is, you know, the first thing to say is like,

687
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:02,592
hey, we're not gonna do this,

688
00:42:02,832 --> 00:42:05,153
and then figuring out why you've been doing it.

689
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:09,253
And usually it's not about deadlines,

690
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,334
it's about misscoping,

691
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:18,574
You know, figuring out where you can't, like, you know, you get to a point where you're like, I can't cut anything.

692
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:21,595
Okay, but can we limit things just a little bit?

693
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:23,616
Can we focus on things differently?

694
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:32,141
And understanding that as producers, it's our responsibility to make sure our team doesn't have to crunch or overwork ever.

695
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:36,343
So if we get to a point where we are doing that, then ultimately we fail.

696
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:41,775
And I know that that can sound a little bit harsh to people who have been in that position, and myself included,

697
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:46,478
where ultimately it was the decision of people above us to do that with the team,

698
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:50,621
and we could have delivered the game on time if they had let us cut certain features.

699
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:56,885
But we have to kind of stand up and be like, no, this is the human cost of what we're doing,

700
00:42:57,065 --> 00:43:00,167
and here's possible solutions and ways to work.

701
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:03,993
It's not as easy as staffing up.

702
00:43:04,053 --> 00:43:06,254
It's about making hard cuts, hard decisions,

703
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:10,296
and understanding your team and what they can actually do.

704
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:14,098
So from your perspective as a consultant

705
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:18,160
and somebody who's worked at these major studios

706
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,861
and smaller studios in 2019,

707
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:24,803
has Crunch gotten better?

708
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:28,785
In my personal life, it's gotten better,

709
00:43:28,845 --> 00:43:30,225
but that's because I'm a consultant.

710
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,723
I think that the stories that I'm hearing about Crunch are a little bit different and

711
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:42,585
I feel like they are less ubiquitous.

712
00:43:43,065 --> 00:43:50,108
When I was going through my first major Crunch in 2008, 2009, it was everybody.

713
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:51,148
Everybody was doing it.

714
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:54,030
We were all trying to hit Christmas deadlines or whatever it might be.

715
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:57,313
I remember talking to all my friends and being like,

716
00:43:57,413 --> 00:44:00,094
oh, I was at my work until 2 a.m.

717
00:44:00,134 --> 00:44:01,555
and they were like, oh, I was there until 3.

718
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,776
And now I feel like people are getting older

719
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:07,417
and having families and responsibilities,

720
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:09,438
so they're willing to kind of push back and be like,

721
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:11,219
hey, you know, I'll work a 12-hour day,

722
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:12,359
but I'm not working Saturdays.

723
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,251
and figuring out ways to have work-life balance.

724
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:20,574
So I think that it's not as common in the industry,

725
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:21,855
but it is still common.

726
00:44:22,555 --> 00:44:25,477
And it's something that we have to keep kind of fighting against

727
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:28,779
and figuring out what are the proper solutions

728
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:29,639
and ways to do this.

729
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:31,320
I think the big difference between.

730
00:44:32,364 --> 00:44:40,706
2008 and now is there are a lot of studios standing up and saying we don't crunch or we are now focusing on fixing this problem.

731
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:47,168
Whereas in 2008 it was kind of like yeah crunch is bad and then everybody's like it's not really bad we're going to do it anyways.

732
00:44:47,508 --> 00:44:53,370
Whereas now it's people are coming out and publicly saying these are the steps that we're taking to change.

733
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:59,731
And I really like a lot of the pressure that has kind of been put on gamers to understand what...

734
00:45:01,602 --> 00:45:05,007
What happens in this and now they're kind of pushing back on their studios and being

735
00:45:05,188 --> 00:45:09,335
that of the games that they love and saying, hey, don't sacrifice your people to make sure

736
00:45:09,355 --> 00:45:10,917
we have new content every two weeks.

737
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:14,182
Like that's not that's not worth it to us.

738
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:23,406
So I think it's about educating everybody from the game players themselves to people who are making games and their families

739
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:26,908
to understand the proper way to have work-life balance.

740
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:35,832
And ultimately, once you can get to that work-life balance, the team is going to be richer and more passionate and understanding about the project

741
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:39,113
than they would be if they were working 75-80 hours a week.

742
00:45:40,554 --> 00:45:43,815
That is a great summation.

743
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:53,506
of what we should do. I love it. I also think it's a great place to bring an end to this segment.

744
00:45:53,706 --> 00:46:00,271
But Grant, where can people find you online? I mean, Alyssa and I already know everywhere to

745
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:05,754
find you online. If people want to get in contact with you about your consultancy, where can they

746
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:11,859
find you? Yeah, so the easiest way is just to Google Shock Ventures, which is just S-H-O-N-K

747
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:14,761
and then Ventures, like Ed Ventures, but you take off ads.

748
00:46:16,675 --> 00:46:22,818
If you Google that or gshonk, G-S-H-O-N-K, you will find all of my social media websites,

749
00:46:23,098 --> 00:46:25,439
emails, and easiest ways to contact me.

750
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:26,880
Sounds great.

751
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,440
Well, thank you so much for joining us.

752
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,581
Thanks for having me.

753
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:30,261
Thank you.

754
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:30,761
Thanks.

755
00:46:55,377 --> 00:47:01,122
Wow, that Grant, huh? We're still trying to get our editing down on this podcast, by the way.

756
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:04,124
You can tell by all our casual banter that we've had throughout the conversation.

757
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:05,265
Yeah, wow, that Grant, huh?

758
00:47:05,746 --> 00:47:08,207
What an insightful conversation here at the GDC podcast.

759
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:12,331
Oh my gosh. Yeah, actually, we're recording this before we even talked to Grant.

760
00:47:13,632 --> 00:47:19,156
No, actually, no, it's after. Alyssa, what are your takeaways there? What's going on in your

761
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:19,697
brain after this?

762
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:24,143
He mentioned hiking like way at the beginning and I've had this just camping itch for just

763
00:47:24,203 --> 00:47:28,128
like just going camping and then contextualizing that with like oh it's this whole creative

764
00:47:28,168 --> 00:47:31,874
refresh and kind of figuring out your like de-stressing and figuring out your place in

765
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:35,379
the world and like throughout the entire conversation there were so many great things mentioned

766
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:36,821
but I just really want to go hiking.

767
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:44,020
Yeah, like hardcore hiking, like Appalachian Trail hiking, or go to the park.

768
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:49,226
I've got family in South Dakota, so I'm just going to flash the Black Hills and go up to

769
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:49,846
Harney Peak.

770
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:50,687
Yeah, it's great.

771
00:47:50,707 --> 00:47:52,049
Oh my gosh, Harney Peak?

772
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:53,010
Harney Peak.

773
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:54,907
Tell me about Harney Peak.

774
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:57,148
It's a high mountain with a view.

775
00:47:57,168 --> 00:47:57,949
Yeah?

776
00:47:58,289 --> 00:47:58,649
Okay.

777
00:47:58,789 --> 00:47:59,670
Oh, you have to do it?

778
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,851
Yeah, no, I think it's this old fort is built.

779
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:05,133
It used to be like a fire watching fort, but now it's just some old cool castle that you

780
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,855
have to walk for three hours up a hill to get.

781
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:09,096
And it's really refreshing.

782
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:11,598
So I can relate to that point of the conversation.

783
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:16,641
So after talking to Grant, basically you're going to take a six month sabbatical from

784
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:18,402
Gamasutra, do some editing.

785
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:22,665
I'm just going to go straight AWOL in Slack and I'll be on a mountain somewhere.

786
00:48:23,297 --> 00:48:24,478
I guess we'll have to discuss that later.

787
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,503
Yeah, but it's so good to catch up with somebody like that guy.

788
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:36,270
That guy, he seems very in touch with how people operate.

789
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:41,632
Yeah, it's interesting to get the perspective of someone who has been in game development,

790
00:48:41,812 --> 00:48:46,695
isn't in the thick of it now, but is still in the industry in a way, doing especially

791
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,876
the consulting stuff, you have a unique perspective on that.

792
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:53,358
So to kind of capture that and dig into it a little bit was a super interesting conversation.

793
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:55,704
Yeah, and that's got to be difficult too.

794
00:48:56,224 --> 00:49:02,266
Just going into, I don't know, basically someone calls 911, you're like…

795
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:03,886
Everything's on fire and you're like, oh my god.

796
00:49:03,926 --> 00:49:06,187
Yeah, the person is like, we need somebody to fix all this.

797
00:49:06,207 --> 00:49:10,749
It's lightly heroic in a way, like, Kate billowing in the wind as you swoop in to fix

798
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:11,609
all of their production problems.

799
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:15,591
Yeah, his rugby shirt just billowing in the wind.

800
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:22,785
Yeah. Well, I know, I want to just point out that usually when you talk about crunch, it gets like,

801
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:28,308
this somber mood kind of sweeps over whenever crunch comes up, but that was a really good

802
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:33,111
summary of issues that lead to it and productively how developers can kind of work through it and

803
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:36,673
work past it and understand it. And I think that was just a really good context to have too.

804
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:43,175
Yeah, it is. Because it is something easy, like you get rightfully fired up about it,

805
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:50,677
and then talking to someone who has to solve those issues on a practical level, and then just,

806
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:54,818
I don't know, like... He's been there in all the different situations,

807
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:58,099
different studios, their own projects, projects they've consulted on, so it's,

808
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,720
yeah, really useful information. I'm glad to be a part of that.

809
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,881
Yeah, me too, Alyssa.

810
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:11,034
So, okay, well, this is where we tell you to subscribe,

811
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:13,696
smash the subscribe button, or is that more of a...

812
00:50:13,796 --> 00:50:14,676
Is it lightly tap?

813
00:50:15,217 --> 00:50:15,957
Do people click anymore?

814
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:17,178
You can tap it, mash it.

815
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:19,019
You can mash the subscribe button

816
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,841
if you're on a touchscreen device on your phone.

817
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:25,423
And we promise to bring more fascinating guests.

818
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:29,525
Right now we're trying once a month.

819
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:32,127
We don't wanna burn ourselves out here.

820
00:50:32,147 --> 00:50:35,049
And I'm kinda lazy.

821
00:50:36,728 --> 00:50:39,732
Yeah, but we may ramp up from that depending on how things are going.

822
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:42,875
So thanks everybody for listening.

823
00:50:42,895 --> 00:50:45,118
Again, I'm Chris Graft.

824
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:46,540
I'm Alyssa McAloo.

825
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,264
And mash that subscribe button with your thumb.

826
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,166
And if you love us, rate and review.

827
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:53,468
See you next time.

828
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:54,149
Thanks everyone.

829
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:54,790
Bye.
