1
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:08,512
This talk is mostly all about a game that I've worked on,

2
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:09,292
which is Dead Cells.

3
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:10,454
It's really gameplay-oriented.

4
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:13,616
So we'll talk about that and some kind of post-mortem

5
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:15,538
of this game, but really gameplay-oriented.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,501
So first thing first, let me introduce myself.

7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:23,070
So my name is Sebastien Bernard, known as DeepKnight on Twitter

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,591
and everything.

9
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:24,932
I'm a game developer.

10
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,154
I'm a game designer also.

11
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,317
And oh, as you probably noticed, I'm French.

12
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:32,661
So I really hope that won't be too much of an issue.

13
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:36,285
So I will take extra care just to make me understandable.

14
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,389
But sometimes you may miss a few things.

15
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:45,941
Also, I've been making games for like ages, literally ages.

16
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,323
And yeah, young me is proud of me.

17
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,786
And I really love making games.

18
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:54,410
I mean, I've been doing that for years and would like to do that for years again.

19
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:56,727
So that's really important to me.

20
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:59,089
And another thing which is important,

21
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,170
so you can understand a little bit more of this talk,

22
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:03,992
I really like to take care of lots of details,

23
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:07,775
such as game feel, controls, balancing, everything

24
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:09,336
which is invisible to the player,

25
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:11,137
but that actually matters in the game.

26
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,719
So it will explain a few things after.

27
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,480
Also, I do lots of game jam.

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,322
as soon as possible because I have a kid now,

29
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,523
so it's a little bit more difficult.

30
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:22,445
But if you have never done a game jam,

31
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:23,486
you should definitely do one.

32
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:25,408
Because it's really, even for someone

33
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:27,029
who is seasoned in the game making,

34
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:29,991
it's really a huge, very important experience.

35
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:32,613
So you learn tons of things about that.

36
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,356
So if you do game jams, yeah, you're cool.

37
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:37,377
If you don't, you're not.

38
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,949
So I do work in a company which is called Motion Twin.

39
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,870
We've been talking about that in a previous talk, which

40
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,730
was all about co-op.

41
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,950
So I will just be quick.

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,051
We've been making games since 2001.

43
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,952
It was mostly web games, especially web free-to-play

44
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:57,133
games.

45
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,193
By this time, we were making free-to-play games

46
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,594
was actually cool or not too hard,

47
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:04,234
because it was before the KPI thing

48
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:07,275
and the free-to-play aggressive techniques and everything.

49
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,215
It was like the cool free-to-play part.

50
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:11,499
We also tried to make a few mobile games.

51
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,641
It wasn't that good.

52
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:15,786
And we actually almost died in the process of doing that.

53
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:19,912
So we didn't have such a great time on mobile free-to-play.

54
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:24,019
We should probably have done premium mobile games.

55
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:30,511
Most people describe us, because it used to be a joke really, like we put that on a website,

56
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:36,495
it was a Monty Python quote, but most people describe us as being, you know, an anarcho-syndicalist

57
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:36,815
co-op.

58
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:38,757
We actually are a co-op.

59
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:42,660
So it means we, in this company, we are based on three qualities.

60
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:46,278
The first one is we do work the same amount of time.

61
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,361
So it's eight hours a day, five days a week,

62
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:49,943
and in the same office.

63
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:53,008
But that's also because we're a small team that we do that.

64
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:55,231
It's really important for us to communicate on an everyday

65
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:55,552
basis.

66
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:58,934
We also have the exact same decision power.

67
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:01,876
It's pretty important, because in any kind of decision,

68
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:04,437
such as a strategic decision, hiring someone,

69
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,499
or deciding if this weapon should be like OP

70
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,481
on the next update, or whatever like that,

71
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,162
everyone can actually take part in the debate.

72
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:13,623
And if you want to express something,

73
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:16,505
if you have any kind of idea, anyone can actually vote,

74
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:21,087
or just talk to anyone to give ideas and to share ideas.

75
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:24,189
There is always someone in charge at one point,

76
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:26,370
so to make sure that we don't lose time talking,

77
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,291
because we like talking, but we don't

78
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,672
want that to last forever.

79
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,192
I prefer making games.

80
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:34,434
Also, the last but really not least,

81
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,115
we are all paid the same way.

82
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:39,216
So for example, I've been in this company for 18 years.

83
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:40,457
It's almost since the beginning.

84
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:43,198
And I'm paid the exact same way as someone

85
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:44,899
who, say, arrived two years ago.

86
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:46,719
So it's really important.

87
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:49,180
It seems like, OK, it's a super hardcore leftist thing.

88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,540
It is in some way.

89
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,321
But it actually makes hiring people very, very efficient.

90
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,762
Because when you get a newcomer in this company,

91
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,502
he actually gets paid and has the same decision

92
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:04,063
power as someone else after a test period, of course.

93
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:08,484
It actually makes people feeling empowered really quickly.

94
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:11,785
And they are involved much, much more quickly.

95
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:14,208
than in any kind of class.

96
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:16,791
So it makes everything, actually, on a day-to-day basis

97
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:17,893
much easier to do.

98
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:21,197
Let's talk about dead cells now quickly.

99
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:24,101
Actually, did someone play dead cells in this room?

100
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:27,091
Yeah.

101
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:27,991
OK.

102
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:29,092
I was stressed.

103
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,092
Now I am terrified.

104
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,112
So it's OK.

105
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,893
So that's basically what we call a rogue Vanya.

106
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:38,794
It's marketing bullshit, but it actually explains things well.

107
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:41,275
It's basically Castlevania that you can play again and again.

108
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,055
So every time you die and get back at the beginning,

109
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:45,976
you have a fresh experience in some way.

110
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:48,256
The levels are different, but not totally different.

111
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:50,157
So it's really that, Castlevania, that you

112
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:51,017
can play again and again.

113
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,310
Oh, you have to know, it was a last chance project.

114
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,331
As I said, we almost died making mobile games.

115
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:00,192
And by this time, because of the decline of the web,

116
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,393
the company was not in such great shape.

117
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:05,014
So we had, of course, cash issues and everything.

118
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,295
And at one point, we decided, OK,

119
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:09,576
do we want to make mobile games forever?

120
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:11,577
Do we want to do something else?

121
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:13,219
And at one point, we actually decided,

122
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:15,501
maybe we should just make a PC title.

123
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,983
Maybe that's the last one, so let's make something big.

124
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,665
And this was actually a good idea,

125
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:23,247
because luckily, we have survived this.

126
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:26,070
But it was really, if this project did fail,

127
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,053
I think I would just be today making a sad post-mortem

128
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,755
of how it was cool before.

129
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,897
So no, it's not that today.

130
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,779
We spent about two years and a half making this game.

131
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,360
We spent about one year and a half on the early access thing.

132
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,142
We announced it one year, but we spent a little bit more

133
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:46,703
because we had tons of interesting feedback.

134
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:49,124
And we also made the console port,

135
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,605
which was something planned at the beginning.

136
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,286
So it took about six months to make all the free consoles.

137
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,848
And so it was a little bit longer than expected,

138
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,648
but still not too far from what we

139
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:01,970
announced to players at the beginning, one year and a half.

140
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,652
The game itself sold more than 1 million units, which

141
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,553
is unexpected and cool.

142
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:09,733
So we are really happy about that, of course.

143
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:15,234
And about 60% as of today is on PC, which is quite normal

144
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:17,975
because the PC version, the early access,

145
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,055
went live one year before.

146
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:23,336
But the thing is, the console is really a big part of it,

147
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,397
and especially the Switch.

148
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:27,537
So the Switch is a thing today.

149
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:30,718
So you already know that, so I won't elaborate on this.

150
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:32,875
So the game itself.

151
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,778
The game is based on three pillars.

152
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:38,880
The first one is obviously combat.

153
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,643
This game is all about killing stuff and not

154
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:44,325
trying to get killed, or trying not to get killed, of course.

155
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:47,508
And so really all about that, positioning in space,

156
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:50,590
avoiding attacks, reading patterns, and killing enemies.

157
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,372
It's also about progression.

158
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,234
We wanted to have a strong sense of progression.

159
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:57,056
That's a free-to-play legacy, something

160
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,097
that we wanted to carry on.

161
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:01,759
And also it's all about replayability, also something

162
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,040
that came for us from the free-to-play,

163
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,281
the way free-to-play before.

164
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:09,363
We have always been making games that you can

165
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,004
play for hundreds of hours.

166
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:12,284
So we wanted to have something like that.

167
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:14,786
But all these three aspects are nothing

168
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,827
compared to one very important thing, which is,

169
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,548
oh, the parameters.

170
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:22,975
You know, permadeath is like the old thing

171
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:25,336
that everyone wants in the game, but no one wants in the game.

172
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:29,477
And when we decided to make a permadeath-oriented game,

173
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:32,578
it actually made lots of things.

174
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,719
It changed lots of things in the game.

175
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:37,000
So yeah.

176
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:41,284
Making a permadeath game is all about embracing this idea.

177
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:43,005
OK, you're going to kill the player.

178
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:43,766
You will be sad.

179
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:45,608
You will have to start naked at the beginning.

180
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,950
So you have to make sure that it's actually a good experience,

181
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,932
which on the paper doesn't seem like one.

182
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:51,814
But anyway, we'll try to do that.

183
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:56,759
So internally, permadeath was obviously a very hot topic.

184
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,781
Actually, at one point, we were not

185
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:00,783
sure if we wanted to make a permadeath game.

186
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:03,964
So it could have been more classic Castlevania type

187
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:04,324
of game.

188
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:06,184
But because we were a small company,

189
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:10,626
it was not possible for us to make like a 15 hours long title

190
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,606
with tons of unique content.

191
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,967
That was not something because we were just eight people.

192
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:17,588
And at the beginning, we just had one graphic artist

193
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:22,969
to make everything at 1.02, which was, wow, more.

194
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,390
So it was definitely not possible to make a single,

195
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,290
not permadeath game for us.

196
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:31,928
So at one point, someone had this idea of maybe we

197
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:35,750
should make the death as part of the progression in this game.

198
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,352
Maybe we should consider that dying should be like,

199
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,533
oh, yeah, I died, so I can do something new.

200
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:42,915
And this actually defined lots of stuff.

201
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:46,397
This was a really great idea, great internal idea

202
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:46,777
that we had.

203
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:50,179
Not to brag here, but yes, it changed really everything.

204
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:53,220
First thing that was changed was we

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,461
don't have any kind of backtracking between levels.

206
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:58,101
So it means, for example, if you start the first level, which

207
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:00,482
is a prison, if you exit this level

208
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:02,223
and go to the promenade, which is the second one,

209
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,903
you cannot go back to the prison.

210
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,464
And if you want to play against the prison,

211
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:07,964
you actually have to die to get back at the beginning again.

212
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,105
So you cannot get back between levels.

213
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,006
You can do whatever you want in a single level,

214
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:13,286
but no backtracking.

215
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,629
Another aspect is making sure that each run counts

216
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:19,430
in some way.

217
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,292
The way we did that is using the so-called dead cells

218
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:23,912
in this game.

219
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:26,393
When you kill someone, you probably

220
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,335
will get dead cells, the blue dead cells.

221
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,936
These dead cells can be used in a shop

222
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,717
that you will see from time to time, which

223
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:34,578
is called the collector.

224
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:38,660
And this shop allows you to invest your cells

225
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,462
and to actually make progress on something,

226
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,923
such as unlocking a new weapon, a new skill, or whatever.

227
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,740
It's really about investing sales.

228
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,821
The thing is, if you die, you lose your sales.

229
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:52,142
But if you die, you keep this progress.

230
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:57,225
So it's really your goal is basically to get that sales, invest them so they are stuck

231
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:57,865
in this bar.

232
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,386
So you actually make progress every time you play.

233
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:04,145
And at one point, maybe after two or three runs,

234
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,566
you may unlock a weapon or unlock a skill

235
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:07,887
that you have chosen to invest on.

236
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:09,768
So it's really all about that, making sure

237
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:12,650
that your death on this run wasn't useless.

238
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,551
At least you make some progress on something,

239
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:16,072
and maybe you have unlocked something.

240
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:21,275
And also we do have, you know, it's still castle vanish thing.

241
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,577
So we do have metroid vanish things in this game.

242
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,338
So for example.

243
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,589
This is a basic world map of the game at the beginning.

244
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:30,831
So you just start on the left in the prison, the first level,

245
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,994
and then you move to the promenade.

246
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,517
And after that, you go to the ramparts, and you have a boss,

247
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:38,378
and so on, and you continue through the game.

248
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,581
But at one point, in the second level, in the promenade,

249
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:44,123
you will get a new skill, which is permanent.

250
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:47,265
And this skill allows you to grow vines out of the ground

251
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:51,007
and to build ladders at specific points that

252
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,309
were before that unreachable.

253
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,230
It's like an extra ladder that you

254
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,631
can build in specific places.

255
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,593
So it allows you to reach places that were locked before that.

256
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:04,616
But the thing is, we do use that in this level, the Promenade.

257
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:06,817
But if you actually want to have new content,

258
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:09,372
you actually have to get back to the prison.

259
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,593
Because in the prison, if you have this skill,

260
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:14,595
you will unlock a new access to a level, which

261
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,435
is called the sewers.

262
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:18,437
And it allows you to actually have a new path.

263
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,438
After the prison, you can now go through the sewers.

264
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,199
And this is the idea.

265
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,401
It's unlocking skills and making sure that you can use them,

266
00:11:26,441 --> 00:11:28,322
but when you die, when you get back at the beginning.

267
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:29,783
And the same goes in the sewers.

268
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,644
You have a new skill, which allows you to teleport

269
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:31,964
yourself.

270
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:34,566
And you can use that in the Promenade.

271
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:37,007
So obviously, you cannot use it straight away.

272
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,209
But if you die and get back at the beginning,

273
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:41,230
oh, you are excited in some way because you

274
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,151
have new things to do.

275
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,533
And maybe there is a level that you can now

276
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:46,294
access in a different branch.

277
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:49,476
And it's all about that, making sure that your skills are

278
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:50,637
used through Dev.

279
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:55,986
And also, very important point, we

280
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,407
had lots of debate and discussion

281
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:58,628
about this internally.

282
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:02,970
It's making the loop between dying and starting over

283
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,830
really quick.

284
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:06,312
We just have basically like 10 seconds

285
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:07,812
because we have a loading screen.

286
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,294
But when you die, you get back in action 10 seconds later.

287
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,395
You don't have to press anything.

288
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,376
You don't have to say, OK, I will do another one.

289
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,081
you don't have any kind of stat screen that might take a little bit too long.

290
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:20,803
It's really just, OK, you died.

291
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:24,547
You get back into the action because it wasn't that important.

292
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,009
You just get back into action.

293
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,456
So it was really important and something that actually made the death a little bit easier to get along with.

294
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:38,625
Another point which was affected a lot by the ParmaDes,

295
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:39,786
it's the control.

296
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:41,407
Why?

297
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:44,810
Because in a ParmaDes game, you will die a lot.

298
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,472
And you will get back at the beginning.

299
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,254
And the last thing that we want the player to actually feel

300
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,956
is dying for stupid reasons.

301
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:54,238
And we don't want the player to actually feel like,

302
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:58,141
I was about to jump there, I fell in the lava, and I died.

303
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:00,443
Seriously, it's a combat game.

304
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:02,885
It's not a platform game.

305
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:05,878
But still, it's a platform game.

306
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:10,947
You know, it's a side-scroller view, it's a 2D platformer, it's action, but it's still

307
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:11,669
a platformer game.

308
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:12,290
So...

309
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,412
We always ask this question.

310
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:18,415
Is the platforming, for example, is meant to be a challenge?

311
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:21,618
For example, if you take Super Meat Boy as an example,

312
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,540
yes, platforming is part of the challenge.

313
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,541
It's all about jumping and getting killed

314
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:27,283
and getting back into action really quickly.

315
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:28,284
It's all about that.

316
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,466
But Dead Cells is really combat-oriented.

317
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:34,830
Platforming, it's just a mean to move and to avoid enemies

318
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,951
and to position yourself.

319
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:39,034
It's not an hardcore platformer game.

320
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:41,397
When we asked this question, it was really

321
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:43,059
useful to many points.

322
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,701
Is it meant to be a challenge?

323
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:47,584
I mean, is the player supposed to die doing this?

324
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,427
And if the answer is no, yes, we just

325
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,589
make sure that player succeeds.

326
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:52,810
Let's see that interaction.

327
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:55,433
We have just a basic situation here.

328
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,596
The player is on the left side, and he

329
00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:58,897
wants to jump to the right side.

330
00:13:58,937 --> 00:13:59,798
So let's see that.

331
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:01,503
Jump.

332
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:04,605
Yeah, that was super intense.

333
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,227
But maybe you're not sure if you have noticed a few things that

334
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:10,168
actually did happen in this very short sequence.

335
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,190
Let's see that again, but this time in slow-mo.

336
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,472
So we can have time to actually notice all the stupid things

337
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:16,412
that actually happen.

338
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:18,253
Let's see the same sequence slow-mo.

339
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:20,035
He starts to run.

340
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:21,415
He's about to jump.

341
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:23,056
Oh, he fall, but he jumps.

342
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:28,392
And he was definitely about to miss his platform

343
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:30,953
because the feet were not on this target platform.

344
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:33,495
But for some reason, he actually reached his platform.

345
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,337
And that's lots of things like that we actually

346
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,798
do which are behind the curtain that actually make sure

347
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:41,360
that the player succeeds in doing what he wants to do.

348
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,201
First thing, this one is a very common thing.

349
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,981
But when you don't have that in a game, including 3D games,

350
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:50,062
it suddenly feels really awkward.

351
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:52,343
This idea is, when you leave a platform

352
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:53,803
and you're about to fall from a platform,

353
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:57,584
we actually give you two or three frames to jump anyway.

354
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,724
Because we understand that you wanted to jump

355
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:03,025
on the last split second, and you clearly missed.

356
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,646
But yeah, it's not meant to be a challenge.

357
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,326
So OK, you can jump.

358
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:08,146
You can do that.

359
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:11,727
So we allow jumps right on the last time.

360
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,948
And also, we teleport you.

361
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,769
For example, if we see that you are like five pixels away

362
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,871
from the target platform, we understand

363
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:21,352
that you wanted to go there.

364
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:23,312
We, for example, check if there is lava,

365
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,354
or are you pressing the right button, or stuff like that.

366
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:28,455
And we try to understand, are you actually

367
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,856
trying to get to this platform?

368
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,176
Is it your goal?

369
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:34,258
And if yeah, we just teleport you,

370
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:37,139
because it's not fun to miss for five pixels.

371
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,440
And if you're really too far, maybe we'll

372
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,003
use extra animation like what we saw in this video, which

373
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:47,805
was like crouching and getting up, which is like a small timing

374
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:48,346
penalty.

375
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:49,987
Or if you're really too far, we just

376
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:52,128
allow you to climb other platform, which is slow.

377
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:53,709
So for speedrunner, it matters.

378
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,910
But for most players, it's just, whoa,

379
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,291
I just arrived on this platform.

380
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:58,232
It was short, but I did it.

381
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,874
That's really important because, as I said,

382
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:01,856
it's not part of the game.

383
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:05,180
And it's all about understanding player intention here.

384
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,405
We try to figure out what he's trying to do.

385
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,348
Is it part of the challenge?

386
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,931
If not, we try to make him succeed,

387
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:14,433
or we help him to succeed.

388
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,004
Oh, yes, about the double jump thing.

389
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:20,746
You know, in the game, we decided

390
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:23,469
to unlock the double jump right away from the beginning.

391
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:26,131
It's not something which is locked in any way.

392
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:28,413
You could decide to lock.

393
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:31,055
But double jump for us is really like a quality of life thing.

394
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,677
It's not about something which is realistic or whatever.

395
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:36,779
It's all about giving your player ways to adjust

396
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,681
and less to anticipate.

397
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:40,742
So it's just really a quality of life thing.

398
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,385
So yeah, you might want and want in a game.

399
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,667
lock your double jump feature behind something.

400
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:49,070
But hey, pro tip here, don't do that.

401
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:53,834
So let's see a full movement sequence.

402
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:55,936
Your player is trying to get the treasure on the right.

403
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,319
He's moving, jumping, double jumps, break the door,

404
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,179
get the treasure.

405
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:00,960
Yeah.

406
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,060
Yeah.

407
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,225
It was, yes, something that really happens a lot

408
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:06,745
in this game.

409
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:08,887
You just move around and try to get something.

410
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,497
But let's see the same sequence, but this time not in slow-mo,

411
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:15,238
but we'll disable any kind of helper in this game.

412
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:16,258
I mean, like everything.

413
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:17,639
You don't have the just-in-time.

414
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:19,839
You just have your jump, double jump,

415
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,080
and that's pretty much it.

416
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,220
So let's see how it actually happens now.

417
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,541
So the player starts to run.

418
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,062
Now there's a collision, so you have to jump.

419
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:30,302
OK.

420
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:31,722
It's too high.

421
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:32,503
You have to double jump.

422
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:34,623
Oh, no, you cannot climb on walls, so.

423
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:37,224
It's too high again.

424
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:38,124
You have to double jump.

425
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:39,849
Okay.

426
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,591
Okay, this one easy.

427
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:41,851
No.

428
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:42,352
Oh.

429
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:44,754
Okay, it's becoming annoying.

430
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,316
So with double jump, I understood.

431
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:47,438
Okay, this one is tricky.

432
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:48,299
And yeah!

433
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:48,359
No.

434
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:53,694
You saw this last one, especially.

435
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,615
It was really, really unfair.

436
00:17:55,795 --> 00:17:58,337
And luckily, the guy didn't die on this one.

437
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:02,359
But if he was dying, maybe it's a 10-minute long run.

438
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:04,100
And it would feel unfair.

439
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,540
It's really all about that.

440
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:08,582
It's really all about making sure that it doesn't

441
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:10,243
feel unfair at any point.

442
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:12,344
And this particular last example,

443
00:18:12,764 --> 00:18:14,645
everyone feels like, oh, it's OK.

444
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,827
He was really maybe one pixel away or something.

445
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:20,188
he fell in the lava.

446
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,336
It was not a pleasant experience.

447
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:25,203
And the same goes for combat.

448
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:28,224
Actually, even if it's a combat-oriented game,

449
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:32,406
if we say to players that we cheat a lot to actually make

450
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:35,047
them win combats, they will say, oh, they

451
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,568
will come with pitchforks and everything,

452
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:37,668
and they will kill us, definitely.

453
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,769
But we actually do that.

454
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,470
But the thing is, this one is a little bit more tricky,

455
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,231
because we try to make sure that no one notices.

456
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,271
Is this recorded?

457
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:46,992
Sorry.

458
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:51,094
So for example, let's take a basic situation.

459
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:52,434
You have a sword in your hand.

460
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:53,255
You have an enemy.

461
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:57,069
behind you, and for some reason you attack on the left and not

462
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:58,090
on the right.

463
00:18:58,731 --> 00:18:59,532
So you missed.

464
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:01,534
But you need to attack this guy.

465
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:03,316
That's something that we can actually detect.

466
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:05,979
We just see you're about to swing your sword,

467
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,862
but you're not facing the right direction.

468
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:10,244
That's stupid, because the enemy is right behind you.

469
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,727
So we just actually turn you around for free.

470
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:15,630
And you know, the thing which is great,

471
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,831
we have this thing, the head, the brain.

472
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,313
And the brain is trying to explain everything.

473
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:24,897
And most players will actually just press the Hit button,

474
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,478
then the Right button.

475
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,700
Some of them will press the Right button first,

476
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,781
then the Hit button.

477
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:33,523
But in every case, the brain sees

478
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:34,584
something happening on screen.

479
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:35,985
Maybe the timing was not perfect.

480
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,886
Maybe he attacked before turning around.

481
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:39,107
But the brain says, OK.

482
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,736
OK, whatever, I did that.

483
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:45,720
And it really works like that.

484
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,343
Actually, for the one year on alpha early access,

485
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:52,085
I think we maybe had two people noticing this thing.

486
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:56,269
It's a kind of hidden trick that actually makes life easier.

487
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,592
Because missing the enemy by attacking the wrong direction,

488
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:00,874
it's just not fun.

489
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,416
We don't want that to happen, especially in a combat game.

490
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,278
And the same goes, for example, for ranged weapons.

491
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:09,539
We have a slight auto-aim, which is, of course, more obvious.

492
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,900
But this one has a few tricks.

493
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,161
For example, if you have a very fast weapon, a fast bow,

494
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:19,723
we'll have a higher priority on small enemies.

495
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:22,304
those who are low on HP or whatever,

496
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:24,345
or maybe a big enemy with low on HP,

497
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:25,385
or this kind of stuff.

498
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:27,486
Maybe it's really close from you, about to eat you.

499
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:30,086
So we have a priority system on targets.

500
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:32,147
It's really different from using, for example,

501
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:35,508
a very slow, powerful longbow, like a sniper or something.

502
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:38,709
In this case, we just want you to eat the big targets.

503
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,850
You don't want to eat some crappy trash mob.

504
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,230
You just want to focus on eating the big target.

505
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:44,631
So it's really all about that.

506
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:47,832
making sure that we actually understand what the player wants to do,

507
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:51,213
and making sure that it feels like he was actually in power,

508
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,974
he was in control, and he managed to do everything.

509
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:57,676
Let's see a full combat sequence in slow-mo,

510
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,356
so we can see everything happening.

511
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:00,857
So we break the door by rolling,

512
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,138
dive on the enemy, he's not dead,

513
00:21:03,498 --> 00:21:05,238
so we press the three turn around,

514
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:08,054
This guy in the middle, he has more HP.

515
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:09,814
So we take a little more hits.

516
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:11,695
But you see on the right, there is the archer.

517
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:13,715
He shoots at us.

518
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,656
So we cancel.

519
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:17,897
And we move to this guy, kicking to the wall.

520
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:21,518
And this guy above is throwing a bomb on us.

521
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:22,938
So we get behind him.

522
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:23,978
We kick him.

523
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:26,219
And he falls on his friend.

524
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,860
When someone falls on the ground in this game,

525
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,321
it acts like a grenade.

526
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:31,962
It has splash damage, something that we

527
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,543
added which was really hidden.

528
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,104
But it feels intuitive.

529
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:36,825
If you have an enemy falling on another one,

530
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,667
it actually takes lots of damage from that.

531
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:42,689
So you see this sequence is actually maybe five seconds

532
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,010
long in real time.

533
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,692
And lots is happening inside this sequence.

534
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:49,974
We don't want jumping to be an issue here.

535
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:52,375
We don't want the player to actually miss the platform.

536
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:54,797
So we really teleport him like a lot.

537
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:59,621
We don't want an attack to miss because there are three more enemies in this room, so we

538
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:03,024
don't want this single attack to miss, especially because it was a killing blow.

539
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:07,168
So we have lots of things like this happening, and it's really, really important.

540
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:11,040
One thing that we actually noticed when we made that,

541
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:14,604
it actually allowed us for much more difficulty in this game.

542
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:18,087
It allowed us to make much more difficult combat

543
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,710
and everything, because it was all about strategy and less

544
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,014
about actual controls or platforming or whatever.

545
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:26,797
It's really all about, yes, thinking what's happening,

546
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:29,200
what I'm going to do, and thinking split second.

547
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,482
And something that we also discovered,

548
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,523
which was really surprising, is that we'll

549
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,324
make our next game really based on this thing.

550
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:40,304
Most reviewers actually talk a lot more

551
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:43,285
about controls and game fields and how the game plays right

552
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:43,785
and everything.

553
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:46,646
And they do that before talking about the actual gameplay,

554
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:49,267
which is, as a game designer, like, uh, blah, blah.

555
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:52,548
But still, they do talk about that more,

556
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,408
which is very important, because, yeah, we

557
00:22:54,428 --> 00:22:55,969
had many positive reviews.

558
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:57,109
And it's all about that.

559
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:04,213
Just a small off-topic thing about early access.

560
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:06,396
We learned two things when we've been to early access.

561
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:10,022
You know, it was by this time everyone was talking about the Indypocalypse

562
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:11,103
and many people just told us,

563
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,908
you should not do an early access, you should do something else.

564
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,670
And actually, it went fine, and people

565
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,990
were really, really helpful.

566
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,331
And all the feedback, especially the negative one,

567
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:21,971
were really helpful on early access.

568
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:25,012
And a small thing that we did, I think, I don't know from,

569
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,752
I don't remember from whom we actually brought that.

570
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:30,673
But it's when we publish the patch notes,

571
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:33,033
we highlight every single line which

572
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:34,374
is based on community feedback.

573
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:37,134
And it could be something like, of course, a bug report,

574
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:39,975
but also a new feature, a new gameplay change, or something.

575
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:42,597
Because it actually makes the community quickly

576
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:44,438
understand that they are really having

577
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:45,799
a strong impact on the game.

578
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,342
Because they do have most of our patch notes

579
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:53,146
are maybe 50-50 of player suggestions on our own roadmap.

580
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:54,807
So it's really, really important.

581
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:55,768
Doesn't cost anything.

582
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:57,249
It really makes a change.

583
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,812
And oh, this one, I do steal it from the guy

584
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,294
from Subnautica, Unknown Worlds.

585
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:05,747
Early access is really like a show.

586
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:08,770
You basically have to prepare your updates.

587
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,533
You have maybe given them to your updates, make videos,

588
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,535
short gameplay video to introduce them.

589
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:17,039
Make your show, your early access show.

590
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,661
Make sure that it's dynamic and things happen and everything.

591
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:23,106
Because it's more shows on a beta, to be really honest.

592
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,348
It's more a marketing tool than anything else.

593
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,912
Yes, we gather feedback, but at the same time,

594
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:29,413
you have to think about the dynamic.

595
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:30,895
It has to be interesting for players.

596
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,300
You have to have game-changing things every, maybe,

597
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,681
single month or something like that.

598
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:39,306
Quick takeaway.

599
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:43,141
I would just say, when you make a game,

600
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,104
really, no matter what kind of game you're doing,

601
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:48,226
it's really all about taking care of details.

602
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:50,849
And especially if it's not the core of the game.

603
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,212
This game, Dead Cells, is not a platforming game.

604
00:24:53,552 --> 00:24:54,273
It's a combat game.

605
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,394
It's a progression game.

606
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:57,116
As I said, stuff like that.

607
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:59,298
But it's not a hardcore platformer.

608
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:02,682
But still, because platforming is part of the game.

609
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,483
But we don't want that to get in the way of the player.

610
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:09,585
We just actually take extra care, actually much more care

611
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:12,426
about controls, for example, than anything else.

612
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:15,968
Because we don't want that to be an issue in any way, and

613
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,228
also because of the permadeath.

614
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:22,672
Maybe you recognize those games, you know, they were like really great and

615
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:27,278
especially Prince of Persia was a defining title for Dead Cells, but I did

616
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:31,864
play them, all of them again many times, Symphony of the Night especially, and you

617
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:33,627
know what, when I played them again

618
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,610
Actually, I didn't have such a great time.

619
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:39,832
Actually, they were good by that time.

620
00:25:40,213 --> 00:25:44,736
But now, by modern standards, they just don't compete anymore.

621
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:47,359
And this is a very important point.

622
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:48,740
When you make a game, whatever it is,

623
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,283
if you have any kind of retro inspiration or whatever,

624
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,951
It's really important to make it as you remember.

625
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:57,732
Please, please don't make a shitty jump curve just

626
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:59,432
because it was like that by this time.

627
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:00,973
It's really not fun.

628
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:03,313
And lots of things have evolved.

629
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:06,154
And it's really all about getting the feelings

630
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:08,875
that you had from this game and transforming back

631
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:11,535
into your game, not copying things,

632
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:13,896
because it's really not interesting, I think.

633
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:16,296
So thank you, everyone.

634
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,537
And if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

635
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:32,655
Yeah?

636
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:34,155
Hey, how's it going?

637
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:34,735
Thanks for the talk.

638
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:35,336
Thanks for the game.

639
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:38,837
In your talk, you mentioned how platforming

640
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:40,597
wasn't the key challenge of Dead Cells.

641
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:42,238
You wanted to make it as breezy as possible.

642
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:45,999
However, in my play through, I noticed the fall damage

643
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:46,980
was pretty punishing.

644
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,820
And so it basically led to this pattern

645
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,301
of the ground slam negating it.

646
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:52,942
I just ground slammed everywhere I went.

647
00:26:53,222 --> 00:26:54,702
Sorry, can you repeat?

648
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:55,723
I didn't understand the end.

649
00:26:56,183 --> 00:27:01,387
Oh sure, so the ground slam move where you press down and attack, it negates fall damage.

650
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:04,890
So it kind of just created this play pattern of everywhere I go in the game I'm ground

651
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:09,314
slamming and I was curious what thought went into the fall damage, taking into account

652
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:12,297
that that's part of the platforming and not really part of the difficulty you were going

653
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:12,457
for.

654
00:27:13,385 --> 00:27:16,306
We did this move because we wanted to have an extra tool

655
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:16,966
for the player.

656
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:19,287
At one point, it was maybe we wanted

657
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:22,329
to make that something locked behind some kind of challenge

658
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:22,729
or whatever.

659
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:25,630
But we decided to make part of the game

660
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,052
because it really added a little layer of extra strategy.

661
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:31,893
It allows you to, for example, to get quickly to the ground

662
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:33,273
because you have only melee weapons,

663
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,454
so you don't want to get too far from the enemies.

664
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:36,955
It was really added for that.

665
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:40,277
And yes, it did change a few things about the world design.

666
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:42,097
But actually not that much.

667
00:27:42,137 --> 00:27:45,319
It was really all about giving tools for advanced players.

668
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:48,940
Actually, we don't explain this tool at any point in the game.

669
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,641
We don't have any kind of tutorial or whatever.

670
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,222
We just want this to be discovered accidentally,

671
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:55,703
because it's not important.

672
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,804
But it can be really useful when you're an advanced player.

673
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:00,345
Most of the players will actually use it,

674
00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:02,806
but maybe after four or five hours of gameplay.

675
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:04,966
So it's really meant to be like that.

676
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:05,927
Thank you.

677
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:06,667
You're welcome.

678
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:12,196
Okay, thank you for your talk. It was very fun to watch too, like your game.

679
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:19,800
I wanted to know how you avoid to give the feeling that you need to grind and

680
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,141
you know restart a lot of games to win this game.

681
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:27,526
It's a big problem with Roguelike with the unlock system.

682
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:31,729
So all about making sure that you have new content every time you play.

683
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:33,370
You know, it's really like a free-to-play thing.

684
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,292
To make sure that every time you die and get back at the beginning,

685
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:39,494
we want you to have something fresh to try.

686
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:43,816
For example, the good example is the vine rune that allows you to grow this ladder.

687
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:47,358
Is that something that you quickly see in the first level?

688
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:49,219
You have these green things on the ground.

689
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,400
You cannot do anything.

690
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,921
You don't have any kind of tutorial explaining what is it.

691
00:28:53,562 --> 00:28:55,202
And at one point in the promenade,

692
00:28:55,242 --> 00:28:57,384
you actually get the power to make this green thing turn

693
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:57,924
into a vine.

694
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:01,546
So it's all about making sure that you notice this thing

695
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:03,006
before, just like in a Metroidvania.

696
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:04,948
So when you get back in the prison, you say,

697
00:29:04,988 --> 00:29:07,050
hey, I saw this thing in the prison.

698
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,911
I died, but I know there is something

699
00:29:08,951 --> 00:29:09,652
like that in the prison.

700
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:10,332
Let's go there.

701
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:13,034
And the reward behind this wall is a new level.

702
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:15,737
This is a very important small loop

703
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:18,038
that we spend quite a lot of time thinking

704
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:19,179
of this particular one.

705
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,822
Because we wanted to have, OK, something strange, solution.

706
00:29:23,703 --> 00:29:27,524
OK, I unlock something, a new level has a reward, a new pass.

707
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:29,765
It's really all about that, making sure

708
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:32,066
that the player understands quickly the loop of the game.

709
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:35,628
And he understands, OK, now I see every time I die,

710
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:37,148
I might have something new to do.

711
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:38,869
And at one point, it's unlocking weapons,

712
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,830
but it could be unlocking pass.

713
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,611
So really taking care of the very first one

714
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:45,592
to make sure that he understands everything.

715
00:29:45,972 --> 00:29:48,733
And he has this blow mining moment where he says, oh, OK,

716
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:48,953
I see.

717
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:49,613
I can do that now.

718
00:29:50,174 --> 00:29:53,515
And it makes everything else after that work more easily.

719
00:29:54,216 --> 00:29:54,496
Thank you.

720
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:55,276
You're welcome.

721
00:29:56,697 --> 00:29:57,098
Good talk.

722
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:59,639
You said you put things in the game

723
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,281
to make the game easier, like the jumps and the double jump

724
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:02,801
mechanics.

725
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:05,422
Did that game design actually make

726
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:08,404
it hard to do other things, like make the bosses easier?

727
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,505
Did that make it worse in any way?

728
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:16,566
It didn't change much thing for the bosses, because most bosses except one is not at all

729
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,367
about platforming.

730
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:19,529
In most boss rooms, you don't have much platforms.

731
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,993
So it's really, it didn't change much anything for the bosses.

732
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:28,018
Actually the most important thing and issue that we had is about the wall climbing thing

733
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:29,680
because you could cheese bosses like this.

734
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,044
But that's something that we are trying to address even as of today.

735
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:35,005
But it didn't change much.

736
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:39,789
Actually, because the bosses happen after the fourth level,

737
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:42,791
you have time to get used to the controls.

738
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:45,432
So when you reach a boss, it's really all about combat

739
00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:46,293
and positioning.

740
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,374
And the first one is actually a 1D boss.

741
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:48,975
It's not a 2D.

742
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:50,236
It's really one dimension.

743
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:52,557
So you just have to think, I'm on the left.

744
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,158
As I'm on the right, I have to avoid attack.

745
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,440
Some of them are both sides, so you have to jump.

746
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,641
So it's really about having very

747
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:00,762
a low learning curve.

748
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:04,204
Even if it's still really hard, most players do say that.

749
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,825
So it's really all about making sure

750
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,827
that the learning curve is properly controlled.

751
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,768
So there was no negatives in adding those?

752
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:14,449
No, it didn't impact anything because we don't have

753
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:15,670
platforming during both slides.

754
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,431
So we do have, but on the last one.

755
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:18,131
So it's really far.

756
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:19,011
Sounds good.

757
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:19,312
Thank you.

758
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:21,032
You're welcome.

759
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:21,253
Please.

760
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,612
Okay, thanks for the talk. Great game.

761
00:31:28,473 --> 00:31:31,295
I have just a question about the balance in the gameplay.

762
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:35,078
There is like a mechanic you can use sometimes.

763
00:31:35,138 --> 00:31:38,201
Some people say it's an exploit, some people say it's a smart thing.

764
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:44,046
It's like hanging on the rope and some enemies they can't reach you at that point and then you...

765
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,069
you scatter your tactical weapons.

766
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:50,392
Is it something you intentionally let in the game

767
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:52,594
for people to feel smart in a way,

768
00:31:52,674 --> 00:31:57,619
or is it just something you couldn't fix at the last time?

769
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,680
It's actually both.

770
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:01,623
I did play, like, a lot of the Division 1,

771
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:04,146
and, you know, I do play turrets most of the time.

772
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,688
I really like this kind of gameplay.

773
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:08,590
And you know, it's really all about thinking,

774
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:09,771
is it breaking the game?

775
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:11,153
First question, which is important.

776
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,516
If it's not, is it a decent way to play?

777
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,919
And to answer that, we actually have a rule internally.

778
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,361
For example, when I design weapons

779
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,642
and I make gameplay choice.

780
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:24,505
It's all about considering that each combat takes two seconds.

781
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:25,686
So it's really that.

782
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,808
And everything is defined around this idea.

783
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:29,530
So the DPS and everything is balanced

784
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,091
around these two seconds.

785
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:33,253
So when you fight an enemy, it lasts two seconds.

786
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:36,116
If you use a very strong, risky weapon,

787
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:37,778
such as a very heavy weapon.

788
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:40,798
We actually allow you to make that in one second.

789
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:41,999
So you just want to kill the enemy.

790
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:44,399
But it's more risky because you have a long casting time.

791
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,580
But if you use, for example, a range weapon or cheesy anything

792
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,121
turret or something like that, actually the combat

793
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:51,701
will last three or four seconds.

794
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:52,921
It's really all about that.

795
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,182
If you want to take your time, it's fine.

796
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:58,042
You will miss a few elements in the game, so time doors

797
00:32:58,222 --> 00:32:59,603
or challenges like that.

798
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,765
But it's really all about, OK, embrace the idea

799
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:03,786
that they will cheese anyway.

800
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:04,567
They will do that.

801
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:07,129
If you want to fight that, it's difficult,

802
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:09,411
because they will always find new ways to cheese,

803
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,033
and especially if you have ladders,

804
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:12,894
if you have turrets, or stuff like that.

805
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:15,377
So it's really about embracing that and making

806
00:33:15,497 --> 00:33:16,317
it part of the gameplay.

807
00:33:16,337 --> 00:33:19,220
So for example, turrets have like 100 DPS.

808
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:21,942
Fat weapon will have maybe 120.

809
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:26,327
And a very powerful slow one, we have about 200.

810
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:29,151
So it's really all about balancing numbers

811
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:31,013
to make sure that combat lasts longer.

812
00:33:31,914 --> 00:33:32,234
Thank you.

813
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,557
OK.

814
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:37,581
So we can continue to discuss outside,

815
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:38,802
because we are out of time.

816
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:39,583
But thanks.
