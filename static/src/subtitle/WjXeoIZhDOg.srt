1
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,628
Okay, so, my mic should be working.

2
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:09,449
There we go.

3
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,571
So welcome back to the AI Summit.

4
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:12,592
Hope you had a good lunch.

5
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:15,615
And so, we have this great new session coming up,

6
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,839
but before we do that, silence your cell phones

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,302
and all that, and don't forget to fill out the forms

8
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:24,683
for evaluating the sessions.

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,145
as well.

10
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,908
Okay, so let's just get started with this thing.

11
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:32,933
So this is a first time we're doing this session at the AI Summit.

12
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:37,519
It was an idea I had, and it sort of embodies what I love about GDC.

13
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,824
I love coming to GDC to meet a lot of people, but I also love to be, like, inspired.

14
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:48,273
And so with this session, hopefully someone in here, at least a couple of people in here, will be inspired.

15
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:54,281
And in order to inspire you, I've assembled a crackpot team of presenters here,

16
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:57,745
who will share their crackpot ideas with you.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,721
And so let's just go ahead and begin.

18
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:04,902
OK, so for my crackpot idea, I started with this thought

19
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:05,643
experiment.

20
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:08,044
How would you get a first-person shooter bot

21
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:10,905
to move exactly like a human player does,

22
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,886
say, in death matches and such?

23
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,947
You want to emulate different skill levels and play styles.

24
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:16,627
But what I'm trying to get at with this crackpot idea

25
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:19,829
is you want to emulate the route and the movement strategies

26
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,470
and exactly where people are facing their guns and such.

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,933
and we start talking about it, you know, emulating people in exactly, right?

28
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:30,175
You're almost talking mocap at that point.

29
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,697
And mocap has some interesting things about it.

30
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:35,579
It captures the subtlety of motion because you're recording it.

31
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,502
And you don't even have to understand why the people are doing what they're doing,

32
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:43,104
and yet you capture all of that, those subtle motions.

33
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:47,027
That's why mocap is so well used in, say, sports games, for example.

34
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:50,950
But I am not suggesting that we do this in first-person shooter games.

35
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,331
That's too crackpot, right?

36
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:56,073
For, I'm a Call of Duty player, and I, what would you have to do?

37
00:01:56,073 --> 00:02:00,155
You have to like make a sound stage, and then actually rebuild a Call of Duty level,

38
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:01,556
and then have, and mo-cap people through it.

39
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:02,977
That is, that's pretty crackpot.

40
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:04,918
So, but that doesn't even solve the right problem,

41
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:07,079
because that's not how humans play the game.

42
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,480
Human play, humans play the game.

43
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,923
with a controller on their couch in a reclined position.

44
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,646
So that's not what we're trying to capture it.

45
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:18,789
But this image here embodies my crackpot idea

46
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,432
and it was sort of the inspiration.

47
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,174
And so if you record a lot of people playing through a game,

48
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:27,217
say a first-person shooter, and their routes

49
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:29,319
and exactly how they're moving and how they pause

50
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,460
and aim their gun and everything,

51
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,302
you have a lot of data like this.

52
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:33,943
And the different colors might represent

53
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:34,544
different play styles.

54
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:38,466
And if you have enough data, maybe not big data, but enough data,

55
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:42,189
you can then find little crossover points between these,

56
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:46,872
and the AI can maybe play back some of these and infinitely recombine this data

57
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:52,355
in order to give eerily realistic player behavior.

58
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:57,359
So the recording strategy I'm advocating is that while people are moving through a level,

59
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,960
humans are moving through a level, you're going to record the route,

60
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,683
you're recording the pace, the style of movement, any pauses.

61
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:04,663
any hesitations

62
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:10,188
and uh... the gaze and weapon direction are critical obviously because as you're

63
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:10,848
going

64
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:14,011
you know in these levels right you're going around corners in just a certain

65
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:18,314
way aiming just in certain places hopefully right where someone's head will

66
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:18,634
be

67
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:21,296
and uh... of course the weapon that you're using is very important in this

68
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:22,297
part

69
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:24,519
so the high-level strategy once you've recorded all this stuff

70
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,400
uh... you've recorded the humans

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,062
uh... you'll need to tag the styles somehow

72
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:33,106
uh... you could probably write algorithms to do this or hire interns

73
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,066
Of course.

74
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:38,928
You want to find these crossover points within these styles in order to be able to switch

75
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:43,089
between them and then the AI plays back these recordings, they're randomly switching between

76
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,810
these snippets and crossovers.

77
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,470
So let me just kind of show you this in a diagram form.

78
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,492
Here's someone's playthrough in blue there and here's another person's playthrough and

79
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,833
maybe these are all the careful playthroughs, we've tagged them as careful.

80
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,875
And then we can identify places where they cross over.

81
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,857
And these are the spots where I could be playing back

82
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,959
and play through and then decide to switch to another one,

83
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,121
just kind of like threads I showed you before.

84
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:06,142
And similarly, we could have different play styles,

85
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:08,064
aggressive one with the crossover points.

86
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,906
And so we have all this data for the ANI

87
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:12,608
to go through and perhaps choose.

88
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:15,751
And I could maybe even switch between these different styles

89
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,732
and if you want to find the crossover points for that.

90
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:23,364
And so, just a week ago I discovered this little thing on the web called the Infinite Jukebox,

91
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,765
and it uses the same idea, basically.

92
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:31,147
So, for what this is, is it's, you load up a song, here's Billie Jean by Michael Jackson,

93
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:35,669
and it starts at the 12 o'clock position and goes clockwise,

94
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,770
and this is the whole song, and an algorithm analyzed it and found crossover points in the music.

95
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:44,776
and so every time you see one of those arcs it randomly decides

96
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:48,601
yes or no to take the arc and so it's recombining the

97
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:51,925
the recorded music so that you hopefully can't tell it's

98
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:55,369
even changing to the different part of the song and because it's bouncing all

99
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:57,732
around it will play the song forever

100
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:58,133
infinitely

101
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,856
and it's basically the same idea that I'm advocating.

102
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:03,899
And in fact, I think that the strategy is so general,

103
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,360
just like I showed you with the music,

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,322
that you could probably use it for a lot of different things.

105
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,444
So you want to record humans somehow,

106
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:10,805
tag the styles,

107
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:12,928
critical to find those crossover points within the styles,

108
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,909
and then you're just playing back the recordings,

109
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:17,372
randomly switching between the snippets and crossovers,

110
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:18,573
and probably the case is,

111
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:21,896
the more data you have, the better this would actually work.

112
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:23,358
And so that's my crackpot idea.

113
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:33,414
OK, hi, I'm Alex.

114
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:37,196
So there are five stages to dealing with a crackpot idea.

115
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:40,997
But first, I'd like to point out that this is a completely

116
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,058
sensible idea.

117
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:45,379
These guys are crackpots, but this is a sensible one.

118
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,960
In fact, I think there are no crackpot ideas in machine

119
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,500
learning in general.

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,722
So anything technical that you can think of, within 6, 12

121
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,123
months, 18 months, it'll be done.

122
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:58,964
So as an example, I just want to dig into image generation.

123
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,795
So in June 2015, researchers at Google

124
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,217
figured out you could inverse a neural network

125
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:07,519
and get some interesting visualizations and patterns

126
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,320
that came out of that.

127
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,623
Then in August 2015, researchers in Germany

128
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:15,326
figured out they could reverse two neural networks

129
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:18,268
and get the style from one transferred onto the other

130
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,710
by mashing them up in the middle.

131
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,250
It's called style networks.

132
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,811
And in 2016, just January.

133
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,492
Researchers also from Germany figured out how to transfer these patches from one image

134
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:35,554
onto another using a neural network which blends them together in a more visually pleasing

135
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:36,854
way, so it's not just a mashup.

136
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:42,456
And you can take an image like this and apply it onto an image like this and generate a

137
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:44,197
circuit board city, for example.

138
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:50,660
So combining them together generates new variations of content, for example.

139
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:56,555
And then just a few weeks ago, we showed that you could take the same idea with annotations,

140
00:06:56,555 --> 00:07:01,496
like take an impressionist painting and then annotate it, and then doodle things on another

141
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:05,937
image, and you can transfer the style from one to another, and generate paintings like

142
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:06,117
this.

143
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:08,218
It only takes a few minutes, and it's pretty crazy.

144
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:12,659
But it works, so machine learning has no crackpot ideas.

145
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:20,486
But the really annoying thing about this is that it's not the technical thing that will hold back your ideas,

146
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:25,208
it's the actual implementation, getting your designs in and getting them into production.

147
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:32,052
Those are where most ideas fall flat, and that's the most annoying part about having these crazy ideas,

148
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,813
is that you have to get them by the producer.

149
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:38,555
So why not instead apply artificial intelligence to fixing those production problems?

150
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:43,678
You know, screw the system, let's figure this out.

151
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:44,498
So I have a deal for you.

152
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:51,766
Let's take our traditional art pipelines where we take our artists, we put them into the

153
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:56,753
pipeline and they generate art, so it's kind of a simplification, let's say, of the process.

154
00:07:56,753 --> 00:08:00,879
Let's turn it into a generative pipeline instead where we...

155
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:05,270
create annotations, we'll call them reference art,

156
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,472
and then we're using a neural network,

157
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:10,874
a patch-based approach to recombine bits of these images,

158
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,055
and because it's the neural network,

159
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:14,696
it has some sense of what fits together visually

160
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:17,118
and it blends things in a very pleasing way.

161
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:18,999
Then we have our level designers,

162
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,161
they're basically creating art-free

163
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:24,783
but annotated doodles of levels, for example,

164
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:27,765
and then generating the final content on the GPU.

165
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,345
So the good thing about this is that you could potentially use it as an interactive tool

166
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:38,091
to guide level designers in creating levels that are visually pleasing by simulating rather

167
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:42,517
quickly, or instead you could do a high quality HD render overnight.

168
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:45,922
So whatever technique works for you, we can make this work, right?

169
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:47,464
There's lots of different options.

170
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:53,514
Now the sad part about this is that it's going to involve a lot of changes.

171
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:57,995
And certainly a lot of members of the team and the art teams will have their roles jumbled

172
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,635
around.

173
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:03,757
A few people may no longer be required, their skills may no longer fit if they can't work

174
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:05,617
within this system.

175
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:08,958
But there's new positions that will open up as well.

176
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,380
So even though the nostalgia of working with individual pixels may disappear, or well,

177
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,019
people will be more nostalgic about working with pixels.

178
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,862
You'll have artists that are working on creating style

179
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:25,047
that transfers well to levels, and junior artists that

180
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,989
may be embedded into level design teams

181
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:30,613
to make it better suited to style transfer,

182
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,995
or even technical artists supervising the whole process

183
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:34,677
and making sure the quality remains high.

184
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,623
So I think these types of ideas, their time has come.

185
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,886
For AAA games or indie games, there's always money

186
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:46,648
to be saved by doing it quicker, even if you're taking

187
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:50,251
programmer art and turning it into 90% quality art.

188
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,472
And there's a lot of value in that.

189
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:55,535
So it's an open source project, you can go and download it,

190
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:57,156
and it actually does work.

191
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:58,856
The resolution and the performance

192
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,657
will be improved over time, but it's already

193
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,417
a pretty good proof of concept.

194
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,478
So I encourage you to go and download it and try it out,

195
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:08,219
and see if you can get this actually into the real world.

196
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:09,440
That's the exciting part.

197
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,600
Thank you.

198
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:09,800
Thank you.

199
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,000
Thank you.

200
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,575
Hi, I'm Brian, I'm gonna go right into it

201
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,716
because I have a bit more crack than most, so.

202
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:31,138
My first one I call non-CPU AI data manipulation.

203
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:32,819
This actually isn't too much crackpotty

204
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,700
because I've done a little bit of it.

205
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,062
Like using influence map techniques on the GPU,

206
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:40,104
using shaders, you can do character

207
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:41,364
and environmental craziness.

208
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:44,726
have a whole slew of them that get all mashed together,

209
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:47,827
additively, multiplicatively, with booleans,

210
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:51,488
all sorts of craziness on the GPU and come back out.

211
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:53,909
And now you have a whole slew of better

212
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,329
influence map techniques that you can do

213
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:56,170
directly on the shader.

214
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,571
Or you could even go crazier and start doing

215
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:02,352
computer vision or more advanced image analysis

216
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:03,813
using compute shaders.

217
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:07,114
There's so many different ways to use segmentation

218
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:10,355
to determine territory or resource areas.

219
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:11,495
Edge detection could.

220
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:18,573
do front lines between armies or even financial front lines in particular simulations. You

221
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:22,518
could find a number of different features, like high-value features like cover points

222
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:27,664
or resource bottlenecks. And then full-blown pattern recognition in a more transient way

223
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:31,869
so that you could potentially find map scale events like there's an ambush happening to

224
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:32,029
me.

225
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:43,319
or there's an opportunistic moment where my guy has seen an unguarded resource or base that I need to take care of immediately.

226
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:51,621
And then again, as Alex is mentioning, one of the things I'm doing in my hobby time is learning some deep learning stuff

227
00:11:51,621 --> 00:12:00,142
because there's new GPUs that are coming out that are really, really ideal for running large-scale neural nets like in real time.

228
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:01,763
It's actually pretty exciting stuff.

229
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,302
My second idea I call APBAIs. This is pretty damn crackpotty. And this is my, this has been

230
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:13,544
my kind of hobby I'd say for about 15 years. It's like a mental, mental game that I play with

231
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:18,346
myself. And this is asymmetric player based AIs. It's sort of like Ender's Game on Crack. Take

232
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:23,047
two or more games and you use the players of each one of them to provide the AI for the other

233
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,268
game without their knowing.

234
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,997
And what the thing is, is the reason I say this is a crackpot idea, but it's actually

235
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:34,687
kind of fun to think about, is that it forces you to abstract the inputs and the outputs

236
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,972
of your AI system in a very, very hardcore way to try and determine...

237
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,212
if you have two games where you can cross over like that. And so you identify is the particular

238
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:50,514
sort of temporal flow of the inputs and outputs, what types, the dimensionality of the things

239
00:12:50,514 --> 00:12:54,995
that you need and you can actually find some pretty decent matchups like an endless runner

240
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,616
game could...

241
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:02,386
based on how you traverse through an endless runner level

242
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:06,807
could be determining which fighter moves that you're playing against

243
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,747
and feed that into a fighting game.

244
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,028
And meanwhile, the fighting game guy could...

245
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:13,929
the moves and when he blocks and that kind of thing

246
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:17,250
could be determining the actual level that the endless runner is playing.

247
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,330
Sort of feeding it into the procedural system

248
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,611
to drive the actual level that the endless runner guy is running on.

249
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,784
same thing with a match three, based on which colors of bejeweled things that I hit or the

250
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:36,289
combos that I do, I launch particular waves of enemies of particular types to an AI director

251
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:42,914
system for a first person shooter or a full blown shoot em up and then in however the human

252
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,347
handles those waves of enemies, the order in which they kill

253
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:49,088
them, how much life he has left, you can then feed that back

254
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:52,169
into the random block generator for the match three and get

255
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:55,709
yourself a nice little match up that way. Likewise you could see

256
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,170
something with a tower defense and a raid boss sort of

257
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,331
situation. The spells and behaviors that the party is

258
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:05,692
using on the raid boss become the creeps for a tower defense

259
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:10,053
game and on the other side the way in which the user handles

260
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:12,293
those creeps become the raid boss' AI.

261
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:17,543
That's crackpot. And my last I call the AI long con. This one

262
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:23,386
sounds kind of weird but I, I enjoy it. Make building AI a

263
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:28,969
rewarding player activity. So, uh, uh, imagine a game, maybe

264
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:33,332
it's a, a large scale persistent, uh, um, like

265
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,012
asteroids game.

266
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:39,470
and you have a home base and you have a number of small ships and you can fly around, you can

267
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,713
collect resources, you can slowly gather up technology, you can do all this. And in the

268
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:45,734
meantime, what you can do is like...

269
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,406
give a small script, a small AI script to any one of your little robots that you have in this

270
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:57,152
world. And so you can pick one off the shelf or you can make your own little quick, little

271
00:14:57,152 --> 00:15:02,898
script, quick script for it and we can actually give you premium currency for, for doing so.

272
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:07,463
Especially if you make your own little script and then you put it on the, on the...

273
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:10,065
the list of available scripts and other people start using it.

274
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:14,309
If it's popular, maybe you get more money from it, that kind of thing.

275
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:19,053
Just to sort of incentivize actually doing a little bit of AI yourself.

276
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:23,077
Obviously the bots have to exceed some fitness function that you write,

277
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:26,620
or like I said, maybe it's some sort of like crowd, crowd,

278
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,063
thumbs up, thumbs down sort of a situation, but you have to worry about

279
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,945
collusion then, and that's weird.

280
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:35,263
Obviously this is good with shifting metagames so that it

281
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:38,185
forces the botters to kind of like reevaluate from time to

282
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:40,586
time and then plus you don't have to worry about massive

283
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,607
optimisation over time although I don't know if that's a bad

284
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,789
thing. And then eventually the botters might actually start

285
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:49,550
making bots that make bots. Um the thing that I've found over

286
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,592
time is that if you give premium currency to anything people will

287
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:53,913
do it.

288
00:15:54,513 --> 00:16:06,184
And so the reason I bring this up is because I honestly think that if you did something like this in a game, people would start creating AI to get their stupid little internet points.

289
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:13,311
And this is the thing, like you start to say, oh, but you're having human beings do the AI and it's like...

290
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:18,828
that's what I want. Because the reason I call this the long con is that I think over time if we just

291
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:24,233
have every... a larger group of people just try making an AI, just try having some control over

292
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:29,719
something that it's going to give them that that little bit of taste that they want that

293
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:33,683
that'll keep them going and keep them keep them making AI in our games and eventually

294
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:36,306
maybe that'll be a direction that's good. So that's my stuff.

295
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay. So we tend to focus a lot of time on the sexy, front-facing agent intelligence. The stuff

296
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,082
that the players interact with at run time, and rightly so. However, I believe there's a lot of

297
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:06,665
scope to spend more of our AI budget on the behind the scenes, the development workflow and

298
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:13,648
tools. So this is what a typical modern level editor looks like currently. Or, God forbid,

299
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:16,290
you're using something like this.

300
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:22,434
They're highly complex software, and they require a lot of expertise to get the most out of them.

301
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:23,614
However, there's a problem.

302
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:27,537
They're all designed about getting polygons into a virtual world.

303
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:32,180
They're not designed about getting game design principles iterated on.

304
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:38,484
It's like forcing coders to write assembly language directly or opcode manually

305
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:40,185
instead of high-level programming languages.

306
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:46,252
Perhaps this is why games get better and better looking every year and our gameplay tends to have

307
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:53,018
plateaued, unlike board games which have seen a soaring rise in new potential. Perhaps we're

308
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:58,984
just not using the right tools. So I think game editors should look something like this. Oh

309
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:00,165
wait, maybe this.

310
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:05,464
You don't need designers spending hours manually tweaking

311
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,064
the placement of geometry.

312
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:10,165
We want them to instead think about the design intent

313
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:13,686
of the space at a higher level.

314
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:16,927
So I'm talking about embracing designer-directed

315
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:18,447
generative content here.

316
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:22,568
The designer could sketch out how he wants the level to play

317
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:27,149
and tag certain areas with particular styles or encounters.

318
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,869
And then an AI system can interpret that sketch.

319
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:31,110
It's a little like Alex's neural doodles.

320
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:35,216
and actually generate the level geometry.

321
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:39,159
Place the decorations, place the encounter spawns, and so on.

322
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,940
All the grunt work can be automated.

323
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,761
Something like grammars, or L-systems

324
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:44,862
are a popular example of them.

325
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:48,564
They would allow artists to develop rules for laying out

326
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:49,605
particular styles.

327
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:53,627
You could come up with rules for a French cafe,

328
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,908
or an Italian restaurant, or an Irish pub.

329
00:18:56,624 --> 00:19:00,086
designers then just pick the style they want, tweak some

330
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:02,868
generative parameters, and off you go. Voila! Instant level.

331
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:06,810
You want that level to be slightly bigger, 10 meters

332
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,673
larger, no problem. Just tweak the size, and it automatically

333
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:13,474
lays it out for you. No more spending three days kind of

334
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,816
moving and repositioning every little bottle on the shelf of

335
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:16,116
the bar.

336
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,660
Now, this isn't rocket science.

337
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,621
It's not groundbreaking yet.

338
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:23,744
I'm not sure why we're not doing this more, to be honest.

339
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:27,287
We've seen some uptake for foliage placement,

340
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:27,807
speed tree, and that.

341
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:31,811
There's been some work on building facade generation,

342
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:35,234
but nothing at the encounter level gameplay.

343
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:36,896
And that's where I think there's some room for AI techniques.

344
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:39,778
Now, grammars are effectively a way

345
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,100
to semantically break up the space and place objects.

346
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:48,386
So there's no reason why we can't automatically apply these semantic tags to those objects and

347
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:53,748
areas in the game. We could feed that into our agent systems, the box system for example, the

348
00:19:53,748 --> 00:20:00,169
last of us do this, right? And they say, he's behind the car! We can also potentially feed it

349
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:05,170
into the behaviors and have richer information to reason about at runtime. Let's crank it up

350
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,391
another notch. Grammars can be tedious to author. So what if we could train an AI system by

351
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:11,951
looking at designer-made examples?

352
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:17,688
artists could layout specific example areas and then we can get the AI to learn the style of

353
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:22,891
those areas and transfer it onto the sketches for the designers have made. If we can learn

354
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:27,915
painterly styles with deep neural nets, why can't we do the same with layout grammars? I

355
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:32,458
think that would be pretty wicked. Let's crank it up another notch. So your QA should be

356
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,321
playing through the game constantly during development.

357
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:40,289
So why don't we have AI systems monitoring their playthroughs?

358
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:43,071
We can try and classify different play styles,

359
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:44,271
learning how the players encounter

360
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:45,692
different areas of the game.

361
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:49,615
We can retrain this constantly during development

362
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,057
and adjust for design changes and balance changes.

363
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:57,319
It could even help highlight degenerative strategies

364
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,181
early on in development rather than catching them later on.

365
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:03,856
We could also learn how the movement speed

366
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:05,557
and the engagement ranges affects the play.

367
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,279
And we could feed those metrics that you've made up

368
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,200
your game design rules about, feed that

369
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,742
into the generative system, and generate layers

370
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:15,103
that are optimized for your specific game mechanics.

371
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:19,566
With systems like this, we can have designers

372
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:22,488
focusing more on how they want the level to play,

373
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:24,569
instead of dealing with the tedious minutiae

374
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,871
of placing all these individual decorations in the level.

375
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,252
They can work about the intent of the design

376
00:21:29,252 --> 00:21:30,413
and the intent of the space.

377
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,253
and it'll allow them to iterate very quickly

378
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:34,736
and be more efficient.

379
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:39,044
So the bottom line is, we can use AI techniques

380
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:41,829
to make smarter tools, and with smarter tools,

381
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,311
we can make smarter games.

382
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:43,832
Thank you.

383
00:21:55,536 --> 00:22:00,480
Alright, my name is Tobias Karlsson and I work at Microsoft and my crackpot idea is

384
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,082
to explicitly model the play experience as a story.

385
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:09,956
So I got this idea from listening and thinking and hearing about the encounters in Halo,

386
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:12,058
particularly Halo 2 and Halo 3.

387
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:17,762
In Halo, each encounter plays out a story, and it's the same story in every single encounter.

388
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:23,467
And I was thinking, wouldn't it be more interesting if the designers could customize a story for

389
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:28,891
their encounter and explicitly model that story as the player's experience?

390
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:34,996
So the way I'm thinking this would work is the designer marks up a timeline of the encounter

391
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:40,680
and on this timeline there would be significant events and this is where the designer says

392
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,823
this is how the experience would change.

393
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:49,731
example of a mock-up I made, what it might look like. On the left here I have what I'm

394
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:56,894
calling the Oh Crap Tom Rocking Scale. So the player starts to encounter reasonably

395
00:22:56,894 --> 00:23:01,937
confident. After a while something happens, perhaps reinforcements arrive, and he drops

396
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:05,679
down to point three, which is definitely in the Oh Crap territory.

397
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,366
The player eventually deals with that and he bumps up to 0.8 and he's probably thinking

398
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:14,048
he's rocking pretty good.

399
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:16,811
And then something really bad happens.

400
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:21,572
a boss or some big monster or a tank or something like show up

401
00:23:21,572 --> 00:23:23,393
and he drops down all the way to point one

402
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:27,997
and then the player eventually works himself through this encounter

403
00:23:27,997 --> 00:23:29,759
and finishes all the way at one.

404
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,543
So the way I imagine this would work is that we have an AI manager that tries to

405
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:37,104
manipulate the encounter

406
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:40,067
in order to match the desired scale.

407
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:50,184
And the AI management will do this by spawning more or fewer reinforcements, or just weaker

408
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:56,010
or stronger enemies, changing the AI aggression, weapons, vehicles and tools used by the AI,

409
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,995
for instance an AI that can revive its fallen comrades.

410
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:02,858
Throw grenades will put more pressure on the player,

411
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,882
while if the AI refrains from doing the same thing,

412
00:24:05,882 --> 00:24:07,043
it will ease up on the player.

413
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:10,628
And as always, we have the standard low-hanging fruits,

414
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:13,591
like changing AI shatter and animations,

415
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:15,694
music, and other emotional manipulators.

416
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:23,517
So the idea is that the designer sets the limits and the AI manager acts within those limits. So

417
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:29,039
the designer may say that you're allowed to spawn 2 to 4 enemies here and the AI manager will

418
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,701
have to spawn 2, 3 or 4 enemies and can't spawn a whole battalion or none at all.

419
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:38,745
And this still allows the designers to script up, say,

420
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:42,168
various approaches to a particular encounter.

421
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:45,091
So if the designer wants to make it hard,

422
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:46,613
if you attack the encounter head-on

423
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:48,495
versus sneaking in the back door,

424
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:53,099
we can use different timelines or adjust different limits

425
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,541
for the AI I managed to work with.

426
00:24:55,253 --> 00:25:01,856
So the whole point of this is to think of an encounter as a story and explicitly model

427
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:03,737
the encounter as that story.

428
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:08,519
So we have something in our game that actually shows the story and what the encounter is

429
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:14,941
about as opposed to what most games do today where it's just a collection of spawns, geometry

430
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:16,842
and perhaps a scripted event or two.

431
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:24,528
So at this point you may be thinking that the Left 4 Dead's AI manager is doing something very similar.

432
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:32,673
And it's sort of true, but the difference here is that Left 4 Dead's AI manager works on an entire playing session at a time.

433
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:37,196
And it's non-scripted and an algorithmic approach.

434
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:42,619
And more importantly, it deals with pacing.

435
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,861
deal with how the story plays out.

436
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:49,603
That's just a side effect of the pacing and the setting.

437
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:53,025
Also, dynamic difficulty systems do something similar

438
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:58,068
as it tries to manipulate how the player experience

439
00:25:58,068 --> 00:26:00,889
its encounter, or the entire game.

440
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:03,131
But again, the goal is something different.

441
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:07,757
So the advantages of this is, first of all,

442
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:10,160
it allows the designer to explicitly express

443
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,621
his or her intent with the encounter.

444
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:16,406
And because we have this done and explicitly written down,

445
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:17,848
this is something that can be shared

446
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:18,809
with the rest of the team.

447
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,911
And you can now.

448
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:29,276
have this vehicle to actually look at this and discuss what this encounter means for the entire

449
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:36,119
game and with the rest of the team. Also, of course, it does allow the encounter to be more

450
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,021
interesting for a wider range of players and playing styles.

451
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:47,589
so we can ensure that more players actually experience the encounter the way we intended.

452
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:53,355
And finally, it makes quality assurance better, because not only can the QA test the knowledge

453
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:57,900
that's played from the encounter say that it works, they can also look at the timeline

454
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,885
and ensure that it actually matches the desired result you see when you play the game.

455
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,472
Thank you.

456
00:27:15,472 --> 00:27:16,532
Hi everyone.

457
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:18,793
So I'm gonna jump right to it.

458
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:21,855
I absolutely love procedural generation in games.

459
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:23,815
I've given talks here at GDC

460
00:27:23,815 --> 00:27:26,156
about procedural generation in games

461
00:27:26,156 --> 00:27:28,477
and how much I think that it's great.

462
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:30,818
I also love story in games.

463
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:34,080
Story is a huge part of why I play games

464
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,800
and why I enjoy them.

465
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,361
So what if we could marry those two things together?

466
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:44,720
We kind of already do this a little bit with things like Skyrim is a good example.

467
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,322
But really those are tertiary quests and things that are kind of push you out in the world.

468
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:50,622
That's not what I'm talking about.

469
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:54,483
What if we can generate something like Dragon Age?

470
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:56,164
The entire story?

471
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:59,745
What if we can analyze the works of J.R.R.

472
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:04,787
Tolkien and build a derivative work from that?

473
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:08,768
Or have an A.I. write a lost Stephen King novel?

474
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,868
I think we can.

475
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:14,571
It's all about studying and analyzing stuff, right?

476
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:15,272
We analyze story.

477
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:17,254
We've been analyzing story for centuries.

478
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:18,215
This is the hero's journey.

479
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:21,438
This was popularized by a guy named Chris Vogler.

480
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:27,445
He took that work from Joseph Campbell, who created Hero with a Thousand Faces, who in

481
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:29,307
turn was just looking at myth.

482
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,529
He was just studying myth.

483
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:37,043
We pulled structure from the way that humans tend to tell story.

484
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:40,346
We know that somewhere in the beginning of the story, we have to actually learn who this

485
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:42,828
protagonist is and care.

486
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:47,632
We know that at some point, some shit's gonna happen, and it's gonna throw his world upside

487
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:48,813
down.

488
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:51,656
And if it's missing, we miss it.

489
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:53,758
Many of you probably recognize this screenshot.

490
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:59,329
One of my biggest problems with Dragon Age Inquisition is that the inciting incident

491
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:00,790
was on the main menu.

492
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,052
As soon as I pressed that menu button, boom, right?

493
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:05,393
That's the inciting incident.

494
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:09,015
I spent the first 15 hours of the game with absolutely no connection to my character from

495
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:10,136
a story point of view.

496
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:13,278
I was like, I'm going to run around and attack things, yay.

497
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,341
And that was great and it was fun, but the story for me didn't kick in until after that.

498
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:21,988
compared to Dragon Age Origins, where it's like,

499
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:23,670
I'm a mage and I'm going on a harrowing,

500
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,651
and I got some people who maybe I care about,

501
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:28,533
or maybe I betray, who defines,

502
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,395
that defines what my character is.

503
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:33,537
So I think we can build an AI that looks and says,

504
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:36,760
hey, right about here, something needs to happen,

505
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,382
something kind of big that forces me into this special world,

506
00:29:40,382 --> 00:29:41,723
or about halfway through the story,

507
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:43,485
something really big needs to happen

508
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:45,546
that spins everything upside down,

509
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:46,907
and maybe that should relate to a thing

510
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:47,888
that happened before.

511
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:48,869
So can we take...

512
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:54,742
an AI and analyze some creative work and derive other work from that?

513
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:56,222
Well yes, we already are.

514
00:29:56,222 --> 00:30:04,664
David Cope is a brilliant man who looked at all of the works of Bach and Mozart and others

515
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:07,185
and has created effectively a Bach generator.

516
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:10,966
You can actually find it on his previous, if I go back here, on his site, you can go

517
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:11,286
find it.

518
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:14,766
And you can listen to what sounds like the lost works of Bach.

519
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,380
Jeremy Leach is another one who's done very similar things.

520
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,562
It's a different technique, but it's the same idea.

521
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:23,863
So we can totally do this.

522
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:28,006
The branching factor is admittedly considerably higher,

523
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,287
but we can absolutely do this.

524
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:32,729
So my final questions on this one are,

525
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:33,229
why can't I have this?

526
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:36,251
Because I think we all want a game master who can just

527
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,192
be this computer and can tell me Dragon Age stories forever

528
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:40,513
and Mass Effect stories forever.

529
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:42,454
But my other question is,

530
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,923
Should we actually do this?

531
00:30:45,923 --> 00:30:50,245
What does it say about our own creative process and our own creativity that we can create

532
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:52,086
a machine that does it for us?

533
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:52,486
Thank you.

534
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:53,126
All right, thank you guys.

535
00:30:53,126 --> 00:31:02,371
One observation, please raise your hand if you actually kind of tapped into this a little

536
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:03,552
bit yourselves.

537
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:03,932
Is that...

538
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:12,920
We were, like, halfway to Skynet, the Matrix, and the Singularity at some point or another

539
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,222
during the past half an hour.

540
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:18,823
Wait until they come for you, Mark.

541
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:26,206
Anyway, let's thank them once again, and I'll see you in 20 minutes for, what is it, it's

542
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:30,428
Eric Martel and the non, it's a movement thing, it's really cool.

543
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:32,309
So let's thank him once again.
