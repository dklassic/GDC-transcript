1
00:00:03,393 --> 00:00:07,837
So this is Ori and the Blind Forest, Sonic polished through distributed development.

2
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:10,339
I'm Gareth Coker and this is Andrew Lackey.

3
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:12,862
We did music and sound respectively for the game.

4
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:18,907
Before we begin, please turn off your mobile phones, pages, whatever you communicate with

5
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:19,488
these days.

6
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:26,594
And when you get your email to do the survey, please do that at the end unless you think

7
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:27,495
we absolutely suck.

8
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:28,736
In which case, don't.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:41,864
OK. So, the gist of our talk is about a small, global team that, we think, delivered some pretty big results.

10
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:45,548
But before I go any further, can you raise your hand if you're a composer?

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,633
Oh my goodness. OK. How many sound designers?

12
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:55,960
And how many people who don't do either music or sound but are indie devs?

13
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,202
Or just devs in general?

14
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:57,783
Yay!

15
00:00:57,804 --> 00:00:58,004
Okay, cool.

16
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,487
We've got a nice range of people here.

17
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:00,830
Thanks for showing up.

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:00,970
Great.

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,851
Okay, so who are we? Andrew, tell us about your company.

20
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:10,872
Yeah, so I'm a sound designer, been doing it about 15 years,

21
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,013
and eight years ago I started Wabi Sabi Sound,

22
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,633
and we cater mainly to the game industry.

23
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:18,674
It's where our love and passion is,

24
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:23,175
and we split our time somewhere 50-50

25
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:26,996
between doing full game ownership of...

26
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:34,847
meaty cool indies like Ori and The Blind Forest and The Witness and we also do contracting for

27
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:42,118
some great AAAs you've probably heard of so that's that's kind of our our MO and we're located in Atlanta, Georgia

28
00:01:43,497 --> 00:01:50,905
And as for me, I've been working in music for games and films and advertising since 2010.

29
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:55,910
And before Ori, my bread and butter was doing, I did a lot of movie trailers.

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,151
I've done way too many.

31
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:59,954
I'm kind of tired of it now, but it pays the bills, so whatever.

32
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:05,836
And since Ori and the Blind Forest, I've worked on Minecraft with their Greek Mythology expansion pack,

33
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:11,857
and I'm currently working on ARK Survival Evolved, which is obviously very different to Ori,

34
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,398
but we are here to talk about Ori today.

35
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:17,499
So, why give this talk?

36
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:20,640
We think that something very special happened...

37
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:25,797
During the long development process of this game, which was about four and a half years,

38
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:28,379
if you include the prototyping.

39
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:33,642
And here's a nice little shot of our Metacritic score, and our user Metacritic score has not

40
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:39,846
been trolled to death by PlayStation people, and it actually matches our real Metacritic

41
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:40,986
score, and we're quite proud of this.

42
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:49,918
So one of the cool things about the project is that everyone came together in a really unique and special way.

43
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:56,464
And what ended up happening was the art ended up elevating the audio, and the audio ended up elevating the art.

44
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:59,407
It all became very synergistic.

45
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:01,128
And I think...

46
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,516
What Moon Studios has done with Ori

47
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:07,736
represents what is the indie dream for a lot of people.

48
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:11,137
A lot of people are doing their games over Skype now.

49
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:13,678
You guys are all sitting in your rooms, maybe in your pajamas,

50
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:16,639
like doing games with all these people around the globe.

51
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,979
But I think it happened in such a way on Ori

52
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,080
and the Blind Forest, we thought we'd try and talk about it

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,581
and give you little hints about what you guys might

54
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,961
be able to do to help you guys with your projects.

55
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,562
So our team.

56
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:34,797
is based all over the globe, as I've alluded to.

57
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:36,839
So just to give you a quick rundown.

58
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,960
So sound was in Atlanta.

59
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,521
Music was in Los Angeles.

60
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,165
Programmers were in Australia and Israel.

61
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,506
Animators were in England.

62
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:46,408
Art team was in Germany.

63
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:48,069
I think I'm missing a couple of people.

64
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,651
You're missing the founders.

65
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:49,951
Yes.

66
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:51,453
Tel Aviv and Vienna.

67
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:52,454
Yeah, exactly.

68
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,756
So all over the place.

69
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,598
20 people on the team in total from about eight

70
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:57,538
different countries.

71
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,962
This is the team and we met them for the first time at the launch party.

72
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:03,763
I never met Andrew in person.

73
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,464
We worked together for a long time, but this was the first time I met him.

74
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:11,808
And he's responsible for how good the music sounds in the game.

75
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:17,532
And it was unusual to have such a synergistic relationship with someone, especially on my

76
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:18,052
first game.

77
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,693
It was nice to have a wingman like that.

78
00:04:19,713 --> 00:04:25,577
I would probably prefer to have met him in person, but it just wasn't doable.

79
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:26,217
You seem nice.

80
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:26,698
Yeah.

81
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,530
It seemed nice.

82
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,913
And then there's these guys, and I've never met any of them.

83
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:35,954
I don't think Andrew has.

84
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:39,798
And most of these are our incredible art team, which

85
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:41,880
serves a lot of the inspiration for us.

86
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,563
I hope we will get a chance to meet them soon,

87
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,585
but they're a long way away.

88
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:54,300
So, we learned a lot in the process, and that's another reason why we're here, because when

89
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,821
you work on something in this way, there's a lot of experimentation, and there's a lot

90
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,782
of things that go wrong, a lot of things that go right, and it's kind of a voyage of discovery.

91
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:09,223
And distributed development is something we're going to be seeing a lot more of in the next

92
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:11,984
five, ten, fifteen years, because the tools have become...

93
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,625
a lot easier and a lot simpler to get integrated into teams.

94
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:22,508
We wanted to talk about how Moon Studios' structure.

95
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,970
Everyone gives feedback at Moon, and Andrew's going to talk about that in a little bit,

96
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,512
and how getting feedback isn't just like a checklist of bugs and points that you need

97
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,212
to cross off.

98
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,853
It can also serve as a source of inspiration.

99
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:39,055
KISS, if you don't know what KISS stands for, I didn't know what KISS stands for before

100
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:39,695
Andrew wrote it in.

101
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,616
It means Keep It Simple and Stupid.

102
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:50,331
And as you're going to discover, Auri's systems for audio are very, very simple.

103
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:55,075
But it didn't prevent us from, we think, delivering good audio.

104
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:58,557
And the last thing is sticking to our guns on what mattered.

105
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:04,201
We had a few disagreements with our creative director and we told him, just trust our audio

106
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:04,581
vision.

107
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:06,062
And we're going to talk about that too.

108
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:10,646
It's important to know, this talk is not about

109
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,988
Sonic Polish 3 Interactive Music, because there is no

110
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:15,310
interactivity in the music, and I will go into

111
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,391
that a little bit later.

112
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,654
There's no fancy, wonderful, third-party tools.

113
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,956
That's what all the other talks were for, and

114
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:24,057
I hope you went to some of them.

115
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,438
That's not what you're gonna get here.

116
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,521
The game was largely made with the Unity 4 stock audio engine.

117
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:37,151
And I want to remind you that this is like focusing on a game that's delivering a single player narrative experience.

118
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:41,115
The audio approach here might not be best suited for multiplayer.

119
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:46,908
So the agenda, Andrew's going to talk about the culture at

120
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:51,011
Moon Studios, and then we're going to follow up with case

121
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,913
studies on sound and music that take into

122
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:56,314
account Moon's culture.

123
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,555
And we're hopefully going to try and tie that

124
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:58,775
all together for you.

125
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:01,237
And then if you have any questions at the end, please

126
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:02,077
feel free to ask them.

127
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,819
So now I'm going to pass over to Andrew to talk about culture.

128
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:10,243
Yes, again, just want to echo Gareth's sentiments.

129
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,083
Thanks for showing up.

130
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,604
This is really a pleasure to talk

131
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:14,064
about Ori and the Blind Forest.

132
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:18,145
It's a very special project and also a very special process

133
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:21,506
of creativity and seeing something start very modestly

134
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:25,027
from a modestly resourced but extremely talented team

135
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,327
get to where it was.

136
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,588
It's a true Cinderella story.

137
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:30,008
So it's fun to talk about it.

138
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:32,709
And it's fun to talk about how this group of creatives

139
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,390
somehow found each other on this.

140
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,674
tiny but huge planet and made Ori and the forest, in the Blind Forest. It's quite remarkable and it was an amazing

141
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:56,744
opportunity to be a part of. So let's jump into it. So, you know, in kind of common lexicon, Moon Studios is a flat

142
00:07:56,804 --> 00:08:03,508
organization, much like you may have read about Valve. However, the focus is on the

143
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:07,110
was very strong about what we were doing.

144
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:11,913
And so I just want to kind of give a little bit of like where the ground rules were

145
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:12,754
and what was

146
00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:14,535
what was flexing and what wasn't.

147
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:16,016
This game

148
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:20,398
from our founders was going to be

149
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:23,580
a beautiful, very tight, metrovania platformer.

150
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,383
We knew exactly that that's what we were doing. It was hammered home all the time.

151
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:35,106
We knew, which I think is very important, why we were making it.

152
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:40,367
And that is for the hardcore fans of the classic 2D platformer.

153
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,567
We knew if we could satisfy that crowd,

154
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:46,308
make it as pretty as we knew we could sonically and visually,

155
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:47,528
we would be OK.

156
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,248
Now that doesn't mean it's easy to do,

157
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:54,149
but this was the ground rules.

158
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:56,590
Day one on the project, this is what was presented to me.

159
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,770
This is what we're doing.

160
00:08:59,370 --> 00:08:59,690
However.

161
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:09,419
how we're making it, outside of it being chosen that it is being done in Unity, it's a battle.

162
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:12,980
And everybody in this room probably feels that, yeah, of course, that's kind of why

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,420
we're here.

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,321
We like doing game design because we're figuring out how to give new experiences, even when

165
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:24,003
we're wrapping a new experience around a classic type platform, like a 2D platformer.

166
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,963
So, let's dig deeper into what makes Moon special.

167
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,144
And as the concept of ownership...

168
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,166
Sorry, here, let me get one more point in here.

169
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:40,689
In a flat organization, this is, I think, probably ubiquitous with most flat organizations,

170
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,710
is that you remove a management layer,

171
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,271
so you have zero management, but...

172
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:49,350
The management falls back on every individual in the organization.

173
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,434
It's only going to succeed if everybody in there is managing their resources,

174
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:56,577
whether it be individually or through group dynamics,

175
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:57,998
to the betterment of the project.

176
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,903
So, it's an everybody-is-managing-when-nobody-is-managing kind of idea.

177
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:09,630
Now, to the point where I think Moon is very, very different, or at least the first time

178
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:19,177
I had ever worked in this type of environment, was that Moon has a culture of rapid iteration,

179
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:24,821
and everybody who's capable and available and has a legitimate amount of interest is

180
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:27,203
expected to review everything.

181
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:36,501
What you come up with, as Gareth alluded to, is we did this entire project basically in Skype through chat channels like this.

182
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:42,687
And if you see that circle there on the left-hand side where it says moon and it says 2135, that might be about an hour's worth of messages.

183
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,196
because there is constant feedback, there's constant discussion.

184
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:57,941
Skype was our big water cooler, if you will,

185
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:03,288
that was constantly going the entire time we were developing the project.

186
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:08,492
So what does that really look like for a sound designer or a composer?

187
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:14,075
I think it varied a little bit between us, just based on the levels of granularity that

188
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:17,017
we're kind of individually going into the engine and designing.

189
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:23,180
But sorry, let me skip around a tiny, tiny bit.

190
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:27,372
What does that mean?

191
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:29,354
Let me just quickly go back to this one.

192
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:33,698
If I'm creating a sound, and I feel like it's important

193
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,721
that somebody would want to hear it and make a judgment call

194
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:40,705
on it, like an attack or a UI sound or something

195
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,967
that I think is relatively important.

196
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:47,569
throw it in the game, you know, obviously make, you know, do my, do my best shot at

197
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:52,231
it, throw it in the game, alert the team, whoever's online, if they're not doing anything

198
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:56,272
crushing that they just absolutely have to get done, they're going to take a listen and

199
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:56,893
give feedback.

200
00:11:57,173 --> 00:12:00,614
And when I say somebody, it could be a QA tester, it could be the creative director,

201
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:03,195
all the way up and down the line.

202
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:05,436
It's important to remember that this goes both ways.

203
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:09,438
It's not just for the, it's not just the audio when we put stuff in, it's like, so when artists

204
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,599
put in stuff and I don't like it, okay.

205
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,590
Composer doesn't like the art in one part of the game.

206
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:17,992
It's unprecedented, it's not normal,

207
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:22,076
but when it's consistent across the entire organization

208
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:26,240
and you get used to it, then it can work.

209
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:30,719
Yeah, and I'll give a quick example too, just to try it on that, because I think it's a really cool point.

210
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:41,704
And we're going to get into more examples as well, but there was a visual effect put on into the game very, very, very, very late in the first ten minutes of playing it.

211
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:45,785
And if you guys have played the game, it's very mood setting, it's got what it's going on.

212
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:54,108
And this effect was done for something else. It was a global effect that came in, and it really ruined the mood of the scene.

213
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,790
And I made a squawk about it, and it got out.

214
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,152
So I'm just showing you, and we've gotten better examples here.

215
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:04,755
But just through the process of group dynamics,

216
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,396
other people were able to agree with that.

217
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:09,498
We got some kind of inertia around, yeah, this really is affecting

218
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:11,199
the way the mood of this place is going.

219
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:14,420
You know, on the sound design side, I would have had to really amp up

220
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,363
the effects to get that to look proper, and it was going to ruin

221
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:22,065
both sonically and visually, I felt, the mood of that area.

222
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:29,550
So, making that work, you know, as a developer or as if you're kind of in charge of bringing

223
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,792
people into the team, you obviously got to look for competent, talented people.

224
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:34,313
That's true of any organization.

225
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:40,177
You also have to find people who can champion their own causes and are self-motivated.

226
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:42,339
You do not get a to-do list.

227
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:46,021
There is not, you know, for the most part, a bug tracking system or a task list.

228
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,322
We don't do agile development.

229
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:50,363
Like, there's not really a structure around this.

230
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,604
It is a very organic process.

231
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,165
You gotta have some thick skin.

232
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:01,007
Keep in mind this is a multinational team.

233
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,048
Not everybody speaks the same language.

234
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:07,089
Not everybody has the same cultural mores.

235
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:09,690
You're a global citizen when you're working on a project like this.

236
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,191
There's great benefits to that.

237
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,571
Sometimes there's...

238
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:17,516
you know, implied tone and whatever, you know, you just kind of got to get past that.

239
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:23,562
And there's a very simple rule around, you know, what we, how you kind of navigate that,

240
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:25,063
and an ability to be agile.

241
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:30,669
And then this one here that's, I think, particularly important and doesn't get discussed, and I

242
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,893
think I kind of discovered it for myself along the way in here, is a real...

243
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:43,190
attention to empathy around an issue.

244
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,352
So I'm going to get into a little bit of that, because I'd really like to just pause and

245
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:54,115
if I can kind of give one nugget of experience, advice, or whatever it might be through this talk,

246
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:55,296
I think this would be the one.

247
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:56,216
And that...

248
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:08,825
Empathic listening is a concept that, as an aside, my wife's a psychiatrist so I get a little bit of the group dynamics and that.

249
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:12,528
This is something that we've talked a bit about.

250
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:18,432
Empathic listening is something that says that, well, understanding what somebody says is obviously important.

251
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:21,314
You need to understand what they're saying.

252
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:24,517
But understanding why is actually the key to progress.

253
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:30,127
Understanding why something might be an issue for somebody is really...

254
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:35,958
at the heart, at the root of what actually needs to get fixed.

255
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:40,222
And especially as sound designers and as composers as well, when you're working with people who

256
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:46,307
do not have a lexicon for sound, they're probably not as adverse to talking about sound.

257
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:54,834
They don't, just don't have the experience in it, but they have real true motivations

258
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,095
and feelings about

259
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,357
what is and isn't working.

260
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,259
So they're bringing something really valuable to you,

261
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:04,621
but not necessarily bringing it to you in a message

262
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:07,484
or a package that you can really necessarily understand

263
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:10,186
really well if you just listen to what they're saying.

264
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:14,149
So in this way, if you're not understanding why,

265
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,591
it's a great time to start asking questions.

266
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:23,198
starting just to, you know, everybody's opinion is gold and valued.

267
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:26,322
We get, you know, it doesn't mean you have to agree with it,

268
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:29,826
but just having this attitude of

269
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:32,530
there is something here that's important and valuable.

270
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:39,824
And, again, I got to the heart of the issue, which I'll give a little example of that.

271
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:46,166
Now if, say for instance, you know, a common one we get in sound design is, you know, because

272
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:51,107
we use electricity a lot, you know, I used some electrical sounds for, source sounds

273
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:56,329
for Ori's spirit flame, the main attack sound, and I got that feedback, it sounds too electrical.

274
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:05,033
Right? Okay. So, my opportunity field, as far as what I'm going to do next, is anything but electrical sounds, right?

275
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:14,198
However, with just a little bit more digging, I could understand that why, is that, well, this sound actually sounds too sci-fi.

276
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:21,224
So then, that suggests a much bigger palette of sounds that we want to stay away from.

277
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:29,351
This stuff is being interpreted as sci-fi, so when I turn to where am I going to go next

278
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:33,955
for material, I'm going to be reducing the opportunity field of what I'm going to pull

279
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:38,199
for because I'm going to be thinking not not electrical, but not not sci-fi.

280
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:43,121
And that's a really simple example, but it's, that gets to the heart of what I think is

281
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:43,801
important here.

282
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:48,363
And remember in this kind of structure, there's a lot of feedback coming at you.

283
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:55,785
So and you know, just the final point on that is that when you do that, you encourage more

284
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:59,967
interactions and you encourage more valuable feedback to come to you.

285
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:05,469
And as we'll show in some of these later slides, it.

286
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:10,697
that feed, that amazing feedback that helps get polished can come from anywhere.

287
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:16,978
So here's a kind of an anatomy of an issue, just to put a finer point on how this would

288
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,619
actually happen in a, in a moon style development environment.

289
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:22,999
You have the offended that says, this thing sucks.

290
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:24,860
And sometimes it's, they actually say that.

291
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Sometimes it's worse than that.

292
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,860
Sometimes it's worse.

293
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:29,821
And then.

294
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:34,082
And then the offender would say, no way, it's awesome.

295
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:35,563
Now that's not empathic listening.

296
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:43,386
But there's a fine line between sticking up for your work

297
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:44,987
and being empathic.

298
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:46,708
And then you've got moderates.

299
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,929
In a group culture, you've got moderates

300
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:53,171
who are going to be able to give a little bit more refined opinion

301
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:56,472
or at least give a little bit more angles on what's

302
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,153
going on here.

303
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:59,215
which I think is really crucial as well.

304
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:03,341
And your ability to kind of process that,

305
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:05,303
re-engage with the group with questions,

306
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:07,666
and try to get to some result that you feel like

307
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,528
is actionable in your next stage.

308
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:12,919
Then you're going to have no opinions, which that's fine.

309
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,719
If you don't have a deep feeling about something,

310
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,960
you don't have to participate.

311
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,102
And a bit here that I'm sure any hardcore manager in the room

312
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,083
would probably just think is totally crazy.

313
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:29,304
But effectively, the game is managed this way

314
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:32,406
in terms of priority and what needs to get done.

315
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:36,047
If an issue is raised, it only gets

316
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:37,848
resolved if A, everybody's happy.

317
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:39,028
Sometimes that happens.

318
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:44,659
be offended gives up, it's not worth it anymore, like I've, you know, I've

319
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,964
gotten as close as I feel like I can to what I feel like is right for this, but

320
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:52,309
the group dynamic is such that I gotta get on to the things or whatever.

321
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,472
Or we just run out of time.

322
00:19:55,446 --> 00:20:00,151
Now, I mean, Gareth will back me up on this, that this is the way we

323
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:04,635
polish the game. It seems counterintuitive. It's pretty much

324
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,717
constantly that way, and if you want,

325
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,300
if you're passionate about a certain issue, you have to push it

326
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:14,705
and justify not only why you think it should be pushed, but why it will

327
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:17,467
benefit the game as a whole, and that's pretty much what we did for

328
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:18,388
two to three years.

329
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:24,212
The concepts we are going to be telling you today and telling you now are not particularly

330
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:29,295
complicated, but it's the execution of them on a day-to-day basis that we managed to nail.

331
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,732
over the course of the development.

332
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:34,993
And we're doing a lot of iterations,

333
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:39,597
even though somebody might not be 100% cool with something.

334
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:41,679
And they might be kind of like, all right, I'm giving up.

335
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:44,160
We've still done a lot of iterations on something.

336
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:48,324
So we don't want to gloss over that point

337
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:50,846
that one iteration was done and we just kind of left it

338
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:52,187
because we gave up.

339
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:53,788
But.

340
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:58,490
We can go into more of that in terms of questions later if you have some.

341
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,011
So the grand motivator is the game's success.

342
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,252
And I know that's something that probably every studio has in mind.

343
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:06,333
But when you remove the management layer,

344
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:11,515
and you remove some of these other techniques and mechanisms for development,

345
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:17,298
this becomes the grain that everybody has to latch onto.

346
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:20,140
If you get so mad in a chat or whatever,

347
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,821
the thing that's gonna keep you in there,

348
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:24,122
or if you feel so offended or so frustrated,

349
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:26,083
the thing that's gonna keep you still engaged

350
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:28,264
in that process is the success of the project.

351
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:31,086
And, you know, sometimes you just have

352
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:34,648
to make those concessions, and you are.

353
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:39,370
probably making that concession because you're doing some mental factoring that says, you know what,

354
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,430
I've pushed this engineer as far as they can go,

355
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:47,353
they've got other stuff to do that's more important as far as I can tell, so we're gonna let it go.

356
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:49,134
And so that's

357
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:52,375
having a little bit broader idea about what

358
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:54,396
means for the game's success.

359
00:21:55,316 --> 00:22:02,362
And this kind of goes back to the other piece, that the team is kind of organically elevating and prioritizing issues.

360
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:07,486
If somebody's playing something and it's like, oh my gosh, that thing, like, you know,

361
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:12,590
just jumped out at me at the blue and took me totally out of the experience. I'm gonna email Andy about it.

362
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,651
Or, I'm sorry, Skype Andy about it.

363
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:19,975
That is the way we prioritize issues. And if, and if since it's in the main chat and other people are like, yeah,

364
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:24,279
I heard that the other day and it's terrible. That's how this whole process happens.

365
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,082
of what gets prioritized and elevated in terms of what needs to get worked on.

366
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:31,566
So, it's very punk rock. It's anarchy.

367
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:38,092
But it has roots in just basic social group dynamics,

368
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,335
and it works.

369
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:44,899
Even on a global distributed scale.

370
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,720
If you get the right...

371
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,728
So, let's get into some sound studies.

372
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,209
This was probably the most contentious.

373
00:22:54,989 --> 00:23:01,072
The language of whether the Spirit Tree, who's the omniscient narrator of the game and tells

374
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:07,134
the story effectively, whether that voice should be English or whether it should be

375
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:11,416
a made-up kind of language that is native to the fantasy.

376
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:19,696
It was, well, let's just go into some videos and show.

377
00:23:20,077 --> 00:23:26,102
So I'm going to show effectively,

378
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:29,906
we had a big Skype brawl about it, that's what I call it.

379
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:31,728
Big Skype brawl.

380
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:34,410
And as Gareth was saying a little bit earlier,

381
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,092
we just had to show and not tell.

382
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:40,616
And so we just did it both ways and let the team hammer it out.

383
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:59,574
We will always remember the great storm.

384
00:23:59,794 --> 00:24:04,659
That night when Ori was lost to the winds.

385
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:38,497
Okay, so there was a big discussion about that,

386
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:41,238
and it ran really pretty close to the lines

387
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:44,680
of whether you like your films dubbed

388
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,041
or whether you like subtitles.

389
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,381
This is actually one of the few,

390
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:50,663
maybe the only area where I actually disagreed

391
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:51,403
with you initially,

392
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,604
because you were pining for the English.

393
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:56,526
Andrew and I had kind of a telepathic relationship

394
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:57,446
with what the game needed,

395
00:24:57,486 --> 00:25:00,328
but this was one area where the signal kind of got.

396
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:02,449
mixed up a little bit.

397
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:05,311
We were just like, we have to make both.

398
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,032
And it can mean

399
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,674
you've got to do more work,

400
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,855
but if it makes the decision easier,

401
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,536
we're trying to make the decision easy

402
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,858
for everyone in the organization. And the easiest way

403
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:16,179
to do that is just to make the thing,

404
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,381
and then you have an A-B choice.

405
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:20,843
Like, it's pretty clear which one is better, right?

406
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:22,003
So...

407
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,465
Actually, put your hand up if you like the English.

408
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:28,268
A handful of people. Okay.

409
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:29,509
Well...

410
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,452
Yeah, well, I mean it's a good it's a really good. It's a really good

411
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:41,514
It's a it's a really good example because to point to paint the picture a little bit clearer about what the discussion on the team

412
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:48,996
Was I would say there's probably about 12 to it was a big part of the team that was engaged in this in the Skype

413
00:25:49,036 --> 00:25:56,358
Raw and at the time we were working really hard on the story, and we felt like we had a really great

414
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:04,844
emotional journey through the first third of the game, but we were really in this process

415
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:09,748
of really finding what the rest of the message in the story was going to be.

416
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:16,413
So yeah, a lot of people felt like the best way to tunnel that message to the widest number

417
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,335
of players was most likely going to be English.

418
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:21,697
So people that were in that camp were advocating for that.

419
00:26:22,017 --> 00:26:24,999
And then, of course, the other side of that argument was that

420
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:29,241
it really ruins, or really takes away from the specialness

421
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:32,183
of the Nibel fantasy.

422
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:36,805
And from a visual standpoint as well, you don't have to

423
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:40,027
have subtitles when it's in a language.

424
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:43,028
So the art gets to be featured better.

425
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:44,289
That was the flip side.

426
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:53,134
all of us would like to not have a bunch of text on the screen, so it's like there is a trade-off by going with the universal language.

427
00:26:53,194 --> 00:27:00,397
I think, you know, we've all seen the art for the game by now, and it's tremendous art, and we've got boxes and text on the screen.

428
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:07,061
There wasn't a perfect solution for this one, so we ended up... this is why it got discussed for so long.

429
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:09,782
I mean, this next video is another example.

430
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:13,845
And like, and to just put a little bit finer point on that,

431
00:27:14,245 --> 00:27:15,826
eventually I did, when I was hearing,

432
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:18,287
especially from, you know, we're a multinational team,

433
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:20,068
and when I was hearing from them, like,

434
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:22,550
eh, we just don't really want the game to be English.

435
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,651
And I was like, oh, eh.

436
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:26,112
Eh.

437
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:26,992
Okay.

438
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:28,073
Cool.

439
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,474
So I'm starting to go, you know,

440
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,094
that kind of convinced me.

441
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:32,455
The inertia starts shifting.

442
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:34,116
The decision starts to get made.

443
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:37,298
This is another great example.

444
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:51,023
The, so we have another made up language in the game that's a spirit that follows Ori

445
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:54,226
around and there's also text and it's a narrative delivery.

446
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:57,030
By that time we had the whole language thing figured out.

447
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:03,953
We had a, you know, kind of an okay solution to the gibberish language.

448
00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:08,554
We had an emotional vector where we could pick sad, happy, excited,

449
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:11,335
and then we were randomly selecting out of that.

450
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:14,415
Well, one QA tester was like,

451
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:17,096
I see the word Ori, but I don't hear Ori.

452
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:22,637
And I was like, yep, shit.

453
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:23,737
You're right.

454
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:30,683
And, you know, the dialogue's done, the actress has been at, and we're, you know, we're on to other things.

455
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,909
There's mixing to do. There's, like, you know.

456
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:35,515
And I couldn't shake this guy.

457
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:38,537
And I also couldn't, again, just put it away and say,

458
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,358
we're not doing it.

459
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:42,701
It had to stay open, because I was like, I know you're right.

460
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:47,465
And yes, we had to get the actress in at the last minute.

461
00:28:47,505 --> 00:28:49,066
We had to re-engineer the solution.

462
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:51,808
And wow, what a difference it makes.

463
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:52,769
Here's an example.

464
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:59,855
Oh!

465
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:00,695
In the food.

466
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:16,196
We're unboxing a whole new version of Sonic!

467
00:29:16,997 --> 00:29:17,777
Sonic Polish.

468
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:18,858
It's the little things.

469
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:26,928
So let's go on to another study. So this one was this pit

470
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:28,970
Gareth and I

471
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,233
against the creative leader of the project. He was a very strong-willed individual, by the way.

472
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,014
So this, yeah, yeah.

473
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:39,558
Going against Thomas, our great leader, can be a challenge, but

474
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,759
this was one where we teamed up.

475
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,400
My thing with this was like,

476
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:47,423
when your composer is telling you that less music is required...

477
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,364
like the composers in here probably, you know,

478
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:51,084
probably all like writing lots of notes

479
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,425
and like making things sound big.

480
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:54,145
But this was one I was like, we need,

481
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:57,026
the music needs to take a step back for this scene.

482
00:29:57,626 --> 00:30:02,467
But Thomas, this is a scene where you face off with,

483
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:07,469
where Ori is hiding from Kuro, the game's antagonist.

484
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,030
And Thomas wanted like typical boss music,

485
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,410
like quite adventuring.

486
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,530
And I wanted to do something stripped back

487
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,831
where sound was taking the lead.

488
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:18,293
And it came back to think we had to make it.

489
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:19,254
We made it twice.

490
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:21,556
And it actually wasn't that difficult because I just used

491
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:24,458
one of the other adventuring music cues to demonstrate it.

492
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:27,981
And what we've done is put together a video where first

493
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:31,104
you'll hear the ambient approach, and then you'll hear

494
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,425
the adventuring approach.

495
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:34,968
So let's play that, and then we'll talk about it after.

496
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:58,464
Now the ambient approach.

497
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,725
Now the adventuring music.

498
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:25,260
Okay, so now it's a little hard to tell why we felt so strongly about this, but this piece is about two-thirds of the way through the game, and to that point, this is the Ori and their antagonist basically having yet another face-off, but this one's different.

499
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,325
Before, it was basically just Ori just trying to stay out of the way and run as fast as possible.

500
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:37,743
that wasn't really what we were doing here. We were changing it up. We were playing a

501
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:43,865
bit of cat and mouse with Kuro. So with adventure music, you're motivating the character to

502
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:49,006
go, go, go, go, go. Right? But when you enter this scene, you've been taught throughout

503
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:51,967
the language of the game to this point that you better go, go, go, go, go.

504
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,642
when the player gets to the scene, they're probably going to try to run that across there as fast as possible.

505
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:07,466
But we wanted to message that this is a little bit more of a splinter cell-y kind of moment here.

506
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:09,908
Like, you're going to have to figure out a different way to go.

507
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,589
And this was something that, you know, like, you know,

508
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:17,011
Gareth and I understand, because we understand the language of sound and music better.

509
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:27,045
in a way that the creative director could not, didn't understand, because to him we were going outside of the language, the kind of general thematic feel of the game.

510
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:31,672
But we were able to convince that, hey, look, we're making a shift here in terms of gameplay mechanic.

511
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:37,495
we need to also shift the music and the sound to approach that, to address that properly,

512
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:43,736
and really make the full experience of giving the player a different thing to think about,

513
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:48,317
a different way of alluding the antagonist.

514
00:32:49,138 --> 00:32:50,878
So we won that battle, right?

515
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:52,038
Exactly.

516
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:54,539
We're proud of that one.

517
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:55,879
So

518
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,572
So just to summarize my part, it's team effort.

519
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:04,514
Team effort.

520
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:06,895
I don't feel like I have to say any more about that.

521
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:09,316
Lead with the principles.

522
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:14,199
Stick firm with what you know is right, but be a sponge

523
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:15,640
and be inviting.

524
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:22,297
And, you know, Sonic Polish is about, you know, the vision and the feedback and the

525
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:24,097
iteration, so I'm kind of restating it there.

526
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:28,720
I didn't go into a whole lot of detail about the sound design and the choices and all that.

527
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,681
There's a good article about it, Making the Magical Sound of Ori and the Blind Forest,

528
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:37,243
and I'm happy to answer any other questions, but for the scope of this, we really wanted

529
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:38,144
to talk about the culture.

530
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:41,145
All right, so I'm going to turn it back over to Mr. Gareth.

531
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:43,126
Okay.

532
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:43,726
Hello.

533
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:53,120
As one of the things about the music, I have been on since before Ori was Ori, since when

534
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,021
it was a prototype.

535
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:56,583
I've been part of the project for four and a half years.

536
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,167
And this is something I feel really, really strong about.

537
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:06,873
Indie devs, devs in general, studio devs, get your composer involved early, especially

538
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:08,154
if we're dealing with story.

539
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:13,740
Stories have arcs, they have ebbs, they have flows, and these take time to develop when you're making them.

540
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,246
They don't just come overnight. I wish they did, but if they did, we'd be pumping out a lot more games than one every four years.

541
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:28,075
So, music is a key part of the development process, and you are only helping yourself if you get the composer on early.

542
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,138
Just don't expect them to work full-time unless they're in-house.

543
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:41,067
Okay, so there's three things that we were able to nail down because I was on the project early.

544
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,810
Style, interactivity, and palette.

545
00:34:45,272 --> 00:34:48,477
And if I don't think, if I'd been on as early as I was...

546
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:55,143
We just still figure this stuff out, but figuring out early means when it comes to crunch, you can just pump out the content really quickly.

547
00:34:55,263 --> 00:35:05,913
Like, doing all of this early and doing all of the experimentation early meant that when it's like, okay, now it's time to write two and a half hours of music, you can do it pretty fast.

548
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:11,158
But you can't—you can do it to a lesser extent, but it's less comfortable.

549
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:17,933
So just about the interactivity, here's some lovely press quotes about the interactive

550
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:18,393
music.

551
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:20,654
The interactive soundtrack matches perfectly with the gameplay.

552
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:23,455
Or in the Binding Forest, there's a wonderfully immersive soundtrack that always feels like

553
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:24,896
it reacts to what you're doing.

554
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:29,297
Coker has crafted an impeccable score, always adapting to what's on screen.

555
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:32,799
There are no layers or stems.

556
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,260
There's no music system of any sort.

557
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:44,324
That's partly for creative reasons, partly my choice, and also I just didn't really have

558
00:35:44,384 --> 00:35:44,924
the skills.

559
00:35:45,705 --> 00:35:49,086
I'm not that good with Ys, and I'm not that good with Fmod, I'm just not.

560
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:55,508
So I was like, we're going to have to make it work for that reason, and also we just

561
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:59,229
didn't really have any time to build anything in Unity anyway.

562
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:03,750
It ended up being that what we delivered was 125 cues in the game delivered as stereo mixes.

563
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,170
That's it.

564
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:09,806
And this is the important part.

565
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:13,428
The score creates the illusion of being interactive

566
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:15,890
or reactive with very elaborate

567
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,671
and relentlessly tested trigger points.

568
00:36:19,392 --> 00:36:22,754
I would say I put about 500 to 1,000 hours into the game.

569
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:24,655
I didn't keep a running tab on it.

570
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,917
It's like that's a minimum and a maximum before it shipped.

571
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:31,419
And I think that's really important

572
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,600
that composers play the game that they work on,

573
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,441
especially in a single player narrative game.

574
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:42,107
And, I mean, the other thing here, all week you've probably been to various talks where you've seen

575
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:46,708
stuff at the expo with incredible tech and wonderfully advanced systems for music and sound playback.

576
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:53,050
But at the end of the day, if you don't have quality content, you can have the greatest system in the world, I think,

577
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,071
and it will not be as effective without content that's well thought out.

578
00:36:57,151 --> 00:37:02,292
Sometimes it's best to not constrain a composer within a system before you even start.

579
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:09,538
So if you can get your composer on early to figure out exactly what you require in terms of an interactive music system,

580
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:11,640
some games require interactive music.

581
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:12,801
This one didn't.

582
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:18,287
And, but if you're bringing a composer on to the end, you've probably already built your music system and you're, you're,

583
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:22,390
you might be hamstringing your composer before they've already started writing a note.

584
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:27,375
And what you want is to give your composer the entire world and then, like, bring it down.

585
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:34,167
So here is an example with interactivity.

586
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:35,711
This is what we didn't do.

587
00:37:36,192 --> 00:37:38,597
And this is regarding combat music in the game.

588
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:09,031
So this is just a crude example where we're going into a combat queue like every time Ori sees a,

589
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:12,935
Ori gets near a monster and then it's playing sting when you beat the monster.

590
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:14,577
This just doesn't work.

591
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:17,720
And because imagine doing that.

592
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,722
How many people have played Ori in here by the way?

593
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:21,243
Okay cool.

594
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:26,368
So in Ori there is quite a lot of combat and

595
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,083
If you had a stinger play, or just combat music, you're going in and out of combat,

596
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:37,187
you know, four to five hundred times over eight to ten hours, it's going to get really

597
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:40,889
annoying and gimmicky unless you've got like fifty different battle cues.

598
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:43,331
And we just came to the decision that it didn't work.

599
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:50,896
And if I could just kind of chime in there too, it also gave Gareth the ability to really

600
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:55,359
build out really strong melodies over a long period of time.

601
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,856
the music wasn't constantly interrupting itself.

602
00:39:00,977 --> 00:39:03,961
And so the player could be kind of floating along

603
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:07,645
in this narrative of the music without having

604
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:11,148
to be kept reminded, like, OK, now I'm

605
00:39:11,188 --> 00:39:13,371
fighting a thing again and a thing again and a thing again,

606
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,173
because you fight a lot of things.

607
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:16,814
It was a really good choice.

608
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,838
The other thing with battle music, whenever you play games,

609
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:23,160
whenever battle music plays, it's like,

610
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,521
I need to kill something.

611
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:27,444
And in Ori, you can get through the majority of the game

612
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:28,425
without killing anything.

613
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:31,027
So as a result, the decision was made

614
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:34,150
to only play battle music when you absolutely

615
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,371
have to kill something.

616
00:39:36,092 --> 00:39:37,893
I think a lot of people don't realize this, especially

617
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:40,956
the first time playing through, because mash x to kill

618
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:42,257
something is quite satisfying.

619
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:47,620
But the game actually, once you reach a certain point in the game,

620
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,902
there's an ability that you get that makes traversing the world much easier.

621
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:54,363
And that really encourages you more not to fight.

622
00:39:54,523 --> 00:39:58,705
And I think it would have just cheapened the game so much if we put such an emphasis on combat.

623
00:39:58,745 --> 00:40:01,267
The game is a platformer. It is about movement.

624
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:03,568
Combat was secondary in this game.

625
00:40:06,215 --> 00:40:11,117
So, next, this is about style, and this is one for the sound people in here.

626
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:17,319
So, we generally avoided using percussion in school, because most of the percussion

627
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:20,940
was supplied through Andrew's, sorry, through Auri Sounds, which Andrew created.

628
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:26,142
So, the result of this is that music is always taking a big picture view.

629
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:28,983
It's like, this is Ori and this is the environment that he's in.

630
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:33,864
Whereas, and then what's actually happening right next to Ori and what's around Ori, that's

631
00:40:33,924 --> 00:40:35,285
the, that's the micro view.

632
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:42,767
And we pretty much, either, pretty much for the whole duration of the game, music and

633
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,528
sound is either doing one or the other.

634
00:40:44,828 --> 00:40:49,189
And I would say for about 80% of the game, music is taking the big picture point of view.

635
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:55,180
And we found this, we discovered this early on, which again, when it comes to crunch time,

636
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,521
it's like, yay, I don't have to write for the percussion section.

637
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:02,183
That's like a whole section I don't have to worry about, which is 25% less work.

638
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:07,385
So here's just a couple of examples of our music and sound for those who have not played

639
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:08,205
Ori and the Blind Forest.

640
00:41:28,463 --> 00:41:30,104
This is a video issue, not a game issue.

641
00:41:30,325 --> 00:41:38,550
With the jittering.

642
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:44,934
So this is just one example, and we're in an underwater area of the game, and it's quite

643
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:46,394
satisfying to just swim around it.

644
00:41:46,475 --> 00:41:49,096
Yeah, there are monsters, and the sound effects are telling you monsters.

645
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:51,398
You don't need anything else to tell us that there are monsters nearby.

646
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:52,758
It's enough for the player.

647
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:54,860
Here is another example.

648
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,721
This is one of my favorite areas in the game.

649
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,502
the first time you get charged up.

650
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:05,545
Which is the last thing you'll see.

651
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,307
So this area,

652
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:12,109
the focus of this area is on wind.

653
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:13,589
And, uh,

654
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,270
the music has a lot of wind that

655
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:17,772
would leave a lot of room for the

656
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:24,375
percussion sound effects.

657
00:42:33,586 --> 00:42:36,147
So that's just like a little taster of like,

658
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,648
you know, when we're combining the music and sound,

659
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,649
you know, take into account your sound designer,

660
00:42:40,669 --> 00:42:41,609
like what they might be doing.

661
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:44,510
Don't make your music in isolation,

662
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,452
like always think about what your sound person

663
00:42:47,492 --> 00:42:50,133
might be doing, because it's gonna make things easier

664
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:53,134
for him or her when they are getting,

665
00:42:53,454 --> 00:42:55,075
when they're getting down to the mixing phase.

666
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:59,262
However, one of the problems with not using percussion,

667
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:01,063
so Auri is a platformer.

668
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,126
Platformers have constant movement and flow.

669
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:05,767
So how to create momentum in the music

670
00:43:05,787 --> 00:43:06,628
without using percussion?

671
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:08,710
Because percussion is one of the easiest ways

672
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,311
to get movement in the music.

673
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:13,674
It can also be a pretty cheap way if it's used too crudely.

674
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:14,895
So we use...

675
00:43:16,452 --> 00:43:21,696
an extensive amount of pulses in the music, but trying to avoid the, the cheap string

676
00:43:21,756 --> 00:43:27,000
ostinatos that are all over a lot of music right now. So I used a lot of tuned percussion,

677
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:34,186
a lot of plucked instruments, a few synths as well, and, and, and the piano. And in all

678
00:43:34,226 --> 00:43:38,810
of Auri's music, you'll hear, especially the platforming music, you will always hear some

679
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,352
kind of very subtle undulating pulse.

680
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:45,214
And on top of that, then we have long sustained sounds.

681
00:43:45,354 --> 00:43:48,516
So while you're moving around, the pulses

682
00:43:48,536 --> 00:43:51,278
are reminding you, subconsciously, I think,

683
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:52,479
that you're playing a platformer.

684
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:55,541
But the longer sustained sounds help bring you

685
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:57,102
into the world and the environment.

686
00:43:57,222 --> 00:43:58,943
Now, I've got a couple of examples of this.

687
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:01,985
And you're going to hear first, you're

688
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:03,485
going to hear the pulse-only mix.

689
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,047
And then you're going to hear everything together.

690
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:07,148
So here's the first example.

691
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:26,801
And now here's the orchestra mix, full orchestra mix.

692
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:42,328
It puts the pulse quite far in the background,

693
00:44:42,368 --> 00:44:44,849
but over the period of a two to three hour play through,

694
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:47,670
if you take the pulses out, that is felt by the player.

695
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:49,551
Here is another example.

696
00:44:49,571 --> 00:44:52,693
This cue is a little bit faster and it's a little bit harder,

697
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:54,494
but it's still the same concept of play.

698
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:34,159
Sorry, this clip went on a little bit long, but, and now coming up is the full mix.

699
00:46:08,874 --> 00:46:11,056
It took a long time for me to figure this out.

700
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:13,578
I'm not sure I would have come up with the solution

701
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,480
if I'd come on late.

702
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,400
I might have.

703
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,742
I might have stumbled upon it.

704
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:21,324
But I had access to the game from so early.

705
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,146
So I was able to try out so many things.

706
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,008
Like, what feels like good platform music?

707
00:46:25,068 --> 00:46:27,810
I've got to add, like, this is not like my thing,

708
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,872
this is the only way to score a platformer.

709
00:46:30,072 --> 00:46:31,593
But this, I feel like, is the only way

710
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:32,534
I could have scored Ori.

711
00:46:32,994 --> 00:46:34,255
And I think.

712
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:39,280
Without the experimentation process at the beginning, I'm not sure I would have arrived at this,

713
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,965
because this pulse and sustained tones combination was the result of hours and hours of play testing.

714
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:49,710
And I'll add to the huge, huge, huge, enormous thank you, Gareth, advantage to...

715
00:46:50,991 --> 00:47:00,253
the sound design was that Ori is a pretty interesting piece of material, material spirit

716
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:09,994
in an organic field, in a real life environment. So without, with him using so much restraint

717
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:14,835
in the music example, not using so much percussion, it gave so much more space to be able to hear

718
00:47:14,855 --> 00:47:18,736
Ori sliding down a wood tree or walking on rocks.

719
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:23,860
which you then feel. It transports you into that. It makes you feel like you're a part of that.

720
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,682
It's back to that micro, macro thing. It draws you in.

721
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:31,467
Exactly. Yet the Brilliant score is still giving you everything you need emotionally, pulse-wise.

722
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:36,851
It's, I think it's a huge key as to how that synergy wrapped, intertwined.

723
00:47:37,632 --> 00:47:40,335
So the last thing I wanted to talk about was our cutscene approach.

724
00:47:40,655 --> 00:47:40,795
So

725
00:47:42,824 --> 00:47:46,566
Normally, there's a lot of ways, I guess there's a few ways you can approach cutscenes.

726
00:47:46,606 --> 00:47:51,009
The worst way is you get handed a video by the developer and it comes with temp music

727
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,230
and hey, rip off the temp.

728
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,632
That's not very satisfying, please don't do that.

729
00:47:56,013 --> 00:48:01,136
The next is you get a cutscene and maybe there's no music, that's okay.

730
00:48:01,817 --> 00:48:02,738
So on Ori...

731
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,028
We had storyboards, and the storyboards were given to me,

732
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:11,031
and I was able to extend or shorten the storyboards,

733
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:16,414
so in order, and, so I could make a piece of music

734
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:18,716
that had a nice flow and arc.

735
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:22,838
This helped define exactly what the cutscenes are.

736
00:48:24,577 --> 00:48:28,960
And we're going to show an example of one of the cut scenes, where I took different approaches.

737
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,484
And this is an example of where the music actually would have influenced the art.

738
00:48:35,524 --> 00:48:40,368
Because the music ended up being done for the cut scenes first, and then the cut scenes got made.

739
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:43,970
And if we'd gone in one direction, the art would have been quite different.

740
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,792
So here is a cut scene where...

741
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:50,796
Kuro, the antagonist, is facing off against Ori.

742
00:48:50,836 --> 00:48:54,260
It's one of the first times they meet each other in the game and here's the first approach

743
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,161
that I took.

744
00:48:59,045 --> 00:49:01,788
This is what concepting looks like by the way.

745
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:35,313
Right, that's like one approach.

746
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,601
It's pretty clear that's the villain, right?

747
00:49:41,914 --> 00:49:44,255
And Thomas, our director, saw that and was like,

748
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:47,796
this is really good, but it's the wrong message to send out.

749
00:49:48,316 --> 00:49:51,297
And if that scene had been developed by artists,

750
00:49:51,377 --> 00:49:53,958
and it takes a lot of work to do the art for the game,

751
00:49:53,978 --> 00:49:55,419
and it would have been a lot of wasted work

752
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,439
if we'd gone with that direction,

753
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,000
because we ultimately didn't go in that direction.

754
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,801
It's very dark, and the art creator for the scene

755
00:50:01,021 --> 00:50:04,382
would have had that dark feel in mind.

756
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:06,863
So here's the mock-up for the second approach.

757
00:50:40,924 --> 00:50:44,085
Now it's less obvious that Kuro is the villain.

758
00:50:44,105 --> 00:50:47,586
There's obviously it's still a big moment and it's still quite scary but it's not like

759
00:50:47,786 --> 00:50:49,827
it's not blindingly obvious anymore.

760
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:53,808
Our villain is misunderstood and this is the first time we want to tell the player that's

761
00:50:53,848 --> 00:50:55,489
like it's yes Kuro is.

762
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:59,512
Kira is your antagonist, but there's a little bit more to it than that.

763
00:51:00,372 --> 00:51:06,938
And then what happens is the art gets put on top on the final cut scene and it makes

764
00:51:06,978 --> 00:51:08,219
it easy for the artist to get in.

765
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:10,661
I hope they were inspired by the music.

766
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:14,724
And I think if we'd gone in the first direction, the scene would look a lot different than

767
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:15,184
it is now.

768
00:51:15,244 --> 00:51:19,367
It's still a little bit scary, but it's not all black and white and silhouetty.

769
00:51:19,568 --> 00:51:20,428
It's just a lot of blue.

770
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:25,212
So here's the final with the recorded orchestra and everything put together.

771
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:05,350
All right, I'm just there.

772
00:52:05,931 --> 00:52:06,231
OK.

773
00:52:06,692 --> 00:52:09,256
So what I learned in this process,

774
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,560
and you're going to get my big message today,

775
00:52:12,702 --> 00:52:15,266
the composer can and should be testing for things

776
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:17,009
that regular QA testing cannot.

777
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:17,710
So.

778
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:23,329
And especially in a small team, you've got no one really,

779
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:25,490
you've got people testing for audio, but they're testing for like,

780
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:26,850
does the loop work?

781
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:28,431
There's no audio here.

782
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:30,152
Why is there a glitch here?

783
00:52:30,512 --> 00:52:34,473
But who is testing the emotional flow from level one

784
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:35,814
all the way to the end?

785
00:52:35,974 --> 00:52:37,054
Who's responsible for that?

786
00:52:37,474 --> 00:52:39,175
The composer is responsible for that.

787
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:42,316
And really, that's your number one responsibility.

788
00:52:42,336 --> 00:52:45,897
And the only way, the only possible way you are going to find that out

789
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:47,778
is if you play the game you're working on.

790
00:52:48,278 --> 00:52:50,120
And yes, it requires a lot of hours.

791
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,501
I spent so many hours.

792
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:57,687
And I, you know, I didn't invoice Moon, please pay me extra money for playing your game for

793
00:52:57,928 --> 00:52:58,428
500 hours.

794
00:52:58,909 --> 00:52:59,829
But it's part of your job.

795
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:00,670
You've got to play the game.

796
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:05,135
And if you don't have time or if you're bad at games, go to, go find a student who is

797
00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:08,018
into games and they'll probably be really happy to play games for you.

798
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:09,499
So.

799
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,443
The big thing is you've got to play the game you're working on.

800
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:18,168
Now, don't get me wrong, there are examples, hundreds of examples, of amazing scores, I'm

801
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,850
sure, where the composer didn't play the game.

802
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:27,097
But my feeling is that you will get your best effort, the developer will get your best effort

803
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:32,342
if you are playing the game actively and looking at the grand emotional experience from A to

804
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:32,382
B.

805
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:34,944
If you're doing a film, you would sit with the director

806
00:53:35,064 --> 00:53:36,785
and do lots of playbacks with the director,

807
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,446
and they would tell you what they like and didn't like.

808
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:39,786
It should be the same for games.

809
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,747
I know I'm pretty sure that it isn't,

810
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:43,468
and it's something I feel really strongly about.

811
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,909
All composers in the room, please play your games.

812
00:53:46,269 --> 00:53:48,611
And all devs in the room, please encourage,

813
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,471
not just your composers, I mean the sound team too.

814
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:52,592
Andrew put a lot of hours into the game,

815
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:54,553
and Andrew and his team put a lot of hours into the game.

816
00:53:55,354 --> 00:53:56,775
And it really does make a difference.

817
00:53:56,975 --> 00:53:58,896
It is more work, but we're making games right,

818
00:53:58,916 --> 00:53:59,456
and it should be fun.

819
00:54:01,814 --> 00:54:02,674
This is just a little note.

820
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:06,457
I said all of Auri's music was trigger-based.

821
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:11,180
We didn't really have a BPM engine, and that's something I would have liked to have done

822
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,841
because it made transitions really difficult.

823
00:54:14,702 --> 00:54:18,225
And lastly, getting on board really helped me and helped the team.

824
00:54:19,486 --> 00:54:25,790
And also having the amount of input and being able to give the amount of feedback.

825
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,831
Makes me feel valued. And we all want to feel valued, right?

826
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:30,352
When we're, when we're working on a game,

827
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:32,872
we want our opinion to feel important.

828
00:54:33,012 --> 00:54:39,814
And when you are on early and you have a big say in the, in the development process,

829
00:54:40,295 --> 00:54:44,196
I don't feel like I'm just getting this list of stuff that I need to deliver.

830
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:47,537
I really felt like I was able to help shape the experience.

831
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:49,117
And I know Andrew felt the same way.

832
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:53,301
So, just to conclude, testing and iteration is king.

833
00:54:53,781 --> 00:54:55,023
It takes time, but it's king.

834
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,426
Do not underestimate the audio department.

835
00:54:57,626 --> 00:55:00,469
We're storytellers too, not just asset creators.

836
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:06,156
And all the feedback is valuable, no matter how much you don't like it.

837
00:55:06,677 --> 00:55:07,838
Just a little quick example.

838
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,240
One of our artists said to me...

839
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,762
I don't like the piano in one of the cues.

840
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:13,103
I'm like, what do you know?

841
00:55:13,203 --> 00:55:15,204
I know you don't play any musical instrument whatsoever.

842
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:17,125
But actually, that person's feedback

843
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:19,507
is valuable because they don't know about music.

844
00:55:19,988 --> 00:55:22,149
And I was like, well, it cost me 10 seconds

845
00:55:22,169 --> 00:55:24,471
to try it just to turning down the piano, and it was better.

846
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,614
Sometimes the person who doesn't know about music is right, too.

847
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:36,507
And Moon's thing about defining what the game is early on really helped us at the end, like

848
00:55:36,547 --> 00:55:37,628
when it came to crunch time.

849
00:55:38,489 --> 00:55:41,672
I've rushed the ending a little bit because I really want to open it up for questions.

850
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:45,115
I know we've only got five minutes, but we are the last presentation, so hopefully they're

851
00:55:45,136 --> 00:55:46,116
going to let us stick around.

852
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:49,380
Okay, so if you've got questions, line up.

853
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,301
Otherwise, that's it from us.

854
00:56:03,267 --> 00:56:03,768
All right, go for it.

855
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:05,774
I was wondering if you could tell us

856
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:09,685
something about the process of implementation of the audio.

857
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,341
Sound, music, or both?

858
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:15,124
If you're able, both?

859
00:56:15,824 --> 00:56:17,185
Andrew, you probably best.

860
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:19,527
We were fully integrated with the tools,

861
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:22,249
and we were getting builds on a minute basis,

862
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:25,512
getting data in the tool, implementing.

863
00:56:26,412 --> 00:56:31,376
But as we said, we were using stock Unity engine.

864
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:33,318
So it was that.

865
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,221
Anything specific you want to ask about?

866
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:45,336
Well, how fast were you able to implement it in the game and share it with the whole team?

867
00:56:45,396 --> 00:56:45,896
Instantly.

868
00:56:46,097 --> 00:56:47,057
Instantly, yeah.

869
00:56:47,297 --> 00:56:50,740
So, I would just drag it onto our Mii's Tortoise SDN and...

870
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:59,360
We, we, uh, I would just drag and drop WAV files, update within like 15 seconds, upload,

871
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,980
get a good internet connection if you're doing distributed development, it's really important.

872
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,361
Um, but, uh, yeah, I could get feedback within like 10 minutes if I wanted to.

873
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,042
Um.

874
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:09,822
Yeah, that's true.

875
00:57:09,982 --> 00:57:15,463
I mean, it was, you would get feedback within 20 minutes, 10, 20 minutes if, um, you put

876
00:57:15,503 --> 00:57:16,703
something on the Skype chat.

877
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:17,883
Thank you.

878
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:21,772
Hi, thanks so much. My question's for Gareth.

879
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:27,076
I was hoping you could talk some about your musical inspirations.

880
00:57:27,337 --> 00:57:33,422
How much for this specific score, inspiration from other composers affected you?

881
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:34,583
Kind of how that worked.

882
00:57:34,843 --> 00:57:37,365
It's less about, for me it's less about other composers.

883
00:57:37,385 --> 00:57:42,149
I think one of the dangers when, are you a student or are you...

884
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:42,629
I'm a student.

885
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,732
Okay, right. So, stop listening to soundtracks.

886
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:51,615
If you like the Ori soundtrack, that's great, but when you're doing your own work, stop

887
00:57:51,675 --> 00:57:55,798
listening to soundtracks, because they've been influenced by temp music too, and the

888
00:57:55,878 --> 00:58:00,342
best thing you can do is find some weird stuff from all over the world, because that's the

889
00:58:00,382 --> 00:58:02,423
stuff that's going to make your work unique.

890
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:06,327
Now, once you've done that, then you can go back and listen to some soundtracks.

891
00:58:07,628 --> 00:58:12,812
So I lived in Japan for three years, and I got to travel around Asia a lot.

892
00:58:15,134 --> 00:58:16,595
that's a real musical treat.

893
00:58:16,915 --> 00:58:19,297
Like, there's just a bunch of instruments I'd never even heard of.

894
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:20,378
I, like, look at them and I'm like,

895
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:21,719
you can make a sound with that?

896
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,961
And I was like, OK, well, I'm going to remember this

897
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:26,563
and store it in the memory bank for the future

898
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,285
when I have a chance to do a project which might benefit from it.

899
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:33,508
And so, once I'd done that,

900
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:35,489
then, to answer your question,

901
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:39,072
you're tying in the weird and wonderful stuff.

902
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:43,115
And for Ori, Thomas Newman's pretty clearly an influence.

903
00:58:44,977 --> 00:58:47,979
And one of my favorite composers is Michael Danner,

904
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:49,680
especially his score for Life of Pi.

905
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,321
I think it's a masterpiece.

906
00:58:51,801 --> 00:58:52,781
He did win the Oscar for it.

907
00:58:53,002 --> 00:58:55,563
And if you haven't heard the Life of Pi score,

908
00:58:55,623 --> 00:58:56,624
please go listen to it now.

909
00:58:56,704 --> 00:58:57,984
If you liked Ori's soundtrack, you

910
00:58:58,004 --> 00:58:59,525
will like the Life of Pi soundtrack.

911
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:01,066
So I hope that answers your question.

912
00:59:01,226 --> 00:59:02,086
Yeah, thank you so much.

913
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:04,848
Hi, guys.

914
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:06,749
So the game's freaking amazing.

915
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:08,210
Thank you.

916
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:09,250
The music is beautiful.

917
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:10,831
The sound is perfect.

918
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:16,871
team. Sounds like it was a really awesome team to work with and I'm curious if at any

919
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:18,392
point it felt like work.

920
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:25,898
Oh yeah, I mean, there was, yeah, I mean it's, it was, uh.

921
00:59:27,936 --> 00:59:31,677
Let me first say that I have a love affair with that game.

922
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:37,559
And it's deeply personal, as much as it is a great career

923
00:59:37,979 --> 00:59:38,499
project.

924
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,660
But the struggle is real, man.

925
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:44,040
I don't know.

926
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:48,642
Development is hard, making games is hard.

927
00:59:49,263 --> 00:59:52,705
And when you're, especially when you're in the indie world,

928
00:59:52,785 --> 00:59:54,926
you don't have a lot of the cushy environments that,

929
00:59:54,966 --> 01:00:00,249
you know, and the established modes of creating

930
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:04,832
or structuring a project in which you can get comfortable

931
01:00:05,392 --> 01:00:09,074
and have some level of prediction or understanding

932
01:00:09,114 --> 01:00:10,455
about what your future looks like.

933
01:00:10,935 --> 01:00:15,597
This game was developed without a future. I mean, really, without knowing what the next month was,

934
01:00:15,657 --> 01:00:21,518
and that's through four and a half years of development. To give one example, this game

935
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:26,740
was supposed to be, and had been talked about, and had been developed to be a three-hour experience,

936
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:33,862
all the way up until E3, prior to the year of releasing it. So we tripled the scope of the game

937
01:00:34,282 --> 01:00:35,623
at some point with...

938
01:00:36,852 --> 01:00:40,035
at that time, 6 months left in the schedule.

939
01:00:40,655 --> 01:00:42,937
Now, I've been around the block a little bit,

940
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:45,600
so I kind of knew that really wasn't going to probably work,

941
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,962
but that didn't mean that I didn't have to have my stuff done

942
01:00:49,183 --> 01:00:50,984
if that actually did happen.

943
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,526
So, yeah, there's not, you know,

944
01:00:53,586 --> 01:00:56,029
it wasn't a comfortable, you know, situation always.

945
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:57,430
And again...

946
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:10,430
The punk rock aspect of the development culture is that, well, hey, look, this isn't, you know, these schedules are not realistic.

947
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:14,832
The logistics here say this isn't going to work out. These are not fun conversations.

948
01:01:14,892 --> 01:01:18,573
You know, this is, you know, I don't have staffing for this, budget, blah, blah, blah.

949
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:22,335
These aren't always fun conversations, but that's part of being a professional.

950
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:24,436
You know, I mean, you're going to have to do that kind of stuff.

951
01:01:24,837 --> 01:01:25,358
I'm gonna chime in here.

952
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:27,122
There was a point, like at the beginning...

953
01:01:30,877 --> 01:01:34,920
it was difficult because none of us have really done the distributed development thing before,

954
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,083
like not to a game with this much ambition.

955
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:41,645
But I think at some point during the development process,

956
01:01:41,685 --> 01:01:43,747
yes there's always problems, but that's normal in games.

957
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:47,250
But at some point I think we all realize we might be working on something special,

958
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,872
and then it starts to become fun.

959
01:01:49,932 --> 01:01:52,034
Then all of the problems cease to matter.

960
01:01:52,654 --> 01:01:57,178
Because, yeah, it sucks, like the late nights suck, the all-nighters suck, but...

961
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:03,501
We were fortunate and Moon cultivated an environment that made us feel like we were working on something special.

962
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:05,182
I mean, it was chaos at the beginning.

963
01:02:05,802 --> 01:02:11,385
Now it's less chaotic. It's more organized chaos as opposed to, like, anarchy and chaos.

964
01:02:13,506 --> 01:02:14,066
Yes, thank you.

965
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:17,168
Hello, thank you for that.

966
01:02:17,368 --> 01:02:19,349
I think, is it, how many, how many more can we do?

967
01:02:20,129 --> 01:02:20,470
Last one.

968
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:24,943
Okay, so we'll just, we'll answer this and then we'll move out to the overflow and do it out there.

969
01:02:24,963 --> 01:02:28,806
Actually, I have two quick questions. Thank you for that fantastic sounding game.

970
01:02:29,286 --> 01:02:32,008
My first question is about the Skype workflow that you showed.

971
01:02:32,688 --> 01:02:38,132
And it seemed to be quite intense and so being in that constant flow of information,

972
01:02:38,152 --> 01:02:44,217
like giving feedback, getting feedback, how do you at the same time keep your creative privacy

973
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:45,718
and your focus to, uh...

974
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:48,340
keep some time to create stuff.

975
01:02:48,501 --> 01:02:50,583
Okay, so with the Skype stuff,

976
01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:52,104
like, I don't read,

977
01:02:52,364 --> 01:02:54,527
I've not read all 2,000 messages,

978
01:02:54,547 --> 01:02:55,888
half of them don't even apply to me.

979
01:02:55,928 --> 01:02:57,329
I don't care what the programmers are doing.

980
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:00,252
I'll never care what the programmers are doing, as long as the game works.

981
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:02,091
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

982
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:10,235
But what I would do, I would create, like do composing, I'm like, it's time to procrastinate.

983
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:12,736
All composers know about procrastination.

984
01:03:14,156 --> 01:03:16,017
And I'll read the Skype chat.

985
01:03:16,037 --> 01:03:19,359
And one of the things I started doing was like, control F, music.

986
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:21,319
Control F, sound.

987
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,041
Oh, it's nothing. Okay, back to work.

988
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:30,224
So, you get used to finding a way to manage the constant matrix data stream.

989
01:03:31,805 --> 01:03:35,467
And what ended up happening, there was obviously too much information in Skype,

990
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:38,409
but the good stuff ended up getting put into documents in Google Docs.

991
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:42,331
So, it's just like an open discussion for people to brainstorm,

992
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:45,413
and then it gets organized after that.

993
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:48,054
And also, if you were missing a chat,

994
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:50,176
if somebody was like, this sound sucks, blah, blah, blah,

995
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:52,157
then somebody would probably private message you and say,

996
01:03:52,197 --> 01:03:54,338
hey, you got to check out the main chat.

997
01:03:54,638 --> 01:03:55,419
Stuff's going bad.

998
01:03:55,779 --> 01:03:56,419
It's going real bad.

999
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:57,740
Yeah.

1000
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:57,880
Yeah.

1001
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,320
That's good.

1002
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:02,163
Hey, Gareth, I really hate your music queue.

1003
01:04:02,223 --> 01:04:04,324
Change it and have a discussion about it.

1004
01:04:04,464 --> 01:04:05,385
So I hope that answers that.

1005
01:04:05,745 --> 01:04:07,806
Yeah, and so thank you, everybody, for coming.

1006
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:09,527
And please fill out your feedback.

1007
01:04:09,747 --> 01:04:12,269
And please go join us in the overflow for more questions.

1008
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:12,529
Thank you.
