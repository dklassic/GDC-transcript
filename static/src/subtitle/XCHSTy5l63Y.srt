00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,630
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,771
The world's a bit crazy out there today,

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:12,372
but I'm happy to be bringing you this talk virtually.

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:15,413
So welcome to my virtual GDC 2020 talk,

5
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:19,435
A Cost-Benefit Analysis, Is That New Tech Worth It?

6
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:20,975
My name is Ben Laidlaw.

7
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:23,956
I consider myself a technical director by trade.

8
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:27,038
I have multiple art degrees, including

9
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:28,658
a Master in Fine Arts.

10
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:31,459
I worked at the gamut of 3D from commercials to features

11
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:33,620
to AAA games to XR and virtual production,

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,581
including now in software development.

13
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:38,731
on multiple continents and a wide variety of studios.

14
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:43,315
I'll start this talk off by asking what makes GDC great?

15
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:47,059
What are we missing out on at this great event?

16
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,803
To me personally, it's connecting with all the new friends,

17
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:53,284
all my buddies from across the industry,

18
00:00:53,284 --> 00:00:55,746
from all the different studios I've worked at.

19
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:59,249
For a lot of people,

20
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:01,171
it's trying to get that next leg up in your career.

21
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:05,685
What I'm willing to bet for most people,

22
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,665
especially the people that describe themselves

23
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,185
as the technical artists,

24
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,186
that you go to GDC, discover and learn

25
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:13,026
about what your competition is doing

26
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:17,387
and how you can improve upon your own pipeline.

27
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:19,868
Some of the tech out there is really amazing.

28
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:20,768
And others, you know,

29
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,248
you could just kind of shrug your shoulder at.

30
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,249
What we really need to be truth about

31
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:28,310
is all technology is not created equal.

32
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,050
Back at your studio,

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,110
you want to be able to implement

34
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,511
that really good viable tech.

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,121
the quality tech.

36
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:36,362
Some of you may be lucky and you can just dive into coding

37
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,023
and creating art to glory.

38
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:40,064
For the rest of us who have managers and investors,

39
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:41,505
you need to sell it to them first.

40
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:42,105
So what will convince the investor

41
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:45,247
to come running to you with their money?

42
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:49,550
Often it's the case they are not specialized in what you do,

43
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,571
they work in a different business.

44
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:52,992
Their language is not, I trust you, go make art.

45
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:53,612
Their language is why.

46
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:57,715
Your answer should be a succinct three letter reply.

47
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:09,233
CBA. Your investor should hopefully come running to you at that point with their money,

48
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:13,454
or they may actually rain on your parade and say, there's no money for that. Trust me,

49
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:16,736
you'd rather have the smart investor, no matter how much it might suck if they say no.

50
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:22,018
So the CBA is short for cost-benefit analysis,

51
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:25,819
wherein you can appropriately analyze the human factor of any investment.

52
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:32,319
which is another method of showing the return on investment,

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,679
the ROI for the investor,

54
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:38,061
of what you're about to do minus the intangibles.

55
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:41,483
The ROI is a common financial and business term,

56
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:45,165
but it doesn't get complicated

57
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,386
with this fangled-angled art technology

58
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:49,867
that we're working on and this human life factor.

59
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:51,388
This is in the simplest terms,

60
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:54,349
how much your investor is going to actually profit

61
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,450
off the technology that you're about to implement.

62
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:03,307
What both of these equate to, is this tech actually worth it?

63
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,447
Is it worth the investment?

64
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:05,448
Is it worth the time?

65
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:06,990
Is it worth the human resources?

66
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,153
It doesn't matter if the whole industry is singing its praise, that you're going

67
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:13,995
to save the hearts and souls of your company, that the artists will love

68
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:17,318
you and dance in the aisle, while all very heartwarming, and maybe if you

69
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,741
had a tad bit touch of the force, it could be enough, what the CBA allows

70
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,183
you to do is put actual numbers behind that tech.

71
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:36,054
You might wonder why CBAs are effective in analyzing art.

72
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:38,535
From a historical point of view, and even to today,

73
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,315
CBAs have been crafted and applied

74
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,036
to large public work projects,

75
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:43,796
with large societal costs and benefits

76
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:45,796
that are more difficult to quantify

77
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,157
than hard technology costs.

78
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:51,618
If we were still in San Francisco,

79
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:53,058
and not virtually in San Francisco,

80
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,899
you'd be able to walk around the parks around us.

81
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:57,679
And one of the cool things is,

82
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,660
the San Francisco parks provide an economic benefit.

83
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,401
approaching $1 billion.

84
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:09,065
It's a very kind of cool insight of a CBA that was just applied that's really relevant

85
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:12,586
to where we all might have been had this week happened, not virtually.

86
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:18,430
However, we're really not, so we're not putting an arbitrary value on art.

87
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,830
Art has a real cost.

88
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,452
For instance, worker time alone is a simple value.

89
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:26,934
We're not sticking a banana to a wall and duct taping it and calling that art.

90
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:30,576
So in the 30 minutes of this talk,

91
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:32,297
we'll say 200 virtual people in attendance

92
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:36,717
on an average of 100K annual cost is $50 an hour,

93
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:39,778
which makes us a $5,000 worth of people

94
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:43,819
sitting in our virtual audience.

95
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,799
Sometimes what we're hoping for is just to get rid

96
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,259
of the more expensive cost of idle time.

97
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,060
So now that I have burned $4 of your time,

98
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,981
let's go on to the guts and glories of the CBA.

99
00:04:56,903 --> 00:05:00,365
So a quick primer, this is the outline of the talk as we dive in.

100
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:05,129
I'll refer back to this from segment to segment as we progress.

101
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:10,472
Quick thing to note is depending on the scope, a CBA may take a day or more of

102
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:14,215
work to modify or create this document, especially if you're a small indie or

103
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:18,758
small project, or you're just doing a small little like tech addition.

104
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:23,722
For extremely large initiatives with tens of millions of dollars on the line.

105
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:27,705
large groups of people, tasks, teams, IT and equipment.

106
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:30,067
This could take quite a while to implement,

107
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,188
even a month or more to do the proper due diligence.

108
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:35,250
But that one month of time

109
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,091
versus potentially the millions of dollars on the line,

110
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:42,814
it's certainly worth doing that little bit of research.

111
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:44,795
Before you even put your finger to the keyboard

112
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:45,596
to work on your CBA,

113
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,457
you need to know a CBA is a comparison of alternatives.

114
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:50,999
This is where the CBA gets its greatest strength from,

115
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,980
the same as any scientific comparison.

116
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,324
Finding relevant comparisons is really the key though.

117
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:58,945
Luckily, the first two are always the easiest.

118
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,766
I generally start with what I call the buzzworthy new tech.

119
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:05,267
This is a tech you see at GDC and catches the most buzz.

120
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:08,067
You'll see it on the latest feeds, Level80,

121
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,428
all the forums, Slack posts, Discord channels.

122
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:13,329
Your buddies will be talking about it at work.

123
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:17,290
I classify this actually as my second alternatives.

124
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,731
The first alternatives might be the most scariest.

125
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:23,132
The first is what if you do nothing?

126
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:26,104
and keep the existing workflow that you have at your studio.

127
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:28,926
At any good scientific analysis, you need your baseline

128
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:30,647
and the alternative method.

129
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,229
You cannot define value for one without the other.

130
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,110
More importantly for us,

131
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,451
when pitching why you should implement the new tech,

132
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:39,373
you need to define why the other is actually so bad.

133
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:42,355
To make a rock solid CBA, however,

134
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:45,117
you should consider a few other alternatives.

135
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:48,079
This is what gives the CBA its strength and validity.

136
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,581
Whether it's two, three, or four alternatives,

137
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:51,942
doesn't really matter.

138
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,232
but it only matters to the type of tech

139
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:56,093
that you are comparing between.

140
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:58,035
If you're choosing, say, DCCs, it's

141
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,537
more important to list all the relevant ones than just

142
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:00,857
the top two.

143
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:04,920
This is considered doing your due diligence and research.

144
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,924
The best thing is to consider other realistic possibilities,

145
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:12,987
or even something everyone talks about,

146
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:16,209
but you personally may know is not related.

147
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,391
This should help smooth out some confusions

148
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:19,051
to other stakeholders.

149
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:21,573
I do have to say a little secret, though.

150
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:23,637
The scariest thing of all these alternatives

151
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,379
and that analysis is that they have the power

152
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,120
to prove what is actually good or bad,

153
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,261
whether you intend it to or not.

154
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:31,164
Sometimes there's a real reason why you're still working

155
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:32,825
with that outdated engine and pipeline.

156
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,387
The bleeding edge does not have a solid foundation

157
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:38,390
as something that is a few other studios have worked out

158
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,272
for a few more years and a few more projects.

159
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,554
As you walk around virtually

160
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:45,655
and you talk to other GDC talks,

161
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:48,938
you see other talks across the globe,

162
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,079
see if anyone else is talking

163
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,560
about the same technology today.

164
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:57,041
Odds are if multiple studios are talking about it this year and not just one, this tech is

165
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:57,561
maturing.

166
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,424
The studios cutting the edge may not really be telling you the whole story.

167
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:03,447
I've been on the bleeding edge and I have scars to prove it.

168
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:13,456
Now that you have your list of alternatives when you're filling out your CBA, I generally

169
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:15,037
work on the buzzworthy options first.

170
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,020
I fill out my do nothing as I lament about the first.

171
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:20,804
Then I cross-check myself on my alternative options.

172
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,245
This keeps me excited and focused.

173
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:25,506
CBA can be a document, boring as most things,

174
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,267
but important document nonetheless.

175
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:31,568
I often fill these alternatives out of order

176
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:32,968
with a template laid out,

177
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:36,209
because as you research, it's easier to look up

178
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,569
the answer for A versus B

179
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,670
than do each question in sequence.

180
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,331
In reality, the priority doesn't matter.

181
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:44,472
The biggest key is to treat all options as equal.

182
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:47,813
So now that we're ready to work on our CBA,

183
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,700
For each alternative, you need to do a short introduction,

184
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,661
and then you calculate the cost and benefits.

185
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:53,962
Finally, you compare your alternatives

186
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:57,303
with your analysis, defining the best method.

187
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,284
So when talking to your investor,

188
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,665
you need to prepare a series of elevator pitches

189
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,827
to explain what each option is

190
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:04,147
beyond just a buzzworthy title.

191
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:06,589
An elevator pitch is if you had one minute

192
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,750
in an elevator with your investor,

193
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,772
and you had to sell them on something.

194
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:13,373
Say it to me quick, say it to me fast,

195
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,394
say it in the most viable method forward.

196
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:18,095
You don't have any more than one minute to talk about it.

197
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,907
So first describe how the method function works.

198
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:23,688
Trust me, no one will understand this more than you.

199
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,389
You're becoming the paid export, but keep it simple.

200
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,989
Layman's terms.

201
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:30,651
Remember your investors, your producers, your managers are not going to actually

202
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:35,933
understand all these jargon, all the industry jargon.

203
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,455
Say what the goals are, the unique elements of this method.

204
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:42,676
What makes this alternative special from others?

205
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:44,217
How does it resolve the current problem?

206
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,658
What are you really trying to fix?

207
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:48,639
Make sure it's the cause, not the causality.

208
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:53,398
State the expected performance and outcomes.

209
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:54,759
Do durations and calculations.

210
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,081
Get hard real calculations, whether it's

211
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:59,643
in microseconds or milliseconds.

212
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:00,424
What are you saving?

213
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:03,726
Are you saving minutes, hours, days?

214
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:06,389
Is it an aggregate or just a means?

215
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,891
Get reference or feedback.

216
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:09,952
Who else is using this method?

217
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,233
Did you contact them?

218
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,974
What were their comments or concerns?

219
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:15,256
Has anyone else used this in production

220
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:16,237
or called bullshit on it?

221
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:18,799
Do not make this a 20-page product summary.

222
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,760
It is awesome to have references like that

223
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,781
to this in other documents or web links,

224
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:26,262
but remember, keep this CBA simple

225
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:28,223
and reference other documents.

226
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,024
No one has ever read all of Game of Thrones

227
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:30,904
for this main reason.

228
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:34,045
For those at indies or small studios,

229
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:36,506
you might not have to worry about

230
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:39,648
these later complex introduction parts as much,

231
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:40,508
but for larger studios,

232
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:42,389
you may want to take these more seriously.

233
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,510
They may be outside your domain,

234
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,290
depending on your level,

235
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,611
so make sure you talk with the correct stakeholders.

236
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:52,637
We never work in a vacuum. There are upstream and downstream dependencies.

237
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:57,621
So identify who cares about this work, and if you change stuff, who and how it will affect them.

238
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:03,385
Identify who will view the changes. Think of this as code flow or sign-off.

239
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:06,227
You don't check in your code on Friday on the way out the door.

240
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:09,429
This may already be a standard document at the studio. You can just link to it.

241
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:13,973
Acquisition strategy. Can you just buy the tech or the plug it right in?

242
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,296
What is the process to get this approved? Where's the money coming from?

243
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,406
This could be a standard studio process you can share a link with.

244
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:23,929
I'd just say Confluence is amazing for this.

245
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:25,710
Does it need a few tweaks to get it integrated?

246
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,113
Creating the engine, for instance, is an amazing product,

247
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:33,017
but it costs a whole bunch more to put it into a custom engine

248
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,618
than it does to use it in a public engine.

249
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:38,362
How will the project be managed?

250
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:39,743
Who is the leader or the project owner?

251
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:42,405
There could be multiple owners for different parts of this tech.

252
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:47,615
Set yourself some high level milestones.

253
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:49,276
You don't need to break out JIRA yet.

254
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,378
Is this a five year project or a five week project?

255
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,640
This may show that for instance,

256
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,562
the lower cost trade-offs against a longer schedule.

257
00:11:57,562 --> 00:12:02,144
Now we're ready to find the actual cost of this new tech

258
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:04,086
by looking at several types of costs.

259
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:07,508
Direct costs are the easiest to calculate.

260
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:10,830
The amount of time you work on it is the gold standard.

261
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,013
Your physical hours are money towards the studio.

262
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:24,314
Photogrammetry, for instance, has a lot of hardware and software costs for setting up the rigs and processing the massive amount of data before you actually get anything worthwhile out of it.

263
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:29,178
Acquired assets can be TurboSquid models or API frameworks or patents you may need to license.

264
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:37,084
Indirect costs are not for the faint of heart. Often they are calculated and lump sum adjusted values by a studio.

265
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:41,687
The number of 100,000 costs annually I tossed out earlier is one of these.

266
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:44,670
It's different for each business. However,

267
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:51,091
100K was the assigned cost at the R&H bankruptcy for the average wage of an employee from intern

268
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:56,892
to senior, plus the cost of their benefits, workstation, and the kitchen, such as soda

269
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:58,373
machines and stuff like that.

270
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,473
I lived through that.

271
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,213
I went through the bankruptcy documents.

272
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,534
That was our value.

273
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,575
That was about seven, eight years ago now.

274
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:12,457
So cost has definitely gone up for the general part of the industry with inflation.

275
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,571
Microsoft and Google may actually calculate that your cost, $250K, so a quarter million

276
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:22,792
dollars on average for sitting at your desk with a nice workstation with a lot of nice

277
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:26,913
provided food or subsidized food for you and the nice benefit package that you have.

278
00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:32,054
Another good way to practice this is to figure out, do you need a full-time or part-time

279
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:32,434
producer?

280
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:35,055
Do you need studio-based IT for this project?

281
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:38,976
How many people do you pull into the big fancy meeting and burn their time?

282
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:42,797
How often do you go to the coffee machine and just drink all that free coffee?

283
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:47,985
Intangible costs cut at the heart of the matter.

284
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:51,126
Does your tech take three to five minutes to iterate

285
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:52,887
on a 128 by 128 tile in a 10 kilometer world,

286
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:55,087
causing your artist to press a button

287
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:56,168
and watch YouTube and Netflix

288
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,708
because it takes three to five minutes?

289
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,829
Does your tech stink so bad the artist hate working with it

290
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:03,570
because they can draw in Photoshop in five minutes,

291
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,371
yet it takes a day or two to do it in the engine?

292
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:10,552
Does the ability to make quality art stink so bad

293
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:13,093
that you can only produce art like it's 2010, not 2020?

294
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:13,953
God forbid it's 1990 style tech.

295
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:18,458
Did you make such a bad decision as to why there are no female characters in the game

296
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:23,039
because you made a male-specific character, causing your studio to receive blowback and

297
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,160
needing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, on marketing

298
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,601
and internal team meetings because of a male rig?

299
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:35,662
Perhaps your pipeline is so bad you need to work stupid crunch in order to ship, then

300
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:41,444
the rest of the industry knows you're a crappy studio to work for, rising costs and hiring

301
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:43,344
to replace all the people you just burned out.

302
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,676
Cost maintenance is the long-term outlook on this tech,

303
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:50,297
especially the do-nothing approach.

304
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:52,538
What does it cost to add additional features?

305
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:55,019
Can third parties integrate into your API?

306
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,779
Do you even have an API?

307
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:57,980
Will your pipeline slowly rot?

308
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,241
Or do you need a babysitter to maintain the tech

309
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:01,101
into infinity?

310
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,202
Is this one-year-old, five-year-old, decade-old tech?

311
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:06,783
Are you just patching an engine away past its prime?

312
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:09,104
Are you guarding the US military code base

313
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:11,185
that is used on 50-year-old engine code?

314
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,184
60-year-old code and you're just having those nukes just sitting in a launch silo on outdated

315
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:25,311
technology on five and a half inch floppy disk. Benefits is really the humanizing factor that

316
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:31,676
separates a CBA from an ROI. Art and quality of life are very subjective and human factors.

317
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:35,319
We can't really define them directly, but you can appropriately define them

318
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,020
by looking at these external factors.

319
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:42,575
A small studio, some tech changes can have huge increases.

320
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,997
The bigger the studio, a lot of people don't have

321
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:47,618
the same oversized impact as a small indie.

322
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:51,480
Some of the direct benefits is, did you go procedural

323
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,202
and were you able to create more content

324
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:56,183
and sell that content?

325
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:58,724
Did you change how microtransactions work

326
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,925
to get higher click-through?

327
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:04,227
Just changing a couple clicks or a couple of UI settings

328
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:06,188
so that you click and it goes to the purchase

329
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,108
and they don't have to pay.

330
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,462
five, six, seven clicks to actually purchase something.

331
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:12,464
Maybe your engine changed so you can hit more platforms,

332
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:15,046
or you change your render to hit universal and HDR content.

333
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:19,309
Indirect benefits in tech art

334
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,752
are sometimes the most measurable for us.

335
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:26,234
This is often tech that can create more content.

336
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,976
Did you increase worker productivity 10 times over

337
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,417
so they can create more assets each week?

338
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,079
Did you decrease the amount of work so much

339
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,982
you don't need that extra artist or the outsource company?

340
00:16:36,672 --> 00:16:37,552
to produce the work.

341
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,913
Did you take that three minutes per tile cook

342
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:42,954
down to seconds, eliminating hours of YouTube time,

343
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:45,435
maybe even hundreds of thousands of hours

344
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:47,176
each month or year for an artist?

345
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,816
Of all the intangible benefits that might exist,

346
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:53,638
my most sincere one is the thank you.

347
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,838
To me, that is priceless.

348
00:16:55,838 --> 00:17:00,520
This is when you actually do some type of code change.

349
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,980
You actually make something

350
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,641
and somebody actually comes up to you and says, thank you.

351
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,242
You just solved a pain in my butt.

352
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:08,277
that has been slowing me down for a day.

353
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:12,059
And somebody actually comes up and just thanks you.

354
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,780
More, less ephemeral ones is,

355
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,941
say you fix an annoying bug

356
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,662
and your customers are more happy.

357
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,563
Improving your customer loyalty

358
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:21,764
is a really intangible benefit,

359
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,385
but it has buyback into your game

360
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:26,667
for later and longer products.

361
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,687
Your tech changed,

362
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:29,608
maybe say your tech changed the playing field

363
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,449
and now you took over a larger market share.

364
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:32,950
Or you reduced crunch

365
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,691
and now you can pop off games faster now

366
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:36,132
and make everybody happy while doing it.

367
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:40,322
Analysis is the last part of the CBA.

368
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:42,042
This is where, through simple graphs

369
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,143
due to all your background work,

370
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:45,043
that you can compare apples to apples.

371
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,844
With all your questions answers,

372
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,425
you can take those findings

373
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:51,306
and add them into your spreadsheet.

374
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:53,167
This is the same task as producer scoping a sprint,

375
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,227
but with the time being converted to money in the end.

376
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:57,108
Make sure you compare alternatives

377
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,089
across a relevant time period.

378
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:01,210
Work done in the past does not count beyond the start.

379
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,851
This could be something as simple as making sure

380
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:06,972
the cost of a plugin are all in the same common currency

381
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:07,852
and not spread out.

382
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:12,300
through all the different languages and finances

383
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,920
across the whole world.

384
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,843
Time and discounting are for longer term projects

385
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:19,904
with significant costs.

386
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:21,765
This applies a rate to the cost

387
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,306
to normalize them to our present value.

388
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:26,108
In short, it's a check on inflation.

389
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:28,369
Say you implement an HDR pipeline now

390
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:29,890
as opposed to a URP pipeline,

391
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,971
but the tech won't be used until the next console.

392
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,772
You may have increased the number of consoles

393
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:34,712
you sell in the future,

394
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,093
but you need to compare that cost

395
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:37,434
to the number of consoles you sell now.

396
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:41,520
For instance, the cost of a gigabyte of RAM now

397
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,221
is significantly less than 10 years ago.

398
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,262
So you're adjusting for that change over time.

399
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:49,944
Calculating risk is another big studio

400
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:52,025
long-term project outline.

401
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,285
With all the big choices,

402
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:55,386
there's always a level of uncertainty in the task.

403
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:58,768
Even with small studios and indies,

404
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:02,109
this is, risk is there, it's very valid.

405
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,830
So say your lead programmer leaves

406
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,432
and that worked, and he was working on that,

407
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:09,629
they were working on that buzzworthy tech.

408
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:12,972
And it will take a few months to replace them,

409
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:14,953
or you have a dark horse program in the wings

410
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,054
and you don't skip a beat.

411
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,138
The lead programmer that just walked away,

412
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:22,559
that could have cost you several thousands,

413
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,241
tens, hundreds of thousands of lost work.

414
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:27,543
The longer and the bigger the problem,

415
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,884
the higher this chance is.

416
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,886
Sometimes it's better to take a less risky option

417
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,028
with lower return than a higher one.

418
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,449
Maybe don't rely on that one lead programmer.

419
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:36,190
Use two or three.

420
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:43,629
That might add to your costs, but you eliminate the risk because you deferred it over multiple people.

421
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:47,150
You can even go to the point wherein you can do a sensitivity analysis on this risk,

422
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,432
adjusting multiple factors. My favorite personally is if you're going real deep into calculating risk,

423
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:57,254
you can actually apply the Monte Carlo's method to get a great distribution of risk fall-off.

424
00:19:57,254 --> 00:20:05,157
Getting a nice little mean curve to see how much it actually kind of calculates out. That's pretty much applying a render algorithm

425
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:06,138
to risk analysis.

426
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:12,655
You do have to also in your CBA watch out for fake news.

427
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:16,197
Once a CBA becomes a series of numbers, it can be very easy to swing the

428
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:17,677
values to a predetermined opinion.

429
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:20,818
I would encourage the stakeholders to define all the biases upfront

430
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:22,179
and in writing in the CBA.

431
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,421
For instance, in one case, I was told on a project, our team lost a company

432
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:29,362
seven and a half million over the course of a project, you can tell this

433
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:33,443
number was BS because first they did not want to show you the analysis.

434
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:36,824
It was just glossed over that.

435
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:37,905
Oh yeah, we lost seven and a half million.

436
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,789
And if someone ever hides the analysis, you should be very cautious right away.

437
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:48,111
Also if we only cost the company a certain amount, then that means we had no benefit,

438
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:49,811
so zero net benefit.

439
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:54,733
It's kind of an interesting argument that somehow we contributed nothing while doing

440
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:58,954
maybe a couple of E3 presentations or defining a whole new branch of technology.

441
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:03,556
There are legitimate reasons to not show the CBA to just anyone, for instance.

442
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:05,477
If they actually report workers' wages.

443
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,422
But in most studio, this is an aggregate value, as I mentioned before.

444
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:15,465
For instance, one company, this company quoted $250K, a quarter million dollars per year

445
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:19,427
for any staff because it included all employee benefits, cost of your desk, incidental costs

446
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:21,488
like HR, and cafeteria subsidies.

447
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:27,571
So if you do a simple calculation of a team of, say, six people for five years working

448
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:31,193
full-time, that number, $250K, adds up to $7.5 million.

449
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:33,894
Also, if you consider there was no benefit...

450
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:36,216
then it would be a total loss.

451
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:39,057
However, if you consider that maybe they never had

452
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,077
six people working on it at one time,

453
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:42,478
some people only worked on it for say,

454
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:44,719
a year or a few months,

455
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,839
then it's pretty easy to call bullshit on that figure.

456
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,021
Simplest way to evaluate the total benefit

457
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,582
versus cost is a simple ratio.

458
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:55,602
I recommend using a percentage-based pie chart

459
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,003
as a visual guide.

460
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:59,684
Benefits over costs, if the value is higher than one,

461
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:00,004
it's good.

462
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,445
The highest value is often better

463
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:04,445
when the comparisons are similar,

464
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:04,625
but ...

465
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:08,795
if money or if money is no option to the investor.

466
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:12,916
So make sure to look at the total investment needed.

467
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,977
And my pseudo not so fake example,

468
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:20,578
you can tell the green is good, blue is cost.

469
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:24,360
The higher the benefit, the better it is.

470
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,101
But alternative to the buzzworthy tech is a six to four,

471
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:30,862
so it's 1.5.

472
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:33,182
But your investor needs to have $6 million

473
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:34,663
to actually pay for that.

474
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,312
If they say they only have $4 million,

475
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,175
then alternative three is actually a better option.

476
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:42,356
The benefit cost ratio has identified

477
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:48,601
that the Buzzword tech has the best alternative.

478
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,324
However, cost of opportunity identifies

479
00:22:51,324 --> 00:22:52,405
what you're missing out on.

480
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:55,267
Since it's contextualizes what you're missing out on

481
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,608
by choosing one option.

482
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,790
Perhaps you have another product down the road

483
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,852
that this tech might not be good for.

484
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:03,074
Perhaps the staff is best used elsewhere.

485
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:07,100
on another project, on another tech plan per se.

486
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,963
Say you have two choices with a GPU purchase plan.

487
00:23:10,963 --> 00:23:12,964
One buys them now at brand new costs

488
00:23:12,964 --> 00:23:13,825
while you develop the tech.

489
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:14,526
The other waits a year,

490
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:18,189
so you develop the tech with cheaper, older models,

491
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,490
and then wait for the price to drop on those things.

492
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,452
Was the work you could have done

493
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:24,934
worth the price of that drop in the meantime,

494
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:27,216
or could you have used those GPUs straight away

495
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:29,617
on something else in the meantime?

496
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,539
You can look at this as a final self-check

497
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:33,320
that you can roll back into your decision tree.

498
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:40,466
A comparison chart of alternatives is kind of the simplest analysis extract of the CBA.

499
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:44,228
This is a summary and review that is presented to start the discussion

500
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:47,230
of any CBA ranking in visual form.

501
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,932
It is a one to four rank of one to x rank of each alternative and the reason for ranking.

502
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:59,335
This may not necessarily line up with the benefit cost ratio because we checked

503
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:02,316
against opportunity costs and found that the outside the box tech

504
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,037
in this case, it's not actually.

505
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,335
necessary for this brand of product.

506
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:09,438
So even though it actually has a higher ranking,

507
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:12,981
it's actually less meaningful,

508
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:14,923
but if we develop another product, it could go up.

509
00:24:14,923 --> 00:24:16,384
So this means our actually our do nothing

510
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,266
is still more advantage

511
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,748
because we're not having to develop a whole new tech branch

512
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:23,351
just to get this one implemented.

513
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:25,393
But say we wanted to go down that whole new tech branch

514
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:25,953
on the next project,

515
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:27,675
it might actually get bumped up quite a bit.

516
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:31,377
then based on your analysis,

517
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:32,698
you now have to make the best choice.

518
00:24:32,698 --> 00:24:35,159
You need all parties to agree in writing

519
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,120
what that choice is.

520
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,561
If they don't agree on certain points, write it out.

521
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,123
Everything should be in writing.

522
00:24:41,123 --> 00:24:43,804
A CBA can be very fragile also,

523
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:46,626
so it's built on a lot of assumptions

524
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:49,268
as you've not actually done the work yet.

525
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:52,249
So if info comes in that changes the factors,

526
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:53,210
then update it.

527
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,611
Make it a living document.

528
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:57,112
Say a company buys a plugin that you were gonna use

529
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:58,033
and gives it away for free.

530
00:24:58,475 --> 00:24:59,535
This is a really good thing to do.

531
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:02,157
It might actually move certain techs up the thing.

532
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:04,678
Or said, they buy a plugin that you were going to use,

533
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:07,220
and it costs 10 times more, and it's not really worth it

534
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,822
anymore.

535
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:12,123
Or maybe they say they buy the plugin,

536
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,264
and they shut it down, like Stinger or Fabric Engine,

537
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,705
and you can no longer use this plugin.

538
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:17,566
So all that investment that you were leading for

539
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:18,967
is now just thrown out the window.

540
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:22,149
In order to get the stakeholder buy-in,

541
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:27,412
there are three main ways to do it.

542
00:25:27,796 --> 00:25:28,316
to present it.

543
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:32,037
First is to get local buy-in from all the stakeholders.

544
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:34,137
Do the legwork, talk to each person in person

545
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,158
or virtually beforehand.

546
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,358
Second is the CBA document that represents your data.

547
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:41,039
The third is a presentation of this data,

548
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,480
because very few will actually read the real CBA.

549
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,881
So the CBA document itself is your research.

550
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,141
This is the actual proof to show.

551
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:51,582
Keep it simple.

552
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:54,961
It should be shown to as many people as it can be.

553
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:57,964
For some larger corporations, due to the dollar figures placed on people,

554
00:25:57,964 --> 00:26:00,066
this may be kept above a certain pay grade.

555
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:04,210
There's a lot to be said about truth and transparency, but there's also a lot of

556
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,774
said about keeping the secret sauce in house, why one company is actually

557
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,815
more profitable than the other.

558
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:13,339
However, the CBA document itself will honestly not be read by many.

559
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,382
How many people actually read the docs in the end?

560
00:26:19,222 --> 00:26:23,004
The slide deck version is actually how you present this research to the most people at

561
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:23,684
one time.

562
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:26,386
Do this after the legwork of each stakeholder.

563
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:27,987
Do not surprise them in a meeting.

564
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:31,769
When you actually present, present it in reverse of your researching it.

565
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:33,730
So present your discovery first.

566
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:39,754
In science this would be normally the hypothesis presented first, but we're going to throw

567
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:42,235
out the hypothesis for the sake of presentation format.

568
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:48,699
People only care about the fact and why at the end of the day.

569
00:26:49,022 --> 00:26:50,242
not how you got there.

570
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,263
Make sure, as always, keep it simple

571
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:53,564
with lots of lovely graphics.

572
00:26:53,564 --> 00:26:57,046
If you're working on visual technology, show it.

573
00:26:57,046 --> 00:26:59,007
For anything important like product specs,

574
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:01,489
include a reference and a PDF version.

575
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,030
Never show any lines of code.

576
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,672
That is the death of most presentations.

577
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:09,674
That's the end of my virtual GDC talk.

578
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:12,435
I'd like to thank you for watching.

579
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:13,896
If there are any questions,

580
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:17,378
feel free to reach out to me with email or Slack.

581
00:27:17,378 --> 00:27:17,998
There is no survey.

582
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:22,004
Um, but I would love to hear your comments.

583
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:23,467
Um, everything helps going into the future.

584
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:27,815
Um, thank you for your time and have a lovely year.
