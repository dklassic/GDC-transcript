Hello there. Do you like puzzle games? Yes? So do I. I'm Brett Taylor. I recently made

2
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:14,075
a game called Line Light, which did pretty well. I am here at this GDC to share my secrets

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,738
on puzzle design. So what makes a great puzzle game great?

4
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:22,659
In this talk, I'm going to unpack the different components of interactive puzzles.

5
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:29,624
So games like Sudoku, Braid, Threes, sort of anything that falls under the puzzle genre.

6
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:35,207
Give vocabulary to it so you can see and evaluate puzzles more clearly to equip you as a better designer.

7
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,909
Also go through the different lessons that I learned making LineLight.

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,110
There were a lot of lessons.

9
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:45,214
And give actionable takeaways, like a toolbox of strategies,

10
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,216
that you can use right away to begin designing better puzzles.

11
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:54,057
So join me this Wednesday, March 20th at 5pm for a train ride into Fun Town.

12
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:55,420
Next stop...

13
00:00:58,385 --> 00:00:58,846
Fun Town.
