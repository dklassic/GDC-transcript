1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,533
All right, everybody. Good morning and welcome. And before we get started, I just wanted to

2
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:15,516
ask everybody to please silence your cell phones or any noise making devices. And if

3
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:20,198
you could please just remember that after this to fill out the electronic speaker evaluation

4
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:24,161
forms, that would be killer. So thanks for coming down today. We appreciate it. I know

5
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:29,444
Friday morning is sort of a, it's a tough period for most people. We're really happy

6
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:30,945
that you guys could make it and we appreciate it.

7
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:35,349
And just to get things started, I'm Chris O'Neill, and I was a senior level designer

8
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,212
on God of War III, and I work at Santa Monica Studio.

9
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,273
And my name is Bruno Velasquez.

10
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,876
I'm the lead game animator at Sony Santa Monica Studios.

11
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:48,500
We're really honored to be able to do this presentation with you, our peers.

12
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:53,224
And I just want to say that even though there's only two of us up here, this was truly a team

13
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,987
effort, and, you know, we're just honored that we were able to represent our studio.

14
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:00,917
And we also wanted to thank GDC for approving this talk and letting us come up here and

15
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:01,597
share this with you.

16
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:06,260
So as the title suggests, this talk is about the Titans, and it deals with level design

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,003
in God of War III and creating the spectacle kind of landmark sequences that we had in

18
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:12,964
that game, which were the Titans, Cronus, and Gaia.

19
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:16,467
So using Cronus as a specific example, we're going to go through the entire development

20
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:20,529
process from the beginning to the end and really outline the tools and technology as

21
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,172
well as the philosophy that enabled us to kind of create the sequence in the game.

22
00:01:24,732 --> 00:01:28,593
from the beginning to the end and what our process is, how we achieve this stuff.

23
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:32,134
But before we do that, I wanted to just talk about a couple of things

24
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,714
and just dispel a couple of rumors or thoughts you might have about us.

25
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,916
Us being from Santa Monica studio, you guys probably think that we're obsessed with violence,

26
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:42,257
that we hate our fathers, that we hurt small animals,

27
00:01:42,997 --> 00:01:45,578
and that we engage in these lavish mass sex parties.

28
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,958
And I'm here to tell you that actually none of that is true.

29
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:51,468
The reality is we actually just don't hate our fathers.

30
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,069
So just to kind of give you a little bit of background

31
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:55,110
on who we are and what we're like.

32
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,450
So this kind of fills you in a little bit.

33
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,351
Yes, thank you for clearing that up, Chris.

34
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,951
Really appreciate it.

35
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,752
So to get things started, we just

36
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:04,232
want to kick it off by showing off this video that

37
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:07,593
highlights some of the moments in the Kronos Titan

38
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:08,714
sequence from God of War III.

39
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:11,374
For those of you who might have not played the game,

40
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:13,775
and also for those of you who have played the game,

41
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:16,496
just kind of serve as a little refresher.

42
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,457
So let's go ahead and get that playing.

43
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:11,254
So my only regret about that was that I wish it were epic.

44
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:18,497
So let's talk about kind of a high level on what this experience was and really kind of

45
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:22,719
nail that down. So it's worth mentioning that this was the biggest undertaking that as a

46
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,681
studio we had ever attempted to develop, not only literally but only for, not only literally

47
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:30,862
but also from an organizational standpoint. Just the manpower alone, the amount of time,

48
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:36,085
effort, resources dedicated to this was far and away unrivaled in our studio's history.

49
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:42,623
We had the nice distinction of being evaluated as the number one IGN boss battle, which was

50
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:45,805
interesting for us because this was never really intended to be a boss battle per se,

51
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:49,188
but nonetheless we were really happy that that was embraced in that fashion.

52
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,231
The next thing worth mentioning is this is kind of a million-dollar money shot.

53
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,354
And by that I mean it was just, this is a 25-minute sequence and, you know, the amount

54
00:04:57,374 --> 00:05:00,997
of time, energy and money invested in this in order to deliver on something that's really

55
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:04,700
about one twentieth of our game is pretty extreme considering.

56
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:16,088
The other thing worth mentioning is this is a five core team developed kind of process.

57
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,630
And what I mean by that is it consisted of me as the level designer,

58
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,792
consisted as an animator, Jason Hall.

59
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,374
It consisted of a combat designer, Adam Poole.

60
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:28,358
It consisted of, let's see, Tyler Breon, the character artist,

61
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,119
and Gary Kavanaugh, the technical artist.

62
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,801
And three of us were dedicated to this full time from the beginning to the end.

63
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:39,523
Also, even though we had five core team members, the total amount of people that were involved

64
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:43,886
at the end were 35, which is about a third of our studio at the time.

65
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:52,130
The animations required for this character were approximately 420, which were more than

66
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,371
any other character that we've done except for Kratos himself.

67
00:05:55,749 --> 00:06:00,193
Also, the joint of the counts of joints for the character was like 500.

68
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:05,819
He was comprised, this mesh was also extremely complex.

69
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,720
He had 160K triangles and about 18 million polygons.

70
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:17,021
The average time, as Chris mentioned before, was approximately only 25 minutes out of a

71
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,661
10-hour game.

72
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:23,604
So it was really just a, you know, it was a huge undertaking, but it really was, as

73
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:28,827
a whole, the amount of playing time wasn't as big as the entirety of the game.

74
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:32,930
Also the character, this was the biggest character we've ever done.

75
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,931
He was approximately 500 meters tall.

76
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:37,873
So we've never really done anything with that scale before.

77
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:43,618
So let's really talk about the kind of inspiration for this and where these ideas come from.

78
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:46,960
And you know, Albert Einstein said that creativity is knowing how well to hide your sources and,

79
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,441
you know, game development is certainly no different. You know, oftentimes things are

80
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:54,803
borrowed from other projects. And at the beginning of development of God of War II, the God of

81
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:59,264
War II director, Cory Barlog, had a vision to create God of War's version of the Shadow

82
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:02,826
of the Colossus, which is another interesting Sony game that came out several years ago.

83
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:07,032
And that kind of set the precedent moving into the third one, how you're going to start that.

84
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:12,420
If you watch the end of God of War II, you know that it ends on the back of the Titan guy on this big cliffhanger moment,

85
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,024
which later gets picked up at the beginning of God of War III.

86
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:19,310
And so, you know, that kind of taking that idea and figuring out, well, you know...

87
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:22,014
and sharing with you guys, well, how do we actually achieve those moments?

88
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:26,902
What is our process for, as a studio, for embracing doing these kind of high-impact games

89
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:32,731
that, you know, really can be kind of these insane spectacles and ultimately very challenging?

90
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:32,911
So...

91
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:37,807
The Santa Monica Studio development philosophy is essentially that we always start our games

92
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:40,668
with a bang. That's number one. It's that we really want to grab the player from the

93
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,790
very beginning by the throat, almost literally, and say, this is what we're going to be showing

94
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,611
you for the rest of the game. Here's how we're going to start it. You know, there's no cool

95
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:51,052
up. You know, we don't, there's no cinematics really. You know, there might be a little

96
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:54,113
one, but it's just right into the gameplay. You know, it's just boom, you're in it. And

97
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:56,854
if you look at God of War I through III, it's always the case.

98
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:02,855
And we feel as a studio that we have much more of a chance of doing something exciting

99
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:08,219
and something that the fans will appreciate if we think huge and really are kind of unrestricted

100
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,463
about what we're going to try to do on a level as far as feasibility and what's achievable.

101
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:15,445
And we're just going to go balls to the wall and figure out what's possible.

102
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:18,947
And then we feel that after that we can wrangle it in and we can condense it down from that

103
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:22,490
rather than starting small with what's manageable and expanding outward, which we don't feel

104
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,351
works very well for us.

105
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:28,201
The other thing worth mentioning is that we playtest a lot, and I can't emphasize that

106
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:28,501
enough.

107
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:33,966
There's no secret that these games are released and they have high review scores, at least

108
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:34,666
in our experience.

109
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:39,030
It's because we playtest our game probably 12 times externally during the development

110
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,412
process, which can range from anywhere from two to three years.

111
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:45,744
And internally, on any given level or boss fight,

112
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:48,766
we probably playtest it between 40 to 50 times, sometimes more,

113
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,369
per level or boss fight, depending

114
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,610
on what stage of development it's in.

115
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,331
So you can see that there's a lot of eyes on this.

116
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,173
We don't develop things in a vacuum.

117
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:59,395
And the next thing worth mentioning that ties into that

118
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:01,597
is that my belief and my experience working

119
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:02,938
at the studio and learning from this team

120
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,801
is that great games are really made one piece at a time.

121
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:11,102
If you have an intro that's rated a 9 or a 10, and then you have a puzzle after that

122
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:15,225
that's a 9 or a 10, and then you have a boss fight that's a 9 or a 10, you have a game

123
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:16,526
that's a 9 or a 10 all the way through.

124
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:21,629
That's very obvious, but it was something that became new to me, seeing that in practice

125
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:22,610
at Santa Monica Studio.

126
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:27,930
One thing that I'm grateful about our studio is that there's a commitment to quality all

127
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,711
the way from the top.

128
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:34,522
So management really gives us free reign to be creative and to push ourselves and try

129
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,326
to make the best game possible.

130
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:43,595
Also, we've had some great directors on the God of War series, Dave Jaffe, Cory Barlog,

131
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,877
Stig Asmussen, and they've been the gatekeepers.

132
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:49,418
Every decision is made through them.

133
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:54,661
Everything from marketing pieces, everything to the music, they really, really, really

134
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,142
have a grand vision for the game.

135
00:09:57,202 --> 00:10:01,884
And that actually really helps us to get things done because we don't have to make decisions

136
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:05,766
necessarily through a committee or through a publisher or anything like that.

137
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:12,425
You know, although we do provide a lot of feedback as a team to come up with ideas,

138
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:16,409
but in the end we have that one person that really makes the hard decisions.

139
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:21,829
Also, our studio is good because we specialize.

140
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,911
Like Chris mentioned before, we have a combat designer that

141
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:31,133
focuses only on making sure the AI feels good, making sure

142
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,013
that Kratos feels responsive, feels great.

143
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:36,134
We have level designers that focuses only on levels and the

144
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:37,955
moment-to-moment events that happen in the levels.

145
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,516
We have people that just focus on the character modeling,

146
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:42,877
environment modeling.

147
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:48,881
So it's very very specialized and I think that helps us to to really focus on on the things that are

148
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,163
That we really want to push and really sell and it's a good way of

149
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:54,825
Approach a scene like like the Titan

150
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:59,308
Also, we don't like to play it safe. You know we try to

151
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:03,430
Kind of go for something that we're not really sure if you're gonna be able to pull off

152
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:08,614
So then by the time that we finish it we hopefully still have something that that was pretty grand

153
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:15,569
So at the beginning of God of War 3, the God of War 3 director, Stig Asmussen, he set forth

154
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,133
to establish the vision with the team and really to figure out not only where the game

155
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:24,577
will take place and what are the locations and the grand moments, but also leveraging

156
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:30,282
the previous moments from God of War 2 and really trying to create those within God of

157
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:32,264
War 3 and the Titan moments specifically.

158
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:36,267
So let's just talk quickly about establishing a vision for our games.

159
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:36,788
What does that mean?

160
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:42,419
When we set out to create our games, generally the entire studio will spend a month or so

161
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,904
coming up with ideas, submitting ideas to the director regarding locations.

162
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:50,989
And so our locations can be anything from ideas like, I want to go to the future, I

163
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:55,734
want to go to Egypt, let's do something in the Stone Age, whatever, it doesn't really

164
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:55,975
matter.

165
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:59,038
But if you look at God of War 3, our key locations in that game were

166
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,854
were Olympus, were, let's see, Hades,

167
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:05,575
and the caverns in the labyrinth

168
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:06,717
were kind of the key locations.

169
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:08,799
And so it really gives you kind of the diversity

170
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:11,042
of not only the visual landscapes

171
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:11,923
that you're gonna be traveling,

172
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:13,264
but it just gives you good pacing

173
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:14,566
and to understand the tone of your game.

174
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,990
The next thing we really focus on is defining what our epic set pieces are.

175
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:21,012
And that's very important for us.

176
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,313
Because if you look at God of War, throughout the game,

177
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,595
there are many iconic locations that you'll

178
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:27,976
visit frequently throughout your experience playing

179
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:28,457
through the game.

180
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:31,379
And in God of War II, another senior level designer

181
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,280
that works at our studio, Jonathan Hawkins,

182
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,783
he had, using this image, came up with an idea from the movie Cube

183
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:40,445
to create a sequence in our game, which ended up being the labyrinth.

184
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:43,847
So that's another idea, as well, is to establish those set pieces.

185
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,187
And then lastly, we really work on establishing,

186
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:48,108
what are our wow moments?

187
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,649
What are the things that are really gonna anchor

188
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:52,172
and brand the player in their brain and kind of.

189
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,809
The things that they're going to remember, you know, two years from now, a month from

190
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:59,311
now, ten years from now, are those things that, you know, really cemented in their mind.

191
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:00,592
And we think about those three things.

192
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:04,594
And that's the kind of holistic approach that we take in order to establish what our game

193
00:13:04,654 --> 00:13:04,734
is.

194
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:06,494
We don't define our game by story.

195
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:07,935
We don't define our game not by story.

196
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:11,637
But we generally define our game in terms of what do we want to do, what is the most

197
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:15,079
compelling thing in terms of locations, set pieces or wow moments.

198
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:18,420
And the director will distill these ideas down and filter them through him.

199
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,081
And he'll ultimately make the final decisions.

200
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:26,975
So part of establishing that early vision also is the previous, you know, getting the

201
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:32,639
art team and the concept art team to start developing some inspirational pieces of the

202
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:34,440
scenes that we want to go for.

203
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,964
So this particular one here is showing off the chronosequence and Kratos, you know, running

204
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:44,607
around on his arm, kind of setting the tone, setting the scale, and it's really, really

205
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:49,710
a good platform for us to jump off and start exploring about how we're going to actually

206
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,371
get this done.

207
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:56,387
Next thing also is doing a lot of storyboarding, especially in the more complex sequences.

208
00:13:57,008 --> 00:14:01,711
This is just a really cheap way for us to get something down with the director and start

209
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:05,434
flushing out some ideas of what perhaps the sequence could entail.

210
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,296
So it's very important for us to do this sort of stuff.

211
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:10,638
The next thing we want to share with you is this video.

212
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:13,399
This is a pretty cool previous video that we did.

213
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,120
We took God of War II assets.

214
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,482
We actually grabbed the Cyclops and we just scaled them up.

215
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:22,343
And we start parenting all these environments on them.

216
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:25,765
And it was just really just an early way for us to start

217
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:28,406
kind of wrapping our heads around how we were going to do,

218
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,988
what sort of things were going to occur on the Titans.

219
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:33,569
And at this point, we didn't have any tech.

220
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,270
or anything at all. All we had was old assets.

221
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,073
So we just started putting things together to get things rolling.

222
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:44,995
What's great about that is that you can really prototype something very cheaply

223
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:49,238
without having to build any art or tech or anything really other than things you already have.

224
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:53,200
It's a huge saving grace for us because you can sell that idea immediately to the team and to yourself.

225
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:56,439
So let's quickly talk about the brainstorming process.

226
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,600
There's a lot of different philosophies, and a lot of

227
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,961
different people in studios have different ways of doing

228
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:03,502
it. The way we do it at Santa Monica Studio seems to be

229
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:04,142
effective for us.

230
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:06,183
So I thought I would just touch on that really quickly.

231
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:08,704
Generally, when we kick off a brainstorm, the director will

232
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:11,465
come into a meeting with the design team, and he'll submit

233
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:14,266
a photo, usually, or a high concept.

234
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,587
And in this case, the photo would have been something

235
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,648
previously that we had shown, which is that high concept

236
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,989
division for Khronos.

237
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:22,730
And so the team is essentially tasked at that point with

238
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,232
with three criteria that they need to define as a group.

239
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:28,314
And so one is getting on it.

240
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:29,895
How do you get on it? What do you do?

241
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:31,577
Do you fly a plane and do it?

242
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:34,219
I mean, do you, you know, do you go to a Chuck E. Cheese

243
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,940
and then, like, he picks up the Chuck E. Cheese and swallows it?

244
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,362
Like, whatever. Like, how do you get on it?

245
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:38,463
What do you do there?

246
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:42,026
Like, what is the thing that you're doing when you're on the creature?

247
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:43,006
That's very important as well.

248
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,508
And then lastly, how do you get off?

249
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,829
Do you kill it? Do you drown it?

250
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:47,450
I mean, is he your buddy?

251
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,111
Like, what happens? Do you guys go to McDonald's?

252
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:49,612
I mean, I don't know.

253
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:52,094
So you just kind of have to figure those three things out.

254
00:15:52,824 --> 00:16:09,280
And then the third thing is that the team will break into groups, or individually rather, for 30 minutes, at which point, you know, we'll go read Wikipedia or try to come up with different concepts and jog our brain with ideas and we'll basically write all those down within the criteria framework and we'll bring them back and we'll regroup and we'll put it on the board.

255
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,143
And that's a pretty gnarly process and it takes a lot of time, but it's very valuable because you get.

256
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:17,951
a lot of ideas and it's a huge smattering of different ideas and then at which point

257
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:21,374
the director and the leads will take that list and they'll evaluate that privately and

258
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:24,516
they'll figure out, you know, what are their favorite three within that list and that group

259
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:29,280
of maybe six to eight people will get together and they'll ask his popularity, which actually

260
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,843
is totally a typo, but I just left it in there because I thought it was kind of funny. And

261
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:38,588
designer spelling, you know, we're super good at it. And at which point then we'll figure

262
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:40,970
out and assess the popularity of it and, you know,

263
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:46,110
it'll probably get distilled down to a few, at which point the director will make the

264
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,053
ultimate decision on which ones he wants to put in the game. So it's a very democratic

265
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,496
process that involves a lot of people, and we find it to be very effective in leveraging

266
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:58,020
the cohesive kind of team brain rather than the individual brain, which is one way of

267
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,302
doing it, but we find the strength in numbers is very important.

268
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:04,490
So you know a little bit about our philosophy, a little bit about establishing a vision in

269
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,350
our studio, and a little bit about the inspiration.

270
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:09,771
Let's talk about the research and development because this is not something that was very

271
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:10,572
easy for us to do.

272
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:13,593
We didn't have the technology that was in place in order to pull this off.

273
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,873
There was a lot of new things we needed.

274
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:23,195
So first and foremost, let's see if this is not cooperating.

275
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:23,716
So there we go.

276
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:31,158
Initially, we didn't have the ability to attach a character to a mesh and move the mesh around

277
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:32,479
and have the character respond.

278
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:37,400
So Fabrice Odero, one of our senior programmers, basically, who works on our navigational system,

279
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,302
he created a dynamic state transition system that would allow any AI or player character

280
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:47,563
that while moving, the environment around him would respond dynamically to that.

281
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:51,104
So that was a huge element in terms of selling the dynamism within that experience.

282
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:54,365
So when players are playing through it, they really feel like I'm on this creature.

283
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,585
I'm not just like standing on a...

284
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:57,033
a static object.

285
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:03,138
So next, this is our gray box man, which was the initial iteration of the Titan as soon

286
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:03,759
as it loads up.

287
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,045
Basically, it's a, it was just a quick way for us to get something, just start animating

288
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:15,329
something, start trying to figure out if this guy is going to be walking on two, on all

289
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,132
fours, what is he going to be doing in the environment, how is he going to be attacking

290
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,273
or interacting with Kratos.

291
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:26,176
But this way it was just something really cheap and dirty that we could do and the nice thing about this is that we were

292
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:28,457
able to get this guy into the game and

293
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:34,759
Start actually prototyping and getting craters to attach to him and climb on him in a very very economical way

294
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,920
the next thing is

295
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:43,543
you know, now that we had this gray box, man, we wanted to iterate and start fleshing out

296
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:47,065
what the character was going to look like. So this is the cinematic model from God of

297
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:51,347
War II. So we were able to strip that from the cinematics that were actually high rendered,

298
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:56,429
that were a separate model than the one that was actually used in the game. And we were

299
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:01,011
able to just quickly take that and start adapting it and start getting it into our new engine.

300
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:03,912
So that was a huge, huge savings of time for us.

301
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:03,972
So

302
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:05,893
Transcribed by https://otter.ai

303
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:09,881
you all know this, you know, you make games, you design levels, it's very obvious that

304
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:13,584
you, usually you're working in a static environment, like yeah, maybe your levels will change or

305
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:17,466
something a little bit, but generally it's a static medium. And the big challenge for

306
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:21,389
us was that, you know, we built this on a real creature, this isn't faked, so how do

307
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,852
we do that? That was the initial super challenge for us to achieve was...

308
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:29,675
actually getting all of our in-game kind of scripting logic and our in-game entity system

309
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:35,598
that controls our cameras, our level scripting, our sound and everything to actually exist

310
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:40,040
on the player. There was no way that we could do this without having a system created that

311
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,742
would allow us to attach it to the creature. So Matt Arrington, one of our senior tools

312
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:48,284
programmers, basically built us a system along with our tech art department that enabled

313
00:19:48,324 --> 00:19:52,286
us to attach specific, any game object that we wanted within Maya.

314
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,730
to specific joints that were defined on the creature.

315
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,954
And so as you can see here, you have, you know,

316
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,677
everything in red is kind of designer entities in scripting,

317
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:04,042
and everything in green is for the camera team,

318
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:05,503
and everything in blue is for sound.

319
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:07,907
And so that as the character moves around like this...

320
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:12,981
those objects from the T-pose would also match the mesh and the position that he moved in.

321
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:17,525
So this is a hugely important part in actually selling this experience because if we couldn't

322
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:21,068
have all of the actual information within the game following the character, there was

323
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:23,030
no way we could achieve this without it being as cinematic.

324
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:27,374
And so I'm sure you're wondering, well, okay, that's all well and good when you're in a

325
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,616
T-pose, but unfortunately the game isn't played like this because if it were, it would be

326
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:31,117
pretty bad.

327
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:35,200
So what we ended up having to figure out was, well, what happens when the character is moving?

328
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,881
So if the character...

329
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:38,192
you know, is in an animation, then what do we do?

330
00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:40,133
And the big problem with that was that, you know,

331
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:42,915
immediately going from this to going to this or anything,

332
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:45,396
all those game objects that you had at a specific kind

333
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,178
of orientation within Maya would just shoot all across the level

334
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:51,560
and it became super nightmarish for us to try to build this way.

335
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,681
And so what we ended up having to do was to basically

336
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:53,601
to create a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

337
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:54,582
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

338
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:55,542
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

339
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:59,164
preview animation system that TechArk created for us, which allowed us to play animations

340
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:04,027
and to see where those specific game objects would exist within the creature itself.

341
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,909
And this is, I can't even emphasize how annoying this process was in the long run.

342
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,591
It was the only way we could do it, but it just takes forever because for all 400 animations

343
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:15,954
that you have, you have to check that each specific object that you need is in the exact

344
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:16,674
right location.

345
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,162
at any point in the animation timeline.

346
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,483
And it just is, you can imagine how much of a nightmare that is.

347
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:24,204
And this thing, there's no secret this thing took, you know,

348
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:25,404
several years to develop.

349
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,085
So that kind of gives you an idea of kind of how we achieve that.

350
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:29,746
And the most important thing is that, you know,

351
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:31,747
really emphasizing in this video is

352
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,487
that we could not have actually done this sequence

353
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:34,508
without this technology.

354
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:39,726
And the next thing that we had to do was to create a new collision system.

355
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:43,468
And so Vassily Filippov, our lead programmer,

356
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:45,829
and Jim Thielander, a senior programmer on our team,

357
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,531
essentially created us a system that enabled us to put collision

358
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,512
on a meshed character,

359
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:54,694
on something that wasn't kind of a primitive geometry.

360
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,776
And as you can see here, we kind of have the arm of Kronos,

361
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:02,898
and the green is the run, and the red is kind of like a no-slip stuff.

362
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:07,940
And the important thing about that is that we had gone from a studio that could basically

363
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,024
move around primitive shapes that we called CD halls that could be animated, but they

364
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:17,067
couldn't be very dynamic or very, or really stray too much and have too many polygons,

365
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,630
to a system that enabled us to animate a mesh in the same way we would animate a creature

366
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:23,432
and to attach collision to it.

367
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:25,233
So as you can see here.

368
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:29,164
Here's Cronos as his actual, like, whatever million,

369
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,847
50 million or whatever polygon, I don't even know,

370
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,028
it's out of control.

371
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:35,990
But we could never put collision on a creature like that

372
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,912
because the amount of just, you know,

373
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:39,834
faces on a creature is just, it's too crazy.

374
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:41,696
So there was no way to do it in that fashion.

375
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:44,378
So this mesh was actually just a visual component.

376
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:46,020
There was really no collision attached to him.

377
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:51,765
What we ended up doing was, in the same way you'd have like armor pieces, we had specific

378
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:56,867
instance versions of collision by region that we would turn on and off throughout, you know,

379
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:57,347
the sequence.

380
00:22:57,387 --> 00:23:01,009
We would define it by hand, by stomach, by arm, and it was the only way we could do it

381
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:04,411
without crippling the power of the PlayStation because if you put collision on a character

382
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,631
that big, it's just not going to run.

383
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:09,513
So this is the way we were able to achieve it, and it was definitely a new system for

384
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:09,653
us.

385
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:16,107
So this video showcases a combination of like the three months of research and development

386
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:16,568
that we did.

387
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:21,570
Now we had, you know, an actual model in an environment.

388
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,391
We had Kratos fighting enemies.

389
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,833
He wasn't completely falling off.

390
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:27,013
He was able to nab on him.

391
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:29,275
And we had some kind of rough animation blocked in.

392
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:34,729
Alright, so we've talked about all that stuff, the tools, the technology, the philosophy, etc.

393
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,990
And now how do we sell it? This is an important thing.

394
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,751
From the very beginning, the mandate was, well,

395
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:42,613
we can't just create this kind of like magnificent, like, idiot robot.

396
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:45,274
Like, this needs to be legit. This needs to be like an actual creature

397
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:47,135
that you feel you're having an interaction with.

398
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:49,316
That emotes, that lives, that breathes, you know.

399
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:52,338
This can't be, you know, we can't spend two years developing something

400
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:53,518
and just have it be overseas.

401
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,579
We really need to focus on how we sell this experience.

402
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,103
So the first mandate that Sig gave me specifically,

403
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:00,985
he was our game director in God of War III,

404
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,606
was this thing needs to be alive.

405
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:03,627
We have to bring it to life.

406
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:05,449
If it doesn't feel alive, we're totally screwed.

407
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,670
So how do we achieve that?

408
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,731
How do we bring this thing to life?

409
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:09,553
And the first thing we really tried to create

410
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,554
was the emotional buildup.

411
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:13,280
So if you play through this experience, you know, from the beginning,

412
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,961
Cronus is rather, you know, amused with Kratos.

413
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,803
He's kind of holding him on his thumb, laughing at his grandson,

414
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:21,704
and he's basically like, oh, whatever, you know, you're a flea to me.

415
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:22,425
I don't care about you.

416
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:23,946
You know, you blind him.

417
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:24,666
He gets irritated.

418
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:25,487
You land on his hand.

419
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,267
You break a sword.

420
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:27,668
Now he's like, he's kind of pissed off.

421
00:24:28,228 --> 00:24:30,149
And then you proceed forward, rip his fingernail off.

422
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:30,970
Now he's furious.

423
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,110
He's, you know, he's angry.

424
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,571
He's like, what, you know, what are you doing?

425
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:34,712
You're like, rip my fingernail off?

426
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:35,612
I got to kill you now.

427
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:39,114
And so he goes through this kind of dramatic kind of character arc,

428
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,355
and through that process.

429
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:44,799
You know, he ultimately is defeated and he goes through these kind of agonized stages

430
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,821
where he's becoming progressively more and more disturbed and defeated.

431
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:51,583
And so you really wanted to try to achieve that in telling that story for the character.

432
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,425
Next thing was we had to really keep this believable.

433
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:58,887
You know, yes, it's Greek mythology, yes, it's fantasy, but we came at it from the perspective

434
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:00,448
of how would a man kill the giant?

435
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:03,830
And we felt that if we could anchor it in that context, then it would feel more interesting

436
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:06,612
and more believable for the player in the context of God of War.

437
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,413
So that was very key to us as well.

438
00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:13,525
The next thing is dynamicism, which actually isn't really a word, but it's just kind of

439
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:17,707
something we throw around at Sony Santa Monica, and it's just really is the dynamism aspect.

440
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:22,409
Making sure that we have those moments where the character throws his arm out and grunts

441
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,911
are falling off and falling into the abyss, or rocks are falling, and that the character

442
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:28,192
is moving and you're changing states.

443
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:30,333
You really had to bring that and we really had to sell that.

444
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,965
So the animation early on, when we pitched this idea,

445
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:38,791
we knew that it was going to be critical to sell the emotion

446
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,293
and to sell the progression of the battle.

447
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:43,978
And as well as dealing with an actual moving level,

448
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:45,821
we hadn't really done that before.

449
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:51,017
The visual effects were also going to be a critical part, you know, all the sequences

450
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:56,042
which Kratos interacts with them and begins to slowly kill him or do damage to him, we

451
00:25:56,062 --> 00:26:01,107
knew that the visual effects had to be spot on and had to really complement the animation

452
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:04,370
as well as the sound effects and the VO.

453
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:10,256
You know, it was important for us to have this sort of dialogue in place so that he

454
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,138
could kind of have a back and forth with Kratos.

455
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:17,004
So it wasn't just, you know, some soulless creature that didn't have any feelings or

456
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:17,384
emotions.

457
00:26:17,424 --> 00:26:18,345
We really want to make sure.

458
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:22,369
So that's why it was important for us to fit as much dialogue as possible throughout the

459
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:22,790
sequence.

460
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:27,415
So here we have Kratos, you know.

461
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:30,234
Men love him, women want to be him, whatever.

462
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:33,336
And he's seven feet tall, roughly, on average.

463
00:26:33,396 --> 00:26:36,978
Then we have Hades, who's about 20, 25 feet tall.

464
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:40,421
Then we have the Colossus, who is, I can't read that,

465
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:41,322
but he's pretty big.

466
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:44,124
And this is actually the real reference size

467
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:45,165
of how this would be in the real world.

468
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:46,385
You have the Empire State Building now

469
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:47,266
next to the Colossus.

470
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,948
And then finally you have Cronos,

471
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,709
who comes in at about 1600 feet tall.

472
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,751
And so you can see the actual kind of scale

473
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:56,153
that we're dealing with here on a character such as this.

474
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:02,059
So we knew, of course, that the scale was going to be critical to really sell this, to make this really grand.

475
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:11,667
But in order for us to do that, we also wanted to make him a real character, not just a set of pieces like one arm here and one head there.

476
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,508
We really want to build a whole character.

477
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:17,228
And this really, really, really was challenging,

478
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,389
but it was actually in the end, it was a big payoff.

479
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,990
We also needed to have moments of relative scale.

480
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,710
You know, that's why we had enemies running on Kronos

481
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,631
and Kratos interacting with other enemies other than him.

482
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:32,632
We also had to display moments

483
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:34,092
where we could show Pandora's Temple

484
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:35,333
that was strapped to Kronos' back.

485
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:41,097
which got a war probably like I think around 70% of the game took place on the back of

486
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:41,958
Kronos.

487
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:46,681
So we wanted to make sure that we included those moments as well as the moments where

488
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:51,345
you could see Kronos place his hand on the side of the mountain and kind of show a couple

489
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:54,787
shots of the ground to really, really sell that relative scale.

490
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,670
The camera work was also very critical.

491
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,832
We had to make sure that we had, you know, dynamic up shots, down shots.

492
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,895
And then that's another reason why we wanted to have a real character in an environment

493
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,658
because there was many, many points where we needed to really remind the player that they

494
00:28:11,698 --> 00:28:15,480
were on top of this giant character and the director would say, pull the camera back,

495
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,261
you know, way back.

496
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:19,542
And if we didn't have the real character, we would have ran into a lot of problems.

497
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:24,045
So by having this guy really be in an environment really saved us.

498
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,153
Also, we wanted to keep it all real time.

499
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:31,477
So we really reduced the amount of cut scenes

500
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:34,079
that we had during the sequence and the amount of cuts.

501
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,703
It was one consistent camera from the very beginning

502
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:39,525
to the end, with the exception of maybe

503
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,767
when he swallows you and you go down his throat.

504
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,929
That was probably the only time that we really cut.

505
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,711
But other than that, it was sort of like a seamless thing.

506
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:53,155
We kind of, you know, were inspired by like scenes from movies like the opening of Boogie Nights,

507
00:28:53,195 --> 00:28:57,438
where it's just one constant shot going through one scene, of course, without all the cocaine.

508
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:00,220
But, you know, we really wanted to sell that.

509
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:05,554
And of course, like I mentioned before, the animation was critical to sell the scale.

510
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:11,102
We needed to make sure that this guy felt heavy, that he felt grand and slow.

511
00:29:11,222 --> 00:29:14,988
So it was a special challenge for our animation team to really pull it off.

512
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,469
did a great job in emphasizing kind of the sense of scale and how we achieved that. But

513
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,850
let's talk about the design decisions that were intentionally made from the very beginning.

514
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,831
And the first thing that we made, you know, very clear as a team was that establishing

515
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:30,311
this was an experience and not a traditional boss fight. You know, God of War has a lot

516
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:33,372
of great boss fights. You know, if you look at Hades, that was a really cool one. Or if

517
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:37,113
you look at the Hydra in the beginning, you know, we have traditional boss fights that

518
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:40,494
are stage-based encounters where, you know, you fight a guy who's roughly your size at

519
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:43,754
this stage and you do damage and you move to the next stage. And you're engaged in kind

520
00:29:43,774 --> 00:29:44,595
of a natural combat.

521
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:47,220
and a natural kind of, you know, narrative in fighting.

522
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,402
And in this, we were not emphasizing that.

523
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:50,603
You really wanted to sell the experience,

524
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,563
not so much a boss fight.

525
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:54,506
The next thing is, you know, that as designers,

526
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,907
we're always trying, and level designers as well,

527
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,888
we're always trying to show the goal whenever we, you know,

528
00:29:58,449 --> 00:29:59,950
you know, to the player whenever we're creating

529
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,510
our environments.

530
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:02,492
We always want to, you know, dangle that carrot

531
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:03,212
in front of their face.

532
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:04,914
And this is certainly no exception.

533
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:06,815
And, you know, when we were play testing it,

534
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,336
we would ask people, what do you think the goal is?

535
00:30:08,396 --> 00:30:08,777
And, you know.

536
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,364
overwhelmingly the response was, it's his head, you know, it's his head, you see his

537
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:16,366
head and that's where I'm supposed to go, which was actually our intention, but we were

538
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:20,448
surprised people intuitively knew that. And the other thing we really wanted to establish

539
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:24,350
was that in addition to having the, you know, the large goal, you need to have those intermediate

540
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,753
goals as well. So, if that's moving from, you know, the wrist up to the forearm, you

541
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:33,676
know, and then, you know, destroying his fingertip and showing those goals all along the way

542
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:36,597
and, you know, presenting them every few minutes is very important for us.

543
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:42,495
And in doing that, and in having those kind of intermediate goals and long-term goals,

544
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:46,298
we really feel it's very important to reward the player for everything that we ask them

545
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:46,618
to do.

546
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:52,543
And as you move up, eventually, to his belly and go through this whole sequence where you're

547
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:56,746
fighting a cyclops on his shoulder, you're rewarded with being able to be swallowed by

548
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:59,628
him and go down into his stomach and then break out of his stomach.

549
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:02,050
Every five minutes, the player is experiencing something cool.

550
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,135
And I really call God of War a bro on the couch game,

551
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:07,537
because I feel that every five minutes,

552
00:31:07,938 --> 00:31:09,280
somebody watching you play is gonna see

553
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,021
something interesting.

554
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,784
Whether it's ripping the eye out of a Cyclops,

555
00:31:12,864 --> 00:31:15,388
or if it's fighting a Titan, or whatever it is,

556
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:16,590
every five minutes you really try

557
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,991
to give someone a big payoff.

558
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:22,275
And the next thing, obviously, is comfortable pacing.

559
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:23,956
Yes, this is a high-impact sequence.

560
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:26,538
And yes, it's very tense, seemingly.

561
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:28,759
But we couldn't expect the players

562
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,101
to be stressed out for 25 minutes, constantly dying,

563
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:32,402
constantly frustrated.

564
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:35,303
We had to create the sense of danger at all times

565
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:37,505
with picking and choosing very specifically when

566
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:40,827
we were going to actually have it be tense and hazardous.

567
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,330
And then lastly, plausibility.

568
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,312
And we just really need to have this whole situation make

569
00:31:48,352 --> 00:31:48,592
sense.

570
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,472
There were no laser beams.

571
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:54,478
We weren't going to ride a magical unicorn and strangle him

572
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:55,600
with an invisible lasso.

573
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,822
We couldn't do anything like that.

574
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:57,843
We had to have it make sense.

575
00:31:58,565 --> 00:31:59,446
Is this justifiable?

576
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:02,211
Could a man kill a creature of this size?

577
00:32:03,872 --> 00:32:06,634
Okay, so we had our research and development.

578
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:08,795
We've roughed up, you know, some stuff.

579
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:11,497
We kind of had the layout of what the events were going

580
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:11,897
to happen.

581
00:32:11,937 --> 00:32:12,958
We knew what the goals were.

582
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,820
Now it was time to actually start executing it,

583
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,621
executing the sequence.

584
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:22,484
And of course, Kronos was going to be the star of the show.

585
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:26,307
So we needed to focus on him, make him really,

586
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,027
really detailed.

587
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:29,368
And one of the biggest challenges was for...

588
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:33,640
the modeler Tyler Breon, the character artist that worked on Kronos.

589
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,625
That usually we have character artists focused just on the characters and we have environment

590
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:40,746
artists just do the environments.

591
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:44,790
But this was a unique case because we had to tell Tyler, guess what?

592
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,473
You're now promoted to environment artist as well as a character artist.

593
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:52,737
Because at first we were going to have two different people work on this character, one

594
00:32:52,757 --> 00:32:54,078
for environments, one for character.

595
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:58,080
separately, but we found out that that just wasn't going to work out because it's like

596
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,562
having two people work on the same thing at the same time. It was really challenging.

597
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:05,324
So I think it worked out for us to actually have the character artist kind of take over

598
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:06,545
that responsibility as well.

599
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:10,807
And the next thing that was super important to touch on is that, you know, generally in

600
00:33:11,327 --> 00:33:15,510
a level design process at our studio, you know, the designers will work on kind of the

601
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,392
levels in isolation from the artists and we'll kind of build things in Maya and essentially

602
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:22,033
construct our spaces how we want and iterate on them.

603
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,292
Unfortunately, in this case, we didn't have that luxury because we had to create this

604
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:29,234
in tandem with the actual physical model itself.

605
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:33,017
And so, you know, when you're on top of the hand as you can, or under the hand rather

606
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:36,219
when you're, as you can see in this photo, and Kratos is kind of climbing along that

607
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:36,619
path.

608
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,822
And the thing that was very challenging was that, you know, in that ceiling climb state,

609
00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:45,265
the creature, you know, would move his hand, animate it slightly and then he would fall

610
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:47,767
and there wasn't enough fidelity actually carved into the mesh.

611
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,215
that enabled us to have kind of clean navigational transitions

612
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:51,756
through the mesh.

613
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:54,760
So what ended up happening was, in order

614
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,244
for us to get that cut properly.

615
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:01,634
It was pretty much a nightmarish process where I had to take screenshots and as you can see

616
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:05,757
here kind of draw in and say, I need more fidelity here, cut here, cut here, cut here.

617
00:34:06,238 --> 00:34:09,540
And then the character artist, Tyler, would spend, you know, an afternoon doing that and

618
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,363
then he would hand that off to our technical artist who would then re-skin the whole thing.

619
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:15,104
And that process took about two to three days.

620
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:19,488
So you can imagine just, you know, just assembling that, just the back and forth in that pipeline

621
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:20,489
was just super arduous.

622
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:22,730
But it was the only way that we really could do it at the time.

623
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,172
So it was definitely worth noting but super frustrating.

624
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:30,136
So we're just going to talk a little bit about sort of the challenges that we're facing in

625
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:30,816
each department.

626
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:36,041
And as Chris mentioned, you know, TechGuard had to continuously update this character.

627
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:42,227
And one of the things that we added to Khronos, after the E3 demo was well received, there

628
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:47,212
was a sequence there where the centaur got de-gutted by Kratos and, you know, you would

629
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:48,293
see his entrails come out.

630
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,675
So, the director was really happy with that and he's like, okay, we got to do that in

631
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:53,575
a much grander scale.

632
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:54,676
We got to put that in Kronos.

633
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:59,657
So, we had to kind of transfer this super tech that we had developed from a very small

634
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:04,219
character into this really gigantic scale and that was really, really complicated.

635
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:11,041
Also, we had, as I mentioned before, a massive joint count, not that kind of joint.

636
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:17,660
But, you know, we had 500 joints that we had to deal with.

637
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,741
So we had full facial animation on the character.

638
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:22,242
We had full fingers, everything that was required

639
00:35:22,282 --> 00:35:23,823
to really bring him to life.

640
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:26,805
And every time that, as Chris mentioned before,

641
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:29,746
they had to change the path of where Kratos was going

642
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:32,447
to be running, they had to re-skin it every time.

643
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:34,829
Eventually, we developed a system where, you know,

644
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:37,610
we could transfer the skinning a lot easier.

645
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,571
But early on in the beginning, it was not that way.

646
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:42,452
It was definitely, definitely challenging.

647
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:47,506
And for animation, we have never really done something like this.

648
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:53,830
Usually we animate a character that interacts in the environment, but we never had a character

649
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,171
that was the environment.

650
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:59,573
So we had to definitely figure out how we're going to pull this off.

651
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:05,317
Because of that we had to deal with stability issues versus aesthetic issues

652
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:11,202
And what I mean by that is that of course we want to make this guy feel alive like like he's really there

653
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:18,787
And not not just some animatronic character, but at the same time we had to keep in mind the gameplay

654
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,993
So we couldn't just have him flail around and move like crazy because you know things could you know credits could fall off things could

655
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:26,613
Could break

656
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:29,835
you know, and that wouldn't have worked out.

657
00:36:29,895 --> 00:36:32,958
So we had to constantly balance that with the sign.

658
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:34,859
All right, does the character feel alive? Yes.

659
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:38,661
Is he moving? Is he not moving too much?

660
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:40,923
Just enough so that the gameplay is stable? Yes.

661
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,365
And then we were able to achieve that in the end.

662
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:49,800
Also, the animation resolution, because the character was so large, the further you got

663
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:54,902
out to his extremities, like fingertips, the animation would start, like, you know, shaking

664
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:57,403
and it would just start becoming unstable.

665
00:36:57,443 --> 00:37:02,946
So we had to deal with that and we had to, you know, work with our tech art department

666
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:08,728
to find solutions for animation compression so that it would be able to work in the end.

667
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,428
So let's give it up for Keyboard Cat real fast.

668
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:14,671
And we love Keyboard Cat.

669
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:17,194
And so basically, the level design challenges

670
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:18,736
that we faced, at least for myself,

671
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:22,120
were that I went from basically working on maps and designing

672
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,541
levels and then handing them off to art

673
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:25,884
in a kind of traditional pipeline that's governed.

674
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:26,865
You hand it off.

675
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:28,504
you just assume it's going to get done.

676
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:30,427
We have producers that worry about that.

677
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:32,349
And yeah, you'll interface with the artist a little bit,

678
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:33,450
and he'll come ask you questions.

679
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,353
But this is very different.

680
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:38,597
In this instance, the level designer myself at the time

681
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:41,340
essentially became the nucleus of this effort insofar

682
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,082
as that my job kind of transitioned

683
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:45,185
into also half producer.

684
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:45,806
I was also.

685
00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:49,789
I was the only person who really knew everything that was going on with this creature amongst

686
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,672
a massive team that eventually was comprised of 35 people.

687
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:54,353
So no one else knows.

688
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:55,934
So we didn't have a producer on it.

689
00:37:55,974 --> 00:38:00,358
So half of your job is actually doing, the other half is just task management and figuring

690
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:03,200
out where everything is and who's working on what and when it's going to be ready.

691
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,721
So that was certainly a new challenge.

692
00:38:05,642 --> 00:38:08,724
The next thing was, I literally had to become one with the animator.

693
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:11,827
We might as well have just had our bodies sutured together.

694
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,713
he was my left hand and I was his right hand because I couldn't work without him and he

695
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:22,155
was basically moving my level around and without us being able to directly collaborate very

696
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:26,258
easily it was near impossible to do anything in a reasonable time frame. So we had to actually

697
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,401
end up sitting together just like side by side and essentially like step brothers you

698
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:34,643
know like we were bunk mates so it just became kind of weird but it was actually super necessary

699
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:34,963
in the end.

700
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,114
And then also working, like I said earlier,

701
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:40,356
with the new collision system was terribly daunting.

702
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:42,157
It had a lot of challenges associated with it

703
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,738
in terms of debugging it and making it work.

704
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,881
And then in reliance on other disciplines,

705
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:48,963
and like I said before, traditionally,

706
00:38:49,383 --> 00:38:51,565
designers at our studio can kind of work in isolation,

707
00:38:51,945 --> 00:38:53,867
but in this case, it was being very much tied

708
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:56,669
into the animation team, very much tied

709
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:59,271
into the tech art team and the character art team.

710
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:01,993
And I needed these guys in order to achieve

711
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:02,974
what we were trying to achieve.

712
00:39:03,014 --> 00:39:03,935
I couldn't do it by myself.

713
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:07,761
And then as far as camera design is concerned, you know,

714
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:09,843
obviously the moving foundation is a huge concern.

715
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:12,285
How do you camera a level when it's moving?

716
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:14,327
So we needed to kind of tackle that and figure that out.

717
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:17,410
And Mark Simon, our, you know, our lead camera designer

718
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,811
who did a great job on God of War III,

719
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:23,736
camera-ing this map, sorry, this character level, you know,

720
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:25,177
I think he nailed that pretty well.

721
00:39:26,312 --> 00:39:29,876
And then also, obviously, selling a ridiculous sense of scale was super challenging for us.

722
00:39:29,956 --> 00:39:34,842
And, you know, not being afraid to pull the camera in to show the detail, but also, like Bruno had said, being able to pull it out.

723
00:39:35,302 --> 00:39:37,285
So those are challenges that we face in new ways of designing.

724
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:41,780
So we've talked a lot about kind of where we came from, but let's talk about, you know,

725
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,901
what happened when we were actually getting it done.

726
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:48,303
So, you know, after the initial research and development phase and that prototype you guys

727
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:52,384
saw earlier, where we were into the development process was Nathan Gary was the level designer

728
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:56,566
on it at the time who had pioneered the technology and kind of taken it in its very early stage.

729
00:39:56,966 --> 00:40:01,348
And the goal now was to get it into a shell form, which is essentially to take it from

730
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:05,389
the very beginning all the way to the end with our big kind of spectacle moments mocked

731
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:05,609
in.

732
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:08,150
It gives us kind of a rough outline that you can play through.

733
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:09,752
It doesn't have the connective tissue.

734
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:14,278
It doesn't really have anything in it other than the kill,

735
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:16,401
and then all the intro, maybe five nodes

736
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:18,103
of what you do from the very beginning all the way through.

737
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:21,007
And it's basically just to get a starting outline,

738
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:22,569
a starting palette to work from within.

739
00:40:23,616 --> 00:40:27,157
But let's talk quickly about that, because it's very important for our level design kind of process.

740
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:32,199
We, like I mentioned, we use a process where we define shells for our levels.

741
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,780
And so as you can see here, this is the Hades shell from God of War 3.

742
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:41,602
And what shells enable us to do is to create a continuous mapping and progression of our worlds.

743
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:42,922
And this is the Hades world.

744
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,902
uh... and all the levels that are comprised in that world and how do they

745
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:47,043
physically fit together

746
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:48,625
uh... not only

747
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:52,809
obviously physically but also in terms of what is the pacing for each area you

748
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:52,969
know

749
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:56,532
we need to have a boss fight here we need to have a loading hallway here

750
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:58,014
there needs to be a puzzle here

751
00:40:58,554 --> 00:41:04,457
a fight space here and we'll actually go through and meticulously, you know, spreadsheet this

752
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:08,419
stuff and figure out where are our wow moments, what is the time breakdown of our wow moments,

753
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:12,781
where are our fights, what are the time breakdown of our fights and create a kind of a spike

754
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:15,543
chart for the entire game and what is it delivering.

755
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:17,485
to the player from beginning to end.

756
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:19,367
And so as you can see, it's very effective for us.

757
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:22,551
And we can literally run through the whole game, essentially,

758
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:24,033
in shell form from getting to end and say,

759
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:27,056
here's a vista, here's a fight, here's an epic wow moment.

760
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:29,919
Some of it's very TBD, but it gives us a good understanding.

761
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,963
So in addition to that, our design philosophy

762
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:34,705
at Santa Monica Studios to expound on that,

763
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:35,866
and this is worth sharing, I hope.

764
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:40,893
Is that we value experimentation iteration over documentation and we do not document.

765
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:56,380
Yes, we will write things in like Microsoft Word to pitch and share it will brainstorm in that fashion. We will do things in illustrator. We spend most of our time doing we spend most of our time building. We don't find that tying ourselves to documentation is very helpful and in fact or documents always come last.

766
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:58,746
You know, we don't write game design documents.

767
00:41:58,806 --> 00:42:01,268
We define mechanics, et cetera, after they've been designed,

768
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:02,369
after we've iterated on them.

769
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:04,190
And our level design docs are the same.

770
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,871
In fact, we don't even create those anymore.

771
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,052
We just do video run-throughs.

772
00:42:07,573 --> 00:42:09,975
And we find that we don't marry ourselves to anything.

773
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:12,277
Because, you know, looking at God of War from the outside

774
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:14,098
before I started working at Santa Monica Studio,

775
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:16,540
I thought these guys were like insane mad geniuses.

776
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,322
I was like, well, because I came from a world where you design

777
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,444
maps on paper, and then you have to get it right.

778
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:22,705
And you have maybe one shot to do it.

779
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:23,906
And that's not the case.

780
00:42:23,946 --> 00:42:25,467
You know, we have the luxury of being able to.

781
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:29,470
have the time to let things come together and that's very important.

782
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,972
There's a commitment that, in our studio, that things need time to come together.

783
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:38,393
You can't make a sequence like Kronos or any of our elaborate puzzles

784
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:42,595
or Pandora from God of War I in a week, two weeks, a month, even three months.

785
00:42:42,635 --> 00:42:44,776
Oftentimes our boss fights take six months to design.

786
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:48,438
Our high action moments in our games can take years to build.

787
00:42:48,918 --> 00:42:52,079
And it's just about giving it the time and valuing what's important

788
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,460
and figuring out where to spend it.

789
00:42:55,042 --> 00:43:01,075
Additionally, Tim Moss, essentially our tech director,

790
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:02,518
and Christa Erickson, our tools director.

791
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:06,428
are very good about giving us strong tools that allow us to iterate very quickly. You

792
00:43:06,448 --> 00:43:10,790
know, like I said before, we can basically build everything in Maya ourselves and in

793
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,932
fact the entire studio works within Maya. There's no, and artists will use ZBrush but

794
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:18,253
everyone is actually interfacing and working within Maya directly so it gives us kind of

795
00:43:18,273 --> 00:43:21,955
a unified platform to develop from within. And that allows us to iterate very quickly

796
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:25,577
and to build things and we don't have to go back and forth with art and have them essentially

797
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,118
build our maps. We build the maps and then they art on top of it.

798
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:33,838
Also worth noting is that in our studio, designers are really encouraged to think for themselves.

799
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:36,538
This is, like I said before, it's not a one-person vision studio.

800
00:43:36,578 --> 00:43:39,859
You know, it's not one guy thinking of all the ideas and making them happen and telling

801
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:40,579
people what to do.

802
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:45,301
You know, obviously there's, you know, people make decisions, but we all think as a collective

803
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:49,282
unit and we find that that's very important for us in terms of getting a lot of ideas

804
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:51,302
and distilling it down to the best ones possible.

805
00:43:52,683 --> 00:43:54,565
And then it's also about getting the right people on the bus.

806
00:43:54,705 --> 00:43:57,606
You know, the interview process at our studio is very painful.

807
00:43:57,646 --> 00:44:00,548
You know, we have a gnarly test that takes forever for people.

808
00:44:00,568 --> 00:44:01,549
We give them a week to do that.

809
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:04,150
And if we get to pass that stage, you probably have, you know,

810
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,432
they're greeted with eight to ten hours of interviews in a day.

811
00:44:06,452 --> 00:44:08,353
And they go through pretty much every department.

812
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:10,274
And it's very brutal and it's very agonizing.

813
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:14,176
But we feel that if we can vet our designers and vet our staff within our studio,

814
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:17,258
then we know that we have people that can handle it and they can do good work,

815
00:44:17,278 --> 00:44:19,680
that can be entrusted, like I said before, to think for themselves.

816
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,961
And we don't have to manage them.

817
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:24,936
overmanage them and they can create content and they can

818
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,503
really just build and do what they do best.

819
00:44:28,063 --> 00:44:30,785
The next thing is really knowing your philosophy and sticking to it, whatever it is.

820
00:44:30,825 --> 00:44:34,988
Whether the vision of your game, For God of War, for example, you know, it's an action

821
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:38,210
adventure game with combat, puzzles, and platforming.

822
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,271
And that's our game.

823
00:44:39,491 --> 00:44:41,412
You know, we don't build things that deviate from that.

824
00:44:41,832 --> 00:44:44,874
We don't, you know, we don't try to build like social networking components within the

825
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:45,115
game.

826
00:44:45,155 --> 00:44:46,455
We don't build PlayStation Home hubs.

827
00:44:46,556 --> 00:44:47,296
We don't do any of that.

828
00:44:47,696 --> 00:44:49,838
We stick to what we know and we continue with that.

829
00:44:49,878 --> 00:44:54,741
And that works not only on a grand scale for our games, but also on a small scale for what

830
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:55,382
our levels are.

831
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:55,702
You know.

832
00:44:55,722 --> 00:44:55,982
So for...

833
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,304
designing the lab with levels, you know, we knew that these are mechanical contraption

834
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:03,527
rims that are essentially hazards and we don't, you know, we don't do anything unique in there.

835
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:07,090
We don't have, you know, there's no water in there, it's nothing crazy. And so we stick

836
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:11,052
to the vision and the, you know, philosophy of whatever that is and we keep that going.

837
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:15,615
And the last thing, you know, is that we really value the strength in numbers and like I said

838
00:45:15,655 --> 00:45:19,658
before we have a lot of people, we have a lot of people that are really, you know, passionate

839
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:23,501
about what they do and that they can contribute. And, you know, I've worked in a lot of levels

840
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:25,062
at Santa Monica Studio and I know that

841
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:29,727
You know, they've always, always, always worked out better in the long run than what I originally

842
00:45:29,747 --> 00:45:30,488
could have conceived.

843
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:34,271
And had I built my initial vision of what I thought a map could be in isolation, it

844
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,493
never would have been as good as what it ended up being in the long run.

845
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:39,455
Once you have other people looking at it, you get the feedback from other designers,

846
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:41,537
et cetera, et cetera, and the leads come in.

847
00:45:41,557 --> 00:45:43,378
And, you know, you get a lot of insight from different places.

848
00:45:43,398 --> 00:45:48,022
And it's very important for us to be, you know, kind of communicative and reciprocative

849
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,424
as far as sharing ideas and being honest.

850
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:55,346
I just wanted to quickly touch on the art philosophy using this example.

851
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:59,227
So this is a shot from the announced trailer for God of War 3.

852
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:02,647
And this was all a trailer that was developed in-house.

853
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,968
We did everything in the engine.

854
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:10,789
It was sort of a way for us to kind of test our new engine and see what we could pull off.

855
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:18,131
So we had this moment in the game on the trailer and it sort of kind of set a goal for us

856
00:46:18,191 --> 00:46:20,952
to push towards for the final game.

857
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:25,681
And although that moment didn't really occur at the beginning of the game on Gaia, we were

858
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:27,703
able to get that moment into Kronos.

859
00:46:28,123 --> 00:46:32,806
So it's sort of that goal that we set for ourselves, that we want to make sure that

860
00:46:32,906 --> 00:46:36,028
we delivered on the promise that we had established with that trailer.

861
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:38,670
Also, you know,

862
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:43,319
pushing ourselves forward, we just want to make sure that the character of Acronis was

863
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:48,502
the most detailed that we could do. So Tyler Vriand did a great job on detailing everything

864
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:55,586
from the veins down to the fingerprints. So definitely our most complex character we have

865
00:46:55,606 --> 00:46:55,886
ever done.

866
00:46:56,938 --> 00:46:58,759
The next slide shows sort of like a progression.

867
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:03,160
First is the cinematic model from God of War II.

868
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,521
And as you can see, the character didn't change too,

869
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:09,863
too much, but there was definitely a progression

870
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:10,883
that you can see here.

871
00:47:11,283 --> 00:47:14,844
A lot of iteration, a lot of fine tuning, a lot of detail,

872
00:47:15,225 --> 00:47:17,285
you know, that added, got added over time,

873
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:20,286
as well as you can see some height changes.

874
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,891
And it's also worth noting that this is anatomically correct.

875
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:28,555
And Tyler definitely got into some hot water over this.

876
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:30,237
This was a point of contention on the project.

877
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:31,658
He was told not to do this.

878
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:32,359
He did it anyway.

879
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:33,560
And it didn't end up making it into the game,

880
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,441
because it would have been weird.

881
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:36,303
Because as you fall off the creature,

882
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:37,584
there would have been a lot of crotch shots.

883
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,865
And it just would have been kind of bizarre.

884
00:47:39,406 --> 00:47:41,047
And it is a bit ironic for a guy so big.

885
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:41,348
He is.

886
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:43,718
not so big.

887
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,803
And someone, I think at one point, they were talking about sex minigame and all this stuff.

888
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:50,044
We were just like, no way.

889
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,625
We just couldn't figure out how to make it work.

890
00:47:51,645 --> 00:47:52,085
We didn't know.

891
00:47:52,106 --> 00:47:55,288
If you guys have any ideas, we can talk later.

892
00:47:58,111 --> 00:48:01,834
So at this point in development, we had basically created a shell.

893
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:04,916
Nathan Geary had spent time working with the team, you know, main viewer, animator, et

894
00:48:04,976 --> 00:48:05,357
cetera.

895
00:48:05,457 --> 00:48:06,578
And, you know,

896
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:12,136
basically building this for us with Tyler and working from the very beginning to establish

897
00:48:12,176 --> 00:48:16,157
the show. And what we were able to do was put this together, as you can see in this

898
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:19,959
video, from kind of beginning to end. So this is six months into development on the creature

899
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:23,640
we were at this point, and three months after the tools and technology had been developed.

900
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,062
And at this stage, you could play through it. It had a lot of the major beats. It wasn't

901
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:33,464
exactly fun yet, but you could see the kind of the spectacle there. There was no connective

902
00:48:33,504 --> 00:48:36,225
tissue really built, and it was all really kind of mocked.

903
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:41,186
in and to be determined. There was really no art added, you know, it was very basic.

904
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:45,731
There was still a ton of work to be done, but at least we had a kind of a nice starting

905
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:49,654
point. And as you can see here, that's our hotbox sequence and, you know, we kind of

906
00:48:50,035 --> 00:48:53,037
have these like weird college humor names that we attach to all of our sequences in

907
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:53,978
order to kind of create.

908
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:57,861
like a nomenclature so we can easily reference them within our team and we feel that's helpful

909
00:48:57,921 --> 00:49:00,803
rather than being like, yeah, it's the thing where he's like holding the hand. People say,

910
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:03,905
yeah, it's the hot box. Everyone knows the hot box, you know. So, and you go through

911
00:49:03,925 --> 00:49:07,467
that and we basically do that for everything that we have in our game. It's kind of big

912
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:12,411
and requires, you know, a lot of conversation. So that's pretty cool. I see him getting strangled

913
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:12,731
right there.

914
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:17,617
And so where we now so now we have to do it for real.

915
00:49:17,897 --> 00:49:20,679
So Nathan Gary moved on to a different position within Sony and that was

916
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:23,901
exciting for him and it left a vacuum in order to see who was actually going to

917
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:27,484
finish this thing off because as you can see it was kind of there in a shell.

918
00:49:27,504 --> 00:49:28,684
The idea was intact.

919
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:29,485
It kind of made sense.

920
00:49:30,025 --> 00:49:32,247
Um, we actually had to do it now and how are we going to do it?

921
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,048
So I was actually brought in for better or worse.

922
00:49:34,088 --> 00:49:36,870
I was super excited in the beginning and you know, I.

923
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:40,232
I quickly turned to Dread, went to talk to everyone who worked on it to figure out how

924
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:40,973
gnarly this was.

925
00:49:41,693 --> 00:49:43,374
And we just got to it, man.

926
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,076
There was really no option, so we just jumped in.

927
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:46,377
And I started working on it with the team.

928
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:49,499
And I was initially tasked with a few things.

929
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,381
And one of them was to figure out, well, play through it and figure out what works and what

930
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:52,841
doesn't work.

931
00:49:52,941 --> 00:49:55,784
And I felt initially that things, a lot of it was working.

932
00:49:55,804 --> 00:49:58,045
And in fact, I think it was quite cool already.

933
00:49:58,425 --> 00:49:59,606
But I felt like we were missing some things.

934
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:00,747
We were missing the dynamism.

935
00:50:00,787 --> 00:50:04,090
We were missing a lot of kind of those big moments I talked about where the character

936
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,636
transition states, et cetera.

937
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,256
And we really needed to shore it up.

938
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,457
We also needed to really create a fight sequence between the

939
00:50:10,497 --> 00:50:14,358
character and Kratos, and really selling that

940
00:50:14,398 --> 00:50:14,878
experience.

941
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,739
And we feel like we didn't really have that at that

942
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:19,000
point. So we had to figure out what we were going to cut,

943
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,360
what we were going to keep, and what we were going to

944
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:20,800
improve upon.

945
00:50:21,706 --> 00:50:24,269
So I just want to share with you a couple of the cut stuff.

946
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:29,975
So this is a part where Kratos is actually going across

947
00:50:29,995 --> 00:50:33,479
to each one of Kronos's eyes and just ripping it out

948
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:35,582
and then just having at him.

949
00:50:36,276 --> 00:50:41,198
We kind of figured out that by the time that you reach his face, he was pretty much incapacitated.

950
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:44,720
Kratos is a brutal character, but he's not necessarily sadistic.

951
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,602
So we felt that, hey, he should just go for the forehead and just finish him off.

952
00:50:49,002 --> 00:50:53,624
But on top of that, we just had too many eye-ripping scenes already in the game.

953
00:50:55,569 --> 00:51:02,211
The next thing is this attack that, you know, we had for Kronos early on. Yes, Kratos is

954
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:08,494
the size of an ant compared to Kronos, but this attack was just way too literal and it

955
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:12,015
just didn't work out for the character at all. But I just thought, you know, I wanted

956
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:17,757
to share this with you guys. And so the first thing we decided to tackle was let's just

957
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:20,699
nail this from the beginning to end, you know, let's just fill it in from start to finish.

958
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,385
you know we started to start with the right arm and this is kind of the right arm and

959
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:26,106
maybe

960
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:29,451
I want to say like the pre-alpha stage and

961
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:32,726
We were kind of figuring out what we wanted to do here and what worked.

962
00:51:32,766 --> 00:51:34,907
And we spent about three months just working on this one section.

963
00:51:34,947 --> 00:51:38,248
And it was the most challenging for us because this is where we really wanted

964
00:51:38,268 --> 00:51:41,349
to sell the actual, even though this is not like a real boss battle,

965
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:43,730
but you know, our version of a direct fight between the two of you.

966
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,731
So, you know, we have, you know, we have Cronos screaming at you.

967
00:51:46,751 --> 00:51:48,672
We have you running over to him and like attacking him.

968
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:50,793
And we had a, we really struggled with this for a while.

969
00:51:50,813 --> 00:51:54,294
You know, we were struggling with the transition state from this point to the belly.

970
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:58,138
And one day, we were sitting there and kind of out of frustration,

971
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:59,800
and he said, well, why don't we just rip his fingernail off?

972
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,143
Thinking people were going to be like, oh, that's a bad idea, whatever.

973
00:52:02,643 --> 00:52:04,085
Everyone was like, actually, that's kind of cool.

974
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:04,625
Let's try that.

975
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:07,048
And so Jason Hall mocked it up that day, the animator, and we just.

976
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,984
we tried it and it instantly sold itself.

977
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:12,585
People were like, that's really, that's terrible, actually.

978
00:52:12,706 --> 00:52:13,746
That's weird.

979
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:15,047
Why would you do that, man?

980
00:52:15,547 --> 00:52:16,848
I'm like, you're ripping people's heads off

981
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:17,688
and doing all this other stuff,

982
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:18,989
which is really kind of unrelatable,

983
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:20,350
but everyone can kind of relate

984
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,750
to having your fingernail ripped off,

985
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,151
and it just is really evocative.

986
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:24,232
You don't really see that here,

987
00:52:24,492 --> 00:52:26,913
but if you play the game, it's pretty gross.

988
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:28,134
And the sound and the audio and everything,

989
00:52:28,174 --> 00:52:28,814
it's pretty nasty.

990
00:52:30,303 --> 00:52:34,304
So where did that leave us? That left us at the point where we needed to solidify the progression of the whole experience.

991
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:37,746
And I liken kind of Cronos to, you know, like a classic car.

992
00:52:37,766 --> 00:52:40,087
You know, if anybody who has had a classic car knows about them.

993
00:52:40,447 --> 00:52:42,628
You know, everything will kind of work when you get it, you know.

994
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:46,189
And then like a week later, the windows won't roll up and then the sunroof won't close.

995
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:49,990
And then like, you know, you need like a new oil pan.

996
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,992
And like what happens is that you can never get everything above water.

997
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:55,753
Everything, something is always submerged. Something is always malfunctioning.

998
00:52:56,193 --> 00:52:59,014
And that was the case with this. It took us about, I would say, you know,

999
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:02,229
nine months just to get it to a place where we could play through the whole thing from

1000
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:05,570
beginning to end with progression. And that was really our goal, was can we get through

1001
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:09,232
it? And it took forever, you know, it kept crashing or you'd fall off and that was gnarly

1002
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:13,434
and very disconcerting. And then that took us into the next stage, which was the play

1003
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:17,236
testing and kind of iterative process stage of the whole experience. And I liken this

1004
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:21,638
very much to being attacked by a shark while you're riding a helicopter under the Golden

1005
00:53:21,658 --> 00:53:22,098
Gate Bridge.

1006
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:24,130
And for all of you who have done it, it's awesome.

1007
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,472
Or if you haven't done it, you know, whatever.

1008
00:53:26,052 --> 00:53:26,432
Check it out.

1009
00:53:26,853 --> 00:53:28,874
But as you can see here, it's wrought with peril.

1010
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:31,457
And it tests a lot of your assumptions.

1011
00:53:31,497 --> 00:53:34,039
And it can be very taxing and time consuming and

1012
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,020
frustrating, ultimately.

1013
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,062
So we went through that process and we figured out that

1014
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,263
people were responding well to this.

1015
00:53:39,544 --> 00:53:40,664
They were falling and dying a lot.

1016
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,306
But they were responding to the grand spectacle of the

1017
00:53:42,326 --> 00:53:44,308
whole thing, which we were very happy about.

1018
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:47,851
And that opened it up for us to figure out, well, as game

1019
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,513
developers, we're aware oftentimes it's

1020
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:54,939
It's not what you add to an experience, it's what you take away from it in order to create

1021
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,484
the better experience and what to subtract.

1022
00:53:57,904 --> 00:53:59,628
And that was certainly the case with this sequence.

1023
00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:00,690
In some respects...

1024
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:04,692
we had to find things to add to, because we felt like we were still missing things at

1025
00:54:04,732 --> 00:54:07,736
those later stages, like the sequence where you saw earlier, where he grabs you off the

1026
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:11,420
belly and holds the hand out, and those dynamic state changes, and we really wanted to sell

1027
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:11,600
those.

1028
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:15,565
So we had to get those in, and there were a lot of eye rolls about that when I suggested

1029
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:19,770
to do that, because, you know, we were already pretty much screwed, and seemingly unable

1030
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,473
to pull this off in the time we had, but we felt if we were going to do it at all, we

1031
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:23,033
had to go big.

1032
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:28,095
So now that we trimmed the fat and we had everything working,

1033
00:54:28,396 --> 00:54:30,901
we had a progression, that was time to really turn up

1034
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:33,566
the volume and polish this thing out and get it out the door.

1035
00:54:33,846 --> 00:54:34,948
So that's when all 35 members.

1036
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,854
all hands on deck, everybody jumped on board to start polishing this thing, getting it

1037
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:41,234
together.

1038
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:47,039
So team members like Max Ankar, who's the lead visual effects artist, you know, did

1039
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:48,060
a great job on Khronos.

1040
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:53,364
Kerry Gavina, the technical artist that worked, he can tell you some crazy stories about working

1041
00:54:53,404 --> 00:54:53,824
on Khronos.

1042
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,927
But, you know, they did it, they pulled together, everybody came together.

1043
00:54:56,987 --> 00:55:00,190
So this is a shot of pre-alpha Khronos.

1044
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,233
And here's a nice transition to what it actually ends being.

1045
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,734
So this is the moment that was most exciting for us.

1046
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:09,656
We're starting to get the visual effects, the sound,

1047
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,319
everything's, the new updated animations,

1048
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:15,761
the final character models in place,

1049
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:18,242
and the frame rates becoming more stable.

1050
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:21,064
It was really, really, truly an exciting moment for us

1051
00:55:21,124 --> 00:55:21,625
at this stage.

1052
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:29,360
So at this point, it's pretty much alive, and I think that for us and for me, this was a big experience to have it all come together.

1053
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:34,806
This is the hardest thing I ever worked on, and it was a situation where every day it seemed impossible.

1054
00:55:34,866 --> 00:55:38,611
Every day, people didn't feel they'd be able to do it in time, or people couldn't see the vision.

1055
00:55:38,631 --> 00:55:40,813
And it was very challenging. It was like looking into a dark abyss.

1056
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,175
And as game developers, we all know that.

1057
00:55:42,575 --> 00:55:44,557
and working in a creative medium with time constraints,

1058
00:55:44,737 --> 00:55:47,059
you know, you don't, you can't see the end result necessarily,

1059
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:48,380
but you operate on that daily faith

1060
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,101
that if you guys work hard as a team

1061
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:52,303
and you try to be as, work as smart as possible,

1062
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:53,223
you'll be able to pull it off.

1063
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:55,705
And that was, you know, that was, it was very rewarding for us.

1064
00:55:55,745 --> 00:55:57,026
And to work on something like this

1065
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:58,187
was really why I got into games.

1066
00:55:58,227 --> 00:56:00,329
It was to work on cool things that I was excited about

1067
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:01,990
and passionate about with really talented people.

1068
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,972
And to me, it was very satisfying, you know.

1069
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,508
professionally, emotionally, personally, in order to work on this and pull it off and

1070
00:56:08,528 --> 00:56:09,509
to see it all the way in the end.

1071
00:56:09,549 --> 00:56:12,770
And I remember, you know, having to set this up for a year and a half, I went through this

1072
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,772
and I played it after we got all the VO in and everything.

1073
00:56:15,812 --> 00:56:18,533
And I remember playing through the whole thing and just really being blown away in the end

1074
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:21,555
when, you know, stabbing him in the forehead and he's like pleading with you not to kill

1075
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:21,655
him.

1076
00:56:21,675 --> 00:56:24,836
And I actually felt bad, you know, which was weird because if anyone's like the Wizard

1077
00:56:24,856 --> 00:56:27,738
of Oz on this, it's me because I set the whole thing up over the last year and a half.

1078
00:56:27,778 --> 00:56:31,020
But I actually felt that we had achieved what we set out to achieve, which was delivering

1079
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,701
on the believability and the spectacle and selling the experience.

1080
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:40,197
For me it was a kind of like a unique experience to be able to work on this because I kind of had

1081
00:56:40,937 --> 00:56:42,798
Sort of like I was able to step back

1082
00:56:42,918 --> 00:56:46,219
I wasn't actually doing the day-to-day animation on the character

1083
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:50,740
But I was able to sort of supervise and see it born all the way from that you know

1084
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,400
Got over to Cyclops

1085
00:56:53,460 --> 00:57:00,262
Previous animation to the gray box man to each iteration and I could really see this character growing and slowly coming to life

1086
00:57:00,342 --> 00:57:01,783
So I just you know

1087
00:57:02,618 --> 00:57:08,624
I'm very grateful that I had that opportunity to kind of have that perspective on the sequence.

1088
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:12,828
We're wrapping up now, but I'll just jump into an outro clip, and this is kind of how it ends.

1089
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:13,614
And so lastly, I just wanted to give a lot of thanks and

1090
00:58:13,654 --> 00:58:15,155
credits to everyone who couldn't be here that worked

1091
00:58:15,195 --> 00:58:15,475
on this.

1092
00:58:15,515 --> 00:58:18,158
Like I said, it was a massive team effort.

1093
00:58:18,618 --> 00:58:21,240
And this is a list of everyone that worked on it directly.

1094
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:23,502
And we just wanted to thank them personally.

1095
00:58:24,023 --> 00:58:26,084
And then if you like money watching mansions and cars

1096
00:58:26,104 --> 00:58:29,287

And yeah, it was great.

1108
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:49,880
We don't, unfortunately, have time for questions.

1109
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,200
I think we ran the full schedule.

1110
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,081
But you can meet us outside after the meeting

1111
00:58:53,121 --> 00:58:54,022

1112
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:55,262
like to talk about it with us.

1113
00:58:55,903 --> 00:58:57,884
Please remember to fill out your speaker feedback forms.

1114
00:58:57,944 --> 00:58:59,384
And let me make sure I got everything else.

1115
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:01,525
Yeah, that's it.

1116
00:59:01,686 --> 00:59:01,906
That's it.

1117
00:59:01,926 --> 00:59:02,826
All right, thanks a lot, guys.

1118
00:59:02,846 --> 00:59:04,027
Thank you so much for coming, guys.

1119
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:04,867
Thank you very much.
