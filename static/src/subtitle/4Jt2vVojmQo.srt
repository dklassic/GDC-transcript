1
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:09,713
All right, so I'm gonna get started.

2
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:12,734
This is hiring for hopeless perfectionists.

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,296
And if you do the Twitter thing,

4
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:16,937
I included those on there,

5
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:18,658
so feel free to tweet if you like.

6
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,160
So if we came to flash forward yesterday,

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,661
I claimed that the hiring process at TGC

8
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,083
is pretty integral to the kind of games we make.

9
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:29,684
And so I wanted to give a talk about

10
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:32,406
how does a small studio create

11
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:34,227
a large impact within the industry.

12
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,148
So thanks for joining me for

13
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:38,364
hiring for hopeless perfectionists.

14
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,365
So, who am I?

15
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,765
My name is Sunny Pavlovich.

16
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:47,246
I'm the studio manager at That Game Company.

17
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,126
I've been there for three years.

18
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:51,667
I've been in the game industry for five years,

19
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,807
and for a few years prior to that, I was in entertainment,

20
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:57,628
and I was doing things such as production,

21
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:59,988
marketing, project management, localization,

22
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:01,568
hiring, all those sorts of things,

23
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:04,209
which tie really neatly into what I do

24
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,129
in my current role as studio manager.

25
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,229
Basically, I oversee internal operations

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:11,810
and external relationships.

27
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:17,054
So, when I was hired three years ago,

28
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:19,656
believe it or not, that game company

29
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:24,339
included a total of three people in 2012.

30
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:29,343
So, obviously, they had made three games.

31
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,645
It wasn't like there was only three people

32
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:33,046
making those games, but that,

33
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:35,908
what happened there is a topic for another talk

34
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:36,769
and has been covered in.

35
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,891
other interviews and such.

36
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,351
So I'm not going to go into that,

37
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:42,632
because that's not the focus for my talk today.

38
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:44,933
I'm really going to be talking about how

39
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:47,615
we went from these three people when I started

40
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:50,896
to building a studio of 15 full-time people

41
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:52,276
and two part-time people.

42
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:54,738
And that is as of March 2015.

43
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,719
So in addition to the three leads

44
00:01:58,699 --> 00:01:59,720
that were there when I started,

45
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,061
there are also four other returning developers

46
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,021
from our previous games.

47
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:05,602
So what has that game come to be done?

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,421
We've made three games for the PlayStation 3.

49
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:11,183
That first one was Flow in 2007.

50
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:13,525
Then we came out with Flower in 2009.

51
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:16,848
And our most recent title was Journey in 2012.

52
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,350
So each of these games are award-winning games

53
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,292
that have received numerous industry honors,

54
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:24,294
including Game of the Year for Journey.

55
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,856
And they've inspired a wide array

56
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,537
of eclectic and devoted fan art.

57
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,565
which makes us really happy.

58
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:34,506
But really, the point of all this

59
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,227
is that the games themselves were

60
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:39,229
the result of relentless, hopeless perfectionism.

61
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,372
And I think that's a trait that defines that game company

62
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:43,652
that I want to talk about more today

63
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:45,774
and how we built that studio.

64
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:48,776
And because that's what has allowed such a small development

65
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,338
team to create the kind of memorable game experiences

66
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:53,999
that people have come to know and associate with our studio.

67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,161
So talking about inspirations.

68
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,651
I have a couple of inspirations for this talk.

69
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,633
And so the first one is,

70
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:06,456
within the industry, that game company is kind of,

71
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,118
might be considered an anomaly.

72
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:10,840
And so people often come to us and ask,

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,942
you know, what is the philosophy

74
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:15,804
that allows your studio to make these games?

75
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:16,925
Like, how did you guys do it?

76
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:20,128
So this talk, Hiring for Hopeless Perfectionists,

77
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:22,970
is my way of demystifying that game company's

78
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,892
internal process and guiding values.

79
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,419
I would say my inspiration number two is,

80
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,300
hey, I'm talking about hiring.

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,300
Why would I talk about hiring

82
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,440
at the Game Developers Conference?

83
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,561
Because, in my view, hiring is such an integral process

84
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:40,562
to the kind of games we make and the studio we're building.

85
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,642
And for something that touches virtually

86
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:44,082
every aspect of game development,

87
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,463
it gets so little attention.

88
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:49,663
So I'm here to throw a spotlight on this critical process

89
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:53,004
and what has worked when we're hiring for our studio and why.

90
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:58,059
And really my goal for this talk for you guys afterwards is,

91
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,501
I want to leave you with a newfound appreciation

92
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:02,743
and understanding for the hiring process

93
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:04,864
and all the work that really goes into it,

94
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:05,965
into doing it well.

95
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,327
So hopefully it will inspire reflection

96
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:10,809
and leave you with some ideas to take back with you

97
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,351
to your own studio and like discuss further

98
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,433
about maybe things that you might want to start doing too.

99
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:20,090
So there are many, many ways to hire and grow a studio.

100
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,370
And that game company, obviously, is just one of them.

101
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,531
But I think, of all the ways, they're not all ideal.

102
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,971
And for example, you have something

103
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,172
that kind of looks like this.

104
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:33,852
So why is this not ideal?

105
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:36,473
It's very efficient, and the hires

106
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,953
are generic, expendable, and replaceable.

107
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:41,374
So if you're thinking about it from a financial perspective,

108
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:42,314
this is probably perfect.

109
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:43,554
But if you're thinking about this

110
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,055
from a creative perspective, this is not what you want.

111
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:49,695
It's completely impersonal, and it's not very remarkable.

112
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,576
And as a result, it's not going to lead

113
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:52,876
to very remarkable gains.

114
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,236
So I would say, if you took this approach,

115
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,057
predicted outcomes would probably

116
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:59,537
be you're not hiring very carefully

117
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:02,738
to build a very specific team that works well together, that

118
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:04,258
has a lot of cohesion, that's going

119
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,298
to have a lot of retention.

120
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,218
The team members, knowing that they were hired kind

121
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:09,919
of generically, they're not going

122
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,979
to have so much personal investment in what they're

123
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:14,140
making and ownership and that dedication

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
to go the extra mile.

125
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:19,580
as a result, they don't really care about the quality of the product as much as they could,

126
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,802
the product itself might be somewhat mediocre. Obviously this is going to create stress within

127
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:31,765
the studio, which is not good for creative people, but also the upper level management

128
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:36,427
might induce a lot of crunching, which is not fun for the employees. And then for all the

129
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:42,470
crunching that may go into a mediocre product, it could potentially lead to layoffs anyway, so not ideal.

130
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:44,879
So I think there's a better way to hire.

131
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,981
And this is what I've tried to do during my time at TTC,

132
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:52,745
is very carefully and slowly pick individual peoples

133
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:55,147
for all the skills and experience that they bring

134
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:56,748
and how they complement each other.

135
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:59,630
So we have this one whole cohesive team

136
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,793
of very interesting and wonderful people.

137
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:06,295
Is that everyone?

138
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:08,177
No?

139
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:09,638
OK, there we go.

140
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:10,996
Okay, that's everyone.

141
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,077
Oops, let me go back.

142
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:14,358
Oh, geez.

143
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,402
All right, so the point I'm trying to make with this slide

144
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,403
is that building a studio is so much more than,

145
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,225
you're not just filling a place with warm bodies,

146
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:26,985
you can do work.

147
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:30,708
And I think if that's not your goal,

148
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:33,969
then the hiring mentality you take has to reflect that.

149
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:36,563
So we have to ask ourselves, what is our goal?

150
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:39,004
And it's so much more than, hey, I'm hiring.

151
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:40,145
Here's an employment offer.

152
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:44,907
So what I'm trying to say is hiring is important.

153
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:48,089
And even more broadly, I would go as far

154
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,590
to say it's a foundational pillar that you should

155
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,792
create in your overall strategy as a studio of really,

156
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:56,113
where do you want to take your studio?

157
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:58,414
What kind of people do you want to be putting in your studio?

158
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,755
To what kind of outcomes do you want to have?

159
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:05,205
And this may be obvious, but when I talk about hiring,

160
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,926
I'm really talking about hiring well.

161
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:11,169
And hiring well means you put a lot of thought, attention,

162
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:13,650
and care into this process, just like you

163
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,871
do when you're making games.

164
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:18,513
Obviously, input is output, so hire well.

165
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,903
And hiring never ends.

166
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,324
It's an ongoing process.

167
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:24,444
Again, it's not just giving out offers,

168
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:27,025
but it's about once these people get into your studio,

169
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:28,505
how do you empower them?

170
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,586
How do you get them to be creative?

171
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,746
How are they invested in doing their best work?

172
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:35,327
How do you get them to retain and spread the word

173
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,507
that hey, this is a great place to work,

174
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:40,048
and so on, so that they're bringing

175
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:42,869
their like-minded individuals to come join you.

176
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:46,850
So there's a saying, ABC, always be closing, I would say.

177
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:51,163
always be hiring, because hiring doesn't end.

178
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,167
because the ideal goal is to talk about

179
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,988
how do we build something like this

180
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,388
and how do we avoid building something like this.

181
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:03,530
So as a quick intro, those are the underlying principles

182
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,550
about hiring at TGC.

183
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,071
So since this talk is hiring for hopeless perfectionists,

184
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:10,812
let's get back to our hopeless perfectionists.

185
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:13,192
So these are our hopeless perfectionists.

186
00:08:13,713 --> 00:08:15,893
They are the executive team at TGC now

187
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,354
and they are our lead developers.

188
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:18,454
They were there since the beginning

189
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:20,635
on Flow, Flower, and Journey.

190
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:26,712
So I would say the hopeless perfectionism that pervades our studio really starts with these three.

191
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:31,495
What is a hopeless perfectionist? Obviously I have to define that.

192
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,636
So I would say there's three qualities.

193
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:37,779
First is you devote an immense amount of time and attention to quality and craft.

194
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,720
And that's pretty much goal number one.

195
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:45,284
You are a truth seeker. You rely on experience and experimentation.

196
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:49,267
You don't rely on conventional methods and what other people do.

197
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,180
you're in an ongoing struggle to reach ever new heights

198
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,741
because you're never really satisfied

199
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:57,961
with your last achievement or accomplishment,

200
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,622
but always seeking to do something better.

201
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:01,242
That's a hopeless perfectionist.

202
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:04,523
So when we talk about hopeless perfectionism

203
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,244
and how our studio is structured

204
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:08,904
and how we set about our goals,

205
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:12,365
it's really based on what are our strengths in the studio

206
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:13,505
and what are our weaknesses

207
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:18,006
and how do we always work on capitalizing on our strengths.

208
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:19,728
to compensate for the weaknesses.

209
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:24,313
So as hopeless perfectionists who spend way too much time

210
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:26,175
thinking and working on game development,

211
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:28,497
the things that we're good at are

212
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:31,260
making games that are artistic, that

213
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,902
have lots of high polish, that can

214
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:37,207
be attractive and accessible to a large group of people.

215
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:42,452
that makes up for our weaknesses, which typically fall under categories like business development.

216
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:47,756
We're not thinking so much, and we're not devoting specifically the resources to like,

217
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:54,042
well, how do we recruit people? And kind of our philosophy always falls back to the strengths,

218
00:09:54,282 --> 00:10:00,568
and really what we enjoy doing is like, well, if we make an awesome game, people will find out

219
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:04,431
about it, and they'll be like, hey, I want to do that too. So we don't really need to.

220
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,597
spend as much time on recruitment,

221
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:07,718
which we don't want to do anyway.

222
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:10,020
And things like management and marketing.

223
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:11,682
If you're making a great game,

224
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:12,803
people are talking about your game.

225
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,727
So this leads me to a key point.

226
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:21,390
If there's one thing I've learned about that game company,

227
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,354
it's that they're an obsessively product-focused studio.

228
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:27,516
And that's what we live, breathe,

229
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:29,497
and talk about every single day.

230
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:31,959
So, full stop on that one.

231
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:38,946
So talking about, well, since we are obsessively product-focused studio, what does that mean?

232
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,307
There are two roles.

233
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:45,953
The bulk of activity and resources go to development, because that's what your product is.

234
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:46,914
Example.

235
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:51,078
When we moved into our new studio back in, I think, 2013.

236
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,934
the previous tenants left a bunch of leftover mugs

237
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:57,975
that they never used.

238
00:10:58,595 --> 00:10:59,595
And so what did we do?

239
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:02,236
We happily opened the box and started using them,

240
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,256
especially as we hired and had more people on our team.

241
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,857
And we're like, hey, mugs, because mugs are mugs.

242
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:10,538
But because we don't care about spending our resources

243
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:12,878
on buying mugs, because you'll still be able to drink

244
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:13,719
your coffee and tea.

245
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,640
But if you ask, like, hey, I need this new hardware

246
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,120
because I want to do this cool thing,

247
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,361
and this isn't cutting it anymore,

248
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,501
we're like, sure, no question.

249
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:23,041
Go buy it.

250
00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:25,617
So yeah, resources go to development,

251
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:26,679
because that's what we care about.

252
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:30,307
And secondly, if it doesn't support the product,

253
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,028
it doesn't matter.

254
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:34,195
And that comes up in so many ways.

255
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:38,713
If someone says like, hey, here's this new initiative,

256
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,473
or like, hey, why don't we do more press?

257
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,554
It's like, well, is that going to help the product?

258
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,254
No.

259
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,395
Then there's like, hey, we have 15 people.

260
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:46,395
There's no one there to do it.

261
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:47,775
We don't want to spend the time or money.

262
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:50,016
So a really great example of this,

263
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,197
and something that I get a lot of flack for sometimes,

264
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:57,918
both from our publicists and other marketing people,

265
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:00,119
is, hey, this is our website.

266
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:00,699
Guess what?

267
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,960
It's circa 2006, the year the company started.

268
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:09,510
Because, you know, sure there are people in our studio who have web development skills,

269
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,013
but it's sort of a question of, do you want to be making them the game,

270
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,375
or do you want to be working on the website?

271
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:21,001
So, if you look at our jobs page, there's photos from our studio back in 2009

272
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,322
when we were all young and skinny.

273
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:27,206
So we're not great at conventional marketing, and it shows.

274
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,072
So when we are hiring, though, what is it that we're looking for?

275
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:35,654
And what is our larger strategy since that's, uh, we want to build to our strengths?

276
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:37,496
So we're very product focused.

277
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,117
So when we hire...

278
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:42,841
Since we started out with hiring hopeless,

279
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,983
or bringing together these hopeless perfectionists,

280
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,904
hopeless perfectionists want to work

281
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:49,126
with other people with similar values

282
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,367
and who are aligned in their goals.

283
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,849
So they want to work with other hopeless perfectionists, people

284
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:56,132
who are always seeking the highest that they can do.

285
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,675
So you either hire more hopeless perfectionists,

286
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:02,797
or you hire people who work well and support

287
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:03,918
hopeless perfectionists.

288
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:07,821
Because the truth is, and I'm not going to lie,

289
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:09,783
hopeless perfectionists are not.

290
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:15,623
perfect. They are far from perfect. They are very imbalanced people. They have, they're very good at certain things

291
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:19,386
and so they, you need other people to create a cohesive whole.

292
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:23,378
The point is you have a team that's all aligned, working towards the same goal.

293
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,907
And when you hire creatives, what are things that they really, which gets them to do their best work?

294
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:36,894
You want to look for people who are directly invested and motivated to do their best work

295
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:39,437
because they feel a sense of personal ownership.

296
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:44,861
when you think about layers of bureaucracy or management,

297
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:47,603
it's like we try to remove that as much as possible.

298
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:49,464
It's like, hey, we hired you because we think you're

299
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:51,526
the best at what you do and we trust you.

300
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,267
I think trust is so fundamental.

301
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,628
And I'll talk about this later in my talk

302
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:58,470
about how we have this really extensive hiring process.

303
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,552
And that's because we want to hire these people

304
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:04,174
who once the hiring, once you've got the offer

305
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:06,175
and you're in the studio, it's like, go wild.

306
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:08,397
We trust you, do the best you can.

307
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:11,573
And so if these are really talented, hardworking people,

308
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:14,993
you want to give them direct feedback, which is basically

309
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:17,094
reward for they did a good job.

310
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:18,114
They made choices.

311
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,834
So it's like they can instantly make decisions about, hey,

312
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:22,314
I think this is a good way to do it.

313
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:22,814
Let's do it.

314
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:26,015
And then they see like, oh, that didn't lead to the experience.

315
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:27,255
I thought, OK, let me change that.

316
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:28,775
And that's what rewards them.

317
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:29,836
That's how they're motivated.

318
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,996
They don't have a manager telling them, hey,

319
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:34,136
I need you to do these five things by the end of the week.

320
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:37,057
So you're self-motivated, self-managed.

321
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:38,657
There's no external bureaucracy.

322
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,479
and you're accountable to each other and yourself.

323
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,241
So now I'm gonna talk about,

324
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:49,104
so how did we actually start building this studio?

325
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,806
How did we start recruiting and hiring

326
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:51,847
and bringing these people together

327
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:52,967
before there was even a product?

328
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:56,090
Like, where does, what's the origin story for TGC?

329
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,152
So, I would just let you know,

330
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:02,295
like, to make a big impact, you need to have...

331
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:04,699
a small team and you need these people who have,

332
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:08,021
or very talented and very invested in doing these things.

333
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:11,042
So the studio co-founders really found each other,

334
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:12,843
even way back then, based on product.

335
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:14,184
Because they're very product focused.

336
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:18,205
So as students, because the company was started

337
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,986
straight out of when everyone started the studio,

338
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,448
was in school, so they were making games as students.

339
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:26,309
They basically just kept running into each other

340
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:28,790
at student game festivals because back then

341
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,791
they just spent all their free time making games.

342
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:33,536
doing the best they can and being recognized for it.

343
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,958
So even though their network at the time was small,

344
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:39,640
and they had nothing like, hey, let's hire a recruiter,

345
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,481
let's put out ads, I'm going to start a studio.

346
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,403
It's just it's very easy to identify

347
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:47,985
other people with similar drive and dedication and talent.

348
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:50,066
And this entrepreneurial spirit, which

349
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,207
is really what it takes to start a small studio,

350
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:56,510
because it's like, hey, we keep making these student games

351
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,450
and running into each other.

352
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:59,412
So now it's time to found a studio.

353
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,953
I guess I want to work with you, because I

354
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,355
I know you and I know you do good work and we can work well together.

355
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:06,199
So what does that look like?

356
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,060
Going all the way back to 2005 at GDC,

357
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,862
at the IGF Student Showcase, we had these two games

358
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,763
show up among about 10.

359
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:18,044
So back then, it's just like there's a student showcase.

360
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:19,205
There was no single winner.

361
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,246
So we had this game, Diodin and Mutton Mayhem,

362
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:24,127
which probably none of you have ever heard,

363
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:26,108
even if you're huge fans of that game company.

364
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:27,729
So what does that look like?

365
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:32,371
This is the Diodin team with our TGC audio director,

366
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:33,311
Vincent Diamante.

367
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,250
working on that student project.

368
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,731
If you remember, not only did Vincent work on these projects,

369
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:43,612
he also joined that game company to do the music composition

370
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:46,293
for Flower, and is a current audio director.

371
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:50,135
And here we have TGC creative director, Genova Chen.

372
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,716
Now the second game, Mutton Mayhem,

373
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:55,457
we have TGC lead engineer, John Edwards.

374
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,041
So 2005 IGF Student Showcase.

375
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:01,641
Next year rolls around.

376
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,002
Oh, there's another student game competition.

377
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:07,204
It's called Slamdance Guerilla Game Maker Competition.

378
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:10,805
Many of you may not have heard of this because it lasted

379
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:11,545
about two years.

380
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:13,526
But back then, that's where the students were going to

381
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,447
show the games.

382
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:19,789
So in 2006, it was a new set of games.

383
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,430
This was Cloud, which you may be familiar with if you're

384
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,991
familiar with that company, and Ocular Ink.

385
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,211
And once again, what do we see?

386
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:32,473
We have Lee's engineer John Edwards and Juno Vachon

387
00:17:32,713 --> 00:17:35,114
showing up at this with their respective games.

388
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,317
Okay, later in 2006, we're back at GDC.

389
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:44,739
Oops, we're back at GDC.

390
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:52,262
Okay, put this out, put that out.

391
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,701
Okay, we're back at GDC for the student showcase once again.

392
00:17:56,721 --> 00:18:00,822
Again, winning our cloud and ocular ink.

393
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:02,562
So you can see this trend here.

394
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:05,443
There's not that many students making these games,

395
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:06,803
but they keep running into each other.

396
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:11,024
Which brings us fast forward to 2007.

397
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,525
By now, that game company has already been formed.

398
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:16,545
We're working on our first game, Flow, for PlayStation,

399
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:22,567
which is just a remake of the student version of Flow for PC.

400
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:27,565
And this is the founding team of TGC way back when.

401
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:31,787
So we have on the left, Kelly Santiago, who worked on Cloud.

402
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:35,808
We have Nick Clark, who worked on Flow at USC with Genova Chen.

403
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:39,109
You can see peeking under his jacket is a Flow shirt.

404
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,990
Then we have Austin Wintory, who also went to USC

405
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,790
and worked on Flow.

406
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,131
And many people may be familiar, he

407
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:48,052
joined us again to work on Journey

408
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:49,312
to write the music for that.

409
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:52,055
Next to Austin in the middle is Genova,

410
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:54,576
and once again we have John Edwards.

411
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:58,199
So this is TGC in its earliest days.

412
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,541
And again, Vincent would come back later

413
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:03,002
to work on Flower Afterflow.

414
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:06,264
So I wanted to ask if anyone's been paying attention,

415
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:11,607
did you notice that TGC's lead engineer, oops,

416
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,208
I went too fast.

417
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:19,512
Where are my slides?

418
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:24,458
Sorry about this.

419
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,646
Okay, GDC 2007.

420
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,770
Yeah, did you notice that GDC's lead engineer

421
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,511
doesn't take any front-facing photos?

422
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,172
I think he's just a shy guy.

423
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:48,096
Okay, so bonus tip since we're at GDC.

424
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:50,478
You know what else happens at GDC?

425
00:19:51,872 --> 00:19:54,713
If you're driving along Interstate 5 in California,

426
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:03,436
you might get inspired to make your next game and first original IP as a studio.

427
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:05,597
So, just a thought.

428
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:09,399
Anyway, that was footage from Flower, if you couldn't tell.

429
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,161
Okay, so now we have a studio, we have a product,

430
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:16,902
we're product-focused, we have something to talk about.

431
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,663
So, how do we build a studio with that in mind?

432
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,163
So we're getting the word about hiring.

433
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:26,205
And remember, that game company is an obsessively product-focused studio.

434
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:28,707
We really want to just be making games.

435
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:30,448
We don't want to be doing anything else.

436
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:33,170
But you know what?

437
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,473
Even though we're straight up terrible at conventional marketing and recruiting,

438
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:41,275
we know that brand building does help the product, and so does hiring well.

439
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:47,983
So, when we do have to do kind of like external, public-facing things, it's still about the product.

440
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,505
So, what do we do? We give talks.

441
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:53,968
This is Junaba Chen at the 2014 Games4Change keynote.

442
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:58,891
And when we give talks, it's mostly about our products and our process,

443
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:02,895
because that's what we are, that's what we know, that's what we feel is worth sharing.

444
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:07,706
Because honestly, hiring is a numbers game,

445
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:10,446
and you never know which one exactly is gonna hit with,

446
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:12,707
or resonate with the person you wanna hire.

447
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,788
But the more brand reputation we build

448
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:18,389
based on external outreach around our product,

449
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:20,450
the higher the chances that we're gonna find

450
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,490
some good hires because of it.

451
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,951
So this is reputation building.

452
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:26,171
This is how TGC does marketing.

453
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:29,673
Plus, it's good karma to share knowledge

454
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:31,973
with our peers at conferences like GDC, as you see.

455
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,157
Jeno Chen and Nick Clark.

456
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,178
Because at heart, we just want to make great products.

457
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:41,019
Giving talks is a byproduct and conduit to making great games.

458
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,822
So we make time for it, even when we would rather be designing

459
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:47,282
or rather be coding.

460
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:52,165
Okay, so if we're doing our jobs well,

461
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:53,066
which hopefully we are,

462
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,708
and creating these memorable game experiences,

463
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:58,410
the press is gonna be more motivated

464
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,072
and likely to reach out and build stories around our studio,

465
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,274
which really cuts out the need for us to go out

466
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:05,835
and like, kind of chill and be like,

467
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:06,836
hey, notice us.

468
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:08,537
Like, they already think, hey,

469
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:10,919
these are some people doing something special.

470
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,540
This is worth talking about.

471
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:13,521
Let's do a story.

472
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:16,503
Saving more resources back for development.

473
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,875
So what I'm saying is, yeah, external research,

474
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:23,458
external outreach always comes back to the product.

475
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,982
So that's how we get the word out.

476
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:30,765
So now how do we actually go about hiring these people?

477
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:31,946
What is our process like?

478
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:32,967
You know, the nitty gritty.

479
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:35,249
it looks something like this.

480
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:36,329
First, I want to mention,

481
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:39,489
where do our eventual hires come from?

482
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,230
So, I would say the number three is from our,

483
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,250
via application on our website.

484
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,051
So, we do hire on there, but it's in third place.

485
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,331
Second place would be speaking,

486
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,732
and actually doing things like what I'm doing now

487
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:55,233
puts me and the rest of the team in touch with people

488
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,973
who are like, hey, I dig what you do.

489
00:22:57,053 --> 00:22:57,973
I think I'm qualified.

490
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:58,773
Let's talk.

491
00:22:59,314 --> 00:23:02,296
And then the number one is personal recommendations.

492
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:05,339
So that's when someone we trust and know within the industry

493
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,881
is like, hey, here's a promising student,

494
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,864
or hey, I know someone who's looking to switch their job.

495
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:11,865
You really should talk to them.

496
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,327
And I just want to be clear that even

497
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:17,490
though personal recommendations is the number one

498
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,752
way we've had most of our hires, it's

499
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,533
not to say a personal recommendation.

500
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:23,794
It's like a guarantee, like, hey, we're going to hire you.

501
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,915
It just means that these people are

502
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:27,875
familiar with what we're looking for and what we need.

503
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:30,656
And so it tends to have higher yield than, say,

504
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:33,677
job application, where just anyone is applying.

505
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:35,137
But we still hire from there.

506
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:35,837
OK.

507
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:37,797
So this is what our job application form looks like.

508
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:39,338
It's pretty simple and straightforward.

509
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:41,638
It's a Google form.

510
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:42,859
It's not fancy.

511
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,239
It probably started when we built our website.

512
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,940
And so that serviced us.

513
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:50,935
And it works. Not exciting.

514
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,338
How about cover letters?

515
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:54,279
So...

516
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,204
I think cover letters within our studio is a bit...

517
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,506
Like, I would say it's slightly controversial.

518
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:02,547
Maybe that's not the right word.

519
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,089
But in the sense that, like...

520
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:09,558
I like cover letters because when I read them I get a sense of a person's personality.

521
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:13,481
And if you think about what a cover letter is, it's really just like how to get noticed

522
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:14,642
and make yourself stand out.

523
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:19,407
But other, you know, it doesn't work, or it works against some people if you require a

524
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:20,347
cover letter, so we don't.

525
00:24:20,828 --> 00:24:25,031
And the reason is if English is not your native language, you're maybe not going to write

526
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:25,792
a great cover letter.

527
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:30,616
And for games that don't really feature language, we don't really care if you have great English.

528
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:37,554
And secondly, if you're a creative person and you aren't the best at writing, but you're great at art, you're great at programming,

529
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:42,558
why would you be motivated to spend time to write a cover letter when you could just like create something awesome,

530
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:44,440
which is why I actually selected this image.

531
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:52,968
So this image is fan art, and it comes from someone we eventually hired as an artist intern for one summer, and she never...

532
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,577
originally expressed interest in working for us and she was never considering game development.

533
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:03,164
But what happened is even though it's someone who actually didn't really play any games, I think

534
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:06,088
Journey might have been the second game she ever played.

535
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:11,885
she fell head over heels for and she loved the art style and she gravitated towards it.

536
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:16,787
So she kept tweeting at us like, hey that game company, like here's some art I did.

537
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,668
And eventually I would call that, that's a non-traditional cover letter because she was

538
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:26,230
doing her part to express an interest and an alignment in the company. And so I reached out

539
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:32,253
to her and was like, hey maybe you should consider working for us and she did for the summer.

540
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:34,373
Eventually what happened though is

541
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:39,767
she's now working at Disney, and I think this is actually a salient point because

542
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:44,328
it's something that the game industry can learn about, at least when it comes to the products we

543
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:50,371
make and how we hire. When I was trying to hire a concept artist role, I was working really hard

544
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:55,153
to see about trying to diversify the applicant pool, and so I was looking, like I took the

545
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:59,534
initiative to seek out a lot of female artists, and I was checking like

546
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,442
dozens and dozens and dozens of portfolios.

547
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,952
and these again these were not people who are applying I was just saying who

548
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:15,814
does great concept artwork. A lot of these people were at Disney and a lot of

549
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:19,896
them tended to be female and I was thinking how come you don't see these

550
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:23,278
people in the industry in greater numbers why are they all at Disney and

551
00:26:23,318 --> 00:26:27,241
if you think about it kind of makes sense. One, Disney is a company that's

552
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:31,183
known for being very family-friendly and like employee focused and having great

553
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:31,743
benefits.

554
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:37,686
And so they encourage like a nice work-life balance, but also if you think about as a kid,

555
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:43,548
everyone watched Disney films and everyone kind of fell in love with that. So if when you get older

556
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,629
and you're going through school and you're graduating and you're looking for a job or you

557
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:49,630
want to work, you want to work at places that make awesome stuff and guess what?

558
00:26:50,804 --> 00:26:53,006
Games don't traditionally appeal to women

559
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:54,167
in very high numbers.

560
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:57,290
So I think in a very, very tangential way,

561
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,313
how that game company hires is by making those products that

562
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:05,416
appeals to more people that will hopefully then help diversify

563
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:06,537
the people who are working for us.

564
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:09,880
And so that's one thing we can learn from film and animation.

565
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,063
They know how to create experiences

566
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,364
that speak to a lot of people.

567
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:16,025
So just a side note there.

568
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,972
Okay, so now we're gonna talk about resumes.

569
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,073
So resumes do some things really well.

570
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:23,894
I'll just say that first.

571
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:27,416
At a quick glance, you can match up a candidate's focus,

572
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:31,339
priorities, baseline skills, past work environments.

573
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:33,420
For example, have they been working

574
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,581
in small studio environments,

575
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:36,782
or are they coming from mega studios?

576
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,404
And that really does matter when you think about

577
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:42,186
who can be the most effective in a small studio.

578
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:45,468
But I think resumes have also a lot of downsides.

579
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,701
They don't indicate talent.

580
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:49,382
You can't tell what their values are.

581
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:50,662
You don't know what their taste is.

582
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:53,363
So resumes have very limiting information.

583
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:58,285
So this is an example of a resume I got and obviously I anonymized it.

584
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:03,968
But I wanted to show you why this resume was particularly terrible and I don't like resumes.

585
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:06,750
There's so little white space.

586
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,813
Maybe this doesn't come across very clearly,

587
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:13,378
but for example, they really packed in

588
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:14,319
all the text that they could.

589
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:16,381
There was so little space between the lines.

590
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:19,004
They chose the tiniest font ever, like eight or nine point.

591
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:26,091
And you know what? It was three pages long. It was three pages of this.

592
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,232
And so what does that tell me right off the bat?

593
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:31,015
You don't know what you want. You don't really want to work here.

594
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,678
You haven't focused on telling me, like, this is what I can give you.

595
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:37,980
You're just like, here's the things I've been doing for the past 10 years.

596
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:43,205
And unfortunately, the font was so small, I literally couldn't read it.

597
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:47,888
And I was just like, sorry, this person was not under consideration anymore.

598
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:55,801
So I don't love resumes, but I love portfolios because at a quick glance, I know a candidate's

599
00:28:55,841 --> 00:29:00,689
focus, I know their priorities, I know their baseline skills, I know their past work environments.

600
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,994
So here's an example of a

601
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:09,788
application that I thought was awesome, and we went on to hire this person, and I'm very happy.

602
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:14,150
Oh, I should note, we went on to hire this person, and because they had such an awesome

603
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,772
application and portfolio, this is an example of someone who did apply via our website,

604
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,714
they didn't know anyone at the studio, they didn't know anyone that we knew, they just applied,

605
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:28,557
they were like, here's what I can do. And I wanted to anonymize it, so I did some Photoshop work,

606
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,338
just to respect privacy.

607
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,480
Here's why I love it.

608
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,020
Portfolio, bam.

609
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,981
I click on it, I can see what they did.

610
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,723
Here, very concisely, they're like, here's who I am,

611
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:43,123
here's what I've done, here's how to contact me further.

612
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:46,564
And really nice visual layout of, hey,

613
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:47,625
find out more about me.

614
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:48,465
Click these links.

615
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:50,866
And so I'm actually going to show you

616
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:52,726
a small snippet of what.

617
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:57,706
what their demo reel looked like.

618
00:29:57,827 --> 00:30:00,209
And I want to mention that this is someone who came straight

619
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:00,849
out of school.

620
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,355
And I appreciated that they were able to, I could see

621
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,417
that they had worked on 3D game environments, and they

622
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:10,377
worked in small teams.

623
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:13,380
And they had a very interesting approach to game

624
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,581
design and aesthetic.

625
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,382
And that instantly caught my eye.

626
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:18,965
I was like, there's not that many students coming out of a

627
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,327
school these days with this kind of background.

628
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:31,490
So I can see, yeah, like, they're making these very interesting choices and creating this world and atmosphere.

629
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:37,311
And it shows, like, they know, they have a wide range, and they just have a baseline talent that was exciting.

630
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:41,132
So, yes, successful hire, currently in our studio.

631
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:51,034
So, you've submitted a resume or an application or your portfolio, and I'm like, hey, this is cool, let's talk more.

632
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:53,794
So, interview screens are pretty standard within the industry.

633
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:55,335
So I like to think that.

634
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:00,364
you know, there's several key functions that take place whenever you do an interview screen.

635
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:06,272
Number one is inform. So, let's say I'm talking on the phone with a candidate and I was like,

636
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:08,034
okay, well here's the role we're hiring for.

637
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,262
For example, let's say we're hiring a field engineer.

638
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:15,944
So as a field engineer, and also what's the structure

639
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:17,745
of the studio, what are the values of the team?

640
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:19,406
It's like, okay, we're a small team,

641
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,867
everyone knows each other, it's very transparent,

642
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:23,468
you have access to anyone you want.

643
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,489
Like if you wanna go talk to an artist,

644
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,730
you wanna go talk to a composer,

645
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,071
they're sitting right next to you, jam out ideas,

646
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:31,132
like totally you can do what you want.

647
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,175
And because of that, if you have a lot of motivation,

648
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:36,455
you'll like working here.

649
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,476
If you like working in small team sizes

650
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:38,997
that don't have...

651
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:45,825
you know, like I said, a lot of management watching over you.

652
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:48,827
So our process is, hey, we do a lot of iteration,

653
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:52,069
we fail a lot, but I think it's exciting

654
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:53,670
because you get to try out ideas,

655
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,251
and you put them actually in the game,

656
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:57,552
like you're constantly working on stuff.

657
00:31:57,592 --> 00:31:59,353
It doesn't work, that's okay, you throw it away,

658
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,075
but it's up to you.

659
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:03,096
What do you think is best in the game?

660
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:03,916
Do it.

661
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:06,918
So I talk about the role, and I talk about...

662
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:09,677
how do we work in the studio?

663
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:11,358
How do we work together?

664
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:12,559
How do we communicate together?

665
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:15,102
And then I try to sell them.

666
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:17,244
And a lot of times after I've had,

667
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,685
like towards the end of the phone call,

668
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:20,527
I'm like, do you have any questions?

669
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:22,569
And they'll say, what do you like about your job?

670
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,071
I'm like, well.

671
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:30,065
let me tell you and I started getting really excited because I was like I work with these like awesome people

672
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:35,146
They're so smart and all my previous jobs like I would be the one who was

673
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:41,087
Putting in the extra hours and like pushing. I'm like hey, we can do this better and you know, like that's not good enough

674
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:46,088
Let's spend more time and this is the first time I've been in a company where it's like

675
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:51,950
Oh, I'm pushing hard to keep up with everyone else as opposed to like, oh, I'm trying to pull everyone along with me

676
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,252
So I get really excited about that, and I'm like, I'm working with these people who are super passionate,

677
00:32:57,272 --> 00:33:04,137
they have all this integrity to create this really pure, for-the-player experience,

678
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:09,860
and they're so smart, and I'm sitting in these design meetings, and it's like, it's totally, it's not structured,

679
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,521
it's not like we came in with a goal, we're just like...

680
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:14,534
Okay, we're going to have a design meeting. Let's sit down.

681
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:17,355
We don't have a design document. It's just like,

682
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:18,876
Hey, I'm just going to throw out some ideas.

683
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:20,476
And they start sketching on a whiteboard.

684
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:22,177
And it's like, Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

685
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,378
Oh my gosh, that totally would work.

686
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:26,399
Oh, I'm so excited for this game, even though it's just sketches on a whiteboard.

687
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:27,239
Oh, I can see it.

688
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,880
And so I get to be in this environment every day.

689
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,901
And it's great.

690
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,322
And I get to do what I want.

691
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:37,823
I get to decide, you know what, today I want to focus on this.

692
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,544
And that's what I think is best for the studio.

693
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,304
And that's what I'm going to do.

694
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:45,023
So, you know, there's a certain amount of selling that has to happen, like,

695
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:49,964
the studio's awesome, but it's also about finding the right fit, and

696
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:53,985
this kind of environment is not for everyone, and, you know, there are times

697
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:55,906
where I have to turn people away, even though they're like,

698
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:59,167
oh, I really want to work at that game company, I really respect what you do,

699
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:03,108
and, you know, they have, honestly, like, a solid background, and, like,

700
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:05,088
they're skilled, but I have to turn them away, because...

701
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:09,771
I don't think that they would fit. I don't think they would actually enjoy working here because

702
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:15,255
working in this kind of environment where you're just doing these prototypes is actually

703
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:20,038
really stressful. And as much as it's great to have all this freedom of,

704
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,921
hey, I want to work on this thing. I think this is what the game needs. If you have that for like

705
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:29,864
two plus years where no one is telling you this is what the game is, it's like, no, you go make

706
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,545
the game. You go tell me what the game is.

707
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:36,931
A lot of people can't handle that environment. They need the kind of feedback. They need the structure.

708
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:41,697
And they need someone saying, yeah, I need you to do these five things by the end of the week.

709
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:47,424
Or you know, maybe they're just not really good at communicating, something like that. So what I do is I say,

710
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:52,524
hey you're going to be working really hard but if you're really passionate about it and you

711
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:57,270
really like it you're going to have a phenomenal time but if you need a lot of structure you're

712
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,775
going to just like spaz out and like you're not going to you're not going to want to stay

713
00:35:01,815 --> 00:35:05,599
here anymore so there's an element of selling as well as scaring.

714
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:08,446
And then obviously I'm evaluating people.

715
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:12,131
I listen to what are their values and filter that.

716
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:12,912
Hey, they're great.

717
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:15,715
Okay, let's hopefully move forward to the next step.

718
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:18,499
So I'm gonna talk about tests.

719
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:22,905
And I know that this has been a bit of a point of contention

720
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:24,928
within the industry of like, well, why is this?

721
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:30,110
necessary? Why do people, why do candidates get subjected to this process?

722
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,792
And so like I can see both sides of it and so I definitely take this into

723
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:37,674
consideration. I don't think it's cool to ask people to do free work for you

724
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:41,536
especially for any like extended amount of time. Like that's not what a test is.

725
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:44,717
It's not to like steal people's IP and put it into your game because they're

726
00:35:44,737 --> 00:35:49,700
too cheap to pay them. And it's not to put them through an endurance test. You

727
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,981
don't give them like a month-long assignment. A test is...

728
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,202
And I think specifically at that game company, why is this step so crucial?

729
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,623
Why can we not skip this?

730
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:04,704
It's because what we do is so different, and the way we work,

731
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:09,646
and the skills we need is such a specific combination that just because you said,

732
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:13,627
like, hey, but I've been working in the industry, X studio for five years,

733
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:15,888
and I've been in these roles, it's like.

734
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:23,094
Yeah, but did you have 15 other people on your specific team just to do AI?

735
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:24,977
Or were you doing the AI?

736
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:27,860
Do you know how to talk to artists?

737
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:33,428
Do you know how to both implement and design and brainstorm?

738
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:42,425
We do this to go, like, I want to know that if you come to the studio, you actually have these baseline, one, skills, but two, is taste.

739
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:46,809
Because sometimes people are, they're awesome at what they do, and they're really good at enabling other people,

740
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:52,634
but so much of what that game company experiences is seeped in, like, this emotion and artistry, it's like,

741
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:56,437
well, there's only a handful of people to do any one task anyway.

742
00:36:56,477 --> 00:37:00,320
It's like, you kind of have to be able to do it and make it look and feel really good.

743
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:00,801
So.

744
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:02,902
That's what a test is for.

745
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:08,007
So I'm going to talk about a field engineer test.

746
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:11,369
And I kind of talked a little bit of what a field engineer does.

747
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,632
A field engineer...

748
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:19,776
Another way to put it is like, they're a hybrid kind of designer-engineer

749
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:23,199
because we don't have any just sole designers at that game company.

750
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:26,001
If you work at that game company, you have to be able to implement, basically,

751
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:29,304
any idea you have because, hey, there's only so many people.

752
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,524
So if you think about what user experience is,

753
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,106
and usually the title's like,

754
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:36,688
oh, we're hiring a user experience designer.

755
00:37:36,748 --> 00:37:38,970
It's like, well, at that company we flip it.

756
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,513
We go, well, we're hiring a user experience engineer.

757
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:44,635
So basically you have all the sensibilities

758
00:37:44,755 --> 00:37:47,837
of what is going to be the optimal user experience,

759
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:51,040
but I also have the engineering-heavy background

760
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,801
that I can go and implement that.

761
00:37:54,664 --> 00:37:59,049
So a fun factoid about that game company, which most people are surprised when they find out about,

762
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,595
is that the majority of the TGC team is actually engineers.

763
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:07,761
Because we need the people who can build all the systems.

764
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,764
So again, what does it feel like to be an engineer?

765
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:11,005
They're the ones who's...

766
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:15,324
putting together, I was like, well, how, they're making the decisions and

767
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:18,967
implementing, how is the character going to move? What are the baseline

768
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:23,770
interactions? Where are the systems? How does the AI work? How does the camera work?

769
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:29,454
So you're creating all these, like, moment-to-moment decisions that creates

770
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:33,297
a larger feeling of being in this world and...

771
00:38:34,322 --> 00:38:36,244
It's like, you know, color choices.

772
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:38,005
What's in the environment?

773
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:39,206
What does the audio sound like?

774
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:40,147
What is the pacing?

775
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:42,529
And how do the characters interrelate with each other?

776
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:44,451
So I'm going to show you this.

777
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:47,073
This is a test submitted successfully

778
00:38:47,113 --> 00:38:48,634
by someone we went on to hire.

779
00:38:49,575 --> 00:38:51,516
And I'm sitting right here.

780
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,179
So the background for this, the prompt

781
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,941
was create an experience where it's

782
00:38:56,961 --> 00:39:00,564
like you're taking the player back to the experience.

783
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:05,411
being a child and like you're kind of tapping into childhood nostalgia and it

784
00:39:05,431 --> 00:39:09,537
was very open-ended so we part of the task is also to see how are you going to

785
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:13,444
interpret this what are your creative like skill sets like and decision-making

786
00:39:13,504 --> 00:39:13,764
skills

787
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:20,512
So in this experience, we have this one central character who is what we call a child-like figure,

788
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:25,195
and they're out kind of in this world, and they're with a parent-like figure,

789
00:39:25,635 --> 00:39:30,698
and then this other fun little figure comes along. And so the player figure kind of has to decide,

790
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,280
well, do I kind of want to go explore and experiment with this fun new character,

791
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,701
or do I want to stick with my parent?

792
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,981
When I play, I just have to pay attention to like the really detailed choices made of like,

793
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,363
how does the character move, how smooth is it, what is the feel,

794
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:51,244
what is the feeling you're getting from this feel engineer test.

795
00:40:22,011 --> 00:40:28,736
So that's actually just a recording of me playing through really quickly the initial

796
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:29,617
part of the experience.

797
00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:35,722
So yeah, we thought this was a great test.

798
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:38,532
They made really good choices.

799
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:43,278
Did they successfully convey the feeling of being a child?

800
00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:46,041
And it felt good, so higher.

801
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:50,283
Next up we have a concept artist test.

802
00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:53,784
So really quickly, this is basically a color script.

803
00:40:53,904 --> 00:40:56,304
So within like one single image,

804
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,745
can you portray a simple story arc

805
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,445
and like tell us what color choices

806
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,706
you would use to convey the mood?

807
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:06,306
And so this is also someone who went on to hire,

808
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:08,907
I really like this other image that they did.

809
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:12,068
So within a single shot, can you produce an image

810
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:16,409
that evokes an emotion or feeling or suggests a narrative?

811
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:17,349
And I feel like, hey, this is.

812
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,911
This is an image that's going to capture you.

813
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:22,513
So we went on to hire this artist,

814
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:24,935
and we are very happy with his contributions.

815
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:28,799
OK, so that's the testing process.

816
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:30,995
That took forever, right?

817
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:34,378
Actually, we try to, again, to be humane about it,

818
00:41:34,418 --> 00:41:38,361
we try and really hone in on, let's say this is a day of work.

819
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:39,963
We don't want you to do too much more than that.

820
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:42,825
Maybe include some brainstorming time or polishing time,

821
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:45,627
but we really want to know what your baseline skills are,

822
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:47,189
like you could just pump out in a day.

823
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,631
The thing is, as much time as it takes for a candidate to do a test,

824
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:57,194
we put so much thought into how do we tailor this test to give us exactly the right data

825
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,414
that fits the role that we're trying to hire for.

826
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:05,477
And tests are interesting because although it's work that we ask a candidate to do,

827
00:42:05,997 --> 00:42:09,299
we also, it's always about hiring and selling.

828
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:13,960
You want to use a test as a barometer to say,

829
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,001
this is what we care about, and these

830
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:17,121
are the kind of things you're actually

831
00:42:17,141 --> 00:42:18,702
going to be working on at that game company.

832
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,584
So if you enjoyed this test, and you

833
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:24,645
thought it challenged you in all the right ways,

834
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:25,986
and you want to do this every day,

835
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:28,007
then you will like working at that game company.

836
00:42:29,328 --> 00:42:31,329
So OK, we get through the testing process.

837
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:33,710
Hopefully it is successful, and we move on to the next stage.

838
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:39,373
And that is the all-day group interview with these people.

839
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:39,453
And.

840
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:46,290
So obviously this is a huge time investment from our side as well as the candidates, but

841
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,794
the thing is not that many

842
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:55,037
candidates get to this stage? Because this is basically the final stage where you spend a day with us and you talk to us,

843
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:56,818
you have lunch with us, we show you the game,

844
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,084
you sit in on meetings, you get to meet every single person on the team, so that if you finally do join us,

845
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:04,005
it's like you know

846
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:09,489
exactly, well, you have a good idea of exactly what you'll be doing with who and how and how do we operate?

847
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:12,772
What are our values? How does a typical day at that game company look like?

848
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:19,754
And yeah, it is a lot of investment to think, well, you take like one day out of downtime

849
00:43:19,774 --> 00:43:24,917
from development, and that's because we consider hiring so important and such a huge investment

850
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,519
that we're really trying to hire for the long term.

851
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:29,541
It's like we're taking you into our team.

852
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:31,782
So we, one, want to make sure that

853
00:43:32,503 --> 00:43:38,064
we can work with you and we can communicate well and there's like a good vibe right between us but

854
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:43,345
it's also hey you're evaluating us too so if you're going to be devoting yourself to working

855
00:43:43,385 --> 00:43:47,206
at this company for several years don't you want to know who you're working with so yeah you're

856
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:52,388
going to meet every single person and that's the point of an all-day interview and it's also

857
00:43:52,488 --> 00:43:58,449
really important we we will fly people in to spend the day with us. All right so

858
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:03,811
hiring doesn't always work out and sometimes you have to reject people.

859
00:44:04,694 --> 00:44:07,783
That's a natural part of the hiring process, but

860
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,662
we have to remember that these are people

861
00:44:11,102 --> 00:44:11,862
we are dealing with.

862
00:44:11,922 --> 00:44:15,083
And especially, I'm usually the main contact

863
00:44:15,123 --> 00:44:16,123
for dealing with this person.

864
00:44:16,203 --> 00:44:18,444
And if they've gone through all these different stages,

865
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:20,404
and if they've invested so much time

866
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,005
doing tasks and doing interviews,

867
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:24,905
it's like they deserve a lot of respect.

868
00:44:25,386 --> 00:44:27,046
And part of it is, yeah,

869
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:29,387
because that's another person I'm communicating with,

870
00:44:29,427 --> 00:44:30,887
and it's not an anonymous person.

871
00:44:30,947 --> 00:44:33,227
It's someone I'm very carefully trying to filter

872
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:34,348
to bring into the studio.

873
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:36,268
So I must have liked them on some level.

874
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:39,491
but also

875
00:44:41,175 --> 00:44:42,455
Well, it's good to be nice, right?

876
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:46,297
But these are people who are going to go on and tell

877
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,398
other people about your studio and what their process is like,

878
00:44:49,418 --> 00:44:50,399
because people like to talk.

879
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:53,940
And you know what?

880
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,481
They had some things that were a really good fit.

881
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:56,541
And you thought they were really smart.

882
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:58,662
But for some reason, they just didn't fit the role.

883
00:44:59,383 --> 00:45:01,924
And if I've done my job well and I've

884
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:03,444
left a really strong impression on them,

885
00:45:04,025 --> 00:45:05,805
maybe they know people in the industry.

886
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:08,607
They might actually recommend people back

887
00:45:08,787 --> 00:45:10,007
to apply at that studio.

888
00:45:10,387 --> 00:45:14,430
And so if you have this long-term, big-picture thinking,

889
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:17,373
always putting care and thought and attention to this process,

890
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:18,634
even when you have to reject someone,

891
00:45:18,874 --> 00:45:20,915
can really work in the studio's favor.

892
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:22,357
And so it's important to be respectful.

893
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:25,919
So an example of this is there were a number of times

894
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:29,362
where I was evaluating some junior hires, maybe fresh

895
00:45:29,402 --> 00:45:31,043
out of school, for a programming position.

896
00:45:31,644 --> 00:45:33,545
And so I felt really bad.

897
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:34,806
I was like, oh, I really liked you,

898
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,147
and I think you had the right motivation.

899
00:45:38,665 --> 00:45:41,746
you seem great, you just don't have the baseline experience,

900
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,868
and I felt bad of like, I've just got to like reject you

901
00:45:44,928 --> 00:45:46,248
and tell you to go work somewhere else.

902
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:49,910
So one thing I did was I pastored the other programmers

903
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:52,091
of like, come on, just give me like a cheat sheet.

904
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:53,792
Like, what do you want to see?

905
00:45:53,872 --> 00:45:54,672
Like, just lay it out.

906
00:45:54,692 --> 00:45:56,693
Like, this is not something we advertise on our website,

907
00:45:57,113 --> 00:45:59,434
but this is something that I put together.

908
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:01,996
And I literally, I've said this on multiple occasions.

909
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:02,296
I'm like,

910
00:46:02,816 --> 00:46:06,180
hey you know what if you work here you need to be able to do these things but

911
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,465
even if you don't work here this is going to help you in the industry when

912
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:14,489
you go work in another studio so my recommendation to you is like hey take

913
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:17,673
some time make sure you know all these things and that would be good and I

914
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:19,055
think that's just a way of

915
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,273
They've given me their time.

916
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:23,634
I don't want to leave them empty-handed

917
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:24,994
and like, sorry, I can't hire you.

918
00:46:26,094 --> 00:46:27,374
So, I mean, just little things you can do.

919
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:29,495
But hopefully everything works out

920
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:31,115
and your offer's accepted.

921
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:33,856
So as I said, the hiring never ends

922
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:35,576
because you want to make sure people know that,

923
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:37,476
hey, I really care about you and I want you on our team

924
00:46:37,516 --> 00:46:38,697
and I want everything to work out.

925
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:43,918
So, you know, people, it's this whole messy process and.

926
00:46:45,752 --> 00:46:48,313
Even if you've done this complete hiring process,

927
00:46:49,054 --> 00:46:51,474
once they get into the studio, you have to devote a lot

928
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:54,916
of attention in onboarding them and making sure they do really

929
00:46:54,956 --> 00:46:55,916
know how things are done.

930
00:46:56,076 --> 00:46:58,997
They know who to talk to, to ask questions.

931
00:46:59,077 --> 00:47:02,418
They feel like someone is invested in their success.

932
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:04,739
And so a lot of times, new hires,

933
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:06,900
like we work really close with them, definitely

934
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,681
the first few days, sometimes the first few weeks, sometimes

935
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:11,881
months, just to make sure it's like they're

936
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:12,822
getting on that right path.

937
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:13,222
So it's like.

938
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:16,164
Because, as I said, what we do is really stressful,

939
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:17,746
so if they're coming in, they feel like,

940
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,587
geez, I'm making all these prototypes,

941
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:22,169
and nothing's sticking, nothing's getting in the game,

942
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:25,272
and they make sure that they feel like failure is a success,

943
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:26,653
because it meant you were trying something,

944
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:28,455
and you've defined that that thing doesn't work,

945
00:47:28,955 --> 00:47:31,658
and it's not that none of your stuff's getting in the game,

946
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:34,500
because most of, I mean, if it takes us this many years

947
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,202
to make a game, and it's not a huge game,

948
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:38,284
most of the stuff we're making is not getting into the game.

949
00:47:39,325 --> 00:47:40,706
So onboarding is really important.

950
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,389
Because it feels really good if you're a new hire

951
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:47,070
and on your first day you're already submitting stuff

952
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,651
into the game, I mean that just feels good.

953
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:52,132
I would say like a second part that I personally think

954
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:54,593
is really important is that when we hire someone

955
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:58,354
and they have a partner, that that partner feels like

956
00:47:58,634 --> 00:48:01,775
they're excited about their partner's new opportunity

957
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:03,136
and they feel welcomed by the team

958
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:05,456
and they get to know like, hey, here's the people

959
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:06,897
that my partner's gonna be working with.

960
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:09,158
So it's like, it's just extending of like,

961
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:11,198
when you make an offer to someone.

962
00:48:11,478 --> 00:48:13,280
It's like you're taking the whole package.

963
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,281
And it's like, OK, they have people in their lives.

964
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:19,043
Get them invested in being really excited

965
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:20,944
and being supportive of the work that they do.

966
00:48:21,004 --> 00:48:22,985
Because sometimes it is going to be hard.

967
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:26,247
And you want everyone on that same side of like, hey,

968
00:48:26,267 --> 00:48:27,508
you're really excited about this job.

969
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:28,188
It's a tough day.

970
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:28,548
It's OK.

971
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:29,009
You can do it.

972
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:29,829
Come back again.

973
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:32,171
And if you're going to have social events,

974
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:33,711
make sure those partners are invited.

975
00:48:35,555 --> 00:48:39,076
So we're getting kind of close to the end.

976
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,178
So just wrapping up, if I've done my job well,

977
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:44,379
the hiring process builds retention

978
00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:46,059
and prevents talent poaching, which

979
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:47,540
I think is really important also.

980
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,121
Because if I've invested all this time

981
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:50,842
to get awesome people into my studio,

982
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:52,842
I want to make sure that they're happy.

983
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:54,723
And if they're happy and someone else comes along

984
00:48:54,743 --> 00:48:55,924
and wants to throw all this money at them,

985
00:48:55,944 --> 00:48:56,844
they're going to be like, you know what?

986
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:57,785
What I got is really good.

987
00:48:58,285 --> 00:49:01,906
So it's a whole process, and it matters.

988
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:05,419
And the idea is I'm creating dedicated teams

989
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:06,279
that work well together.

990
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:11,903
So really wrapping up, what's it like working

991
00:49:12,003 --> 00:49:14,044
with a studio of hopeless perfectionists,

992
00:49:14,104 --> 00:49:16,306
and why do we do it in a few slides?

993
00:49:18,587 --> 00:49:20,388
Working with hopeless perfectionists

994
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:21,249
is super frustrating.

995
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:22,249
Why?

996
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,471
Because when you've been working on a thing for a really long

997
00:49:25,551 --> 00:49:26,812
time and, you know,

998
00:49:27,571 --> 00:49:29,172
You haven't talked about the game,

999
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,153
and it hasn't been published, and we extended the deadline

1000
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:32,594
again.

1001
00:49:32,994 --> 00:49:35,215
It's a lot easier to just kind of be tempted to say,

1002
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:36,055
you know what, it's good enough.

1003
00:49:36,116 --> 00:49:37,156
Let's ship it.

1004
00:49:37,196 --> 00:49:37,796
Let's keep going.

1005
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:41,158
And then just enjoy keying back with your colleagues

1006
00:49:41,198 --> 00:49:43,339
rather than really pushing and fighting

1007
00:49:43,419 --> 00:49:46,321
for these unproven ideas and impossible ideals.

1008
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:48,702
But that would be a lot less meaningful,

1009
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:49,623
and that's not why we do it.

1010
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:51,681
because we're hopeless perfectionists.

1011
00:49:51,761 --> 00:49:53,442
So it's going to be frustrating sometimes,

1012
00:49:54,122 --> 00:49:55,002
but that's part of the process.

1013
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:57,883
I think working at the studio and being

1014
00:49:57,903 --> 00:50:00,123
a hopeless perfectionist is also very motivating,

1015
00:50:00,143 --> 00:50:02,884
because you're getting these constant new challenges,

1016
00:50:03,024 --> 00:50:05,104
and you're creating these new discoveries that

1017
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:07,165
keep us ever pushing towards something greater.

1018
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:10,206
And that really actually leaves you hungry to go find

1019
00:50:10,226 --> 00:50:12,446
the next goal and your next set of accomplishments

1020
00:50:12,486 --> 00:50:13,526
and see how far you can go.

1021
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:17,394
working at that game company is inspiring.

1022
00:50:17,755 --> 00:50:20,256
Because we make experiences where players feel something

1023
00:50:20,276 --> 00:50:21,316
they've never felt before.

1024
00:50:22,297 --> 00:50:24,658
Sometimes it's because it's the first game they've played

1025
00:50:24,698 --> 00:50:26,799
and they've actually decided, hey, that looks interesting.

1026
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:29,660
Or maybe they've had a lifetime of playing games

1027
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,502
and they're like, I've never felt that in a game before.

1028
00:50:32,882 --> 00:50:34,823
And when you see this happening over and over again

1029
00:50:34,863 --> 00:50:36,164
with all new players, you realize,

1030
00:50:36,764 --> 00:50:38,385
I'm making something that makes a difference

1031
00:50:38,485 --> 00:50:39,665
to people in this industry.

1032
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:44,791
Hiring for Hopeless Perfectionists, the studio,

1033
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:50,156
the work is challenging because we're redefining

1034
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:53,619
new boundaries of a worthwhile interactive experience,

1035
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,621
and that can be really overwhelming

1036
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:58,544
when you don't have these baseline models to work off of.

1037
00:50:59,384 --> 00:51:02,827
But on the other hand, it also means we get to redefine

1038
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:04,609
new boundaries of interactive experience.

1039
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:06,671
So, you know, double-edged sword.

1040
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:12,032
Working at That Game Company can be funny and empowering

1041
00:51:12,512 --> 00:51:14,333
when we're comfortable expressing ourselves

1042
00:51:14,454 --> 00:51:15,895
as individuals together.

1043
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:18,037
And yes, that's an actual picture from our studio.

1044
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:22,740
Working at That Game Company is worth it

1045
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:24,782
because it's really hard, but in the end,

1046
00:51:24,822 --> 00:51:26,644
we get to make wonderful game experiences

1047
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:28,745
that we're proud of, that are different,

1048
00:51:29,526 --> 00:51:30,627
and that we wish to see more of.

1049
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:35,806
And in the end, it's because we're building cohesive teams

1050
00:51:35,946 --> 00:51:38,328
to break through hard times and make something great.

1051
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:40,230
This is that game company.

1052
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:43,812
Are we still gonna look wistful?

1053
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:44,533
I don't know.

1054
00:51:44,553 --> 00:51:45,333
Let's all look at the camera

1055
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,475
and then look wistfully into the distance.

1056
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:52,519
It's hiring for hopeless perfectionists.

1057
00:51:57,022 --> 00:51:58,143
Thanks, Q&A.

1058
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:10,143
So I'm very open and welcome to do Q&A. I think we have like three minutes.

1059
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:16,648
So if anyone is interested and we don't have time to like fit you in, I will be in the room

1060
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:22,852
across the hall. It's room 2002. You're welcome to join me there. And sprinkled throughout this

1061
00:52:23,412 --> 00:52:27,555
room are my colleagues. So you can go harass them as well and ask them lots of questions.

1062
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:30,837
Yeah, they're here and here and here. So yes.

1063
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,731
I'm just curious, have you had any experiences where you've made a mistake in hiring or where

1064
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:42,693
something just hasn't quite worked out and how you've dealt with it or would recommend

1065
00:52:42,713 --> 00:52:43,394
dealing with that?

1066
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:45,314
Yes.

1067
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:49,096
Actually, so in the three years that I've, oh sorry, I need to repeat the question.

1068
00:52:51,762 --> 00:52:53,922
You asked me a really lengthy question.

1069
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:55,403
I don't know if other people will have time,

1070
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,303
so please stick around.

1071
00:52:57,464 --> 00:53:00,445
The question is, have I ever had an experience where

1072
00:53:01,065 --> 00:53:02,826
I hired someone and it didn't work out,

1073
00:53:02,986 --> 00:53:05,107
and what would I recommend?

1074
00:53:05,127 --> 00:53:08,288
That's really tricky.

1075
00:53:08,308 --> 00:53:11,149
So it's happened three times in the three years

1076
00:53:11,169 --> 00:53:13,370
that I've been there, which is like an OK rate.

1077
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:14,211
It's not great.

1078
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:15,931
What I found out.

1079
00:53:18,913 --> 00:53:21,475
Sometimes when that happens, when we hired someone and it didn't work out,

1080
00:53:21,555 --> 00:53:24,837
it was because we actually subverted the process that I talked about here.

1081
00:53:24,857 --> 00:53:28,179
So, there's a reason why we have a process when we go through these steps.

1082
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:32,322
It's because we're really trying to do a thorough assessment before, you know,

1083
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,544
making that huge commitment, which really is...

1084
00:53:34,564 --> 00:53:38,967
It feels really bad when you've put in all this effort to bring someone to the team,

1085
00:53:38,987 --> 00:53:42,229
and then, oh, it didn't work out. Like, that emotionally feels bad.

1086
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:43,850
So, I would say...

1087
00:53:45,045 --> 00:53:46,987
follow the process, don't skip, don't think like,

1088
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:49,008
oh I know better, oh they're a work girl, they're fine,

1089
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:51,649
oh they've had enough experience, we don't have to do that step.

1090
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,911
Or they come highly recommended, it's like, you still have to do the step.

1091
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,373
And I think the other thing I would advise is,

1092
00:53:57,473 --> 00:53:59,254
if you know someone is not working out,

1093
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:02,035
you want to identify that sooner rather than later, and...

1094
00:54:03,548 --> 00:54:06,750
Really, you want to leave, have the person leave on amicable terms.

1095
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:10,892
So when it doesn't work out, it's not always like, oh, we're rejecting that person.

1096
00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:15,515
Sometimes that person's like, no, I'm not really getting what I'm looking for from the

1097
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:15,956
studio.

1098
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:21,559
So you, what I advise is if someone feels like they're ready to leave, or if we feel

1099
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:25,942
like maybe it's better for everyone if this person leaves, is you make it safe for them

1100
00:54:25,982 --> 00:54:26,322
to leave.

1101
00:54:26,382 --> 00:54:27,023
So you don't.

1102
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,551
you're not there to like villainize them.

1103
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:33,874
You want to go like, hey, if you feel like you can do your best

1104
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:35,875
work somewhere else, we're going to support you.

1105
00:54:35,975 --> 00:54:37,676
Like, do you need references?

1106
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:38,716
Do you need recommendations?

1107
00:54:38,736 --> 00:54:39,777
Do you need us to talk to people?

1108
00:54:40,197 --> 00:54:42,078
We'll help you, because we still like you.

1109
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:43,579
We want you to do well.

1110
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,380
And you don't want to have like bad feelings.

1111
00:54:47,141 --> 00:54:49,062
Or also, sometimes it's like making sure

1112
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:52,684
that you give them some kind of compensation of like, OK,

1113
00:54:52,744 --> 00:54:54,025
if you're going to be out of work for a while,

1114
00:54:54,345 --> 00:54:55,005
here's some severance.

1115
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:56,766
It makes it safe, so it's like.

1116
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:59,610
they're not going to feel like, oh, I'm alone on this boat.

1117
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,915
When they're not.

1118
00:55:03,995 --> 00:55:04,176
Hi.

1119
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:08,041
I was wondering roughly what your success rate is

1120
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:11,526
based on number of applicants who apply for a position

1121
00:55:11,906 --> 00:55:13,288
and the number that you would actually

1122
00:55:13,328 --> 00:55:14,409
give an offer to, roughly.

1123
00:55:15,138 --> 00:55:21,641
Okay, so to break it down into numbers, so like I said, when I started there were three people,

1124
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:28,864
so I would be fourth. We're at 15 people right now, so I'm only going to be speaking to the

1125
00:55:28,884 --> 00:55:35,186
duration of time when I was there in these three years. So what that's like seven people,

1126
00:55:35,246 --> 00:55:39,208
and then we grew to 15. Obviously some people left, so there was a few more hires.

1127
00:55:41,529 --> 00:55:43,490
So we made eight hires.

1128
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,817
that weren't previous developers on previous games

1129
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:49,259
or the people who were there or myself.

1130
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,444
So eight hires, I've seen thousands of applications.

1131
00:55:57,285 --> 00:56:00,367
So I guess that's also why I kind of highlight those things

1132
00:56:00,427 --> 00:56:03,530
of like, work in an awesome portfolio,

1133
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,011
make yourself stand out,

1134
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:07,453
don't have a three page long resume

1135
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:09,174
that says everything that I can't read.

1136
00:56:11,385 --> 00:56:12,927
come talk to us at talks.

1137
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:14,848
I mean, we're people.

1138
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:16,269
If you seem cool, we will talk to you.

1139
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:17,891
We don't get to respond to everyone.

1140
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:20,813
But as I said, there are people we hire

1141
00:56:20,873 --> 00:56:22,034
who just straight up apply.

1142
00:56:23,475 --> 00:56:23,795
Thank you.

1143
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:25,677
Oh, I didn't say the question.

1144
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,861
What is our rate of hiring based on the number of applicants?

1145
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:32,182
Hi.

1146
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:34,464
This is very inspiring.

1147
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:35,305
Thank you.

1148
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:37,286
Susan Mocklin, Punch Bee Music.

1149
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:41,402
Can you speak about contracting versus hiring

1150
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:45,426
and how you might adapt these tips to finding a contractor

1151
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:48,950
with the eventual goal of ideally hiring

1152
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,331
for a permanent team?

1153
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:52,914
OK, so the question is, how do we

1154
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:56,538
deal with full-time hires versus contractors?

1155
00:56:56,598 --> 00:56:58,901
And how do we deal with that and what the difference is?

1156
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:00,042
And I would say.

1157
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:06,107
At that game company, we strongly prefer hiring full-time hires because the idea is,

1158
00:57:06,447 --> 00:57:09,291
we've already gone through this extensive review process.

1159
00:57:09,351 --> 00:57:10,933
It's like, we either want you or we don't.

1160
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:14,497
And this idea of like, kind of either a part-time or extended trial

1161
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:17,041
hasn't really worked out in our favor very well.

1162
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:19,604
And the thing is, like, if we're not sure we want you...

1163
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:26,672
Again, we're very feely people, so once you're in that studio with us, we are going to latch

1164
00:57:26,773 --> 00:57:27,193
onto you.

1165
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:31,556
And so it's kind of like once you're in, you're in, and then if you're in but then you're

1166
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:35,438
not quite the fit we want, then that's just kind of bad because then it's like, oh, we

1167
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,620
have to fire that person, but we really like them and they're cool.

1168
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:41,662
So we really try and just...

1169
00:57:43,003 --> 00:57:43,883
focus on full-time.

1170
00:57:43,923 --> 00:57:44,864
So they can get up.

1171
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:45,885
They're a full-time hire.

1172
00:57:45,905 --> 00:57:47,346
They get our full attention and all that

1173
00:57:47,386 --> 00:57:49,167
comes with being part of that.

1174
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:51,728
We do have some contractors, but those

1175
00:57:51,788 --> 00:57:54,170
are for non-development roles and things

1176
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,131
that can be a little bit more tangential,

1177
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:59,993
such as our current community manager is part-time.

1178
00:58:00,053 --> 00:58:03,095
Although I am hiring a lead community manager

1179
00:58:03,115 --> 00:58:04,396
to be full-time in our studio, because I

1180
00:58:04,436 --> 00:58:05,637
think community management's really important.

1181
00:58:05,657 --> 00:58:06,718
I'm just going to say that out right now.

1182
00:58:07,778 --> 00:58:10,740
And our publicist, she works with us part-time.

1183
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:15,383
She's, I think, also a special exception because she really gets us.

1184
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,405
And I think that's another thing with contractors.

1185
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:22,789
If their mind is elsewhere or spread out, they're not going to necessarily be the best

1186
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:24,370
fit in making good choices.

1187
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:28,753
So you really need people in the team, sweating it out with you day in, day out, and know

1188
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:29,193
what's best.

1189
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:32,596
Because again, it's really hard to define the needs.

1190
00:58:33,036 --> 00:58:37,820
But if you're there every day, you see what's going on, you can better make choices that

1191
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,500
help the student.

1192
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,901
So I hope that answers your question.

1193
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:42,803
OK, it looks like we're out of time.

1194
00:58:43,263 --> 00:58:48,165
I'll be in 2002 across the hall if you want to follow up

1195
00:58:48,185 --> 00:58:48,845
with any of us here.

1196
00:58:48,865 --> 00:58:49,505
There's a bunch of us.

1197
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:51,806
Please fill out your session evaluations.

1198
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:52,287
And thank you.

1199
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:53,407
Enjoy the rest of GCD.
