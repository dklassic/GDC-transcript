00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:09,716
Hi guys, I'm Kate, I'm a physical therapist and you're probably here because you have

2
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:12,158
some amount of interest in health and wellness for your players.

3
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,599
At least I hope that's why you're here.

4
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:18,744
So a little bit about me before I get started on today's topic of choice.

5
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:24,949
I'm a doctor of physical therapy, I'm a certified emergency first responder, and I'm a recovering

6
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:25,549
non-gamer.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,292
I think the sum total of what I played growing up was some Oregon Trail, a little bit of

8
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:34,955
Zoombini's Logical Adventure, and like 10 minutes of Ocarina of Time when one of my

9
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:36,736
cousins got fed up with a boss that she couldn't beat.

10
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:40,579
Do you know how hard it is to try and beat that Water Temple boss running in a circle?

11
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,400
You need WASD to run in a circle.

12
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:49,285
My first real game was Dota 2 because I wanted to make myself something nice and easy with

13
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,546
a community well-known for being very welcoming.

14
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:56,868
But since diving head-first into that deep end, I've captained and drafted for an amateur

15
00:00:56,888 --> 00:01:02,310
Dota team, I've directed and educated a group of stats people, I've done in-game statistics,

16
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,251
I've worked on-site at Dota and Smash summits, I've worked at a lot of Smash tournaments.

17
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:15,760
and somehow found the time to play way too much Dota, Guild Wars, Warframe, Melee, Street Fighter 4 over 5, and Guilty Gear.

18
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:22,866
So I've been doing the eSports thing for about three years now, about as long as I've been a physical therapist.

19
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:30,013
So while I'm newer to eSports in general, I'm not quite so new to the helping people get better while they're playing thing.

20
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:34,229
I work for a company called 1HP, which is myself and one other PT.

21
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,671
We're a huge company, obviously.

22
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:40,198
And our motto there is that we want to help players play more and hurt less.

23
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:46,798
So my goals for this presentation are to help devs and community members alike understand

24
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:51,739
the value of health and wellness as part of community growth, to help understand the role

25
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,300
of health and wellness in player experience, player retention, and player longevity, which

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,701
probably matter a good deal to everyone here, and to understand who you want to draw in

27
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:05,782
to help you out with that along the way, to help you develop health and wellness initiatives

28
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:06,502
and infrastructure.

29
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:11,127
Unlike traditional sports, we don't really have an infrastructure right now.

30
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,353
So on the one hand, that's great. That means we get to build it the way we want it and the way

31
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:20,120
that works for us. On the other hand, that's less great because we have to build it the way we want

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,322
it and the way that works for us.

33
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,659
So there's two exceptionally obvious reasons why health and wellness matter, and then

34
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,460
there's two more gaming-specific reasons.

35
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,642
And the exceptionally obvious one would be that, well, you're putting yourself at risk

36
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:36,323
of injury by playing for a long period of time.

37
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:43,086
Matt and I at 1HP classify esports as a static endurance activity that challenges executive

38
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:46,308
function in a virtual environment, and let's dig into that a little bit more.

39
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:49,464
Static means we're not moving all that much.

40
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:53,107
We're seated, there's micro movements of the hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder.

41
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:58,912
They're not moving with large enough velocity or direction to be considered strongly dynamic

42
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:02,715
in the way that say soccer or football or track and field would be.

43
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:07,437
It also is static because we're maintaining a position.

44
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:12,060
So it's more about maintaining posture than it is about quickly changing postures repeatedly.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,403
So that postural awareness is a really key part of helping players avoid injury.

46
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:23,783
It's an endurance activity, because just like running, we're performing the same cyclical

47
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:26,125
repeated movements over an extended period of time.

48
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:28,047
Our bodies need to be conditioned for that.

49
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:33,293
We don't consider most injuries that happen with gaming to be overuse injuries per se,

50
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,595
we consider them to be under-preparation injuries.

51
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:38,058
And on the one hand, yes, that's a matter of semantics.

52
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,480
On the other hand, though, what that suggests more accurately is that if you are underprepared

53
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,342
and that's the reason you've experienced an injury, there is in fact something you could

54
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:49,543
do to prepare yourself to avoid that injury.

55
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:51,023
And that's certainly true.

56
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:55,845
We can build up endurance and strength and conditioning and motor control.

57
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:58,630
to make players less likely to be hurt while playing.

58
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:02,958
And more than that, we can help players to perform better,

59
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:05,342
especially in a competitive esports environment,

60
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:08,788
with the right kinds of conditioning.

61
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:13,810
The executive functions and the virtual environment are probably a little more self-explanatory.

62
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,453
Executive function being anything involved in the frontal lobe for the most part.

63
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:22,257
Your working memory, your attentional control, all of your control over what your body does

64
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,260
and your ability to process information in and output activity out.

65
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:30,563
And it happens within the virtual environment of whatever game a player is playing.

66
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:36,317
So we like to hit four different aspects when it comes to health and wellness for players.

67
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:42,461
One being probably the most obvious, healthy movement, posture, exercise outside of game

68
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,542
time, changing position while playing.

69
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:46,623
taking breaks and using them accordingly.

70
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:51,688
That's probably the most obvious component of health and wellness in gaming and eSports.

71
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:55,832
Equally important, though, is a healthy environment, one that supports you in your play.

72
00:04:56,393 --> 00:05:00,817
And that's both physical, in terms of your chair, your keyboard height, whether or not

73
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:04,260
you're using armrests, the height of your monitor, the angle of your backrest, whether

74
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,322
your feet are on the ground or not.

75
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:09,705
If you're short like me, you may tend towards the feet, not on the ground, with that little

76
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:10,206
extra help.

77
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,992
It also has to do with your social environment.

78
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:18,215
One of the things that I really like about the area I work in, I work on the East Coast,

79
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:23,998
we have this company called the Game Gym, which runs intramural eSports leagues for

80
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,363
elementary and middle school and high school kids kind of developing that same

81
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:32,765
healthy social environment that you might get from playing intramural soccer

82
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:37,109
or you know pick up basketball games but with something that these kids already

83
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:40,672
really like just building out a good social structure on top of good gaming

84
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:41,153
behaviors.

85
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:46,660
We also approach it from the aspect of healthy eating, which doesn't just mean, you know,

86
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:50,944
following any one particular restricted diet, but more addressing the general health and

87
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:53,787
wellness that comes through good nutrition and good hydration.

88
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:58,491
And then the last piece being healthy thinking, your mindset about how you're playing, your

89
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:03,756
ability to be mentally resilient, to recover from setbacks, from things that cause you

90
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:04,877
distress while you're playing.

91
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:11,721
Those are kind of the more obvious aspects of health and wellness in terms of why somebody

92
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:12,601
might be interested in them.

93
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,965
But if you are specifically designing games, you may be interested in, why does health

94
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:20,469
and wellness matter to my specific gaming community, other than, well, they don't get

95
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:22,170
injured and if they're not injured, they can play more.

96
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:27,109
For one thing, it can significantly contribute to player experience and player retention.

97
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,072
For another thing, it's really important, especially if you're trying to get integrated

98
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:35,334
into an eSports scene, to retain and develop top-tier athletes and streamers.

99
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:41,998
It also can help you develop those tier two, tier three teams and organizations that really

100
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,340
want to contribute to the community, but aren't quite at that top level just yet.

101
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:52,995
That being said, obviously developing an esports ecosystem is not viable for every game there is.

102
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:54,637
And that's totally fine.

103
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:59,462
Developing a community, though, that's not only viable, that's essential for every game there is.

104
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:05,729
Two of the key areas for player retention would be achievement and friends.

105
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:08,032
And that was from a recent research study that came out.

106
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:10,733
Although probably most of you in gaming already knew this.

107
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:13,034
They just formalized it with a research paper.

108
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,135
So when it comes to achievements,

109
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:18,996
we want to look at things like enabling achievement hunters

110
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:21,157
to feel as though they've progressed within a game.

111
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:26,259
Health and wellness can be used to link in-game and out-of-game character growth,

112
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:27,500
and I'll expand on that in a minute.

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,441
And players want to be able to gain prominence or reputation

114
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:33,522
or respect for unique traits.

115
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:39,304
So when it comes to character growth and gaming prominence and reputation,

116
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,506
every game wants to be able to be shown off,

117
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:46,327
and every player wants to be able to show off their prowess at their play.

118
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:51,609
So if we put players in a position where not only can they show off how they do in game,

119
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,431
but out of game, we're suddenly linking those two communities,

120
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,012
the online sphere and the IRL development.

121
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:03,501
That allows players to stand out not just for their ability to play well,

122
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,902
but especially when those players who play well additionally stand out

123
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:09,684
because they're doing something incredible with their bodies.

124
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:14,226
Think of players who rock climb and brag about the fact that

125
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:18,488
I went rock climbing this weekend, I did a V5, and this was my first time doing it.

126
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,349
solo, that's a big deal.

127
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:22,930
And if the community gets that,

128
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,530
that's something else that they can bond over.

129
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,631
Finding kind of these little sub-communities

130
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:28,712
within your gaming community is a really good way

131
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:31,653
to create a stronger sense of cohesion.

132
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,634
It gives players something to show off and bond over.

133
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:38,235
And of course, you know, if everybody wants to bond over

134
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:39,575
having beat a really hard raid,

135
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,376
or having been a particularly difficult boss,

136
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,677
or finally overcoming their demon

137
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:45,898
when it comes to a certain matchup.

138
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,584
We can also develop that in the form of an IRL community.

139
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:52,806
Sorry about that.

140
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:59,414
And the growth of that IRL community supports growth of the online and in-game community.

141
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:04,460
When it comes to friends, that kind of shouts back to what I was talking about in the last slide.

142
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,922
When it comes to the importance of the social development of a game,

143
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:11,365
how the community feels as though they are tied together.

144
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:15,008
So it's really important, obviously, to develop these cross-linked communities,

145
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:20,592
utilizing things like Discord, Reddit, YouTube, Twitch, and your own gaming forums, if you have them.

146
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:25,594
You don't want players to just stay isolated on any one of those particular platforms.

147
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,875
You want them to be able to be moving and migrating between all of those.

148
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:36,078
Healthy behaviors and healthy content programming can really help that to occur, especially

149
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,239
if you're doing something like, say, having a...

150
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,003
server-wide challenge. We've done recently at Genesis, was the last event that I worked,

151
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:49,946
we did a planking competition. And we had it running the whole day, we had it advertised

152
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:53,929
in our Discord server, we had it advertised on Twitter, we had like this big whiteboard

153
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,950
and people were taking pictures and tweeting themselves out, I held it for this long, I

154
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,573
held it for that long. And so all the while while these pools are going, and people of

155
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,094
course are going oh and toom, pools.

156
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:05,255
There were people who would come over after they went through pools,

157
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:08,196
kind of just wander through the vendor area, would find us and be like,

158
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:10,437
oh, I can do this, this is a thing I can do.

159
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,059
So even on those occasions where your players are feeling less successful at an in-game behavior,

160
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,940
giving them an out-of-game behavior that they can also control,

161
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:21,802
again, makes them feel more successful. That shouts back to achievement.

162
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:26,649
Health and wellness behaviors are also really key for community development.

163
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,350
Look at what's happening right now with the FitFGC movement.

164
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,271
Look at what's happening with ExoAcademy.

165
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,952
So ExoAcademy is kind of neat.

166
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:40,455
It's a bit of a unique subset in that they're developing within the FGC community this team

167
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:45,637
that specifically sponsors two female players per four-week cycle before a big gaming event

168
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:47,318
like Final Round this weekend.

169
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:53,020
During those four weeks, the players work with an individual coach, they have special coaches,

170
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,881
they had me, I have to be honest, I have some bias here,

171
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:00,883
they have a media coach, they have someone who coaches them on commentary,

172
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:05,884
on how to do an interview, and within those communities there's like this whole,

173
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,646
there's this whole degree of excitement about not only are we working on developing

174
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,988
a potentially underdeveloped group within the FGC,

175
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,830
that is, female players at a high level,

176
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:18,953
but we're also linking it to their healthy behaviors.

177
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:21,796
For a whole first week of their four-week cycle,

178
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,537
they were all posting about,

179
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:25,559
oh, I did this new stretch, this new exercise,

180
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,000
look at my new weightlifting form.

181
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:32,064
Again, it goes back to allowing that IRL community growth,

182
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:35,006
which then supports the online and in-game community.

183
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,958
Because the more the players are invested in each other,

184
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,579
the more they are invested in the game that they're playing together,

185
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,940
that thing that they share together.

186
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:48,262
When it comes to retaining and developing athletes and influencers,

187
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:52,444
obviously, players who don't get injured play more and play longer.

188
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:53,764
That was pretty apparent.

189
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:59,707
But this can also be applied to a little bit more specific interests

190
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:01,687
for both athletes and for streamers,

191
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,148
which are two pretty important populations at this point.

192
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:06,730
When it comes to influencers or streamers,

193
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,492
involving healthy behaviors and healthy gaming content,

194
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,453
that gives them an opportunity for a new kind of variety streaming.

195
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,274
It's not just the game that they're playing,

196
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,075
but they can also be showing off,

197
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:19,317
oh, here are the stretches that I do between games

198
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:22,939
to make sure that I can play these 8-10 hours that I'm streaming for you.

199
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,801
Here are the exercises that I do to keep myself healthy on my off days.

200
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,182
Here are the healthy behaviors that I engage in

201
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:32,424
that make me able to do what I like to do.

202
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:38,186
It allows for increased community interaction, again, especially when it comes to developing some kind of competition.

203
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,387
A good deal of people who play video games like to compete at them.

204
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:44,928
A good deal of us like to feel as though we've done something exceptional or special.

205
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:51,950
So having a friendly rivalry, a friendly competition, is absolutely a really easy way to develop that.

206
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,771
And again, that allows you to build it across multiple platforms, Discord, Reddit, YouTube, etc.

207
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:00,734
It also can contribute to the development of parasocial relationships.

208
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:05,719
On the one hand, we want to be cautious about the degree to which streamers develop parasocial

209
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,721
relationships with their communities and vice versa.

210
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:13,186
You don't ever want streamers to feel as though they are obligated to their communities, and

211
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,669
we don't want gaming communities to feel as though

212
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,273
A streamer is closer to them than they actually are,

213
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:24,395
in the sense that we don't want an unhealthy connection between the two of them.

214
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:28,698
But healthy gaming behaviors promoting not only physical health,

215
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:29,899
but also mental health,

216
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,441
is a really good way to kind of establish a healthier parasocial relationship,

217
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:36,203
while still maintaining that degree of community integration,

218
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:40,446
and getting players interested in playing this game that their favorite streamer is playing.

219
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,527
Again, if they're interested in that person,

220
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,129
they'll be interested in what they're doing.

221
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:46,030
If they're interested in what they're doing, they're playing that game.

222
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,713
When it comes to more of the eSports sphere,

223
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:54,877
there's been an increased emphasis on not just injury prevention,

224
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:57,899
but on performance enhancement in the last couple of years.

225
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,523
And I can say that pretty confidently because I've worked with a number of teams in the past couple of years,

226
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:05,105
and the questions I was getting went from,

227
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,908
okay, how do I treat the fact that I've been sitting with horrible posture all this time,

228
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:11,730
and how do I deal with this wrist injury,

229
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,953
and how do I deal with the fact that I got really mad at the International,

230
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:15,253
and...

231
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:19,777
kicked a curb because I was so mad we got knocked out and now I think I may have broken my toe.

232
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:27,123
That was a unique one. How do we go from that? We've now progressed to how do I use these healthy

233
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:31,486
behaviors to make myself a better athlete? How does this contribute to my ability to play at

234
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:37,071
the highest level? We've got teams like LA Valiant and the Immortal Squad have their own physical

235
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:37,531
therapist.

236
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:40,895
who does individualized programming for each player,

237
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:44,539
not only addressing their specific injury prevention needs,

238
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:46,361
but also their overall health and wellness.

239
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:48,443
Working with a nutritionist to develop their

240
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:51,086
healthy eating habits.

241
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:53,388
Working with a local gym to develop

242
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:57,790
a good routine for them, just something simple that they can do together.

243
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:04,175
That allows the team to have a bonding activity that isn't solely directed by we must scrim

244
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:08,399
on this game together, we must play this game together and develop specifically in game.

245
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,703
It allows for a more organic connection between them, which in turn allows for more comfort

246
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:15,344
playing together in a competitive environment.

247
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:20,488
And when it comes to health and wellness for athletes in particular,

248
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,591
developer investment can really lead the way.

249
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:27,854
So most recently, Hi-Rez partnered with a local hospital

250
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:31,978
that will be doing basically eSports health screens for their players at the beginning of seasons,

251
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,239
which I'm super excited about.

252
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:39,220
Other people may not geek about that quite as much as I do, but I will say that that's really key because

253
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,661
we're kind of crossing that gap between

254
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:49,483
the eSports community and the medical community and allowing the medical community to develop along with the gaming community.

255
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:55,964
That's something that I'm going to hit on a little later in the presentation as well, but for now I'll just say it's really important that

256
00:15:56,604 --> 00:16:00,365
the healthcare professionals who become involved in gaming who are contributing to

257
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:04,629
The development of health and wellness programming within gaming and eSports spheres.

258
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,995
That they have the degree of understanding of what your community is and what your community needs.

259
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:14,920
Which means it's also really key for developers and communities to be expressing that.

260
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,164
To be able to have a clear sense of identity and to be able to express that identity.

261
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:27,230
So, for an example, the multiblood community is clearly and distinctly able to play just

262
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:27,790
about anywhere.

263
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,072
That is a key part of their community identity.

264
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:35,255
It is, they are adaptive, they are flexible, they are able to make it work in places that

265
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,597
gaming possibly maybe should not actually work, like bathrooms.

266
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:40,218
But you know what?

267
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:40,899
That's them.

268
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:41,659
That's what they do.

269
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,400
That's who they are.

270
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:47,074
The FIT FGC movement is kind of a similar subset.

271
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:52,099
The idea that players are being known not only for their skill in game,

272
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,483
but I'm known because I have made this improvement to my life.

273
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:58,386
I have lost this weight. I have gained this muscle mass.

274
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,789
I have been able to do this new thing that I could not do previously.

275
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,654
That's really key to developing a well-integrated community, too.

276
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:12,862
So, what are some of the ways you can start to incorporate health and wellness programming

277
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:17,466
within your game, whether or not you are an eSport, whether you're competitive or casual

278
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:18,387
or some mix of the two?

279
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:23,052
For one thing, in-game is a really easy way to incorporate.

280
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:26,323
So toast text, those little pop-ups you get, for example.

281
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,565
On the bright side, they are minimally disruptive.

282
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:31,427
They don't do too much to disrupt the gaming experience,

283
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:33,709
which is great, because at any stop point,

284
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:35,991
you run the risk of losing some degree of players.

285
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:39,554
And as much as it'd be great to say have physical health tips

286
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:40,675
as part of a tutorial,

287
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:43,458
as much as technical skill or in-game abilities,

288
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:46,040
you're more likely to lose your players early,

289
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,601
when they have less investment in the game,

290
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:48,682
than later on in the game,

291
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:51,044
when they're invested in playing more or finishing it.

292
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:55,446
So when it comes to toast text, because they have to be very short,

293
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,667
because they involve almost no interaction,

294
00:17:58,147 --> 00:18:00,347
because they can irritate players to have frequent pop-ups,

295
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:05,369
and because they run the risk of causing players to lose interest or to leave the game,

296
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:10,350
if you're going to use toast text as an opportunity to build in health and wellness for your players,

297
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:12,691
they should be short and general tips.

298
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:16,032
They should be things that are for general, not specific habits.

299
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:21,415
So things like, have a drink of water, don't forget to stretch, take a break every 30 minutes,

300
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:23,857
take three really deep breaths, check your posture.

301
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:27,679
Things like that are a really easy way to involve toast techs.

302
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,762
And in that way, you're not risking alienating your players quite so much.

303
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:37,078
Contextualized tips and using loading screens and saving quit screens are when you can get

304
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:38,259
a little more specific.

305
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:42,940
With contextualized tips, after a period of time, maybe after a section of your game that

306
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,801
you know requires a high APM, after a certain number of matches, or even within that, a

307
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:53,243
certain number of won or lost matches, it can be better to put these on loading or save

308
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:56,043
and quit screens because they afford you more space and time.

309
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:59,405
Players expect to spend more time there.

310
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:03,168
And it's a larger space than just a little tiny pop-up box.

311
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:06,450
Here you could do something like putting a picture of a stretch,

312
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,493
or putting a picture of a series of stretches, or more specific reminders.

313
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:14,856
You can also use something like a lore book or a codex

314
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:18,318
as a really good space for achievement hunters in particular,

315
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,319
and I will admit to being an achievement hunter.

316
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,521
Anyone in my Guild Wars 2 guild will tell you that.

317
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,660
So if I see a pop-up that I've got something unchecked in my lore book, I want to go and

318
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,181
look right now.

319
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:31,022
I want to see what it is and what I have got and what have I earned.

320
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:35,645
So in the same way that you can get entries if, say, you discover a particular kind of

321
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:41,288
flower in an open world exploration, you could use time or ability-gated checkpoints to create

322
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:42,689
healthy habits entries.

323
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,431
So let's say your game allows you to track when a player has used a certain skill.

324
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,694
Maybe something that involves a multi-button input or a really quick movement like, say,

325
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:51,634
Dave Dashing in Melee.

326
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:55,539
Or cycling through a chain of skills like invoker in Dota 2.

327
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:59,124
You could have a toast text that indicates they have a new achievement available to view

328
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:02,990
and it's available after their next break or their next match, etc.

329
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,934
So there's no kind of time pressure, no immediate pressure to see it.

330
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:11,489
And then when they go to check, there's an entry in their codex or whatever is to use to track achievement in your game that shows,

331
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:17,354
you know, here's a good stretch to use after you've performed that skill ten, a hundred, a thousand times.

332
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:20,637
Or here's a good strengthening exercise to make that chain easier to perform.

333
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:25,641
It's the kind of thing that could even have the image of one of your characters demonstrating how to do,

334
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:27,943
which again kind of ties back into lore stuff.

335
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:32,892
And similarly you can have time gated prompt along the lines of achievement unlocked x

336
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:37,477
hours of play that corresponds to a codex entry showing a quick one to two minute break

337
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:39,319
routine that players can do to avoid injury.

338
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,361
So other ways you can also incorporate things is out of game.

339
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:51,506
And again, I recognize that for not every gaming company is out of game or at a tournament

340
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,788
or eSports a viable option.

341
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:54,749
And that's okay.

342
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:59,413
We're going to go over a couple of ways that this can work regardless of game development

343
00:20:59,453 --> 00:20:59,813
size.

344
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:05,017
So yes, IRL Health and Wellness is not just the domain of huge companies like Riot, Blizzard

345
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:05,478
and Valve.

346
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:07,640
There's plenty of ways that smaller companies and teams.

347
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,210
can incorporate health and wellness from professionals as well.

348
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:16,593
So definitely one of the bigger studio things would be pre-season screening and league setups,

349
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:20,934
allowing for players to be assessed for their injury risk at the beginning of a season,

350
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:25,276
which then allows for players to have specific injury prevention routines built for them

351
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:25,736
as they go.

352
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:32,072
Sponsored clinics at tournaments are a bit more of a viable option for anywhere from

353
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:33,673
mid to large tier companies.

354
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:37,776
Something like I mentioned being at Genesis recently.

355
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,899
We had a community health clinic there where anybody could stop by at any time.

356
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,420
They could get an assessment.

357
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,123
They could get some kind of basic treatment and some suggestions on what they could do

358
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:48,663
to follow up.

359
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:53,147
And then on the playoff day, on the third day of the tournament,

360
00:21:53,408 --> 00:21:56,471
we had a top eight specific clinic where we were only backstage,

361
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:58,433
only working with the top tier players,

362
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:02,237
so they felt as though there was something unique and special and individual

363
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:05,560
being provided to them, kind of the same way that an athletic trainer

364
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,943
might be available for a traditional sports team before a match.

365
00:22:10,348 --> 00:22:15,012
And even if your game exists entirely online, there are ways that you can incorporate professional

366
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:15,793
help for your community.

367
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:21,899
You can use graphic guides, you can use text-based guides, you can use video guides.

368
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,343
For us, we found that graphics tend to get the best interaction because they're short,

369
00:22:26,423 --> 00:22:27,404
simple, and straightforward.

370
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:31,868
You can kind of do them on your own time or pace, and they don't require as much investment

371
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:34,730
in the sense that you don't have to scroll through something, you don't have to sit and

372
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,391
watch something.

373
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:42,920
Absolutely, text and video have a higher degree of interaction required, which can result

374
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,942
in kind of a deeper connection.

375
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:48,888
But if you want players to quickly pick up on something new and healthy, a picture graphic

376
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:52,092
has been, in our experience at 1HP, the easiest way to go.

377
00:22:53,193 --> 00:22:57,115
And you can both make use of and grow your cross-linked communities with health content,

378
00:22:57,155 --> 00:23:00,557
especially if you're incorporating challenges or competitions.

379
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:04,539
And you definitely want to have your community involved in the development of guides.

380
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,822
And whatever ergonomics and injury prevention folks you end up working with,

381
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,983
they should be integrated into those communities.

382
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:15,725
They should be in a position to seek feedback and get good feedback and good questions

383
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,426
so that they know what your community needs

384
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:20,248
and they aren't just developing what they think your community needs.

385
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,652
So in that regard, I don't know how that got moved around there.

386
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:35,638
So in that regard, the kinds of people that you want involved in your communities could

387
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:40,200
be anything from physical therapists, a little bit biased there, but also you could involve

388
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,123
personal trainers, exercise kinesiologists, you could use certified strength and conditioning

389
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:46,844
specialists, you could use athletic trainers.

390
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:51,646
There are a lot of folks who can help contribute to healthy behaviors in your communities,

391
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:56,269
but if you're going to do that, you need to know what to look for within those individuals,

392
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:58,410
what kind of attitudes they should have.

393
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,694
Generally speaking, they should be interested and invested in what your community is doing.

394
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:08,217
They shouldn't be just doing this because they've heard that esports and gaming has a whole bunch of money in it.

395
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:14,081
That's also for the benefit of your community in that they're not going to buy in to whoever's trying to help them

396
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:17,523
if they don't believe that whoever's in your community is actually trying to help them.

397
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:22,787
Gamers are understandably and justifiably skeptical about non-endemic sources coming in and working with them.

398
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:25,709
And I think that's one of the things that Matt and I have really going for us.

399
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,510
We both play a lot.

400
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:32,658
Possibly more than I should given that I have a full-time job and an esports job on top of that.

401
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,539
But that means we have a degree of understanding.

402
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:43,082
Any professional who's working in your community should also have an understanding of not only what controller your players are using primarily,

403
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:50,865
but also kind of specific inputs involved in that. I've used the wave dashing analogy before speaking about Smash Melee specifically.

404
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:52,946
But if your community

405
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:57,488
uses specific inputs in a specific order, if they are

406
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:02,049
There are certain high-level skills that require them to move through a very high APM.

407
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:05,791
Your healthcare professionals who are helping you need to know about that.

408
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:10,572
They can't just be like, oh, okay, well, I know that they use this type of controller.

409
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:12,033
They use a GameCube controller.

410
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:15,374
If you don't know what they're doing on the GameCube controller, it's not terribly helpful.

411
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:21,406
And last but not least, they should really be invested in the growth of your community.

412
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:25,009
They should actually give a shit about whether or not your community gets better.

413
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:29,232
They should be in this because they want to see players play more and hurt less.

414
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:32,834
And I think I'm right on time then.

415
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,696
This is the part where I remind you of two things.

416
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:37,617
Thing number one, please fill out your survey.

417
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:40,619
Thing number two, this is the part where you can ask all of the questions.

418
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,242
And if we run out of time for questions, we will go to Overlook 3024 after this.

419
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:58,525
I think there is a microphone in the middle of the room if folks do have questions.

420
00:25:58,585 --> 00:25:58,986
Hi, Patrick.

421
00:25:59,226 --> 00:25:59,426
Hi.

422
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:05,551
So when I grew up playing video games in arcades, I'd often see that winners don't use drugs

423
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:08,274
screen show up before playing Ninja Turtles or whatever.

424
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:14,739
And so I would expect that health stuff around video games can come off as kind of hokey.

425
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,723
How have you found players to be engaging with this kind of stuff?

426
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:21,950
That's a really good question and one of the biggest things that Matt and I have had to

427
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,410
confront.

428
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:27,033
So Patrick was asking how do we make it not seem hokey, how do we make it not a, you know,

429
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,334
just say no to drugs, a la Nancy Reagan.

430
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:34,117
One of the biggest things that we found helps is talking about the injuries we've experienced

431
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:39,200
and making sure that players know to appreciate the person who's giving them the advice.

432
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,602
So when players and high level competitors in particular are open and honest about the

433
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:47,084
difficulties they've faced and the people they've trusted or the things that they've

434
00:26:47,144 --> 00:26:47,565
changed.

435
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:50,646
That's a really good way to get more community buy-in.

436
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:54,588
A good deal of it is out-of-game education.

437
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:58,269
So being able to make it clear to players why they should give a shit about this,

438
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:01,811
why this should matter to them, how this can specifically help them play better,

439
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:04,192
not just avoid being injured.

440
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:06,853
When it comes to the in-game pop-ups,

441
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:10,314
I definitely, growing up, more than once saw the

442
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:12,735
take a break every 60 minutes and just laughed at it because...

443
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:17,459
No, no, I'm not taking a break. You can't make me.

444
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,184
That's why it's important to kind of use those opportunities where you have more space and time available to you to explain why they should

445
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:25,645
be taking a break every 60 minutes.

446
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:29,849
So that's not just feeling like somebody's mom tapping them on the shoulder and saying, okay, honey,

447
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:31,570
you've been in front of the screen for long enough.

448
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,733
So that it's more clear that it's a this is in your best interest and you can totally come right back to this.

449
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:38,896
That's why the educational component is so key.

450
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:45,374
Any other questions?

451
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,137
Hey. Hi. Hello.

452
00:27:54,717 --> 00:28:01,800
Um, question. Clearly, eSports is an extremely competitive landscape, and there's all kinds of competing teams.

453
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,660
That's what they're there to do in many regards.

454
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:06,821
Um, and with something like this, and health and wellness being so...

455
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:12,395
So important to every human who's participating at an elite level in competitive gaming.

456
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:15,917
From your perspective, how do you address that?

457
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:22,999
So in working with different eSports organizations, as you may be or certainly aware of the relevance

458
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,801
of all of this no matter which team you're playing for, is there a way that you're addressing

459
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,822
that opportunity in a way that

460
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:33,750
It reinforces the fact that it will help every player become better in their game,

461
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:38,153
but then also addresses some of the concerns that individual esports organizations might

462
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:42,095
have as this topic of esports performance continues to be more top of mind for them

463
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:44,076
and perhaps a point of differentiation that

464
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:47,968
know, they might be able to provide their players in terms of helping just their players

465
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:48,889
improve their performance.

466
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:52,411
So if you have a general stance on that, I would be super curious to hear about it.

467
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:52,931
Sure.

468
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:58,955
So when it comes to helping players and organizations develop individualized content, what's really

469
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:01,836
key there is understanding what the players need in the first place.

470
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:06,879
That's why it's really important not just to pick the right branch of healthcare professional,

471
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:08,500
but also the right type of healthcare professional.

472
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:15,585
So if you're thinking about involving someone in your organization, you need to make sure that their views are in line with yours.

473
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:22,350
Or, if they're not in line with yours, you find what the mismatch is and understand why they feel the way they do about how your players should be getting better.

474
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:28,295
That's also why it's really key that any healthcare professional working with teams in esports in particular,

475
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:32,236
has a really solid understanding of what that game entails,

476
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:36,357
what controllers are used, what specific motions are used most frequently,

477
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:38,377
and what players are most at risk for.

478
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:42,218
Because without that underlying knowledge, without that basis,

479
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:46,059
players aren't going to trust, organizations shouldn't trust,

480
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,860
and nobody's actually going to get better.

481
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,681
So when it comes to building that individualized content,

482
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:52,721
it really requires...

483
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,854
a good degree of investment from the person who is working with you,

484
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:02,178
and it really requires a good degree of investment from the players in the community themselves

485
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:06,601
to be willing and comfortable with speaking with that healthcare professional.

486
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:09,362
So it has to be someone who has the trust of the community,

487
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:13,765
which generally requires that they at least do some amount of play of the game themselves.

488
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:24,376
So we're kind of coming out of this era where players only know how to get better by playing

489
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:25,938
10, 12, 14 hours a day.

490
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:29,962
And while that's ending, there's still a lot of players who play on that kind of frame

491
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:30,382
of mind.

492
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:34,766
Grind solo queue for X days at a time, get better.

493
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:40,051
So are there methodologies or tactics that you use as a motivational tool to get some

494
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,314
players to what is effectively eat their vegetables when it comes to this?

495
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:48,859
I have in fact used actually eat your vegetables at players before, but generally it does require

496
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:49,920
a bit more than that, you're right.

497
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,221
So when it comes to helping players recognize why the behaviors that they're currently engaging

498
00:30:56,261 --> 00:31:00,683
in may not be the healthiest or the most effective way, I've found that education is still the

499
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:01,523
easiest way to do it.

500
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:07,725
Making it clear to players why this is useful for them, what the research supports, and

501
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:09,325
what the research is in the first place.

502
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:14,189
So, Matt and I frequently reference something called a heat meter, which is, you know, the

503
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:17,491
idea of in a game if you have a gun, you use it a whole bunch of times, it's eventually

504
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:19,893
going to overheat, you're going to need to reset and cool all the way down.

505
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:24,456
It's a really easy mechanism for explaining to players that, hey, if you're doing this

506
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:27,999
for this many hours, you're going to hit an overheat point, and when your body overheats,

507
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,161
we don't just mean that, you know, you get a hot sweats or something, instead you're

508
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:31,822
going to get injured.

509
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:33,863
There are a lot of ways to avoid that.

510
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:35,024
Let's talk about some of them.

511
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:39,746
It's also been really helpful that us physical health care professionals have been working

512
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:43,769
with a lot more mental health professionals, sports psychologists, performance coaches

513
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:49,974
and the likes, and using what we know from traditional sports models of training periodization.

514
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:52,156
And training periodization refers to

515
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:57,921
looking at macro cycles like a preseason, in-season, off-season, or preseason, in-season,

516
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:03,666
post-season, off-season, and then more micro cycles, which are within a week or within a day

517
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:09,490
even, of how do we structure practice to be the most efficient possible? How do we make it so that

518
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:14,995
what you're doing, all of it, is useful, directed, and actually going to have a result?

519
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:19,240
So we found a lot of success in just coming to a team and saying,

520
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,524
hey, let's talk about how you're practicing, why you practice that way,

521
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:24,126
and what you're getting out of it in the first place.

522
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,989
It's especially good when we can get players to realize,

523
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,093
well, I'm doing this and I'm kind of still stuck at.

524
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:37,240
I'm kind of still stuck at, you know, my 3,000 MMR that I've been stuck at for the last three years,

525
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,064
and I'm going to keep practicing the exact same way, and that's not going to get me better.

526
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:43,566
Okay, how do I do something different? What's the different thing that I do?

527
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:47,209
Making those options and that knowledge available to players is really, really key,

528
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,454
and organizations, not only team organizations, but developers, are in a really unique position

529
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,937
to be able to put that content somewhere where players are absolutely going to find it.

530
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:06,310
And I think if anybody else does have more questions,

531
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,953
we can all hang out at the overlook spot.

532
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:11,096
But we are at the end of this session time.

533
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:12,778
So please make sure to fill out that survey.

534
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:16,083
That's how GDC gets all of their updates and changes and such.
