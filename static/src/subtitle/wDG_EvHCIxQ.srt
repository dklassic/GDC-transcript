1
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:05,858
All right, hello.

2
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:07,419
My name is Gwen.

3
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:08,760
I'm an indie developer.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,881
I've been in the industry for 12 years now.

5
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:13,142
These are some of my credits.

6
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:16,924
I started out in online games working on Marvel Heroes.

7
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:19,785
I worked in the Bioshock Infinite franchise.

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:22,207
I founded an indie studio with several other people.

9
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:23,897
I did that about five years ago.

10
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:28,283
And a year and a half ago, I did the craziest thing I've ever done.

11
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:30,927
I quit all of that and I went solo.

12
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:35,854
I founded my own indie studio to make one specific game, Kine.

13
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:37,918
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.

14
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:38,899
I'm going to talk about Kine.

15
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,447
This is a narrative puzzle game.

16
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,208
It's about six hours long.

17
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:45,951
It's got a wide variety of spatial puzzles.

18
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,893
There's different characters that have their own way of navigating the world.

19
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:51,675
And you have to kind of figure out how to move through the

20
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:52,716
world with these characters.

21
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:55,979
And as the game progresses, you have to complete different puzzles, like

22
00:00:56,099 --> 00:01:00,603
Sokoban style stuff or sliding puzzles and so forth, but what makes the game

23
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:03,866
unique is that the mechanics aren't introduced arbitrarily.

24
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:06,007
The mechanics exist to tell a story.

25
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:13,793
So when I have sliding puzzles in the game, those puzzles exist so that two characters can go dancing together or go on a boat ride together.

26
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,976
All of the mechanics service the narrative of the game.

27
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:21,379
That's the point. Kine is a game that tells a story using puzzles.

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,483
I released this game on PC just last year, actually, at the end of the year.

29
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:29,985
I released it on console as well and on Google Stadia.

30
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:33,108
And I'm happy to say that this game was very successful.

31
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:35,550
I'm really proud of this game.

32
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:36,999
I loved making it.

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,982
But I have to admit, when I started making this, I didn't sit down and plan to make a

34
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:46,384
six-hour puzzle game that tells a story with puzzles.

35
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:47,404
That's crazy.

36
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:48,585
I would never do that.

37
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:51,126
I'm not a designer.

38
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:55,128
I've never actually wanted to be a designer until I made this game.

39
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:00,751
In all my years in the industry, my background has always been in animation, tech animation,

40
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,472
and sometimes in the business side of things.

41
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:06,064
So I don't have a design desire to do this.

42
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:10,168
And honestly, in all of my years in the industry, I've never worked on a puzzle game.

43
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:12,770
I never even considered making one.

44
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,794
And in my time as a person running a business, like helping to run an indie studio,

45
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:22,797
if you had asked me before this game what you should make,

46
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:27,021
what's a good idea for something to make, I would not have advised you to make a...

47
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:33,132
narrative single-player game without any replay value. These are not the kinds of games that tend

48
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:37,513
to be really successful in the marketplace for indies. This is not the kind of game you should

49
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:43,675
invest a lot of time or money into, right? But I did. Is the problem. I definitely did. I spent

50
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:46,655
two and a half years of my life on this game. I spent $420,000 on this game.

51
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:54,241
And that's a lot of time and a lot of money to put into something that probably I would

52
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:58,446
have advised against early on. I would have said that this wouldn't be a commercially viable

53
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:03,871
product. But I spent that time and I spent that money and I have absolutely no regrets.

54
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,134
I'm really proud of this game and I love it.

55
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,365
And so that's what this talk is about today.

56
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:14,768
This is a sort of a postmortem, but I'm going to explain what I was thinking as I

57
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:18,150
developed the game and how I came to the conclusion that I should invest this

58
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,192
time in this money, and I'm going to go over some of the things I learned along

59
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:28,017
the way, and it's going to be difficult to explain exactly what I was thinking

60
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:32,020
when I came up with the idea for Kine, but I did used to record my desktop at

61
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,161
all times so I can show you.

62
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:37,007
Before I made Kine, this is what I was doing.

63
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:40,588
I had a full-time job and I was messing around after work

64
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:43,249
in blueprints, blueprint scripting for fun.

65
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,590
And I was mostly trying to explore different animation ideas.

66
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,351
I had this idea in particular of a character that,

67
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,552
like a humanoid character that would roll around

68
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:53,752
in the world and kick off of walls to move around

69
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:56,173
rather than using run cycles and so forth.

70
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:58,154
I prototyped that character with a cube

71
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,534
that had kind of like appendages that would extend.

72
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,315
You can see here, this was the beginning of that prototype.

73
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:08,817
And as I was coming up with this tech for this thing that would be a humanoid character, I

74
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:13,398
honestly just really liked the cube. I just liked the way the cube moved, I thought it was fun.

75
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:19,060
So in the beginning, I was just working on animation tech, and I really liked the animation

76
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,982
tech I was doing, and I wanted to make a game to justify this tech demo. So in the beginning,

77
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:30,784
I sat down with this tech demo and I thought, can I make a game out of this? Can I justify

78
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:31,944
a reason to keep working on it?

79
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,896
So I started working on a puzzle game.

80
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:38,899
Um, and I call this phase the brainstorming phase.

81
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,200
I, at this point, I didn't even realize I was making a game yet.

82
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,381
I just had an idea.

83
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,703
I like the way this character moves and I want to come up with, uh,

84
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:47,845
something game-like that uses it.

85
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,551
And you'll see here different things I tried.

86
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,712
Maybe the limb gets in your way and it blocks you from moving around.

87
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,812
Maybe there's sliding puzzles.

88
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,353
I tried things where you're like a Tetris shape that tries to

89
00:04:57,393 --> 00:04:58,294
roll through holes in the walls.

90
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:01,855
I just experimented a lot with different mechanics that were interesting over

91
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:03,156
the course of about four months.

92
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,997
And when I thought I was onto something, I made a video of it.

93
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:10,459
So after four months of the brainstorming phase, I made this video.

94
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:15,305
And I sent it to my friends and I asked them if they thought I should make this into a game.

95
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:18,206
And I completely ignored their advice because I didn't care.

96
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:22,508
At this point, when I made this video, I pretty much knew that I wanted to make this game.

97
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:26,910
But I also, keep in mind, at this point I was working after work.

98
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,113
And I knew that making a puzzle game probably wouldn't be a commercially viable project.

99
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:36,214
So this was going to be a hobby project of mine.

100
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:42,103
and at work right when I made this video we were going down to working about 20 hours a week part

101
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:48,152
time. So I realized at this moment I wanted to make this hobby project and I have the time to do it.

102
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:53,170
And I came up with a plan and I call this plan the first scope of the game.

103
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,932
At this point, I had decided that I would make a game.

104
00:05:57,152 --> 00:06:00,534
I had spent four months brainstorming and playing around with different ideas.

105
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:06,197
And I knew I had 20 hours a week that I could spend myself for about three to

106
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:08,458
four months until I had to go back to being full-time.

107
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,003
And I figured that was enough time to make about a one hour puzzle game.

108
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:17,327
If I scoped tightly and I focused and I figured I would spend this time, I would

109
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:21,091
make a one hour puzzle game that just kind of refined what I had already built

110
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,353
during that brainstorming phase.

111
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,507
So now I'm going to go over some of the things I learned during scope one.

112
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:30,169
At this point as far as design goes I had never made a puzzle game before

113
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,912
so a lot of those early puzzles were kind of pointless and boring.

114
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:38,736
I cut basically all of them and remade them and I've put a lot of my focus into

115
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:41,217
making sequences of puzzles that I found interesting.

116
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,560
Early on in particular I was really interested in the idea of having a

117
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,102
preset order to puzzles. I really like a crafted experience. I thought it'd be

118
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,984
fun to introduce a mechanic and then

119
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:53,885
introduce another mechanic and then have a puzzle to combine them. I wanted to really

120
00:06:54,346 --> 00:07:00,268
control the experience of the player going through the game. I like that. I like the idea of having

121
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:05,049
that kind of crafted experience but you'll see that that's kind of controversial among puzzle

122
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:10,691
designers. A lot of designers would argue that you should put your, you should have your puzzles in a

123
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:15,633
non-linear order. You should be able to jump around from puzzle to puzzle so if a player gets stuck

124
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:19,415
a player has a different thing that they can kind of jump to and a different thing that they can play.

125
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:22,528
And there's good reasons for this.

126
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:27,991
If you get stuck in a puzzle game, it is very frustrating, more frustrating than any other

127
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,311
genre.

128
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,813
It's important that you're able to jump around and play something else.

129
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,631
because if I guess the best way to explain this is with other games if you're stuck in a game like

130
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:43,413
super meat boy every time you fail in super meat boy you at least feel like you're getting better

131
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:47,575
you feel like your skill is progressing when you fail in a puzzle game you don't ever feel

132
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:52,118
like your skill is progressing you've either you've figured out the puzzle or you have not

133
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:55,940
figured out the puzzle and if you're not if you haven't figured out the puzzle you don't feel

134
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,022
like you're closer to figuring it out and you're just getting more and more frustrated a lot of

135
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:01,683
the time and so it's very important

136
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:06,247
for a puzzle game to give the player the ability to leave and go play something else

137
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,190
as soon as possible when they're stuck. And if you have a very difficult game,

138
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,654
it's important to give the player a lot of different puzzles that they could go play.

139
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:20,380
But in spite of this, I really wanted that crafted experience, and so I kind of came up

140
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,982
with a hybrid solution at the time.

141
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:28,186
I decided to lay out my puzzles in sequences, but have multiple sequences that you could jump between.

142
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:34,669
So this UI kind of shows off what I was going for there. I took the puzzles, I clumped them by mechanics,

143
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,511
and I came up with the concept that they were each different characters. There's three different

144
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,492
characters in this game, and that way I knew there'd be, at any time, three different kinds

145
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:44,673
of sets of puzzles that the player could go between.

146
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:51,292
And so that's something I figured out as far as design goes in the first scope of the game, and we'll get back to that more later.

147
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:56,816
In the first scope of the game, I also had to make a lot of art decisions. A lot of important art pillars were figured out.

148
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:04,061
Specifically, I decided that the game had to have a sketchy art style, because this is a game where you have to cross these gaps in the world.

149
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:07,183
And I needed the player to see where they would land when they crossed a gap.

150
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:12,807
So if I had a sketchy art style, I could have a line that kind of overhangs the world, and I could have the...

151
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:17,969
I could show the grid of the world in negative space so that the player could actually see the

152
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,511
board that they were playing on. Another thing I locked down as far as the art goes was the

153
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:30,453
character design which seems, I guess, obvious in hindsight but the characters had to be designed

154
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:35,535
very intentionally. The mechanics of the game are a bit unusual in that you can stand up off

155
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,697
of a limb. A limb is load-bearing from the side but...

156
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:45,202
or you can stand up off of a limb, but the limb will not bear any load if on the side.

157
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:50,047
So like if the body rolls off the world, if the body of a character rolls off the world,

158
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:54,651
the limbs will not support weight. Or if another character rolls on to a different character's

159
00:09:54,691 --> 00:10:00,055
limb, that limb does not support weight. So the limbs had to look flimsy. They had to also somehow

160
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:03,939
look like they could maintain your weight if you were standing on them.

161
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,224
Also, I needed a way to ground the characters in the world.

162
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:13,133
There needed to be very clear color separations between the different grid units, the different

163
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:15,416
grid tiles that the character was occupying at any time.

164
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,673
so that you could kind of feel out where the character was in the world.

165
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:21,775
This was important to make the game playable, really.

166
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,517
So that's a lot of the stuff I figured out in the first scope of the game.

167
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:30,240
It took about four months, and after four months I made this video and I brought this

168
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,220
video to GDC.

169
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:33,702
This was a trailer of Scope 1.

170
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,363
I showed it at GDC 2018.

171
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:38,945
And this is a trailer for a playable game.

172
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,431
This version of the game was two hours long.

173
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:43,253
I was aiming for one, but I hit two.

174
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:46,297
Uh, and it wasn't completely done.

175
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:49,441
Uh, I did need some UI fixes.

176
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,943
I did need a lot of bug fixing.

177
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:54,727
The game would crash at times, but it was feature complete.

178
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,691
And it was something that I could have polished up and shipped in

179
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,273
my free time if I, if I wanted to.

180
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:05,269
But I didn't want to because I took this to GDC and everybody really liked it and

181
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:06,530
everybody was really supportive.

182
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:09,853
And I just didn't feel ready to be done yet.

183
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:15,637
I decided at this point, because my GDC experience was so positive that I would

184
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:16,697
continue working on the game.

185
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:19,119
And so I sat down and I made a plan for that.

186
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,020
And that plan is Scope 2.

187
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,572
And what this was, was I decided, okay, I've completed scope one.

188
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:27,333
I know exactly what that game would be if I shipped it.

189
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,754
I have it basically done, but I'm not happy with it.

190
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:31,694
I want more mechanics.

191
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:32,695
I want more variety.

192
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:36,436
Uh, I didn't feel like I'd explored everything that this game could do yet.

193
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:42,359
Um, and I talked to, I talked to my coworkers and I decided to stay

194
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,701
part-time for about six to 10 more months to just help me figure out

195
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,202
what I wanted to do to complete the game and wrap up the game.

196
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,163
And this, scope two was probably the most fun.

197
00:11:53,183 --> 00:11:54,924
This is when I think I did the work I liked the most.

198
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:57,946
This is when I decided to both add mechanics to the game

199
00:11:57,986 --> 00:11:59,067
and also add a story.

200
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:00,108
Because at the time,

201
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,309
in my head, these characters had personalities.

202
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:04,291
In my head, these characters were talking to each other,

203
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:06,052
but none of that was actually in the game,

204
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:08,674
in the original puzzle game I had made.

205
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:11,175
And I wanted to actually put that in the game.

206
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:13,957
And so I added a narrative

207
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:15,939
and the narrative drove the mechanics.

208
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:21,698
So for instance, when Euler and Rue were in love, I wanted to show that somehow.

209
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,844
So I thought, well, what would happen if two characters were in love?

210
00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:25,886
Maybe they go dancing.

211
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:26,366
And I looked at.

212
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:30,915
choreography for figure skating and I tried to design puzzles that would make you dance.

213
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:34,277
And that's how I came up with the ideas of these kind of sliding puzzles.

214
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:37,599
It's actually based on watching a lot of figure skating.

215
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,180
On the other hand, later on, I decided I wanted them to fight.

216
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,201
And so what would it look like if these two characters would fight?

217
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,223
I actually didn't have to add any extreme new tech there.

218
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:49,224
I just had to fit the characters on the same...

219
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:53,606
I just had to fit the characters on a smaller board in order to kind of get that.

220
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:58,129
So I was designing puzzles that looked like they were fighting, or here Euler is injured,

221
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,091
and I wanted him to feel like he was limping, I wanted him to feel hurt,

222
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:05,473
and so I designed puzzles where you would have to literally limp through the world.

223
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:10,336
I mean, Euler's always constrained in his movements, but here he feels particularly helpless.

224
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:13,358
This is the kind of stuff I did in the second scope of the game,

225
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,699
and this is the kind of stuff that was honestly my favorite.

226
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:20,620
If I could go back again, I would throw away a lot of the earlier puzzles.

227
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,982
I think what I found was as soon as I had a purpose or an intention for the puzzles,

228
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:28,023
those puzzles were just much stronger.

229
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:28,783
They were funner.

230
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:30,023
It was more fun to make.

231
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:30,964
It was easier to make.

232
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:34,125
And the puzzles tended to sit in the game.

233
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:42,154
in a better way. They had a purpose. Simply exploring a mechanic, I didn't find that those

234
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:46,397
puzzles were necessarily the strongest ones. If I could go back again, I would probably have caught

235
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:52,261
a lot of the main stage stuff, not because it was bad, but because those puzzles didn't really have

236
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:58,405
a purpose. They weren't crafted with any kind of intention. They weren't as grounded in the game

237
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,187
as the puzzles that were designed specifically to tell a narrative.

238
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,842
And that's something I learned in scope two.

239
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:05,364
That's the second scope of the game.

240
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:10,128
Uh, and I had a lot of fun with that, but if you look at this kind of timeline

241
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:13,711
here, you'll see, uh, at this point I had spent what four months brainstorming,

242
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:17,315
uh, four months in scope one and eight months in scope two.

243
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:21,059
So that was a full year that I had spent working part time.

244
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,541
Um, this year I.

245
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:27,758
At this point, I had spent a full year working two jobs.

246
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:31,339
Uh, and that was important cause I needed the money, but it was

247
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,160
really killing me at the time.

248
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,982
I didn't feel like I was burnt out.

249
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,702
I didn't feel like I could keep going.

250
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:42,605
I felt like I wasn't putting my all into my job, uh, my, my proper job.

251
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:45,126
I felt like I was putting way more energy into.

252
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:50,988
kind at home. And so what I figured I would do at this point, I worked it out with my co-workers

253
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:56,110
and I decided I would quit. I would found Chump Squad and the goal was I had found Chump Squad

254
00:14:57,211 --> 00:15:02,613
at this point at the end of Scope 2, I had a another game that was completed that was longer. It was about six hours long

255
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,734
without final art. The art you saw there was

256
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:11,213
final art, but the art, the actual art for the game was the art you saw from Scope One.

257
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:18,956
So I had this finished game and I figured I'd quit my job, I would wrap it up, I would ship it

258
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:22,958
within like two months, and then I would take a break and then I would get another job again.

259
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:27,300
And the reason why I felt like I'd have to get another job again was because I really did not

260
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,402
believe that the version of the game I had would do well in the marketplace. I was proud of it,

261
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:33,702
I loved it, I thought it was really fun.

262
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:39,365
I was excited to ship it and show it to the world, but I knew it wouldn't be commercially

263
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:44,167
successful for a lot of reasons. The biggest being I didn't have any kind of marketing plan.

264
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:50,709
I didn't think the art in the version that I had at that point would stand out in the market.

265
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:57,372
I didn't. I just, it looked bad. It didn't look like something that would be successful

266
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:02,494
in the marketplace. And there are some UI, UX stuff I hoped I could get to,

267
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,495
but I wasn't sure I'd have time before I ran out of money.

268
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:10,057
So I figured I would ship this and then I would have to get another job, but just in

269
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:14,818
case, since I'm quitting my job anyways, I figured I would take one week and put together

270
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:21,160
a pitch deck and I would send it out to all the different publishers just in case somebody

271
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,720
would bite.

272
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,021
And this was a long shot.

273
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:27,822
You have to keep in mind if you pitch a game to publishers, I've done this many times,

274
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:31,823
generally from the moment you pitch until the moment you actually get revenue, that's

275
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:33,103
like at least six months.

276
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:36,618
Six months after you pitch is the earliest you're going to actually

277
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:37,900
see money in your bank account.

278
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,544
And I knew I would probably have to launch the version.

279
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:43,966
I would have to launch kind before then in my head.

280
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,127
I didn't think I'd make it that long.

281
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:50,133
So this is really more of a Hail Mary, but as it turns out, something

282
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:51,314
really unexpected happened.

283
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,556
I quit and I found a chump squad.

284
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:56,279
And three weeks later, the Epic game store launched.

285
00:16:57,987 --> 00:17:02,449
And a matter of a couple of weeks after that, I had assigned exclusivity

286
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,210
deal with Epic Games, which is how I funded Scope 3.

287
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:08,392
And I'll get into Scope 3 in a second, but I should say that this was the

288
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:10,653
biggest stroke of luck imaginable.

289
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:18,076
I had no idea this was coming, but, uh, I was very lucky that I happened to,

290
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:21,257
um, have gotten an Unreal dev grant for Kine already.

291
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,978
Kine, Epic already knew about Kine.

292
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,762
When they launched their storefront, I already had their emails.

293
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,803
It was very easy for me to get in contact with them.

294
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:30,564
They knew who I was.

295
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:38,171
And so explaining the situation and banging out that deal really quickly was an unexpected

296
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:43,175
huge advantage and that is the entire reason I was able to do Scope 3.

297
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:50,241
Which brings me to scope three. So at this point what I had was a game that I liked as far as the

298
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:54,666
design goes. I was really happy with it. I'd figured out in scope two what I was doing.

299
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:58,931
I was making a game that told a story with puzzles and I had made those puzzles.

300
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:03,253
And I was proud of it, but I didn't think it would be commercially successful.

301
00:18:03,293 --> 00:18:06,014
And so at this point, I had a set amount of money.

302
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:07,755
I couldn't spend more than that.

303
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:14,497
I had a designed game, and the goal was to take that game I had and make it market viable.

304
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:19,759
Specifically, I wanted to polish the environment art, the UI, and I wanted to port and localize

305
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,219
the game because I had enough funding to do that.

306
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:26,201
I figured.

307
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:32,039
I could work full-time and I could hire a couple of contractors and I needed to

308
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,840
wrap up what I had in about eight to 10 months.

309
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:40,062
I still didn't really have a marketing plan, but I figured maybe I could

310
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:46,564
buy, like hire a PR company and maybe if I just came out on a lot of platforms.

311
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:49,385
Part of why I came out on a lot of platforms was I had this idea in my head

312
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:53,026
that if I could just be on every platform, I would get marketing from each of them

313
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:55,067
and they would reinforce each other and it would create some buzz.

314
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:59,110
Anyway, scope three is when I was funded.

315
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,291
So this is when I should probably talk about the budget because the vast majority

316
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:06,773
of the money was spent in this version of the game, uh, in total, I spent $420,000

317
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:10,414
on Klein that does not cover my salary.

318
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:13,256
Uh, but that covers absolutely everything else.

319
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:16,777
I mean, that covers paying for the contractors that I hired in this phase.

320
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:23,160
I'm also paying for the company when I initially set that up, going to PAX, the flights to GDC

321
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,884
this year that I didn't get to take because of the coronavirus. So this is the amount of money

322
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:34,426
I spent total for everything with Kine. And you'll see here I spent $210,000 on art.

323
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,800
And pretty much all of that went into the environment.

324
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,141
So let's talk about that first.

325
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:42,642
Cause that is the biggest part of my budget.

326
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:48,143
I did, I worked with about four artists over about four months to revise the art

327
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:52,205
style that's not perfect, but I hired surface digital to help me with the art

328
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,505
style and what we did was we.

329
00:19:55,118 --> 00:20:00,681
we tried a couple of different things i had this abstract kind of painted art style initially and i

330
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:04,242
knew i wanted to keep that sketchiness for the reasons i talked about before i liked

331
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:10,425
the idea of having lines that overhang the world but i wanted the objects to have some kind of

332
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:13,793
just some basis in reality.

333
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,075
I wanted to come up with something a little higher fidelity,

334
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:17,396
more interesting for the environments.

335
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:19,617
Worked with the artists to do this,

336
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,398
but we rapidly found we couldn't have

337
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:24,160
too much high-frequency detail in the environments.

338
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,701
It would distract the eye,

339
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:28,483
and as soon as the player couldn't see the puzzle board,

340
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:29,844
the player was completely lost.

341
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:35,447
We had a lot of other problems. It was very necessary to never have anything not align with the grid.

342
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,330
If there's ever really long lines that don't align with the grid, again,

343
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,653
the player would have difficulty seeing the puzzles and the puzzles are already hard.

344
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:48,836
It doesn't feel fair if you're failing on a puzzle because you can't see what's going on.

345
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:55,940
This is a huge problem in Kine. Even if you're very careful to have all of the lines align with the grid,

346
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,202
you can still end up with optical illusions like here.

347
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:04,047
Do you see this brown box in the foreground? It's hard to see where that is in z-height. It's hard

348
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:08,689
to see if that's the same level as the the white boxes or not. You have to kind of turn the camera

349
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:13,051
just to see it. This is an optical illusion that you have in Kine and there's a lot of other optical

350
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:19,274
illusions very similar to this that had to be troubleshooted basically. And I'll tell you the

351
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:24,257
way I solved this particular one was I added a scribble shader to Kine. So anytime you can't

352
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:24,697
land on

353
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:29,781
land on a grid tile from where you are you see kind of a scribble and that's consistent

354
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:33,983
throughout the game so the player is their eyes trained to see where they can land and where they

355
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:38,746
can't land and that becomes more important later on when you can change the height for

356
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:44,530
different reasons or when you can switch between characters. This is one trick I did.

357
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:48,893
Going more into the art in scope 3.

358
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:54,423
I would say I made some kind of questionable production decisions in Scope 3 as far as

359
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:54,963
the art goes.

360
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:58,524
I was working with a very small amount of time.

361
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:01,024
I was trying to work as efficiently as possible with a bunch of outsourcers.

362
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:05,946
So I took each puzzle and I took all the static meshes from them and I merged them into one

363
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:10,046
static mesh and I would outsource that and I would bring it back in and I would put that

364
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:10,747
back in the editor.

365
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:15,768
And that's how I up-res'ed the different puzzle pieces as quickly as possible.

366
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:19,309
But this also meant that I couldn't edit a puzzle, right?

367
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:24,051
As soon as I merged all these meshes together, uh, and exported them as an FBX.

368
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:28,933
Now, at this point, I can't change any puzzle unless I go into Maya and actually

369
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:33,494
change the final art for the puzzle, which means at this point, I couldn't

370
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:34,875
change the puzzles if I wanted to.

371
00:22:34,915 --> 00:22:38,136
And I would say that's a, it's something I could get away with because I knew I

372
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,737
was locking down the design at the beginning of scope three, but it's something

373
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:42,238
I would definitely recommend against.

374
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:47,762
I hate that. I like that there are certain areas that are still tile-based, like the boat area.

375
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:55,723
This is done entirely through tiles and using shader tricks to make the tiles look differently.

376
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:59,404
I vastly prefer working this way. I think it's really important to be able to iterate

377
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:06,165
on the design throughout the entirety of production. So that's what I learned in Scope 3

378
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:10,006
as far as the art goes. And like I said, I spent about $210,000 in four months.

379
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:16,726
Uh, on just that, like working four months of my time as well, full time

380
00:23:16,766 --> 00:23:19,127
working on that to overhaul the environments and the UI art.

381
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:20,708
And that was the correct call.

382
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:23,609
I'm really happy with how the art turned out in Kine.

383
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:26,250
I think it really did help position the game well in the marketplace.

384
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,412
Um, but if you look at here at the chart, you'll see there's a sizable part of

385
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:33,212
the budget that's spent on porting.

386
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,333
And I, uh, that wasn't just the budget.

387
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,474
That was also my time.

388
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:39,395
I spent three to four months.

389
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,333
on kind full time on localization and porting this game.

390
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:45,195
And that was a bad decision.

391
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,117
I regret that.

392
00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:48,380
I do not recommend doing that.

393
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:51,705
I think trying to do a multi-platform launch almost killed me.

394
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:58,045
It was just a lot of work for me personally. I underestimated how much of my effort would have

395
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:02,266
to go into that no matter what. Just learning five different back ends and setting up five

396
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:07,408
different storefronts with each language. So getting all the translations set up on each

397
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:11,150
storefront. Each storefront has their own requirements, not just for images but for

398
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,372
everything. I had to manage five different builds. If I found a bug, I had to fix that bug in five

399
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:17,433
different places.

400
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,915
And this is on top of the language specific problems and the platform

401
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:22,775
specific problems.

402
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,976
So like certain things you have to do just for cert on one platform or another,

403
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:30,338
or just in a certain language on certain platforms and others, it just became a

404
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:35,900
combinant, like no one thing was awful, but all of these things in aggregate were

405
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,182
just way too much for not only one person, but for even spending a lot of money.

406
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:45,924
I just couldn't keep up with the amount of work required to launch on all these

407
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:47,024
platforms at the same time.

408
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:51,855
If I could do it again, I would have released first on PC and then on Stadia or

409
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:54,658
Switch and then on the other platforms one at a time is needed.

410
00:24:54,678 --> 00:24:57,760
Um, and I, I'll tell you the.

411
00:24:59,135 --> 00:25:02,396
The one platform that I didn't sim ship with was Stadia because Stadia didn't

412
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:07,118
launch until November and I came out in October, so I had another month to work

413
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,159
with Stadia and that was a much more pleasant launch for me.

414
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,780
I got to work with the marketing team there.

415
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,941
I got to make sure our messaging aligned.

416
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:17,662
I got to get my marketing materials together for the store.

417
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,903
I had time to learn the backend.

418
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:26,770
By the time I was submitting the final cert for Stadia, I'd already fixed all the bugs for the main game.

419
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:33,137
So I knew any bugs that showed up on Stadia were Stadia-specific problems, which was something that I didn't have for the other platforms.

420
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:39,824
There was times when I'd get a bug on the Xbox and I wasn't sure if it was on every platform or just only on the Xbox.

421
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:47,160
So again, if I could do it again, I would have focused only on one storefront.

422
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,342
And I can tell you specifically for Kine, the PS4 and the Xbox port were

423
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:53,482
the ones that were not worth it.

424
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,883
I mean, I can't legally say how many units I sold on each platform.

425
00:25:57,408 --> 00:26:02,053
But if you combine the Xbox one and the PS4 sales, they're less than 5% of my total sales.

426
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:03,915
Um, and this makes sense.

427
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:08,399
Uh, largely this is because I didn't reach out to Microsoft or Sony.

428
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:11,022
I didn't participate in any marketing with them.

429
00:26:11,142 --> 00:26:18,269
I thought, I thought if I marketed the game in general, it would.

430
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:21,746
have some kind of splash effect on every platform.

431
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:24,308
I was a bit naive.

432
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:27,750
I didn't think to reach out to Microsoft and Sony, and I didn't have the time

433
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,712
because I was shipping on everything to reach out specifically to Microsoft and

434
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:35,314
Sony and try to leverage whatever their marketing channels would have been.

435
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:38,536
Also just in general, I find people don't.

436
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:47,040
People who play puzzle games, my users, gamers who play puzzle games, they tend to play on the go on the switch or on the phone.

437
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:50,484
Some people who want the more hardcore games will play on their PC.

438
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:54,736
Puzzle gamers generally don't sit at their couch to play puzzle games.

439
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:58,758
Maybe for a game like Gris or more of a game you sink into, perhaps.

440
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:05,381
But games that are difficult, that are difficult puzzle games,

441
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:07,723
people tend to prefer those on other platforms.

442
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:13,145
So that was my biggest mistake in Scope 3, was sim shipping on so many platforms.

443
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:18,868
I wish I'd been more focused, specifically in my case, probably on Stadia and PC and Switch.

444
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:24,802
In any case, that's the story and some of the things I learned along the way of

445
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:30,087
how I spent two and a half years and forging $20,000 in a puzzle game.

446
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:34,672
And I'm going to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts, just what went right

447
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:35,993
and wrong over the entire project.

448
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,886
The way I made this game was iterative.

449
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:46,394
I made a scope of the game and then when I had the resources and I knew the game

450
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:48,918
deserved to be a bigger scope, that was when I increased the scope.

451
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,264
I did not sit down and plan to make a massive game and then a

452
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:55,728
game that I couldn't fund myself.

453
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:58,346
I find that that's the worst situation to be in.

454
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:03,070
If you come up with a massive game where you can't personally fund it and you're going

455
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:08,135
around pitching your small prototype hoping you get funding, you're in a very bad spot.

456
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:09,917
It's difficult to stay confident.

457
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:15,282
You're just not in a good negotiating position with whoever needs to give you money.

458
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:18,425
You're just assuming a lot more risk there.

459
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:24,756
Personally, the way I work and the way I would recommend working is to design iteratively

460
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:30,458
and scope up as you know that the game deserves to be a bigger scope and as you can acquire

461
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:31,699
funding to make that bigger scope.

462
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:36,101
There's a great deal of confidence that comes with knowing that you have enough money in

463
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:38,242
the bank account to ship what you're currently working on.

464
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:39,542
I find that that's really important.

465
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:43,184
There's been times in my career when I haven't had that and that's maddening.

466
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:44,705
I would highly recommend against it.

467
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:50,627
As far as the rest, other things from the game, I'm really happy with how the art worked out.

468
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:57,250
I don't think the way it was, I wouldn't recommend the way I constructed it, but I'm really happy with how it ended up in the end.

469
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:02,112
As far as takeaways for Kynem, let's see here...

470
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:04,533
Yes, I think launching on Stadia was smart.

471
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:06,593
I'm glad I did that.

472
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:10,034
There was 22 titles in Stadia when it launched and Kine was one of them.

473
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:13,134
And that, because there were so few, that gave me a lot of press.

474
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:18,275
I am really proud that I got to work with Stadia.

475
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:20,055
Like, that was pretty cool that I pulled that off.

476
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:24,476
But on the other hand, I wish I didn't launch on all the other platforms.

477
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:27,957
Launching on so many platforms at the same time just ended up being a lot of work

478
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:30,757
that I don't think was worth it.

479
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:38,443
And as far as design goes, I didn't put enough thought into the player experience when the player is stuck on a puzzle.

480
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:45,474
So this is a point that I don't think really fits into any specific scope, but I really wanted to touch on because it's something important that I missed.

481
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,928
The user experience when a player is stuck in Kine is very bad.

482
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:54,129
And a large part of this is how the puzzles were structured.

483
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:56,870
It's the core point of the game, right?

484
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,851
Like Kine is a game that tells a story using puzzles.

485
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,312
And the part of the way I tell that narrative is as soon as you beat a

486
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:07,993
puzzle, you jump to the next one immediately in a sequence and you see

487
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:11,354
a little bit of dialogue and then you beat the next puzzle and you jump to

488
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:12,954
the next one and you see a bit of dialogue.

489
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:16,845
So, a player is encouraged to continuously play the game.

490
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:19,652
A player almost never sees the level select screen.

491
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:22,619
Compare this to an experience like Baba is You.

492
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,342
In this game, you complete a puzzle and you're immediately kicked out to the level select screen.

493
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:31,684
Every time you beat a puzzle, you're kicked back out to it, and you have a lot of different puzzles to choose from.

494
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:33,165
It doesn't feel like there's any set order.

495
00:30:34,686 --> 00:30:40,989
In this game, if you're stuck and you back out to the level select screen, that doesn't feel quite as much like failure.

496
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,590
Because you see the level select screen all the time.

497
00:30:44,313 --> 00:30:48,578
in Kine, when you back out to the level select screen, it feels like failure.

498
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,322
It's not something you do unless you're stuck.

499
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:54,546
And because of that, there's a lot more player friction.

500
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:55,968
Players generally don't want to do that.

501
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,984
It's just a more negative experience.

502
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:01,987
And I think in general, what I needed to do is spend more time looking at

503
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:07,193
players that were struggling, looking at players that did not grok the game

504
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,295
immediately, did not get it as easily.

505
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:13,439
I think if I was more focused on making sure that those players were still

506
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:16,162
having fun or I would have caught this earlier on.

507
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:21,382
So those are some of my takeaways and that's the story of how Kine was made.

508
00:31:22,142 --> 00:31:25,042
Um, I'm sorry we couldn't do this talk at GDC, but I'm glad you

509
00:31:25,062 --> 00:31:26,022
guys get to see it either way.

510
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:28,463
My name's Gwen, Kine is out now.

511
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:29,343
I hope you check it out.

512
00:31:29,623 --> 00:31:31,083
You can reach me on Twitch.

513
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:32,884
I'm sorry, this way.

514
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:34,684
Dire Goldfish on Twitch.

515
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:36,984
If this is streamed, then hopefully I'll be in the chat.

516
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:41,185
Uh, I'm also dire goldfish on Twitter and I am on YouTube.

517
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:44,866
Um, because we couldn't do this at GDC because of the coronavirus.

518
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:45,906
I hope you're all staying healthy.

519
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,686
please reach out to me with any questions you have.

520
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:53,593
Hit me up on Twitter and I'll reply as best I can.

521
00:31:54,354 --> 00:31:54,615
Thank you.
