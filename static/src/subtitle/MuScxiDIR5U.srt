1
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:07,112
Greetings, everyone.

2
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:09,714
This is Forging Hard Space Shipbreaker.

3
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:12,116
We're gonna talk about our journey

4
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:14,338
the last four and a half years as we made this game

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:15,819
and some lessons that we learned

6
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:17,420
and some things that we can share with all of you.

7
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,062
So who are these people that you're seeing in front of you?

8
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:21,043
I'm Rory McGuire,

9
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,805
I'm the Chief Creative Officer here at Blackbird.

10
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:25,847
I've been in the games industry almost 20 years now.

11
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:29,790
I've got to work on a ton of amazing brands and IP.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,552
Most recently, we've contributed to the Minecraft series.

13
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,149
But I've also got to work on some original IP,

14
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,969
which is what we've did here with Hardspace Shipbreaker

15
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:38,970
and what we're gonna be talking about.

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,670
And I'm Elliot Hudson.

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,490
I'm Associate Creative Director here at Blackbird.

18
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,191
I've been with Blackbird for about, I think, eight years now.

19
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,571
I started on a game called Hardware

20
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:48,212
that eventually became Deserts of Kerak.

21
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:49,792
And for the past four years,

22
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,292
I've been working on what eventually

23
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,613
would become Hardspace Shipbreaker.

24
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,053
But it wasn't always Shipbreaker.

25
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:55,713
So we're gonna go through the journey

26
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:57,454
and share some things with you guys.

27
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:58,914
So who are we as a studio?

28
00:00:59,194 --> 00:00:59,974
We were founded in 2010.

29
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,875
We're based out of Vancouver, BC.

30
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,824
The studio was founded by a number of EA and Relic folks, and really the goal was to create

31
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:15,289
incredible games, original games, games that people could be immersed into, games that when

32
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:20,893
you're playing them, the screen edge disappears and you just fade into the game. Our first game was

33
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:26,097
in 2016, Homeworld Desperate as a Carrack launched. We had been working on a game that was kind of a

34
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:31,681
spiritual successor to Homeworld, and while we were developing that, the Homeworld IP actually went up

35
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,141
for auction.

36
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:36,330
We bid on it, but we were also dramatically outbid by Gearbox.

37
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,513
But the first thing that happened was Gearbox reached out to us and said,

38
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:45,619
Hey, would you guys like to do something with us? And at that time we were working on this incredible game that launched in 2016.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,305
And we're about 79-80 on Metacritic, but amongst PC gaming focused sites, namely PC Gamer, GameSpot, IGN,

40
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:55,248
they gushed, they loved the game and that kind of put us on the map.

41
00:01:56,054 --> 00:02:01,016
Shortly after that, we collaborated with NASA's JPL on what was called Project Eagle,

42
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:04,718
which was imagining a Mars base 100 years from the day it launched.

43
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:10,160
That was an interesting process because we often create ideas on our own,

44
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:15,323
but in this case, we were creating concept and then vetting them with engineers and, you know,

45
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:18,284
xenobiologists and all these crazy things at JPL.

46
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:23,767
That went onto Steam for free to celebrate NASA's InSight landing.

47
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,748
And then finally, what we announced last year,

48
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:29,549
Homeworld 3, which we announced in September on stage

49
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,649
with Gearbox at PAX.

50
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,290
We all miss PAX.

51
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,531
But we're not talking about any of these today.

52
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,632
We're talking about Shipbreaker.

53
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:42,273
Shipbreaker went onto Steam's right around a month ago,

54
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:43,493
a month and a couple of days.

55
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:47,475
And it has, we spent a couple of days

56
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:48,655
at the top of the Steam charts.

57
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:54,138
press and the fan response to it has just overwhelmed us and that's just what

58
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:59,720
we're going to be talking about today. So just a quick look at what Shipbreaker is.

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,841
So Shipbreaker, obviously you play the shipbreaker and you work in this

60
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:06,442
salvage yard for this company that sends you these derelict ships and your job is

61
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:10,183
to strip these things down, try to salvage all the valuable materials, all

62
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:13,403
the components, etc. and try to get as much value of the ships as possible.

63
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,269
But just like real-world shipbreaking

64
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:18,090
and real-world salvaging, it can be extremely dangerous.

65
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,711
There's fuel running through these ships,

66
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:22,153
electrical systems, they have faulty reactors in them,

67
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:23,674
lots of ways for you to die.

68
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:25,435
The company will just clone you

69
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:26,536
and throw you back in the yard.

70
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:27,837
So it's all about trying to escape

71
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:29,498
that seemingly endless cycle.

72
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:34,161
So what we built was quite unusual and quite different.

73
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,742
One of the things that the team struggled with

74
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:37,303
was there weren't a lot of market comparables

75
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:41,686
or games that were in the market that were similar.

76
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,681
So I want to talk a little bit about how we got there,

77
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:47,485
both from a brand side or IP side, as well as gameplay side.

78
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,268
And really that was driven through the goals

79
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:52,070
that we set initially and the goals

80
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,652
that we continue to calibrate with the team

81
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,433
as we were working on it.

82
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:55,895
And what we're hoping is, is you're

83
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:57,256
going to go on this journey with us

84
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:58,878
through the last four and a half years.

85
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,301
We have slides that are about learnings

86
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,101
and they're labeled learning.

87
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,092
But we also have a ton of slides that are actually

88
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:07,133
from team presentations at those times.

89
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,393
You'll be looking at videos that we presented at those times.

90
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,314
So you'll get to see a little bit about how the game evolved

91
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:13,455
and get some takeaways from it.

92
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,295
So as a studio, we've modeled ourselves

93
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:19,336
after these kind of legendary studios, or certainly

94
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:20,356
legendary studios.

95
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:23,297
Other studios similar to this would be Psyonix that most

96
00:04:23,337 --> 00:04:24,338
recently did Rocket League.

97
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,198
And what these studios did, aside

98
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:28,959
from being known for being just incredible and producing

99
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:29,879
incredible games.

100
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,660
They began doing work for other people,

101
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,861
which is what we did as well,

102
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:37,682
is they took on games with other people's IP.

103
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,982
In the case of Gearbox, who we know quite well,

104
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:41,243
we've worked with them on a couple of games.

105
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:44,223
Gearbox began by making incredible FPSs.

106
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,844
For example, the expansion to Half-Life,

107
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,084
like what an amazing gig.

108
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:50,225
Or the PC port of Halo, again, what an amazing gig,

109
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,566
to build out the tech base, to build out their studio,

110
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,227
and then start taking shots at games of their own.

111
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:58,387
So in the case of Gearbox, that was Brothers in Arms,

112
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,868
but really it stuck with Borderlands.

113
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:03,835
In the case of Blizzard, we all know Rock and Roll Racing and The Lost Vikings,

114
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,797
but really it's Warcraft that set the stage, and then after that, World of Warcraft.

115
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:11,460
So this is what we've modeled ourselves after, which is that we're building these incredible games,

116
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,143
we're building this incredible technology, we're also able to take our own shots and build our own games.

117
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:20,436
So the journey for Shipbreaker starts at the beginning of 2016.

118
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,956
We had just shipped Deserts of Karak,

119
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:26,517
and the studio hadn't quite spun up our next big project yet.

120
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:29,138
So they've had a lot of people who needed something to do,

121
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:31,399
something to work on, and it was also an opportunity for us

122
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,999
to decompress a little bit from working on Deserts of Karak,

123
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,780
and then also do some creative bloodletting

124
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,060
and just kind of refresh ourselves.

125
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,141
And so Blackbird decided to run an internal game jam.

126
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,562
So we split into teams of about seven to eight people.

127
00:05:43,582 --> 00:05:44,922
I think there was about five teams total.

128
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,411
And everyone was involved, accounting,

129
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:51,173
IT manager was involved, audio engineers were involved.

130
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:52,694
It was a great, it was really fun.

131
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,355
And I happened to be part of a team

132
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,676
that worked on something called Hello Collector,

133
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:57,676
which is what we're gonna look at,

134
00:05:57,696 --> 00:05:59,317
because that was where Showbreaker started.

135
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,098
Yeah, so out of five teams,

136
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,839
we had just this remarkable game here.

137
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,521
Yeah, so the goal for the jam,

138
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:08,022
for this demo here that we're looking at,

139
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:10,983
was recreate that sense of, in the movie Gravity,

140
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,904
of Sandra Bullock spinning through debris.

141
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:16,977
barely held on by a cable that's keeping her from flinging off into the void.

142
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:21,599
So you have a very simple set of mechanics, you can grab and crawl along these debris pieces,

143
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:25,620
you have your grapple that can pull you around, and that's essentially it. And your objective is

144
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,221
to climb through the swirling debris field and find the valuable resources without getting flung

145
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:34,883
off into the void. Extremely effective, it was super tense to play, and very rewarding,

146
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:41,705
very successful. So we did a big review with the whole studio, at the time it was probably 60 folks,

147
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:42,205
and we

148
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:44,867
We looked at all of the Game Jam games,

149
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,508
and the sense in the room was electric

150
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:52,189
that we had to make a Hello Collector into a game.

151
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,750
Like everyone produced these awesome games for Game Jam,

152
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,651
but I probably had 10 people come up to me afterwards

153
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,751
that weren't on the team talking about,

154
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:00,932
are we gonna make this game?

155
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:02,952
It's super cool, let's make this game, let's do this thing.

156
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,553
So it literally took about two days

157
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,334
before we had a full green light,

158
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,995
and we set a goal, I think we started production

159
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:10,695
about a month later,

160
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:12,295
we started the team going about a month later.

161
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:15,257
And the team, what was the Hello Collector team,

162
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,138
the Game Jam team, began working on

163
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,259
what we would call project links or code name links.

164
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,481
And right off the bat, we wanted to set goals for the team.

165
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:24,882
We talked a little bit about this earlier.

166
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:28,504
There's a phenomenon that was observed by sociologists

167
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,005
in the criminal justice system,

168
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:35,108
where detectives are deeply incentivized to solve cases.

169
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:36,569
They're called clearance rates.

170
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:40,663
And from an outside perspective, or even if you're in the system, that makes sense.

171
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:41,823
Detectives solve cases.

172
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:48,666
But what happens is, is that detectives are now incented to progress their careers,

173
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:51,467
to not take on cases that are difficult to solve.

174
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,328
And that's not actually what we want from our detectives.

175
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:56,889
Now, this is something that was observed in many, you know,

176
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,329
changes have been made to that system.

177
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,191
But it's a very human thing that when you set a goal in front of someone, they try to solve it.

178
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,652
And sometimes that means not taking on cases.

179
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,772
is where there's out there somewhere.

180
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:10,013
It's a hard case to solve.

181
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,374
So in the case of Shipbreaker,

182
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:14,796
we didn't set a goal where we said,

183
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:16,377
we want you to make a shitload of money,

184
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,638
or we want you to make a ton of money.

185
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:21,620
We want you to ship a game that has 10 million active users

186
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,221
or anything like that.

187
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,542
We set three really simple goals.

188
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:25,363
Was that one, we want you to ship.

189
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:29,746
Two, we want you to make an original game that is unusual.

190
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,428
And three, we want it to be an original IP that is ours.

191
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,418
And we didn't set any other goals aside from that.

192
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:38,560
There were times where we did financial forecasts,

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,182
but those didn't go into team facing goals.

194
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:43,184
And they were extremely conservative

195
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:44,485
because we didn't want pressure on the team

196
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:45,146
to do something else.

197
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,108
So then we, yeah, like we said,

198
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:48,669
we started development on trying to turn this

199
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:50,031
into a full fledged project.

200
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,892
And this is a screenshot from around that time.

201
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,414
And really what we were doing is we were just taking

202
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:54,835
all the stuff we liked about the game jam.

203
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,091
and really trying to inflate it and stretch it

204
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:58,851
into a full-sized game.

205
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,892
So rather than like a randomized debris field,

206
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:03,834
here you are at a space station that's falling apart

207
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,995
and your objective is to try to clamber your way

208
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,276
inside that station and find out why

209
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:09,476
it's crumbling to pieces.

210
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,537
And you'd start to move through other locations

211
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:13,058
throughout the galaxy.

212
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,079
And it was fun, it was really exciting.

213
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:18,080
We started adding more maneuvering mechanics,

214
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,641
more gameplay, more hazards.

215
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,602
And then we started to work on the actual tone

216
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,063
and narrative direction of the game as well.

217
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:29,375
And so this is where we were, this is a slide from that time

218
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:32,196
where we did an exercise of trying to place ourselves

219
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:34,517
on a sort of tone spectrum.

220
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:38,498
The game jam had a lot of tense gameplay, it was very dark,

221
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:41,739
but you'd also get these very satirical and sardonic emails

222
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,940
from the company that had sent you out to the depths of space.

223
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,440
So there was this kind of humor to it, a very dark humor.

224
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,181
And so between something that's very light and satirical

225
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,762
and something that's straight up dark horror,

226
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,263
we sort of felt that we were kind of in the middle of that.

227
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,249
We're showing that here because this is one of the big things

228
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,450
that we would start to reevaluate

229
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,072
as we continue to progress through development.

230
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,475
As Elliot said, we had a ton of mechanics

231
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,596
that we thought were really impressive.

232
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:11,039
At this point, we were eight months into six months

233
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,180
into development, something like that.

234
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,222
And we had all the mechanics that we list here.

235
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:16,784
This is from the presentation that

236
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,425
was made to the team when we evaluated it.

237
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,127
All of these features are in the game four years later,

238
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:23,068
or all of these mechanics are in the game four years later.

239
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:23,248
Really.

240
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:27,350
We really love the viscerality of grabbing onto a ladder,

241
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,691
grabbing onto a piece of wreckage

242
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:30,292
and spinning with it in 0G.

243
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:33,754
We thought it was really cool.

244
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:38,817
But once we got this build and we got the mechanics together

245
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:40,899
and we were able to look at it and we were able to step back

246
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,160
from it, there were some lessons, which

247
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,742
is one of our next learnings, which

248
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:48,423
is when we first began development on what would

249
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:50,965
become Shipbreaker, which was a time called Code Name Links

250
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:51,745
or Project Links.

251
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,446
We felt that milestones and gates were things

252
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,647
that publishers forced on developers,

253
00:10:58,047 --> 00:10:59,048
or not forced on developers,

254
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,248
but it was part of that process.

255
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,509
It was part of that social contract or business contract

256
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,449
that you get with publishers.

257
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,810
We were making our own original IP.

258
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,750
Everything was in-house.

259
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,671
We were like, ah, we don't need to do gates or milestones.

260
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:13,033
And we spent about five, six months in that view,

261
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:15,794
or that worldview, when we realized,

262
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:17,354
actually, gates and milestones,

263
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:18,875
even if we're not triggering a payment

264
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:20,655
or all the business things associated with it,

265
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:21,956
it lets us.

266
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:24,688
take a moment to evaluate the game,

267
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,988
to build it up to a point where we can all look at it,

268
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:28,048
we can all talk about it,

269
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:30,269
and then have an official takeaway of,

270
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,609
this is the feedback, this is what we're gonna do next,

271
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:33,629
and we can plan for the future.

272
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:37,210
So, our first, or one of our early lessons

273
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,590
is kind of a goofy one,

274
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,111
but we aren't above gates and milestones.

275
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,391
We're not beyond the law.

276
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,291
Like it's important to take these inflection moments

277
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:44,031
and look at the game.

278
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,572
The second is, we're gonna talk more about what happened

279
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:48,552
out of this first milestone,

280
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,953
but there was something really important

281
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:51,713
that we wanted to.

282
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:59,399
embrace and really lean into. So what we're looking at here is the evolution of what would become Halo. So on the far left

283
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:06,601
is the original Halo prototype, or at least in the public, this is the original Halo prototype, which is a sci-fi

284
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:09,902
RTS for Mac using

285
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:14,183
soldiers from the future that are battling in vehicles that are roughly to scale.

286
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:18,104
There's something obviously really cool there, and actually if you look at the very top of the screen,

287
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,945
that is a tank that is incredibly similar to what would actually ship in Halo.

288
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,913
But they didn't keep that game.

289
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:26,615
Clearly, they played it, and they iterated on it,

290
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:28,316
and they decided that there was something cool here,

291
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,957
but they wanted to remove something from it

292
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:30,797
and refocus it.

293
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,739
So in the middle, you can see this is where

294
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,240
it became a third-person action game.

295
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,341
I'm not sure what the platform is at this point.

296
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:37,802
I'm fairly certain they're still on Mac.

297
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:40,544
And then the thing on the far right is an HD version

298
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:42,746
of what would actually ship of Halo Combat Evolved,

299
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:46,989
which was a first-person Xbox-only title.

300
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,252
A radical transformation in terms of what the game was.

301
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:53,832
But at the same time, you can see the threads of DNA

302
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:55,273
or them following the bright chromes

303
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:58,654
as they're doing each iteration of Halo to find that.

304
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,055
And that was something really important to us,

305
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,775
and it's something we wanted to preserve and hang on to.

306
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:04,036
If you're curious about the evolution of Halo

307
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:05,677
or the development of Halo, there's

308
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:06,957
a ton of articles on this online.

309
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:09,738
And I don't want to turn this into a cheesy talk

310
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:12,379
on a post-med, but it was important to us

311
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,420
to follow the bright chromes.

312
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,220
Yeah, exactly.

313
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
And like Rory said, the.

314
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:17,089
We didn't do the gates at first,

315
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:20,412
but for the first half a year of development really

316
00:13:20,452 --> 00:13:22,014
was just let the team do their thing,

317
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,417
they're creative, they'll come up with something cool.

318
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:25,839
But what we realized is that the gates

319
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:27,481
are really important to evaluate

320
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,964
whether you are following those breadcrumbs that are working.

321
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,146
This is a slide from one of the gates,

322
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:33,488
I think probably the last gate

323
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,790
before we decided to make a pretty big change to the game.

324
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:40,530
And we had come up with something that we thought was really strong, like objectively it was a good game,

325
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,094
but it had this sort of cosmic horror, dark, slow, plodding pace to it,

326
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:50,298
and it just wasn't something that Blackbird as a studio felt would fit in their roster of games.

327
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:52,100
It wasn't the type of game that they wanted to make.

328
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:58,045
And so that's where we had to really step back and find what do we like about what's here,

329
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,008
and what do we want to add to this to take it in a different direction.

330
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:05,782
Yeah, so we took just a few days with the team evaluating the build, talking about it,

331
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,804
and we decided that we were going to move away.

332
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:08,645
Yeah, we built.

333
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,687
Yeah, so at the very beginning, that was the end of 2016, the very beginning of 2017,

334
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,870
we started to work on something called Falling Skies.

335
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,975
And this is our first pivot of Helicollector, which would then become Shipbreaker eventually.

336
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:24,319
And Falling Skies was basically, there's this battle happening above Earth.

337
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:32,135
There's these ships that are taking damage and getting destroyed, and they're slowly falling through the atmosphere, threatening to smash into the ground and cause massive devastation.

338
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:43,499
So you take your grapple gun, which we had already, and you basically Spider-Man from falling ship to falling ship, and this is where we introduced a new mechanic, a new breadcrumb, which would be the cutting tool.

339
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:49,801
So you would slice these ships up until they were small enough that they just dissipate in the atmosphere and they don't cause a hazard anymore.

340
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:53,223
There was some issues with this pitch,

341
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:55,284
even though it was very fun, it was very action-oriented.

342
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:57,105
We called a few ninja in space.

343
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:59,506
We found that there was actually a problem.

344
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:02,267
Yeah, we were really excited about this concept of cutting,

345
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:05,468
but overall, we weren't happy with where we ended up totally.

346
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,328
Yeah, we took that back to the team.

347
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:08,589
We chatted with them about it.

348
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:10,769
We worked on it for, I think, for maybe two months tops.

349
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,370
And what became clear is that the team wasn't happy

350
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,951
with this concept, with this tornal shift.

351
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,042
in trying to address the concerns with Hello Collector being too slow and too plotting,

352
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:24,346
they felt that we had gone and done an over pivot, that we'd gone towards something that

353
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:29,369
was far too action arcadey, that didn't leverage the mechanics very well, that we had lost actually

354
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:34,373
a breadcrumb along the way, that sense of relatability and this personal touch the game had,

355
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,016
and it didn't feel unique anymore. It felt like you were just kind of a super soldier like you

356
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:42,799
see in so many other games, whereas in Hello Collector you felt like a real person out in space.

357
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,011
So the team came to the creative leadership at Blackbird

358
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:48,932
and essentially said, we don't really want to do this.

359
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,752
And so we said, okay, well, what excites you guys?

360
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:53,933
Or you folks, excuse me.

361
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:57,694
And they come up with four ideas, which they pitched.

362
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:58,894
Yeah, exactly.

363
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:01,195
So we realized rather than try to come up with something else,

364
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:03,295
take it back to the team, see if they like it, go back.

365
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,856
We could just flip flop there forever.

366
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,616
Like Rory said, we decided to do this more collaboratively.

367
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:09,537
So we came up with a bunch of different concepts

368
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:10,477
that we could possibly do.

369
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:15,765
all of these leveraging the mechanics that we knew we really liked the zero g stuff and the cutting

370
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:20,770
so there's falling skies saboteur was all about using your cutter to penetrate through this

371
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:27,195
invasive alien colony ship and try to destroy and destroy the fleet knight errant was traveling

372
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:31,679
through deep space with your grapple and your cutting your cutting tool and battling these

373
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:36,383
giant ship like leviathan creatures uh kind of wacko but kind of cool

374
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:42,830
And then the last concept that we hit on was this idea of someone just working in a salvage yard being given these derelict ships

375
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:48,052
And having to tear them apart and salvage them and as Elliot said all of these used

376
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:55,395
Grappling they were all first-person. They all involved cutting heavily like whether we're cutting into another ship or cutting into some space beast

377
00:16:56,435 --> 00:17:00,036
But there was one idea again that stood head and shoulders above the rest

378
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:04,738
Which was this concept of tearing apart derelict starships in search of?

379
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:15,305
ships have. So it began a change. We didn't like the fantasy and tone that we first had with Helicollector

380
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:20,229
and we began discussing what our new fantasy is. Exactly, so up until this point we've been

381
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:23,852
following these little breadcrumb trails to see where this game would take us, where it wanted to

382
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,654
take us, and this was a tonal shift that

383
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,011
it would end up actually being basically an entire loaf.

384
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,792
This is something that we got so excited about as a team,

385
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,113
as a studio, as an executive team.

386
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:37,875
It was just something that had so much potential,

387
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,535
talking about the working class hero,

388
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,816
that sense of nobility in the work you do,

389
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:42,977
the reward of hard work,

390
00:17:43,017 --> 00:17:44,438
contributing something bigger than yourself

391
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:47,379
and contrasting that with industry and systems

392
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,720
that exploit those kinds of people.

393
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,280
It was also an opportunity to bring back

394
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,162
a lot of the humor and personality that Helicollector had.

395
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,261
And what's amazing, so this is again,

396
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:57,782
is a slide from 2017, right when we made that pivot.

397
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:01,023
What's amazing is you can see this in the game today.

398
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:03,584
Yeah, interestingly, right before the game went live,

399
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,805
there was a preview where they gushed about

400
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:07,565
how the game felt like Brazilian space.

401
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,206
And we were like, yes, we did it.

402
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,427
So this was really a thing that we could sink our teeth into

403
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:13,488
that we were really excited about.

404
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:13,968
Totally.

405
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:18,389
And this informed a new set of pillars,

406
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,950
a set of changes to what we were trying to do.

407
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:26,142
Yeah, we took that tone and through a collaborative exercise with the team came up with our pillars.

408
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:30,906
And these aren't design pillars, they're not art pillars and audio pillars, these are game

409
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:33,949
pillars and at Blackbird we use these to inform all of the disciplines.

410
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,652
So it's really important that these are strong and that they're very precise in what they're

411
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:38,473
trying to convey.

412
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,615
And we'll talk a little bit more about how we do that.

413
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:42,277
But this is where we were, 2017.

414
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:45,700
This I think, maybe from the same presentation as the last slide.

415
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:49,888
Blue-collar fantasy, that's been our guiding star through this whole thing,

416
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,730
and you'll see that that rarely ever changes.

417
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,712
The other ones get nuanced a little bit, but...

418
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,975
But you'll also see their DNA, but they don't completely go away at this point.

419
00:18:57,884 --> 00:18:58,965
So let's talk a little bit about pillars.

420
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:02,086
So this is something I first heard that associated with Relic.

421
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:04,148
I mean, we have many Relic folks here at Blackbird.

422
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,409
So we kind of inherited this process.

423
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,430
This is pretty much industry standard now at this point.

424
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,171
There's two really great talks, one from GDC.

425
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,153
Josh Mosquera gave a talk and Jay Wilson gave a talk,

426
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,334
both of which are about Diablo 3

427
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:17,475
and the pillars that they had,

428
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,196
including when they pivoted into reversals.

429
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:22,958
These are some of our guidelines for pillars.

430
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:24,378
One is we, in general,

431
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,813
Make authentic team, product facing pillars,

432
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,495
authentic game facing pillars.

433
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:36,019
Make pillars that the team can understand and connect with.

434
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,903
If you have strategic business pillars, that's fine.

435
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:41,484
That's fine to have an executive level

436
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:42,485
or at a marketing level,

437
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:45,708
but it's not something that teams get excited about, right?

438
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:49,111
We also, in general, we try to be really specific.

439
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:50,372
All of our.

440
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:52,170
our pillars after a certain point.

441
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,411
I actually noticed earlier that we,

442
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,312
in our earliest pillars, we were not obeying this,

443
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:56,994
but we tried to get really descriptive in the pillars

444
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,195
and evocative with the pillars

445
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,597
so that the team can repeat them often to each other,

446
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,418
that they can talk about blue-collar fantasy.

447
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,381
I think if we were to measure the amount of times

448
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:07,202
people on the Lynx teams have blue-collar fantasy,

449
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:09,144
it'd be like in the tens of thousands.

450
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:12,407
But we do refine them over time,

451
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,668
which we'll see, even with these pillars here,

452
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:16,190
we're gonna see them changing as we move through.

453
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:20,314
And like I mentioned, we do this as a collaborative process

454
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:20,875
with the team.

455
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:23,036
It's not like the creative director or the game director

456
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:25,078
goes off and decides what the pillars are

457
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:26,419
and dictates that back down.

458
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,861
We find that the most effective way to do it

459
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,342
is to come to those pillars with the team

460
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:31,143
for a couple of reasons.

461
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,245
One is your pillars will probably be stronger

462
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,106
because you'll talk through all of the issues with it

463
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:36,728
and you'll massage it into a place

464
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,229
that it actually has a lot of meaning.

465
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,031
And the other is that people will feel super invested in those pillars, and they'll take that out into their work.

466
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:48,493
And you won't even have to do much maintenance on it, you won't have to repeat it very often,

467
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,335
people will actually, they'll surface in the stuff that they're doing every single day.

468
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:56,157
So that's why it's extremely important to us that we do this as a team process.

469
00:20:56,697 --> 00:21:05,541
Yeah, and just as examples of that, like, you know, you can direct your audio director to give you the sounds of industry and blue-collar fantasy,

470
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,982
or they can take that pillar away.

471
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:13,317
And in the background, you can hear the sounds of metal colliding, and it evokes that, and you never even ask for that.

472
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:16,239
So ideally, that's the position that you're in with the entirety of your team.

473
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,323
And then this is just an example of a whiteboard from one of those exercises with the team trying to arrive at those pillars.

474
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:26,865
And we actually heavily use something called the MDA framework.

475
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:29,787
MDA stands for Mechanic Dynamic Aesthetic.

476
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:34,230
And typically, it's used as an analysis tool for complete games to try to determine...

477
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:36,763
okay, how do the mechanics of this game interact

478
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:38,825
with one another to create these dynamics,

479
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:41,147
which are then perceived and interpreted by the player

480
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:42,628
as the aesthetics of the game,

481
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:47,493
the livable experience of the game,

482
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:48,974
the emotional experience of the game.

483
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:52,357
And we actually use it because we had a list of mechanics

484
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:53,398
that we knew we really liked.

485
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:55,299
We showed that earlier in the presentation.

486
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,982
We had this new aesthetic that we knew we wanted to hit,

487
00:21:58,002 --> 00:22:00,404
the blue collar vibe, the industrial sci-fi vibe.

488
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,130
And so this was really an exercise with the team to figure out how do we massage those

489
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,113
existing mechanics, how do we add just a few more layers of systems in there to create the dynamics

490
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:13,616
that we believe are going to create the aesthetic we want, and then enshrining all of that logic

491
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:19,679
into pillars. And this exercise took actually a week or more. We went through and looked at

492
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:24,562
these mechanics and the things that we wanted to achieve, but we would start to really dial in

493
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:29,165
what we thought the game was. So at this point, the team begins working on a vertical slice,

494
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:29,965
which we're seeing here.

495
00:22:30,735 --> 00:22:37,139
So we're pointing out this footage is none of this ship in the game, but it is very close

496
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:37,840
to what we shipped.

497
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,663
This is, we're seeing the cutting applied, we're seeing grabbing objects and moving them,

498
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:48,346
we're seeing this here, the reactor, interacting with the environment in compelling ways.

499
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:55,811
And everyone that saw this is like, yes, like all systems go, let's put this into production.

500
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:56,412
We're good.

501
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:57,893
Yeah, totally.

502
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:58,193
This is...

503
00:22:59,496 --> 00:23:04,881
just under two years ago probably and this is clearly the game that we wanted 100% like it

504
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:09,865
has everything in it that you see nowadays the salvage bay that you salvage in the freeform

505
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:16,231
cutting in the ships salvaging these hazardous things but it was all handcrafted and so that's

506
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:20,755
where we found we actually had a problem not thematically not creatively there was actually

507
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,477
a production problem that leads us towards our last pivot of the game.

508
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:27,207
Yeah, so we were ready to put this game into development.

509
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,028
Once we realized, or into production, excuse me,

510
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:30,948
we were already in development.

511
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,710
Once we realized what the, there was a problem,

512
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,911
is that the team to make this vertical slice

513
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:37,551
essentially hand-built that ship.

514
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:40,633
And we would need to hand-build all of the remaining ships,

515
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,734
which the team felt could only be three or four

516
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:43,894
with a medium-sized team.

517
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:45,695
That was a problem because

518
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,467
that meant that we would need to focus the game

519
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:49,989
on a five to 10 hour experience,

520
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:51,130
which is of course doable.

521
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,031
And there were games coming out at that point,

522
00:23:53,051 --> 00:23:54,813
like Firewatch, we were talking about quite a bit

523
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:55,854
that can do this,

524
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:57,535
but it actually felt disconnected

525
00:23:57,555 --> 00:23:58,776
from the game we've been talking about.

526
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,137
If you look at all of the pillars

527
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,478
that we've been sharing over time,

528
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:03,380
nowhere in there is there a narrative.

529
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,562
Nowhere in there is the player is this person

530
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:06,743
and their journey is this.

531
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:08,624
Like we had had conversations about it,

532
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:10,566
but in order to build a five to 10 hour experience,

533
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:11,927
a core part of that is the narrative.

534
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,940
And that felt a little bit disconnected

535
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,601
to take that from being a 0% or a small percent emphasis

536
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:20,621
to like a 30% or 40% emphasis.

537
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:22,402
So we actually didn't want to go down this path.

538
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:26,083
It was also informed by business conditions as well,

539
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:27,683
as we did want to target early access.

540
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:31,944
And we knew that a traditional story game typically

541
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:33,384
doesn't do well in early access.

542
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:35,124
And we did want to engage with that.

543
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:36,945
And we wanted to grow this game with the community.

544
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:41,506
So we set out to do the first impossible task that we built

545
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,026
was cutting.

546
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,797
the second impossible task that we put in front of the team

547
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:47,299
was essentially taking all these beautiful starships

548
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:48,620
that we'd been making at Blackbird

549
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,442
and make them into kind of pseudo-procedural

550
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,003
generated randomized ships.

551
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:56,704
Yeah, this was really the final breadcrumb

552
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:58,465
for the thing that would become Shipbreaker.

553
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:01,127
And that was fully embracing systemic designs,

554
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:04,969
like Burry's saying, pseudo-procedural modular ships,

555
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:06,230
taking all that gameplay that we liked

556
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,071
about that vertical slice, chunking it up

557
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:09,812
and trying to figure out how to make it dynamically

558
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:10,973
mix and match to provide.

559
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:13,788
way more breadth of content and experience for the player

560
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:15,829
than we could ever hope to do building by hand.

561
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:18,310
And so that went beyond just the ships.

562
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,951
We actually doubled down on making the actual

563
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:24,112
elemental systems of the game far more interactive

564
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:27,093
and systemic, heavily inspired by Breath of the Wild's

565
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:28,774
element system, which I think had just come out

566
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:29,674
right around this time.

567
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,195
And things like equipment decay and having to maintain

568
00:25:32,215 --> 00:25:34,596
your tools and all of your vitalities and things like that,

569
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,836
that all came out of this final pivot.

570
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:39,617
And the thing that's worth pointing out here as well

571
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:40,318
is that this is.

572
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,241
We are the studio, many of our artists and art directors

573
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:45,522
worked on the original Homeworld

574
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:47,303
and worked on Deserts of Karak

575
00:25:47,323 --> 00:25:48,684
and are now working on Homeworld 3.

576
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,706
So the standard for ships in the studio of starships

577
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:53,807
is extremely high.

578
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:58,249
And to build these procedurally with an art direction

579
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,830
that everyone was happy with when they saw them

580
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:00,911
was quite an achievement.

581
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:04,052
So now that we've got all the final pieces in place,

582
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:07,654
I wanted to show the contrast between where the pillars were

583
00:26:07,694 --> 00:26:08,955
when we started to decide

584
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:10,256
that we're gonna make the shipwrecker.

585
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,501
and where they were when we shipped basically in January of this year.

586
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:18,782
So in 2017, you can see the blue collar fantasy tactical ship disassembly

587
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:21,063
and vehicle fantasy from the human perspective.

588
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:23,524
And then what we shipped with was blue collar fantasy.

589
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:24,344
That didn't change.

590
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,045
Like I said, that has been one of the guiding forces of the whole game.

591
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:31,306
Total ship assembly was just a slight nuance to better inform people.

592
00:26:31,386 --> 00:26:34,447
What we meant by that pillar is where I said, as you use these pillars,

593
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,567
you're going to only refine them.

594
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:37,782
And then the last, to be honest,

595
00:26:37,802 --> 00:26:39,563
that one was actually a bad pillar from the start.

596
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,925
So vehicle fantasy is a reference to a pillar

597
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:43,586
on our previous game, Deserts of Karak.

598
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:47,369
So we were subverting that pillar for use.

599
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,531
And that made sense to people

600
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:50,592
who had worked on Deserts of Karak,

601
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:52,533
but as we hired more people for the team

602
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:53,954
who hadn't worked on Deserts of Karak,

603
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,215
it didn't make any sense.

604
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:57,677
It was total, I think Rory calls it inside baseball.

605
00:26:57,857 --> 00:26:59,718
Yeah, people just didn't understand.

606
00:26:59,738 --> 00:27:01,380
They were like, what is vehicle fantasy?

607
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,100
Explain that to me.

608
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,301
And it's like, well, there's this game.

609
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:04,882
Yeah, so there's a lot of,

610
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,582
hidden knowledge that's sort of required to understand that one. So we just got rid of that

611
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:14,785
completely and we realized we really need to make systems as content a pillar. That we're not going

612
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:19,149
to try to handcraft stuff, we're going to try to have the game create these experiences.

613
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:23,972
So let's talk a little bit about some of our learnings through this experience. We learned a

614
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,575
lot and some of these we learned accidentally, some of them were intentional, but we'll just

615
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:30,017
share some of the things that we think were really important. So one is...

616
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:31,595
keeping the team size small.

617
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:36,837
So we never really invested deeply into the team

618
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:38,778
beyond say like 10 to 15

619
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:41,040
until we'd really dialed in the game

620
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,760
and we were really confident that we could pull it off

621
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,302
and the team was able to build prototypes

622
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:46,702
and or production prototypes

623
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:49,384
that we could actually get hands on with and understand.

624
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:51,225
But also on the opposite side

625
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,966
is we didn't move people off of the team.

626
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:56,387
For the most part, we kept people on the team.

627
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:57,748
There was an odd one or two week

628
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:01,674
pinch-hitting for something, we pulled a couple of concept artists to help with

629
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:05,656
something here and there, or a producer for a time period, but in general we made

630
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:09,959
a policy of not crippling the team by pulling people off, and a policy that we

631
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:16,042
would not ever pause the team. This is also something that was shared by the

632
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,284
folks at Psyonix when they were building Rocket League, is that that game went

633
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:23,406
through so many different pivots and changes, but they never paused it, even

634
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:26,348
when they weren't quite sure what it was. And that's really important, because the

635
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:27,468
act of spinning it back up...

636
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:29,088
is way harder.

637
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,248
It's way harder.

638
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:32,989
The second is time boxing thing.

639
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,231
So in the case of Shipbreaker,

640
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,291
we had two impossible asks that we talked about.

641
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:38,832
It was cutting and it was this concept

642
00:28:38,872 --> 00:28:40,033
of pseudo-procedural shifts.

643
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:42,734
Both of those, we essentially gave the team

644
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,595
a period to evaluate it

645
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:46,916
and actually discover whether or not this was doable.

646
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:49,357
The first week, it was like, you guys are crazy.

647
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:50,918
How can we possibly do this?

648
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:53,019
But as they started to explore the concept,

649
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,699
they started to make concessions here and there.

650
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:56,700
And like, hey, we can do the cutting this particular way.

651
00:28:57,141 --> 00:28:58,281
if we change this particular thing

652
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,362
and we never ever do this one thing.

653
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:02,563
And we were actually able to pull it off.

654
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,124
Same thing with procedural shifts.

655
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:06,465
And the idea is as long as we're making progress

656
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:08,565
and we're moving towards these goals, we're generally fine.

657
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:11,527
It's really easy as a studio

658
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,188
and from a business perspective to get panicked about change.

659
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:15,168
Change is good.

660
00:29:15,308 --> 00:29:17,729
And if you go back through the history of amazing IPs

661
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,970
and original games, we give the example of Halo,

662
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,711
but StarCraft, StarCraft began,

663
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:25,152
this is very public knowledge that it began as,

664
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:28,556
Chris Metzen's crazy space vampire game.

665
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:32,198
And it's like, what that connected with StarCraft,

666
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:32,898
I have no idea.

667
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:34,139
I'm sure there's a great story there.

668
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,941
But that act of changing the game

669
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:39,462
and pivoting and refining and changing is super healthy.

670
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,105
The last thing is, or one of the last things

671
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:43,885
is ask for help.

672
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:47,267
We asked for a ton of help amongst amazing folks

673
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:50,289
like Brian and Haley Martello from Gearbox,

674
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:52,430
very heavily involved in the creative direction

675
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,511
of Borderlands.

676
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:56,013
They gave us so much guidance on this process,

677
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:59,114
and really helped us through building an original game.

678
00:29:59,594 --> 00:30:02,696
And then four amazing Vancouver-based independent

679
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:05,537
developers, Shane Neville, Jamie Chang of Clay,

680
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,659
Tyler Sigmund of Red Hook, and Derek Johnson of Thorium.

681
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,780
Each one of these people contributed so much to this game

682
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,941
and gave us so much guidance.

683
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,602
Yeah, we were extremely grateful to them.

684
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:18,744
And then our last insight is that, you know,

685
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:19,904
when you're making an original game,

686
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:22,256
You don't always need a partner.

687
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:24,377
If you have the funds, you don't necessarily need a partner.

688
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:26,699
Or if you have the business acumen

689
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,840
to publish a game yourself, you don't necessarily need it.

690
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,641
But if you do want a partner,

691
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:33,502
find someone that really likes your game for what it is.

692
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:35,344
When we were shipping Desert to Karak,

693
00:30:35,364 --> 00:30:37,085
we were showing it to publishers

694
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:39,286
and to other potential partners.

695
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:42,628
And it's a game about vehicles set on a desert planet.

696
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,869
And someone asked us completely seriously,

697
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:46,970
can you change out the vehicles for dragons?

698
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,252
And we were like, we could.

699
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:55,825
And maybe that was a good game somewhere, it's just not really our game.

700
00:30:55,905 --> 00:31:01,528
So in the case of Shipbreaker, the partner we found, Focus, loved the game for what it was.

701
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:06,430
They were so excited about what it was and they wanted to help us make it what it was,

702
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,012
not change it into a game where you dismantle dragons.

703
00:31:10,712 --> 00:31:11,972
Scalebreaker sounds pretty cool.

704
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:14,073
Yeah, hard space scalebreaker.

705
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,005
So this is where we ended up. So this is

706
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:21,567
the launch trailer that we saw for

707
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:27,931
Shipwrecker that was actually produced by Focus that came out

708
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:33,334
It's been it's been a phenomenal experience, you know, that's like we knew we knew that we love this game internally as a studio

709
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:36,036
We always knew also that it was kind of a weird concept

710
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:38,678
Weren't sure how it would land when I said finally get out there

711
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:43,961
But especially once focus came on board and they got it immediately we were like, okay, maybe this maybe there's some legs to this thing

712
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,500
And here we are in Early Access

713
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,501
and we've got just a phenomenal community.

714
00:31:48,321 --> 00:31:49,822
It's done super well and they love it.

715
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:52,403
And we're so happy to be talking to them

716
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:55,464
about what to add to this, how to expand on this experience.

717
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:58,185
They're giving us amazing fan art, amazing fan fiction.

718
00:31:58,325 --> 00:31:59,105
It's fantastic.

719
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:00,666
Yeah, yeah, it's been an incredible journey.

720
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:04,848
Yeah, and to think this began with a tiny game jam

721
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,969
and though it's worth pointing out,

722
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:08,389
you guys have seen the footage along the way.

723
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:10,470
There's some things that still carried through.

724
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,291
There's some things that we still shipped with

725
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,242
pretty remarkable that we kept them through all of them.

726
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:16,183
And there's definitely code

727
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,645
from the game jam still in the game.

728
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:19,567
You know that very well.

729
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:22,030
So that's Shipbreaker.

730
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,753
We're in early access on Steam.

731
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,135
I am Rory McGuire,

732
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:28,997
the Chief Creative Officer here at Blackbird.

733
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:31,320
And I'm Alex Huffman, Associate Creative Director.

734
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:35,430
If you guys have any questions at all about this process, what we went through,

735
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,112
you have a question about some lore stuff that you experienced in Shipbreaker,

736
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:42,034
or you have feedback about a game mechanic, we would love to hear it.

737
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:45,876
So you can tweet at us here and or just send us emails.

738
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:50,398
Though we apologize if our spam filters go sideways.

739
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:55,842
So thank you all very much, have a great GDC summer, and we will talk to you soon.

740
00:32:56,002 --> 00:32:56,922
Sure, thanks everybody.
