1
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:09,362
Thank you all so much for coming.

2
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,004
My name is Abhi.

3
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:13,405
I'm the designer and writer of Venba.

4
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:16,148
And this is my talk.

5
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:20,651
I'm calling it Lore Don't Tell, a guide for telling culturally rooted stories.

6
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:24,194
So what is Venba?

7
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:31,300
Venba is a narrative cooking game where you play as a immigrant Indian mother who moves to Canada in the late 1980s with her family.

8
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:34,331
and her travel to Canada, her recipe book gets damaged.

9
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:42,316
So as a result, players have to cook various South Indian dishes to restore these lost recipes while also exploring this family story.

10
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:49,141
The game explores the relationships within a family and how it grows and changes over time, but it does that through the lens of food.

11
00:00:52,605 --> 00:01:01,913
The problem I see a lot is that showcasing a culture in media can be very challenging, especially if it's a culture that an international audience isn't necessarily familiar with.

12
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:13,902
If it's a culture that's familiar, you can just focus on telling the story, but when it's not, you feel a need to tell not just a story, but also educate in the ways of the culture in addition to telling the story.

13
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:18,006
You almost want to set up the context so that players can understand the story you're telling.

14
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:22,489
But ironically, I find that this leads to worse storytelling.

15
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,372
The story and plot now serve two purposes.

16
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,576
Not only does it have to do justice to the characters, it also has to educate.

17
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:32,959
And anytime you could do that, you could be telling the story instead.

18
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:37,602
So the solution to this problem already exists.

19
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:38,962
It's what we call lore.

20
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:44,403
With Venba, I got a lot of praise for how it portrayed the culture in a very unassuming way.

21
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,464
Someone said Venba just exists.

22
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,504
It doesn't say or do what it is.

23
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:50,825
It just presents itself, right?

24
00:01:51,385 --> 00:02:00,667
And people asked a lot of questions about how I wasn't worried about the specific, hyper-specific details that I showed, about players missing those details, et cetera, et cetera.

25
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:11,857
And when I was trying to explain why it felt right for me to tell the story in this way, and add these details in this way, I realized I was essentially describing what we all understand to be lore.

26
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:15,561
In most media, there's plot and there's lore, right?

27
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:19,765
Plot is told to the player, but lore exists for the player to discover.

28
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:25,668
In fantasy settings, we are often thrust into worlds and cultures that are drastically different from ours.

29
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,450
But in those settings, not everything is explained to the player.

30
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,831
Often things are left unsaid.

31
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:37,675
The author alone might know these details to flesh out the world, but they heavily leverage the lore to do it instead of using the plot.

32
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:40,577
So why should real-world cultures be any different?

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,161
Before I start going into specific examples, I want to address one thing.

34
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:54,343
I think when we try to tell culturally rooted stories, we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to make sure we capture all of it, right?

35
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:57,804
And I definitely understand this responsibility.

36
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:05,285
I think this also causes an insecurity in us because we know that to tell this culture is not something people might be familiar with.

37
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:08,026
But I think we need to let go of that insecurity.

38
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:14,771
My favorite Tamil movie director, Vetri Maran, would often say, the more local you are, the more international you become.

39
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:22,117
So to me, that means tell a very hyper-specific story, and somehow it feels more universal that way.

40
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:29,262
And the strength of the stories we tell is that it's different and unique, and we shouldn't dumb it down and risk losing that.

41
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:33,686
Let me start by going to specific examples.

42
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:45,129
So one thing I see is a lot of times we, in an eagerness to communicate to the player, we start treating the familiar as unfamiliar.

43
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,350
What I mean by that is that

44
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,888
If we want the players to engage with our world and the things in our world, and as if they are familiar cornerstones, we have to treat it as familiar first.

45
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:04,558
So when a player is thrust into the world of Venba, they may or may not be familiar with Tamil culture and Tamil cuisine, but Venba and Pavlin are experts, right?

46
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,923
And there's a dissonance here between the knowledge of the players and the knowledge of the characters.

47
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:18,826
But if I write the game in a way that the characters explain the different aspects of the culture, then these characters themselves are acting as if the culture is something that needs to be explained.

48
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:26,668
I never talk about idli or dosa in a way that, oh, it's a fermented rice batter.

49
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:27,709
I don't talk about it that way.

50
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,269
I just say idli and dosa, right?

51
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:30,169
Because I know what it is.

52
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:38,152
But if I try to account for players who don't, Venba and Pavlin are starting to act like they don't know what idli and dosa is.

53
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:42,673
So instead, I think it's better to lean into the dissonance instead.

54
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:49,355
Aggressively don't explain anything, and don't explain anything that these characters normally wouldn't.

55
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:53,056
If it's not a conversation that they would normally have, then don't bother.

56
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:58,618
And I think this actually creates a feeling that these characters aren't here for the player, or in service of the player.

57
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:01,819
They're here regardless, and the player is just here along for the journey.

58
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:10,119
There is one level in Venba where Venba cooks a variety of dishes, like a marathon.

59
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:15,193
And I don't tell the players what the name of these dishes are in English.

60
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:19,694
So a lot of times during playtesting, players are like, these dishes look so good.

61
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:20,554
I want to cook them.

62
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:22,354
What are they called, right?

63
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:25,915
And this is the most common feedback I got for this particular level.

64
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:32,436
The feeling I wanted to recreate in this level is Wenba creating dish after dish after dish, right?

65
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:36,797
So it's complete contrast to the other levels where there's only one dish you create.

66
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:47,004
So the way to address that feedback is, some people said, why don't you put a title at top of the dish when the final thing is presented so players know what they're cooking.

67
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:49,846
And this is a completely valid ask, and we almost considered it.

68
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:57,172
But then it struck me, how absurd would it be if I showed pizza and large letters showed up saying pizza, right?

69
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:03,177
So here, the game itself, from the UI itself, it's trying to acknowledge that

70
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:08,063
if I showed those titles that these dishes are not something you should be familiar with.

71
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:19,300
Instead, if you go the other way, yes, it leads to some player frustration, but it at least cements the fact that these are the bread and butter for Venva and Pavlin.

72
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:30,187
And just like how it's important to familiarize, keep familiar things familiar, you can do the opposite to reinforce what is unfamiliar for these characters.

73
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:34,549
So when Wenba speaks in Tamil, the default text color is white.

74
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,290
And throughout the game, that's how it remains.

75
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,111
But when a character speaks in English, the text color changes.

76
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:45,613
This treats speaking English as a special occurrence, which makes sense for these characters.

77
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:48,355
And it's not something normal to the players, right?

78
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:57,844
But by default, when one of the members was implementing the language tags, by default it would be English, and you'd have to tag it to make it dumber.

79
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:02,308
So that also led to the different colors, right?

80
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:04,090
But I had to reverse that very consciously.

81
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,677
Because it makes sense for all of us growing up here, the English does feel like the default, but you have to make sure that that doesn't bleed into the game itself.

82
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:19,677
The other thing I want to bring up is, where does all of this stem from?

83
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:30,309
I think it stems from an eagerness for the game to be a good representation, but often it leads into it trying to be representative.

84
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:32,646
talk.

85
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:54,518
And it's important to remember that we are a representation, we are not the representation.

86
00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:04,207
But you might be seen as the representation by the players, but that's a problem of not enough pieces like Pinball or other games existing.

87
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:14,197
But if you do try to be representative, it leads to the game feeling more like a tour guide than a story that you're saying.

88
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:19,787
This line can actually get really, really blurry when you're in production.

89
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:24,371
So with Venba, I knew that a lot of the players were interested in it for the story.

90
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:29,875
But I also know that a lot more players were interested in it because it's about South Indian food, and they were really excited about it.

91
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:36,321
So a lot of the feature requests that we got were things like, can we understand what these dishes are?

92
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,022
Can we get trivia about them?

93
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:38,903
Can we get their recipes?

94
00:08:39,003 --> 00:08:39,824
And all these things, right?

95
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,046
And these are very, very reasonable asks.

96
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:56,975
I felt the need to cater to them a bit, and catering to these things might seem innocent enough, and in fact it makes the game much more commercially viable if we say that, oh, play Wenba to learn how to cook.

97
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:04,919
But I specifically was very careful about avoiding this, and whenever people ask, can we play Wenba to learn how to cook, I would just say,

98
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:05,539
talk.

99
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:24,059
they can't walk away with a complete understanding of the dish itself.

100
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:34,387
And you have to be specifically careful about this when working with publishers or merchandising because these are the aspects that appeals to them and these are the things that they might push for.

101
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:37,670
But you're not creating a product, you're trying to tell a story.

102
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:46,228
So instead, what I did was, the thing is that I'm also very, very passionate about South Indian food.

103
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:52,150
And I do like to tell people, oh, Italy is made of three days rice fermented batter and things like that, right?

104
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,330
And similarly, Benba is also very passionate.

105
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:05,973
So I, I was able to find organic ways of Benba geeking out about food and treating that as a way to give the players more insight and more trivia about the recipe.

106
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:10,288
So there are ways to find it, it just has to be more subtle.

107
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:21,759
If you're not giving players these things, but what you can do is inspire them to seek more for themselves, especially when it's a real-world culture.

108
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,005
So for example, this is how every level in the game starts, by showing this calendar and there's a small proverb.

109
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:36,910
I never explain what these proverbs are called, what these collections of proverbs are called, why are they here.

110
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,710
I don't explain any of these things.

111
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,672
But the thing is, that proverb, it's actually called a venba.

112
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:45,572
And venba is named after these poems.

113
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:51,154
So there is a question of, is this game named after these poems or after the main character?

114
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:59,036
And even though it's so subtle like this, I saw so many people looking up these proverbs, trying to find out where they're from.

115
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,297
People found, like, dumber subreddits, and they were like, oh, can you translate this for me?

116
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:04,778
Where can I read more of this, right?

117
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:06,238
that's

118
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:28,293
This is important because these gaps are important for us to leave.

119
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:34,557
If I made a playlist, then it becomes much more authoritative, and it becomes the one source, right?

120
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:39,160
And if I make a guide for, go look at these things, it mutes that discussion.

121
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:42,183
But when players have questions, it actually generates more discussion.

122
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:45,685
So I think it's really, it's actually effective to leave these gaps.

123
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:51,327
I'm

124
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:25,234
and you can do that either with the framing, so with the food, like it was really important for me to make it look really delicious and sound really good and all of that because whenever I cook, I know which part of the recipe step I get excited about, right?

125
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:29,157
So visually, it was very easy to push for that.

126
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:33,800
And similarly, the characters in Venba are also deeply passionate about thermoculture.

127
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:39,524
So just seeing that passion is infectious and that's what leaves a lasting impression on the player.

128
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:45,619
So players might not always see lore, but they'll definitely feel it.

129
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,880
And I'll give you some examples of that.

130
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,144
Every level in Wenba also starts with this photo wall, right?

131
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:56,947
And on the left side, you'll see a photo frame of Wenba and her parents.

132
00:12:57,407 --> 00:13:02,131
And on the right side, you see more modern day photos of her family in Canada.

133
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:12,954
So I really, really like that I did this because photos in India, especially back in the day, people just took them and they would cut them out of pictures.

134
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:14,834
They weren't really made to any standard sizes.

135
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:21,656
So it's very clear to me that Venba brought pictures of her family from India to Canada.

136
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:26,958
There's no frames that fit in, so she put two photos in and made a frame out of it.

137
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:31,662
And as the photos took in Canada, they come for a very specific frame size, right?

138
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:37,707
For a lot of Indian players, when they see this, they're like, yeah, I absolutely have a photo like this in my home.

139
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:39,049
They immediately catch that.

140
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:44,093
But players who are not necessarily from the same culture, they still get this same feeling.

141
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:45,895
I don't have to explain all of these things.

142
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,977
They're able to connect the gaps.

143
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,738
And this gives so much personality.

144
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:59,562
And if I shy away from showing something like that, because players wouldn't understand it, they wouldn't be thinking about it in this way.

145
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:01,723
And if I did explain it, it would be boring.

146
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:04,945
So I think this is a really nice line to walk.

147
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:24,433
So another thing I did that was very subtle is once again bringing back this example between English and Tamil is that something that really bothers me about diaspora media is when people write dialogues in English and there's a very first generation immigrant speaking.

148
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:33,378
I can tell when it was written by an assimilated person and not an assimilated person because sentence structures change when your language changes.

149
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,119
Your thoughts change when your language changes.

150
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:39,801
So if you write in English from the get-go, Venba is speaking English.

151
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:45,883
So to avoid that, I actually wrote all the Tamil dialogues in Tamil first, and then I translated them into English.

152
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:50,384
This might seem like a lot of effort, but language is thoughts, right?

153
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:55,146
Like sometimes I have to consciously switch in which language I'm thinking to flesh out that thought better.

154
00:14:56,146 --> 00:15:01,568
So it was much easier to capture that authenticity if the dialogues were written in Tamil first.

155
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:04,669
And similarly for Thavin, who's more assimilated,

156
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:05,929
a lot

157
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:33,829
She was able to recognize that very consciously because she's summer, but I think every player still feels the same feeling They're like all these feelings add up right into fleshing out this world.

158
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,511
It might just not be that explicit

159
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:43,697
So if culture is lore, we should also make peace with the fact that lore is meant to be miscible.

160
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:53,741
A core essence of fleshing out a world is giving the players a feeling that they don't fully understand this world yet, and there's parts that they haven't seen yet.

161
00:15:54,561 --> 00:16:01,024
There's a lot of details and subtext that I've crammed into Venpa, but that by definition means players won't see everything.

162
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:04,485
They'll miss some things, they won't connect things individually.

163
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:08,206
But this means more to the players that don't miss it, right?

164
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:13,048
Because they're able to connect it because they have had a certain similar experience or maybe they're from that culture.

165
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,810
But even for the players that do miss it, this gap actually creates a lot of depth.

166
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,032
So I'm really wary about filling the gap just because people miss it.

167
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:29,160
So in the spoilers, in the fifth level, Benba's husband Pavelin passes away.

168
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:37,971
And the way I communicate that is by a single shot of Pavelin's photo and his glasses and the book because he's a writer.

169
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:45,109
Culturally, this is a big difference between the West and South India, specifically.

170
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,993
We don't hang photos, or we don't use to hang photos of ourselves unless a person passes away.

171
00:16:51,294 --> 00:17:00,881
And especially when it's framed this way, as a singular photo of him, people who saw that and it's black and white, they immediately got, if they're from Tamil Nadu, they immediately got that, oh, Pawan passed away.

172
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:04,424
But for a lot of other players, they didn't get that.

173
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:11,268
until maybe the level ended or maybe even after when they see Coven wearing Pavelin's glasses.

174
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:21,235
And this might seem like a issue to address and to make it more explicit, but it's not the worst thing if they don't connect the dots immediately, right?

175
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:24,858
If you let the question linger in their head, that actually creates a lot of interest.

176
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,279
Like if they're playing the game thinking, wait, what happened to that?

177
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,020
What happened to that?

178
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,864
and then they finally find out, they're more engaged also.

179
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:34,086
So it's not absolutely the worst thing.

180
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:40,893
And then they're like, okay, so that photo then retroactively they can make the connection.

181
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:45,218
And when you make connections like that, you really learn the culture, you really feel the culture.

182
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:49,561
We might all feel this when we go to different countries or different cultures.

183
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:55,326
We just observe certain things that are different and we're not quite sure why they're different and then we'll understand it slowly.

184
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,469
So playing Venva essentially gives that same experience.

185
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:10,427
There's also, okay, I know I said lore is meant to be miscible and all of that, but I'm just going to go through some details that I'm a little annoyed that not enough people noticed.

186
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:17,531
So this one is when they revealed the Puttu scene, and I really love it, but it's a direct reference

187
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:27,297
to this movie, and even though you didn't have to have seen this movie, like the comedy of the scene is captured here.

188
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:40,946
And similarly, the dad, Pavelin, has a very striking resemblance to one of my favorite actors, so much so that from the beginning that's been the reference.

189
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:54,295
And then here, Venba's cooking biryani, which is one of the most complicated recipes, but Venba is such a good cook, her confidence comes through just in the way the dishes and utensils come in, right?

190
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:58,118
She's excited to cook, and therefore the player is excited to cook.

191
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:02,982
And when she pours the oil, she's just, you know, shotgunning it, right?

192
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:03,762
talk.

193
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:20,730
This might be the most subtle one.

194
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:30,317
In one of the levels where you cook with ghee in Canada, the ghee is semi-solid, and you put it into the pan, and then it melts.

195
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:35,981
But when you cook with ghee in India, because the room temperature is higher, it's already melted to start with.

196
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:40,584
And when I asked my team, they're like, oh, we already have a ghee acid.

197
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:41,725
I'm like, no, it needs to be liquid.

198
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:44,787
They're like, no one's going to notice, but it's important for me.

199
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,814
So, a lot of these details might feel very self-indulgent, and it is.

200
00:19:52,914 --> 00:19:59,760
All these movie references and everything is very, very self-indulgent for me, but it makes it so much more worth it when even one person notices.

201
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,903
And the main point is that even if other people don't notice it, they will feel it.

202
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:08,207
They will feel that when they're stacked with details and there's this world that they haven't quite discovered yet.

203
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:26,980
Every opportunity, every, I know indie developers sometimes groan at achievements, but for me, achievements are just so liberating, because they were just this window of places where I can cram even more references, even more details, and showcase what are the things I like about my culture.

204
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,341
Yeah, and that's pretty much it.

205
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:31,423
That's how I approached Venva.

206
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:36,566
And yeah, I think, I definitely understand that we all feel the need to

207
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:45,931
Make sure that players understand what's cool about our culture and make sure that we convey what we find interesting and do it properly.

208
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:54,078
But if we let go of that a bit and we make peace with the fact that some players might miss it, I think it does make for a better product.

209
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:55,559
Thank you so much.

210
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,895
We can do questions, if anybody wants to do questions.

211
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:17,661
If not, please remember to fill out your evaluation forms.

212
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:24,451
Hi, I'm Yu-Sun Chung from Electronic Arts.

213
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,173
I really enjoyed this talk.

214
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:27,813
Thank you so much.

215
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:32,296
And I really like the visual, and I really like the use of color.

216
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:40,280
And yeah, I think the food, I can't wait to go to the game and start making those myself.

217
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,000
Awesome.

218
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:44,202
Which platform is this game available also?

219
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:48,684
Canada was referred in the presentation.

220
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:50,745
Did you make it in Canada?

221
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:50,845
Yeah.

222
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:58,347
So I came to Canada when I was 12 and when I was inspired by a lot of the families I saw in Canada.

223
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,208
We're out on pretty much every platform.

224
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:03,908
PC, Switch, PS5, Xbox.

225
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:05,649
We're also on a massive sale right now.

226
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,015
Awesome, I'm buying it tonight.

227
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:17,782
Did you get any feedback from Indian audiences, whether in Canada or in India?

228
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:25,708
Yeah, so one thing I was super worried about is my friends back home will roast the shit out of diaspora media.

229
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:30,150
And I was like, oh no, I hope that doesn't happen with Venba.

230
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,431
But thankfully, I think I was really committed to keeping things very authentic and important.

231
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:48,754
So much so that in the biryani level, one of the things that most players struggle with, there's a livestream of one of the streamers, a Tamil streamer playing with his mom, and she didn't even look at the recipe.

232
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:50,575
She was just like, yeah, go do this, go do that.

233
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:56,059
And the fact that her instincts were right in the game, I think, is really good.

234
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:58,121
So they're all really happy with it.

235
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,403
And that's something I'm very grateful for.

236
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:07,358
Hi, I have been, I've played Vampire, actually, a while ago.

237
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:15,221
I've been following it for a few years now, actually, because I am, one of my research areas as a professor of game design is food in games.

238
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:16,861
So, very relevant.

239
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:24,584
And one of the questions that I had for you was, how did you approach the design of the cooking itself?

240
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:31,469
And then a follow-up to that would be, how did you balance the story elements with the cooking levels?

241
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:35,290
How did you figure out what was a good balance between those two?

242
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:36,591
Yeah.

243
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:42,433
So for me, that was a really, really hard problem to figure out because Indian recipes are very, very complicated.

244
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:45,194
Like the ingredient list itself is like,

245
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:46,278
like

246
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:11,834
And Idli has like these plates and these ways you rotate and place them.

247
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:15,859
And it felt like a physical turn the object around kind of game.

248
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:18,783
So that became much easier to start making.

249
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:21,246
So I started to find puzzles within the recipes themselves.

250
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:24,651
They were simpler, but I think they were more fun to solve.

251
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:30,573
Um, and I also try to keep in mind like which dishes doesn't make sense for the family to cook.

252
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:38,195
So in the 1980s, making something like biryani would be very expensive, uh, because those speciality spices are really hard to come by.

253
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:43,877
But in the 2006, the explosion of the immigration community in Toronto makes those things more possible, right?

254
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:51,220
So it nicely aligned with the recipes are getting more difficult and complex, but it's also because when we can now actually cook these, uh, dishes.

255
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,320
Thank you.

256
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,751
So yeah, hi Avi.

257
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:57,051
Thank you so much for the talk.

258
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:57,452
Yeah.

259
00:24:57,772 --> 00:25:01,654
And as a Tamilian, big congratulations for the IGF awards yesterday.

260
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:01,995
Thank you.

261
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:03,095
I was screaming my lungs out.

262
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:03,416
Thank you.

263
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:03,976
May have heard me.

264
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:04,596
Thank you.

265
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:11,081
So my question is that around the world, there are a lot of local games made by local devs for local audiences.

266
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:16,444
But we see that these are not as popular in the West, especially like games from Iran, from India.

267
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:24,149
Whereas Venba is something that, as you mentioned, instantly kind of appealed to the global audience in a way that other games haven't.

268
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,171
So if you didn't try to do this consciously then, you know, why did it work?

269
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:29,792
What's your opinion on how it?

270
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:49,465
Yeah, I think a lot of it is in we were in the right place right time also being in Canada being in So close to a game dev scene comes with massive massive privileges So I don't think I think if I didn't make when but it's a matter of time before someone else did And yeah, I think right now

271
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:52,267
the India game I've seen is exploding.

272
00:25:53,088 --> 00:26:01,576
And I can't wait till so many more cooking games come out that when Bob becomes irrelevant, I'll be able to breathe freely then.

273
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:02,737
I think it's just a matter of time.

274
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:03,117
Yeah.

275
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:04,398
Okay.

276
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:05,119
Thank you so much.

277
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:09,123
Hi, thank you so much for the talk.

278
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:10,004
It was so incredible.

279
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:15,089
I particularly loved how you had the two different assets for the ghee, the solid and the liquid.

280
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:19,914
I was wondering, how did you negotiate that with the extra asset for the temp team?

281
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:23,617
Yeah, my producer is sitting in the front row.

282
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:34,645
So yeah, I think what I really like about working with my team is that they will first understand what I'm going for.

283
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:40,009
If I am able to convey why it's important to me, they'll be like, OK, fine, we'll do it.

284
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,752
But it's just about finding the way to do it.

285
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:46,134
It's a lot of compromises, a lot of compromises for sure.

286
00:26:46,794 --> 00:26:48,655
We can keep adding details, right?

287
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:52,938
But those kind of small details go a long way.

288
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:55,739
So it becomes a big compromise thing.

289
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:59,141
I'm really bad at scoping and all of those things.

290
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:02,163
So I'll keep putting ideas on the board.

291
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:05,925
And my team will ruthlessly cut it.

292
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:08,426
And sometimes we get into debates and stuff like that.

293
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:10,767
But I think that's how the game is made.

294
00:27:12,307 --> 00:27:16,907
My follow-up is, is there anything that was cut for scope that you still wish could have made it?

295
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:22,631
Yeah, so initially I wanted way more levels to begin with.

296
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:24,312
So that cut down to seven.

297
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:33,779
And I think things like, I wanted the player to have the feel, like once you cook idli, it's stuck, especially if you use a cloth.

298
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,601
It's very satisfying when you peel that idli off the cloth.

299
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:37,721
Very, very satisfying.

300
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:40,443
And I wanted the player to be able to do that physically.

301
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:46,467
But I also suggested this idea after we had already passed certification and we had a month.

302
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:51,631
So yeah, there's so many things like that.

303
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,851
I made an entire document.

304
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:56,554
After we passed CERT, we're like, OK, we have three weeks for day one patch.

305
00:27:57,955 --> 00:28:01,617
My lead programmer made, here's some bugs and polishes that we have to do.

306
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,398
My producer made an even smaller list.

307
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:09,562
I wrote entire features and story arcs that they ruthlessly shot down as they should.

308
00:28:10,843 --> 00:28:12,484
Thank you so much, and congratulations again.

309
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:12,884
Thank you.

310
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:19,925
Hi, I'm wondering how you went about Canadian culture.

311
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:26,588
Was there anything you wanted to highlight from there or did you kind of want to undersell that to highlight the Indian culture?

312
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:33,913
Yeah, so I think this goes back to the original question of like, if Venba is about something, what is it not about, right?

313
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:37,354
So you're absolutely right, like that is something I struggled with also.

314
00:28:37,975 --> 00:28:41,497
There's so much in Canada that I love and want to show

315
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:42,197
talk.

316
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:01,143
not show so much of Canada.

317
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:04,966
And the entire game happens inside the home for most of it.

318
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:13,173
And that was intentional so that when Wenba finally goes back to India, that's when we show that they're sitting out in the open in the terrace.

319
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:18,537
So to Wenba, immigration was very suffocating.

320
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:23,641
And that's exactly what we wanted to show.

321
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:25,002
Thank you.

322
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:29,933
Hey, good talk.

323
00:29:30,513 --> 00:29:35,537
I do games that has a focus on the African diaspora.

324
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:39,940
So a lot of the creative challenges I very much understand.

325
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:55,852
One of the things that I've struggled with recently over the past couple years is sourcing, the wanting to, the things that you kind of mentioned, wanting to show and make sure people kind of get an understanding of certain aspects and details.

326
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:56,934
aspect of

327
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:15,169
would

328
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,782
when I started watching anime, I had no idea what was going on.

329
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:47,864
They were just so authentic and they didn't make it for us, they made it for themselves, right?

330
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,725
But we put up with that, right?

331
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:50,945
We would look up everything.

332
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:52,666
I would go to the wiki pages and like, what does that mean?

333
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:53,947
What does this mean?

334
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:59,969
So if they can do that, like for me, that's what I wanted to do with Venba, is like, if I read

335
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:01,810
talk.

336
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,480
to translate it themselves with Google Translate.

337
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:28,082
And they're like, oh, this dish, I'm going to go cook it.

338
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:30,264
I don't quite understand it, but I'm going to find the ingredients.

339
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:31,645
So they're doing that.

340
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:32,986
I'm really, really happy about that.

341
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:37,410
So I think your passion for whatever you want to show is organic.

342
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:41,213
You trying to make it accessible to them is inorganic.

343
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:46,157
And I think as long as we stay organic, it will shine through for the people who want to engage with it.

344
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:48,193
Appreciate it.

345
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:49,295
Thank you.

346
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:51,399
I think that's it.

347
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:53,523
Thank you so much for coming.
