1
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:11,528
Okay. Hi everyone, thanks for coming to this talk. Before we start I'd like to gently remind you to

2
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:17,890
switch off your cell phones and to evaluate this session at the end. This is my first talk at GDC

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,972
Europe and your feedback will be very valuable for me so please do that at the end.

4
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:29,455
I'm PaweÅ‚, I'm Director of Research and Development Technology at Techland.

5
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:34,330
And I came to you from Wroclaw, which is located in Poland.

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,672
And I'm going to give you some insights about Dying Light game.

7
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:40,594
So the title for the session is 4 and 1

8
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,995
half million players within 100 days.

9
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:45,877
There are two important takeaways for this talk.

10
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:49,659
So you'll learn what are the most important aspects

11
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,700
of successful game before the release.

12
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:54,322
What have we done before the release to make it successful.

13
00:00:55,195 --> 00:01:01,241
and then how to increase the game virality and visibility to make a great commercial success.

14
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:08,088
So things we've done after the game is being released to the market, to the platforms.

15
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:11,093
So the agenda for this talk is as follows.

16
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:13,995
I'll give you some very brief background about myself

17
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,076
and Dying Light game.

18
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,858
And then we'll jump into the meat of the presentation.

19
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:20,719
So we'll be talking about things before and after release.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,362
And hopefully, at the end, we'll have some time for questions.

21
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:26,063
So please stay tuned.

22
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:33,431
About me, I'm a director of research and technology development, which means I'm doing pretty much everything in the company.

23
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:46,541
Which means I'm responsible for stuff like defining vision and goals for technology development, advising the business development and supporting internal teams in terms of technology decisions.

24
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:55,067
I'm also conducting research and conducting scientific and technological centers like hardware manufacturers and so on.

25
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,892
and also managing internal teams, running inter-program,

26
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:03,375
hiring people, and all stuff connected with game development.

27
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:07,118
At last, but not least, I'm working very closely

28
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:07,858
to game teams.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,603
So I try to provide the best technology for game teams

30
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:15,524
that they could take benefit from.

31
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,427
Yeah, a lot of stuff, but I believe strongly

32
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:22,870
in synergy between business, art, science, and technology.

33
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,772
That's why I really enjoy my work.

34
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:31,395
OK, so first question, have you played Dying Light?

35
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,475
Please raise your hand.

36
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:34,877
OK.

37
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:38,079
And who hasn't heard about the game at all,

38
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,520
like for the first time here?

39
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,642
OK, three people.

40
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:46,925
So I'm going to show you a very short, like 60-second video

41
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:47,746
clip about the game.

42
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:50,828
So it will remind you what the game is about.

43
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:55,091
But first, why video clips are good for the presentations

44
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:55,431
like this?

45
00:02:56,784 --> 00:03:01,369
So there is a Chinese proverb which says that word is worth 10,000 words.

46
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:10,480
So if we have a 60 seconds trailer at 25 frames per second, it gives us one and a half thousand

47
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,900
pictures.

48
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:14,645
That is 15 million words, right?

49
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:19,990
I'm speaking to you right now at 180 words per minute, approximately.

50
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:26,280
So I would need almost one and a half thousand hours to talk about this video clip.

51
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,984
So let's save some time and see the trailer.

52
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,618
Okay, so this was something we've done before the release, of course.

53
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:42,505
Yeah, and now is a very good time to jump into that part of the presentation.

54
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,889
So we'll start with the things that we've done before.

55
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:49,583
we try to do the clear communication of the game

56
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:49,963
features.

57
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:51,543
So there are certain game features

58
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,924
in the game which are really like the face of the game.

59
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:58,345
For example, one of our first major feature

60
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,625
was the melee combat.

61
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,026
So in the game, you can kill zombies

62
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:05,166
in many different ways, like using weapons, traps,

63
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,127
environment, world objects.

64
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:10,228
You can kill zombies by kicking zombies, jumping out of them.

65
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,669
And we put a lot of effort to make killing fun.

66
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,629
So that was our first feature.

67
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:24,779
The second feature of the game is that you don't have to use the first feature. So you don't have to fight zombies, you don't have to kill zombies if they don't like you.

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:34,371
Instead you can use plier parkour style of moving across the world. And we call this feature the natural movement. It means that you can jump over the zombies.

69
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:39,548
You can push them, kick them, you can climb the building smartly away from the zombies.

70
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:45,952
You can use grappling hook to very fast and quickly and efficiently move around the world.

71
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:51,636
So the second feature is something that you can use the first feature or you can combine

72
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:52,217
them together.

73
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,318
So it worked really, really great.

74
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:57,152
The third one is the night.

75
00:05:57,872 --> 00:05:59,352
So during the night, gameplay changes.

76
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:04,933
Zombies are more scary, more powerful, much more dangerous than during the day.

77
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,654
And you should really avoid the night if you want to survive.

78
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:11,294
There are new types of zombies, for example, like Volatiles,

79
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,995
which are chasing you always when you are looking back.

80
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:17,415
You need to use your flashlight, which limits your field of view,

81
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:18,696
which is even more scary.

82
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:23,157
And we call the feature Hunter by Day, Prey at Night.

83
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:29,515
And really, we try to make the game feature strong and visible for everyone.

84
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,957
And the last feature I'd like to mention about is the co-op play.

85
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:38,861
So you can explore the world of Koran, which is the main location in the game, with other

86
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,161
players, up to four players.

87
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:41,983
And people really love that.

88
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,326
Apart from the co-op play, you can play in player versus player mode, which we called

89
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:53,010
be the zombie mode, when you can be a hunter chasing human controlled by other players.

90
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,162
And that was one of the major things that we did before the release.

91
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:03,703
So, apart from the feature, we were showing the features.

92
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:08,025
We were not afraid to show, like, the one minute of the gameplay.

93
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:13,327
It's not a trailer, it's a gameplay, right? The video that you have seen, it's a gameplay video.

94
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,308
It's not a, like, trailer for marketing purposes.

95
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,910
It's the gameplay, and we were showing each week new game feature.

96
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:23,540
or the features that can be combined together

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,342
to create the new gameplay for the game.

98
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:29,865
And we call those features dying highlights.

99
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:33,948
So to keep it interesting, we weren't afraid to show.

100
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:40,732
a bit of humor as well. And one of the clips that was in Dying Highlights was the clip that you saw

101
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:48,699
two minutes ago. And also I'd like to demonstrate you another clip which is very popular and a

102
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:53,924
little bit humorous. And it's a clip about traps you can use to kill the zombies in many different

103
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:54,144
ways.

104
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:28,560
Oh

105
00:08:56,982 --> 00:09:01,024
So as you can see, it's not only the melee fighting and the natural movement.

106
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:08,606
You can also kill zombies using the environment and different objects in the world.

107
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:16,269
The next thing I want to mention is that our in-house technology really worked for us.

108
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,871
So apart from those four game pillars I've mentioned, we're having our own tech.

109
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:24,452
And it's a really great advantage for us.

110
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,401
We have been developing the tech for 15 years right now,

111
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:31,462
and it gives us great flexibility and advantage.

112
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:35,703
Like, we decide which platform we are targeting,

113
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:38,123
which game features we would like to bring

114
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,243
to the higher level to support games,

115
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:42,644
and really, that's great, right?

116
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:44,484
So we have physically-based shading,

117
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,624
advanced post-processing,

118
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,705
as the photorealism is really important for us.

119
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:53,106
So we decide which features should support the game,

120
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:54,546
and how.

121
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:58,639
Of course, based on our engine, so the rendering stuff,

122
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,920
the physics stuff, and so on, we have also in-house made tools.

123
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,661
And this is something that gave us extra advantage, right?

124
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:08,542
So we can create the city like you

125
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:11,643
see in this picture quite easily by using

126
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:14,523
this special feature which is called hierarchical selections.

127
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,564
Unfortunately, I don't have time to go through that.

128
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:19,925
But if we have some time for questions,

129
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:21,545
you can ask me about that, and I'll

130
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:23,706
try to explain it in a few words.

131
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:32,011
But in general, it's some kind of a way to build a world in a hierarchical way, and in a semi-procedural way.

132
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:39,035
So we can just clone some groups of objects, which can vary a little bit, to build the city, which looks like this.

133
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:47,019
Okay, so this is something we've done before the release, and it's release day, so everyone is exhausted.

134
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,521
But it seems that the real fun is just about to start.

135
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,803
So we really wanted to take care of...

136
00:10:53,688 --> 00:10:56,290
things such as keep the player engaged in our game,

137
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,832
so it's not only a one-shot game,

138
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:02,996
keep the product fresh and viable in full price,

139
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:06,038
and stick to our goal like long-term investment

140
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:09,641
and player support, and what we did to achieve that.

141
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,426
First, we have used the PLS system,

142
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:16,388
it's post-launch system, we call the system like that.

143
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,871
So we wanted to gather data from users, like the telemetry.

144
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,053
But it's only a 50% of the success.

145
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,676
We've provided the system, this system provides the ability

146
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:29,817
to do the real-time patches, game patches.

147
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,159
So if we gather the data from users,

148
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,422
we can tweak on a daily basis game balance,

149
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,703
like game scripts, for example.

150
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:38,583
So we can.

151
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:43,931
we have the whole loop so we can see how the changes progresses by changing the

152
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:49,937
scripts, getting data, and then it's a closed loop and we can just make the

153
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:53,541
game better and better on a daily basis or a few times a day even.

154
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:59,730
It also allowed us to use some event type,

155
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,332
event based actions like new achievements,

156
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:04,653
challenges or for example, first of April power up

157
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:08,176
when we just increase the power of fists and kicks

158
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,517
and you can just kick the zombie like

159
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:13,299
for a few kilometers away from the player.

160
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,541
So it really worked for us.

161
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:17,982
Of course we have implemented the PLS system before,

162
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,404
but we use that after the game is being released.

163
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,863
This is the example stats from the screenshots from the tool that we've used for telemetry.

164
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:35,989
So as we can see for PC players, there is something between 35 and 40 percent of retention.

165
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,573
So the people really completed the game with returning to the game and completed the game

166
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,754
after the whole gameplay.

167
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,216
And it's really unlikely to have an open world game.

168
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:48,797
So it was a good sign for us.

169
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,821
Here are some other stats that you can take a look, like for example, distance traveled.

170
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:59,943
It's something like 700 ways from Earth to Moon.

171
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:06,505
But also we can see from the stats, like marked in green, that lock picking is quite well

172
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:06,965
balanced.

173
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:11,446
So still there are more players who were able to pick the locks.

174
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:18,869
Maybe we can see from the stats that zombies dissolved in acid is quite low,

175
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,292
so maybe we should teach the players to do so,

176
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:27,156
or maybe there are two little places where you can kill the zombies that way.

177
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:33,101
So we know that from our telemetry and we can balance it in real time.

178
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:38,361
Okay, so that was the wide aspect of telemetry.

179
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:41,183
So we were gathering like statistic data from the users.

180
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:45,586
But then we decided to go very pro-player company.

181
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,509
So we were reading feedback on forums, on each forum.

182
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,831
We were talking to community via Steam chat

183
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,172
and on the Facebook.

184
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,694
We were present in social media everywhere.

185
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,517
We were really listening to our gamers

186
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:00,098
and tried to change the game,

187
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:01,779
taking...

188
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,242
like the feedback into account, so it was very important for us.

189
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:12,989
And the example for that is that we are always pushing hardware to the limits of our technology.

190
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:18,213
So we have experienced a lot of issues, like hardware issues for the PC version

191
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:19,814
after the game is being released.

192
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:23,758
And really working with community was a great experience for us

193
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:27,120
because we're contacting individual people who had problems.

194
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:30,343
we were providing the beta branches on Steam.

195
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:32,725
They were downloaded, the branches, they were tested,

196
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,127
said everything is okay, you can go live.

197
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:37,068
We made the patch live.

198
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:38,869
So it really worked for us,

199
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,772
and we received great feedback from community

200
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:44,173
that we're really working with people,

201
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:47,116
not only from telemetry point of view,

202
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:50,938
but also from individual player point of view.

203
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:57,143
And it's a great way of getting to know about your issues

204
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:01,085
getting better feedback from community.

205
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,345
Worked fantastic.

206
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,947
Another thing we've done was releasing the developer tools.

207
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,708
So after two months, two months after release,

208
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:12,489
we have released our world editor.

209
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,611
And people just were able to create the mods for our games,

210
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:19,452
for Dying Light games.

211
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:24,334
So we've got right now, after four months of release,

212
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:24,534
like 150.

213
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:31,510
maps for example, so you can extend your gameplay into 30 hours just by playing mods.

214
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:38,575
And yeah, so it was really, really good direction.

215
00:15:38,615 --> 00:15:42,118
So you can see the different mods on Steam Workshop.

216
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:44,260
So we've done the Steam Workshop integration.

217
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,542
There is a lot of stuff going on in the forum.

218
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:48,303
Here are some stats.

219
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:56,671
So we have something like 150k downloads, which is quite good in terms of game visibility and virality.

220
00:15:57,491 --> 00:16:04,854
And one of the stats for here, which is I guess the most important, is the return of investments for generated marketing value.

221
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:12,377
So we put the X amount of money for making the tools available, and we got 10X.

222
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:21,607
back in the marketing value bar, but generated links, YouTube views, and Facebook views, and so on.

223
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:29,337
So, yeah, it was really a long-term investment, and it was something that you should really consider doing also.

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,661
Apart from that, so apart from the very wide perspective,

225
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:39,702
like the telemetry, and talking to individual users,

226
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,683
we also wanted to reach all potential players.

227
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:45,064
And I really do mean all of them,

228
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,905
like even those who buy the game once or twice a year.

229
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:52,447
So we reached to Ampisound, a parkour collective,

230
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:56,849
to create a real-time, real-life Dying Light video.

231
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:59,610
The video they created for us attracted

232
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,270
over 12 million players.

233
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:05,115
and views both on the YouTube and Facebook, so

234
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:08,298
really we started to propagate the zombie culture

235
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:11,641
in the mainstream media, and it

236
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:14,063
worked also just fantastic. So

237
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:17,406
you were just able to read about Dying Light in

238
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:21,189
really every review and every

239
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,110
journal, so it was great.

240
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:31,040
The next step we've done was that once the game came out,

241
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,841
our focus shifted from just presenting the gameplay

242
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,301
into keep the fans engaged.

243
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:40,662
So we just don't want to show the gameplay,

244
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:42,842
because the players were able to play the game.

245
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:48,003
But we tried to do something like the customer word

246
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:48,443
of mouth.

247
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:52,924
But we wanted the users to create the content

248
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:53,885
and to share the content.

249
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:58,426
So we decided to create something like the community hub

250
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:03,888
when we asked our fans to participate in gameplay community challenges.

251
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:07,770
So first, for example, we asked our fans to submit a maximum

252
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,171
30 second long gameplay clip that make feel them like a badass.

253
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:16,033
The process was very simple. Upload your clip to the YouTube,

254
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,114
tag it with the hashtag badass dying light,

255
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:21,415
and send a tweet with the link in the hashtag.

256
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:23,809
we gave people a week to send the clips in.

257
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,551
And the result was really staggering.

258
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:29,373
So we received hundreds of entries populating YouTube.

259
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,695
As a result, Badass Time Flight Tag

260
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:36,137
had over one million impressions over Twitter alone.

261
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,359
So the best part was that our fans were sending out.

262
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:42,695
like the gameplay from the best possible angle,

263
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:44,356
that they were really proud of it,

264
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:47,439
and it really, like, it was the marketing

265
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,021
which go viral and great.

266
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,503
So digital word of mouth at its best, really.

267
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:59,688
We did some other campaigns, like Drink for DLC,

268
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,150
and it also go viral.

269
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:07,034
We had also ideas like, and we've done the ideas,

270
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:09,356
like the Horan emergency line.

271
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:09,616
So.

272
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:14,187
to give a world of dying light a nod to the real life,

273
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:19,570
we set up a real phone number which is located in the game.

274
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,911
So it's linked to the Skype account

275
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,893
with pre-recorded message and people were able

276
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,355
to find the number and call real Skype

277
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,936
to Horan emergency hotline.

278
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:36,046
And before we publicized the number, we had thousands of messages left on Skype,

279
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,928
account and Reddit threads talking about the number.

280
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:41,290
So we decided to listen to the messages through,

281
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:43,692
and after a week of listening and digging through,

282
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:47,996
we choose the best, most funniest one and create a compilation of that.

283
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:49,237
It's on YouTube as well.

284
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:54,321
And once we released the video, our social channels, the fans went nuts.

285
00:19:54,741 --> 00:20:00,726
Over 100,000 people watched the video, and it seemed just as many people called the number

286
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:01,587
right after.

287
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:03,268
So it was really, really great move.

288
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:09,694
And the amount of positive feedback and community support was really staggering.

289
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,957
OK, so we don't have much time, so...

290
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:21,391
I'll try to make a wrap-up of all the features that we've done, all the things that we've done.

291
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:25,879
clear communication of game pillars, game features.

292
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,601
You need to stick to them and work on them

293
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,683
for the whole production process.

294
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,646
Having our own tech was really great advantage for us.

295
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:38,548
And we are not afraid to show the gameplay footage.

296
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:41,770
So we were showing the gameplay features just

297
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,211
on a weekly basis.

298
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:46,493
And just for three or four months before the release,

299
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:50,196
you can see, you were able to see the game actually

300
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:50,676
how it looks.

301
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,444
We use the post launching system. So both telemetry and

302
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,367
patching on on a daily basis

303
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:06,222
And of course, working with community was one of the best shots in like the marketing and PR of Dying Light.

304
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:12,425
So it helped us solving hardware issues, making challenges, releasing developer tools,

305
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:17,387
community hub for sharing the best gameplay videos from our users.

306
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:26,692
And of course, a lot of crazy and creative ideas like Drink for DLC or Skype emergency hotline was working great.

307
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:32,673
And apart from that, we had tons and tons and tons of content updates.

308
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:37,715
And I'm going to show you right now a short video about our content updates.

309
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:39,016
So enjoy.

310
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:04,332
Let the game begin.

311
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:32,995
and I'll see you in the next video.

312
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:33,276
Bye.

313
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:24,369
Okay, so as you can see, after 180 days after the release, we're still packing the game with updates and people just love that.

314
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:28,491
And we're still working on more on big content update.

315
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:35,193
And that's pretty much it. Thanks for being here. And if you have any questions, I'm here.

316
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:41,595
I'm also at the business area and we have also our recruitment area, so you can find me or my colleagues.

317
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,656
And if you have questions, I'm here for you.

318
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:46,207
Thanks.
