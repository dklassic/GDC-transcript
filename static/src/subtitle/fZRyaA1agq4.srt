00:00:02,721 --> 00:00:07,169
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the studio director of Media Molecule, Siobhan Reddy.

2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:09,133
Hello.

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,922
Big thank you to Ed and Todd. That was absolutely amazing.

4
00:00:20,903 --> 00:00:21,803
So good afternoon.

5
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:28,748
I'm here today to give a small peek into the journey that has been Dreams and Media Molecule.

6
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:32,931
So being able to do a live performance like the one that you've just seen

7
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:37,194
has actually been core to the vision right from the very beginning

8
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:41,336
and in fact was the first way that we showed Dreams off back in 2013.

9
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:46,944
Reminding behind me are the steps that we have taken as a studio,

10
00:00:47,404 --> 00:00:50,125
making LittleBigPlanet, Tearaway and Dreams.

11
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:53,567
And it was on a GDC stage 12 years ago

12
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:57,349
where Alex Evans and Mark Healy introduced Media Molecule

13
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,710
and our vision to bring creative gaming to PlayStation

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,331
and the world with LittleBigPlanet.

15
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:06,253
It's poignant to be on a GDC stage again,

16
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:10,475
not long before we finally released Dreams to our community.

17
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:15,930
According to the outside world, Dreams has been in development forever.

18
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:22,597
And for us, Dreams has taken the time that we have needed to meet the vision that we

19
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:23,718
set out at the start.

20
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,365
So like all epic development journeys, Dreams has pushed us out of our comfort zone and

21
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:34,890
into territory that we weren't used to, especially the getting things wrong zone.

22
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:38,044
We have announced more than one day prematurely,

23
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:40,304
and we have remade this game more than once,

24
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:42,865
learning and building on our findings

25
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,926
so that we could stay true to the vision of the project.

26
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,386
Dreams has been harder, more ambitious,

27
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:52,967
more unpredictable, wildly unpredictable,

28
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:56,968
and has needed every voice of every person at the studio

29
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:57,868
to make this possible.

30
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:02,749
Dreams very much is Media Molecule in digital form.

31
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:05,926
It's our love letter to creators and creativity.

32
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,168
Our studio is one of makers.

33
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:12,409
People who love to create in and outside of work,

34
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:16,430
be it baking, music, gardening, building, fine art.

35
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:19,171
And our mission in all of our games

36
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,572
has been to demystify the creation process,

37
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:24,233
to allow people to see something that they have

38
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:25,674
made on their television screen.

39
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:29,468
To us, making video games should be for everyone

40
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,809
and have the same accessibility and pleasure

41
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:35,250
as playing with a camera, a guitar, or a pencil,

42
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:37,571
something that you can just start to learn

43
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:38,652
by just picking it up.

44
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,173
And just like how everybody who picks up a guitar

45
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,374
won't become a rock star,

46
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:46,095
and maybe doesn't even aspire to be one,

47
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,676
we hope to promote the idea of making games

48
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:49,636
as being a hobby again,

49
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,797
just like it started out for so many of us in this room.

50
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,292
With Dreams, like many things at Media Molecule,

51
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:59,494
it started out by us wanting to have a jam.

52
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,197
Our previous jams had given birth to Sackboy

53
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,220
and to the innovative ways that the Tearaway games

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,802
use the PlayStation controller and the Vita.

55
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:13,883
But maybe this jam was a little more like a musical jam

56
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,604
than a traditional game jam.

57
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:18,506
We wanted everything that we would jam with

58
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:19,526
to complement each other.

59
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:21,127
So one tool.

60
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:25,249
And we wanted creation to be so fast that we could feel free.

61
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,312
Free to make happy accidents, to get lost in an experiment,

62
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:31,413
to make something ridiculous.

63
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,015
We wanted to sidestep the faffy mission

64
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:37,816
of having to bring together a bunch of different tools.

65
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,101
For those seeing dreams for the first time,

66
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,332
this is how that jam took shape.

67
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:49,510
Dreams is a game creation engine that brings all the disciplines

68
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,172
into one space, so moving between them

69
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,473
is a fluid experience.

70
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:56,875
And as you learn the basics of assembling a level,

71
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,216
you're learning the same skills that you'll

72
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,577
carry into making music or visual effects.

73
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:04,139
You're never waiting for something to render.

74
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,720
Everything happens on screen in real time,

75
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,362
so you can learn as you go and play your creations

76
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:10,042
as you make them.

77
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:17,005
But unlike LittleBigPlanet, where everything still retained the handcrafted art style of that game,

78
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:21,986
the Dreams engine has been made to let a world of different art styles shine through.

79
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:27,487
Our art director, Kareem Mattouni, whose background is in production design and oil painting,

80
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:32,009
has helped to ensure that Dreams is a place where the looseness of impressionism

81
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:34,689
and the tightness of architecture can co-exist.

82
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,691
You can make something from scratch, collaborate with others,

83
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:43,453
and it's all shareable so that you can remix creations made by our amazing community.

84
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,934
And of course, you can just play or watch the content.

85
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:51,596
But to achieve this vision, our team has had to work together differently.

86
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,197
The ambition of the project has meant that we have jammed more,

87
00:04:55,698 --> 00:05:00,359
less as a full team, but in our molecules, as each discipline within the studio

88
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,801
has helped create the tools designed for them to use from the ground up.

89
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:10,326
The end result of this is that every single person at Media Molecule

90
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:13,108
has contributed an influence to the shape of dreams,

91
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,370
and they have passionately advocated for their areas

92
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,812
more than any other project that we have ever worked on.

93
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:25,076
That has tested our strengths, our weaknesses, and our structure.

94
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:27,478
But it has made us better,

95
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,301
and it is how we move closer to the vision day by day.

96
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:39,109
So vision, such a simple word, but achieving it is an eye-watering exercise.

97
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,211
Because it's not just the exciting work of coming up with forward-facing ideas,

98
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:46,872
and you can't half-deliver on a vision.

99
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:51,575
Achieving a vision is about choosing a flavour and sticking to it,

100
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,957
so it's just about as much of what you don't do.

101
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:01,919
You have to be prepared to have the required discussions and make choices to protect the core.

102
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,966
Big ideas need to be made tangible, they need to be measurable, you have to be thorough,

103
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:11,790
and you have to get into the grit of the idea. Refactor that code if you need to.

104
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:17,416
Hitting the vision really means crossing the T's and dotting the I's, no matter how tedious they are.

105
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:21,738
So now isn't the time for the juicy development stories.

106
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,279
But along the way, we have got very excited.

107
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,599
We have argued.

108
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,539
We have debated.

109
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:30,780
We have made spreadsheets like you just would never believe.

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,720
We have killed darlings.

111
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,461
We have resurrected lost loves.

112
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:38,982
And we have created an absolutely insane bug database.

113
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:43,002
But together, we have solved thousands upon thousands

114
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:44,083
of creative problems.

115
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:46,043
And that's games development.

116
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,423
And let's not pretend.

117
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:48,723
That is why we love it.

118
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:54,198
And so now here we are, nearly ready to launch early access

119
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:56,440
and give our community the tools and tutorials

120
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,382
to create what excites them.

121
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:01,985
The game they want, the music they want,

122
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:03,627
the memes they want.

123
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:06,610
And so to prepare ourselves earlier this year,

124
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,913
we took about 20,000 self-identified creators

125
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,135
and gave them dreams for six weeks.

126
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,157
And this is what they made.

127
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:19,359
When the beta went live, we watched as people started playing,

128
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,321
and we were biting our nails as those first creations were published.

129
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:24,722
And it was amazing.

130
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:26,503
Not the first creations.

131
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:29,864
The first creations were people using the Sculpt tool to write out,

132
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:32,505
thank you, Media Molecule, which was very sweet.

133
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:35,827
But the creations started coming quickly,

134
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,248
and having gone into the beta just hoping some people would make something,

135
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:40,129
like just anything,

136
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,190
suddenly there were creations that we might have hoped to have seen

137
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,431
after six weeks just a couple of days in.

138
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:49,006
And our new game developers continue to surprise us,

139
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,448
though we should have seen this one coming.

140
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:52,689
They copied us.

141
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,190
And I don't mean copying actual games,

142
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,011
although they did that.

143
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:58,052
They copied our behaviors.

144
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,875
They made teases and wrote disclaimers.

145
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:03,256
They made version notes, set release dates,

146
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:04,757
and outsourced when necessary.

147
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,339
And they didn't just make games.

148
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,362
They made music players, visual novels, secret dance clubs,

149
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,943
interactive museums, haunted houses,

150
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:16,185
all of the things that give us pause

151
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,186
when someone sees dreams and asks us,

152
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:19,907
so is this a game?

153
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,470
Seeing people use dreams in so many ways

154
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,111
with the features that took us all that time and iteration,

155
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:29,353
pushing the boundaries of what we thought

156
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:32,114
was possible with them, that was amazing.

157
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:35,336
Suddenly, the journey just didn't feel so long.

158
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,622
And there was something beyond what our players made.

159
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,124
It is who they are.

160
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:43,566
They're kind and they're helpful,

161
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:46,008
just like the community of progressive

162
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:48,850
and supportive sharers that we see here at GDC.

163
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,993
When we looked at the top words people used

164
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,454
when they spoke to other players,

165
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:57,638
those top three were great, thanks, and love.

166
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,460
We even looked for profanity

167
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,083
and found that it was used to emphasize encouragement,

168
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:04,564
not to belittle players.

169
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,937
That kindness and support impacted us as well.

170
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:13,642
And it gave us the confidence in what we had made

171
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:17,046
and really gave us the courage to transition

172
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:18,368
to the next step for Dreams.

173
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,732
That next step of early access and our stated hope for that

174
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:25,934
is to learn more about our own game, how people use it,

175
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,915
where we can improve upon our systems,

176
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,177
what to prioritize in that always evolving list of ideas

177
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:31,797
from the team.

178
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,759
But we're hoping that it shows us something more,

179
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,242
a new genre, new voices, new directions,

180
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:41,764
and a new phase for Media Molecule,

181
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:45,386
the next step in that vision of self-expression

182
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:46,366
and experimentation.

183
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:53,371
So on a journey so filled with detours, yak shaving and complex problems,

184
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:57,193
it could have been very easy for us to compromise on the vision.

185
00:09:57,854 --> 00:09:59,895
And I am so glad we didn't.

186
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:04,939
Things like today, where we can show off a live musical performance,

187
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,762
our partnership with the experimental theatre company Punch Drunk,

188
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:12,707
and some of our other exciting collaborations that I can't talk about today.

189
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:17,489
Dreams can now give our team and the community the freedom to explore new spaces

190
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:22,270
and push our creative vision outside the boundaries of what is considered interactive entertainment

191
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,091
and still make games.

192
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:28,813
I couldn't be more proud of everybody at Media Molecule.

193
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:31,014
Grateful to Sony

194
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:35,095
and especially thankful for all of our cheerleaders throughout this journey.

195
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:35,775
It's been hard.

196
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:39,256
But what happens next is unknown.

197
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:42,379
And so it is for you.

198
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,922
So to everybody here on your own journey,

199
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:48,564
I wish you the very, very best on your quest

200
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:49,424
to deliver your vision.

201
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:52,307
And I wish you the very best people by your side.

202
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:55,649
This industry is at its best when we help each other along.

203
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:56,910
Thank you.
