1
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:06,071
So thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:08,292
I'm here to talk about God of War combat.

3
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:11,073
And this talk will go into some of the details

4
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:14,234
surrounding the design changes to our combat system

5
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:15,054
in the last God of War.

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,415
I'm not gonna get into a lot of technical details,

7
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,976
but there are a lot of other combat-related talks

8
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:21,377
that I'll reference later that go deeper

9
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:22,937
into some of the concepts I'm gonna mention here.

10
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:25,618
So first, a quick introduction.

11
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:26,979
My name is Jason.

12
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:29,760
I've been at Sony Santa Monica for over 14 years,

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,240
and I've worked on every God of War.

14
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:34,556
I was the lead gameplay designer on the last God of War,

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,979
and that meant I was involved with almost everything

16
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,081
gameplay related, from bosses to enemies

17
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:40,182
to Kratos and Atreus.

18
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:43,024
So over a third of my life has been spent

19
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:45,006
thinking about Kratos and what he can do.

20
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,068
I literally have dreams about it at this point.

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,550
It's really, really strange.

22
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,575
But with me was a team of very talented combat designers,

23
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,837
some of which are inside the studio right now,

24
00:00:57,298 --> 00:00:58,058
or inside this building.

25
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:01,662
And also old school God of War veterans,

26
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:03,063
Derek Daniels and Eric Williams,

27
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,044
who were combat designers in the first two God of Wars

28
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:06,384
back in 2005 and 2007.

29
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:09,145
So the development of this game was definitely a team effort.

30
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:11,506
So previously we made these games.

31
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:15,588
And the changes in each game was mainly about variety.

32
00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:17,869
You know, we wanted to make each one bigger, grander,

33
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,190
more weapons, more enemies, more bosses.

34
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:23,412
We'd make some small refinements to the system each time,

35
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:24,832
but nothing too major.

36
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:26,353
So after 10 years or so,

37
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:27,673
it was exciting to try to do something new.

38
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,298
So what now?

39
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:31,139
We're going back to the drawing board.

40
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,641
This one would be about reinvention.

41
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,543
We wanted a new combat system that felt new and fresh.

42
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:39,385
This game was still called God of War though,

43
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:41,266
so we would try to retain what our team

44
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:43,248
and our fans loved about the game.

45
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,030
So we'll talk about the path in this talk

46
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,731
of how we did this.

47
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:49,292
First, the vision.

48
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,935
What do we want to retain from the previous God of War games

49
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:55,016
and what were we going to reinvent?

50
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:57,018
So we start with the vision.

51
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,215
And our director, Corey, gave us multiple pages of vision

52
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:01,955
in the form of a book.

53
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:04,096
And this was given to the entire team

54
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:05,536
and it detailed the major pillars

55
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:06,316
and direction of the game.

56
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,757
All studio departments would read this book

57
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:10,537
as an initial guiding point of figuring out what to do.

58
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:13,378
So it had a lot of details of narrative, art, and levels,

59
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:14,358
or whatever, who cares about that.

60
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:17,338
I cared about combat, as a gate lead gameplay designer.

61
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:18,959
So I jumped right to that section.

62
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:22,899
So what I found was the desire for a complete overhaul.

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,500
The camera would be close, like a third person camera,

64
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,460
or a third person shooter.

65
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,238
The game would have strafe controls like Last of Us

66
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:31,320
in a melee-focused game.

67
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:34,484
The Chaos Blades, the most iconic thing about Kratos,

68
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:36,106
were going to be replaced with the basic axe.

69
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:38,930
UI, like combo counters, were gone.

70
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,694
We were taking out circle grabs in mini-games.

71
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,118
And a little kid would follow you

72
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:45,219
through this entire journey.

73
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:49,163
So, yeah, the initial response to this was,

74
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:50,604
well, how are we gonna do any of that?

75
00:02:50,724 --> 00:02:52,824
I mean, this is the way the game looked like before.

76
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:54,425
That's the way most action games look like,

77
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:55,465
at least melee action games.

78
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:57,966
And the blades, that was such an iconic weapon,

79
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:58,946
like, how could we lose those?

80
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,047
But we did a few early tests,

81
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,127
and this is what it looked like.

82
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:06,029
So we put in the camera, we gave him an ax,

83
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:07,509
put in a bunch of shirtless dudes.

84
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,480
and we used our existing tech to get things in the game.

85
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,721
And the results confirmed every bias

86
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,122
that we could have dreamed of.

87
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:15,703
It was terrible.

88
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:17,644
Like it was really hard to see anything,

89
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,045
like look at that, you're trying to hit this guy,

90
00:03:19,185 --> 00:03:20,165
floating guy for no reason.

91
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:23,808
Just, this was not inspiring any kind of confidence.

92
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:26,990
So the next question on everyone's mind was why?

93
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,550
Like why were we doing any of this?

94
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,532
It felt like we were removing God of War combat

95
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:32,273
from God of War.

96
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,674
Everything we had been building up at this point

97
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:36,816
would be thrown away, replaced with a game

98
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:38,276
that could potentially feel nothing like it.

99
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:39,666
So what did we do?

100
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:42,448
We started zooming the camera out and we played it again.

101
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:45,430
So here's some footage of a zoomed out camera view

102
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,470
a little bit later in development.

103
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,792
And Kratos could attack all around him

104
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:49,832
like he used to be able to do.

105
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,074
The enemies were starting to appear behind Kratos

106
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:53,715
so we were starting to get feedback of,

107
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,556
well, let's remove the strafe controls.

108
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:56,576
Why do we have those in the game?

109
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:57,537
And of course they were asking that.

110
00:03:58,017 --> 00:04:00,779
With this viewpoint, no games control this way.

111
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:05,505
And while we were getting some positive feedback on this camera, it still wasn't zoomed out

112
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:05,905
far enough.

113
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:06,765
Like, people wanted more.

114
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,166
And I know what they wanted.

115
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:10,107
They wanted that familiar scent.

116
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:15,550
You know, as we started zooming the camera out, you started to see all your enemies making

117
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,871
the same type of combat decisions you were making in all the God of Wars.

118
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,010
So if we zoomed out again, it would bring us right back

119
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,890
to where we were comfortable.

120
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,372
And it was clear that's what a lot of people wanted us to do.

121
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:26,073
And to be honest, I kind of wanted to do this too.

122
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,634
I mean, we were just starting out here.

123
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:29,195
We knew within a year we wanted to put

124
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,316
a snippet of gameplay together.

125
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:31,396
How are we gonna get this done?

126
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:34,238
So that's when I decided to zoom the camera back in.

127
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:37,680
And honestly, this decision was gonna haunt me

128
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,400
for a long time.

129
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:40,502
I mean, here I was embracing the very thing

130
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,103
that seemed to be creating all our problems.

131
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,549
But I felt we were simply running away from the changes

132
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,230
as opposed to really breaking them down

133
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,851
and figuring them out.

134
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,693
I mean, I was kind of used to this in God of War,

135
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:51,234
you know, in the years I've worked there.

136
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:52,735
We had Pegasus in God of War II,

137
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,256
we had giant titans in God of War III,

138
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:56,438
we had multiplayer in God of War Ascension.

139
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,280
It was like every single time there's something impossible

140
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,301
that it feels like you cannot do.

141
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,702
And that's what this seemed like.

142
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:02,784
So this was our chance to tackle new problems,

143
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,965
so let's tackle them.

144
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:06,807
And that meant first accepting this vision goal.

145
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:08,889
The game would feel close and personal.

146
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:10,510
You are in there with Kratos now

147
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,871
and not just watching him from afar.

148
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,836
And as far as what we wanted the game to feel like,

149
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:16,639
let's take another look at that vision book

150
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:17,561
and maybe read it this time.

151
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:20,846
And once you ignore the knee-jerk reactions

152
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:21,948
to some of the details of the changes,

153
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,250
there were actually a few excerpts

154
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,552
that gave us some clues of what to do.

155
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,757
Kratos was older, he was more deliberate in this game.

156
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:31,444
And by playing on people's real life expectations,

157
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:34,108
we'll create a more intuitive and inviting gameplay loop.

158
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:36,130
This quote was interesting because it was talking

159
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,073
about trying to add some intuitive gameplay mechanisms

160
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:41,056
to games like this or melee action games

161
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:42,218
that usually are kind of abstract.

162
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:44,180
It's hard to understand how to play those things.

163
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,964
So this made a sense as a path to changing the game.

164
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:50,423
Old God of War was partially about fleeing your blades

165
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,664
of chaos in every direction, hitting enemies everywhere.

166
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:54,485
You can make some deliberate choices,

167
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:55,325
but they weren't the focus.

168
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,826
Your goal was to hit as many enemies as you could at once

169
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,287
and use your crowd clearing abilities as much as possible.

170
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:04,709
So let's make controlling Kratos more precise and deliberate.

171
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,431
Let's not focus on only the issues with the camera

172
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,211
and strafe and all that.

173
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:11,072
Let's focus on design ideas on how to make this game

174
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:13,013
more deliberate and solve the camera along the way.

175
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:16,454
So when we think about that word deliberate,

176
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,481
First, awareness is the first thing you have to think about,

177
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:20,561
because with this close camera,

178
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,402
just being aware of the enemy takes effort,

179
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,223
being aware of the arena itself takes effort.

180
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:26,383
We would need to tune enemies accordingly

181
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:28,744
to allow player time to take in their surroundings.

182
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,825
So this meant slower-paced combat.

183
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:33,867
The blades in combat in the past were very, very fast,

184
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,487
and this time we would investigate

185
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:36,848
slowing things down a bit.

186
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:38,709
And this would seem to work well

187
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,269
with giving the player more time

188
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,210
to make deliberate decisions.

189
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,644
And lastly, your choice of target was much more important now.

190
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:48,528
The blades used to hit many targets at once, your axe would be focused on one at a time.

191
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,134
So to tackle those camera changes, we aimed to make a close camera that was a balance

192
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:55,695
between visibility and intuitive control.

193
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,320
It needed to be just close enough that strafe always made sense, but just far enough that

194
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,044
you could see immediate threats to your sides, prompting the desire to move and reposition.

195
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:08,164
So I drew some icons to kind of help us out here.

196
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,586
So this was the old God of War with the camera

197
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:13,449
zoomed out, Kratos in the middle, and everything in view.

198
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,612
And if the enemy were to appear outside of view,

199
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,253
we would actually usually disable that enemy.

200
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:19,234
He wouldn't be allowed to attack

201
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:21,036
because we were trying to put everything on screen at once.

202
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,777
This is partially why in Ascension,

203
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:24,799
Kratos started to become like a speck on screen

204
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,740
as we tried to get grander

205
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,921
with more and more enemies on screen.

206
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,253
Now we were trying to put the camera really close to Kratos,

207
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:32,735
but our first test had the camera this close,

208
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:35,016
so if an enemy was actually right out there hitting you,

209
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,517
and you wouldn't even see this enemy.

210
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:40,000
So we would want to zoom the camera out just a bit

211
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,141
so you can see him, but not enough that you could think

212
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,162
you could turn around and hit him.

213
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:47,245
And if that enemy started to go off screen,

214
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,207
well then we'd expect the obvious,

215
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:50,968
like you should just turn around and take a look at him.

216
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:54,310
So we implemented these changes, and then we got this.

217
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:56,900
And the result was positive.

218
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,480
People were now controlling Kratos

219
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,501
a little bit more intuitively.

220
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,002
They were at least looking around,

221
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:02,783
kind of similar to a third-person shooter,

222
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,524
and trying to find their enemies.

223
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,425
And it was kind of fun to actually whip around,

224
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:08,766
turn around, and keep track of what's going on.

225
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:10,667
And it also didn't play much worse

226
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:11,867
than our previous zoomed-out test,

227
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:12,648
because there was actually a lot

228
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:13,688
of other problems to figure out.

229
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,970
So we started paying more attention to the axe itself.

230
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,661
Because when you think about the blades of old,

231
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:23,564
they had a strong power in mythical fantasy.

232
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:25,465
They had chains, and they were on fire.

233
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,826
And the axe that was currently in his hand,

234
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,447
though, it felt like you could just go to Home Depot

235
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,107
and buy that thing.

236
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:31,728
Like it was simple.

237
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,149
It wasn't interesting.

238
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,510
No mythical touches like the awesome blades

239
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,371
that made them feel powerful.

240
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,700
So selling this power was a big part of Kratos' fantasy,

241
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,600
as a character fantasy.

242
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:46,562
For this weapon to have a chance to live up

243
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:48,563
to the mythos of the blades, it had to be powerful.

244
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:50,984
So let's start trying to add some interesting components

245
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:51,504
to the axe.

246
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,386
To emphasize the feeling of power

247
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:55,427
and deliberate decision making,

248
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,868
we decided to start simple and make the axe combos short.

249
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,690
The blades had a eight hit combo that took some time

250
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,911
to get to a powerful finisher.

251
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,632
A shorter combo would get there faster.

252
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,694
And that might make it feel a bit more punchy and powerful.

253
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:10,437
It would also work better with a tight camera,

254
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,099
since it would be a shorter period of time

255
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,881
locked into an extended combo sequence,

256
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:15,543
vulnerable to attacks from the sides.

257
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:18,887
Next, to give the axe a fantasy of its own,

258
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:20,108
we tried out a simple concept.

259
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:21,950
What if the axe stuck into enemies?

260
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:23,833
These axe sticks were a concept

261
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,615
that Corey and others liked very early,

262
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,136
as it gave the axe a distinct feel

263
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:28,738
from previous weapons in other games.

264
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,433
So in the new God of War, we would actually connect

265
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:32,933
and pause the axe inside the enemy

266
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:35,014
and play an animation of Kratos ripping it out.

267
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,215
And this was one of our early implementations.

268
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:38,856
Everything was full-synced animations

269
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:39,736
between Kratos and enemy.

270
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:42,818
And this looked and felt powerful.

271
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:45,379
And it also was slowing the pace of combat,

272
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,539
kind of like what we wanted to do,

273
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,800
making things feel more deliberate.

274
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:52,961
So this was a good starting point in making the axe feel unique and different within the game.

275
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:57,223
You would kind of get in there with this kind of combat system and assassinate quickly with short combos,

276
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,565
then you'd whip the camera around and find your next target.

277
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:01,506
Everything we had been talking about thus far.

278
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,809
But this wasn't enough to make the axe feel special, compared to the blades anyway.

279
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:09,111
There also wasn't anything really more intuitive added by this.

280
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:12,961
So while all this was going on, animators were hard at work

281
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:15,403
creating animation previews for various ideas for the axe.

282
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:17,485
These are just animations that they would use

283
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:19,867
to kind of prove out or potentially show us

284
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:20,708
what combat could look like.

285
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,750
So one day, our lead animator, Metti,

286
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,732
animated this idea by himself.

287
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:29,596
So you see he has everything that we've been talking about,

288
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:31,657
close camera, really short cameras,

289
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:33,079
or combos really short.

290
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,142
But then right here, he throws the axe away

291
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,142
to protect Atreus.

292
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:38,919
and slams his head in the wall.

293
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,880
So I remember when I first saw this,

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,281
that first of all, the axe there looked awesome,

295
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:45,223
but how would we ever do this?

296
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:47,604
Kratos throwing his iconic weapon away

297
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:48,925
that we're trying to make feel special,

298
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:50,646
what if he didn't pick it up?

299
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:51,786
What if he just left it there?

300
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:54,048
So we kind of dismissed this idea for a while,

301
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,729
until one man,

302
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,911
named Vincent Napoli, our lead systems designer,

303
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,313
made the critical suggestion to call back the axe

304
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,614
in command with a certain Norse god.

305
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:09,430
Prototypes were made partially with our amazing programmer,

306
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,971
George Mall, who's sitting right there

307
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:12,952
and not making me say this at all.

308
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,015
And it immediately resonated with the team.

309
00:11:17,796 --> 00:11:18,896
The concept was deliberate.

310
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:20,758
It encouraged the player to look around

311
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:21,999
and attack everything with precision.

312
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,980
With the ax gone, he could target someone else

313
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,660
with his bare hands.

314
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:27,362
The concept also worked with our new camera.

315
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:29,584
I mean, who would have known that a third person

316
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:31,865
shooter camera could use some third person shooting?

317
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:33,046
So.

318
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:35,559
Aiming with the reticle from this vantage point

319
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:36,640
was actually very intuitive,

320
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,981
and it was hitting that goal as well.

321
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,123
And lastly, it was mythical, and this one was a big deal,

322
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:43,044
because at first, the initial direction

323
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,845
of this entire game was very, very grounded,

324
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:46,507
so the axe was very simple.

325
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:48,708
But this gave the axe something special,

326
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:50,349
similar to how the blade's at its chains,

327
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,631
and it opened the door to more mythical additions

328
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:53,712
to the axe later on.

329
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,554
So at the end of that first year of development,

330
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:58,575
it was time to put together a playable snippet of the game,

331
00:11:58,715 --> 00:11:59,796
and we called that first playable.

332
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:03,279
The goal was to implement all the ideas with higher fidelity

333
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,921
and art necessary to showcase the vision.

334
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,662
So that included the closed camera,

335
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:09,123
showing the new perspective of the world,

336
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:11,204
shorter combos and slower pace,

337
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,305
the axe sticks showcasing power,

338
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:14,946
our brand new axe throw.

339
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:17,103
and a functioning Atreus.

340
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:20,285
I know we haven't been talking about him much thus far,

341
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,327
but he was a very difficult part of this game.

342
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:24,508
Like the entire time,

343
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:26,410
Corey was reminding everybody constantly

344
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,451
that we can't cut this guy,

345
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:28,712
even though everybody wanted to,

346
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:29,592
because it was so difficult.

347
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,514
So at this point in first play,

348
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,195
we kind of just wanted to get him in working,

349
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:34,536
and he wasn't an integral part

350
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:35,577
of the combat system just yet.

351
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:38,499
We were also trying to hit all the key words

352
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,300
we've been talking about.

353
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,261
Close and personal combat,

354
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,243
deliberate, mythical, and powerful.

355
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,451
So here's a snippet of that first playable.

356
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:48,112
And everything's looking good.

357
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:50,172
The art team was knocking it out of the park.

358
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:51,953
And before any fights begin,

359
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:53,853
it felt like you could appreciate exploring this world

360
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:54,494
from this viewpoint.

361
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:57,274
And the axe throw was in there and working.

362
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:58,535
You could recall at any time.

363
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:00,835
And then we had these very long axe sticks

364
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:02,496
when Kratos would actually land attacks.

365
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:04,276
That felt powerful.

366
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:08,897
And the combos are shorter,

367
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,398
so you just get rid of this guy real quick.

368
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:16,526
And we also showcased just some basic strategies

369
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,987
of what could happen, where if you threw your axe

370
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:19,527
to one guy, you kicked another guy off the edge.

371
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:21,748
So mission accomplished.

372
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:23,148
You know, we did everything in one year.

373
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,869
Like, just, everybody in game development knows

374
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,769
you get the hole in one, it just works perfectly.

375
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:30,770
It didn't.

376
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,110
Because it didn't play well.

377
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,031
So, here's some footage of somebody

378
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,531
actually trying to play that content.

379
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:40,752
And what you'll see is a lot of Kratos evasion

380
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:41,752
and a lot of backing up.

381
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:43,473
And you'll see why in just a little bit.

382
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,381
So he's trying his best to hit these enemies,

383
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,501
but not getting much luck.

384
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,122
He swings here, up, hit out of it, let's back up again.

385
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:53,243
Throws his axe one more time,

386
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:54,764
because it's the safest thing you could probably do.

387
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:56,765
Jump at this guy, nothing happened.

388
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:59,346
Okay, well let me try to mash into him a little bit.

389
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:01,467
Up, hit out of it again, let's back up.

390
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,769
And this was like the whole game right here.

391
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:05,990
Like everybody just backing up

392
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,950
and running away from everything.

393
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:11,132
And I think that this last part of that video

394
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:12,013
really is telling.

395
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,293
Because if you look at what happens

396
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,414
after Kratos swings twice,

397
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,332
he blocks, and he didn't have a shield at this point,

398
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:18,513
so he was blocking just like this.

399
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,334
But if you look at the enemies on the screen,

400
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:21,295
nobody's doing anything.

401
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:22,916
Like he's just blocking because he's afraid

402
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:23,957
that they might do something,

403
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,058
because he doesn't have any time to respond

404
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,119
to what's happening on the screen.

405
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,721
And this is very not God of War at all.

406
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,602
Like all this backing up, all this fear.

407
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:34,144
And at the end of this demo, we showed the player this.

408
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,006
Because this is supposed to hype you up

409
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,848
on some big class fight that you can get

410
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:39,408
at the end of this.

411
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:40,929
But after actually playing it,

412
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:42,931
the only real player response was that.

413
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,221
So, what was missing?

414
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,923
You know, we had a cool looking game there,

415
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:51,424
but it wasn't God of War yet.

416
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,305
And we weren't retaining that feel.

417
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:56,307
So now we're gonna talk about how we aim to do just that.

418
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:58,948
And the design decisions we made to ensure this game

419
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,550
continues to feel like God of War.

420
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,972
So first we look at that word deliberate

421
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:05,693
because maybe that was the problem all along.

422
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:07,794
After all, it seems like all these decisions

423
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,035
that were making the game deliberate

424
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,337
were setting us on a road that we didn't like.

425
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,730
But I believe the problem was more that the word deliberate

426
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,611
doesn't mean careful.

427
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,731
God of War was not about being careful.

428
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,931
You can make meaningful decisions

429
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:20,152
without having to worry about everything.

430
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:21,632
So what do we do now?

431
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,353
So we think about what God of War actually was,

432
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,934
and we deconstruct the best of the previous combat system

433
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:29,854
and ensure it's brought back into the new system.

434
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:32,635
We wanted players to feel similar to how they felt

435
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,535
in previous God of War games in this new perspective.

436
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:37,076
The tricky thing was trying to get this to work

437
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:38,436
without sacrificing the vision goals,

438
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:39,837
so we had to continue to remember those.

439
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:42,960
So when we think about the God of War feel,

440
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,782
we break it down into a few key components.

441
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:50,106
One versus many, playful combat, and power for all.

442
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,591
And I'm gonna break down each one

443
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:57,433
of those categories shortly.

444
00:15:58,394 --> 00:16:00,816
So for one versus many, God of War was always about this.

445
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,638
Kratos had this built into his chains,

446
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:05,260
so everyone could see Kratos take on hordes of enemies

447
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,042
and feel confident that he'd make it through alive.

448
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,306
We knew that we had to make crowd control accessible

449
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:12,027
if players were going to retain this confidence.

450
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:14,509
And the blades were great at this,

451
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:15,790
even while mashing square,

452
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,651
while Axe was currently terrible.

453
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,292
So while we were thinking about

454
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:22,033
what the blades used to be,

455
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:23,654
Corey told me of a thematic phrase

456
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,576
that was used to describe the blades a long time ago

457
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:26,656
in the original God of War.

458
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:28,377
And I like phrases like this

459
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,258
because it can help ground future decisions

460
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:31,599
that fail to match the theme.

461
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:36,102
So that phrase was...

462
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,846
Ballet of fire.

463
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,587
And I laughed when he told me this.

464
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,287
But when you think about it, the term

465
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,188
really describes the feel and look of those blade attacks.

466
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:49,649
The footwork, the elegance, a powerful mythical fire

467
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:50,930
shredding everything in sight.

468
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:54,671
Twirling around, hitting all the enemies in every direction.

469
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:57,032
But we couldn't take that approach with the axe

470
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:58,093
because of the camera angle.

471
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:00,194
We also wanted to give the axe a different feel.

472
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:03,115
So we wanted to create a thematic tagline that

473
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,275
would encapsulate this feel.

474
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:05,836
And this is what we came up with.

475
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:07,316
Plow the road.

476
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:11,367
And because we really wanted it to feel this way,

477
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:13,050
we wanted it to feel like you could just dive through

478
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,895
hordes of enemies and not have to worry about anything.

479
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:19,101
And we accomplished this partially by causing the enemies

480
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,224
you attack to hit other enemies behind that enemy.

481
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,670
So when Kratos attacks an enemy, that enemy plays a reaction,

482
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,290
and he bumps into enemies behind him,

483
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,631
bringing everybody backward.

484
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,511
And what ends up happening is that Kratos has this protective

485
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,372
zone in front of him the entire time he's mashing that button.

486
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:36,092
So simply mashing R1 feels a little bit safer and more

487
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,493
powerful in the simple groups of enemies.

488
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:39,993
Before we added this, the enemies behind the attacked

489
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:42,373
enemy would either slide around and attack the player

490
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,334
or disrupt the flow or slide off camera.

491
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,394
This would encourage players to poke attacks and never

492
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,055
complete combos like we saw in the first playable.

493
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,266
So we wanted him to just shred through enemies.

494
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,547
The player should not be afraid to track into the group

495
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,227
because that's what Kratos was all about.

496
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,707
The axe would do it through sheer power

497
00:17:58,747 --> 00:17:59,748
as he plows the road ahead.

498
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:02,748
It also made crowd control a little bit more deliberate.

499
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:05,309
You couldn't twirl around and hit everyone everywhere,

500
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:06,909
but you could face a direction

501
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,209
and drag a crowd of enemies forward.

502
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:11,350
This was also a step in alleviating some of the cameras,

503
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,170
or some of the issues with the close camera,

504
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,811
since Kratos could charge into a crowd

505
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:17,311
and keep them in front of him with each attack.

506
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:20,147
And you probably noticed while looking at that

507
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,450
that we sped up those axe attacks, or axe sticks,

508
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,073
because those axe sticks were like the bane of my existence

509
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:27,354
for a very, very long time.

510
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:28,956
It's like they were slowing everything down,

511
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:30,057
making it very hard to fight.

512
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:32,599
Everybody liked the power and the feel of those things,

513
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,861
so we tried to actually do a dynamic solution

514
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,403
where the axe would embed temporarily,

515
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,506
but it wouldn't stop Kratos from actually moving

516
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:40,687
or rotating or doing anything.

517
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,068
Made the game feel a lot better.

518
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,884
And instead of slowing Kratos down

519
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,265
with those slow axes that we had,

520
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,627
let's just slow the enemies down using something else,

521
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:49,308
frost.

522
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,530
And similar to the blades and fire,

523
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,571
the axe having frost and ice was mythical.

524
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:55,933
It would add intuitive effects.

525
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:58,556
Enemies struck by cold would be slowed or frozen,

526
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,297
and you could easily understand how that might help you

527
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:01,838
in crowd control, slowing the enemies down.

528
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,441
And finally, it gave context to a lot of special

529
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:07,023
area of effect attacks that Kratos could do

530
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:09,085
to attack multiple enemies at once

531
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,826
to help that once versus many concept.

532
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,180
So all this was nice additions to help that one versus many,

533
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,523
but it also helped our next part of God of War feel,

534
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,164
which is playful combat.

535
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:22,546
And what I mean by play here is that it should be fun

536
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:25,829
moving Kratos around, linking various moves together,

537
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:28,631
or having fun knocking around the enemy cast.

538
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:31,212
All of this should be enjoyable before even worrying

539
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:35,035
about the enemy designs or specific obstacles you will face.

540
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:37,777
So let's start with why this is important

541
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:38,538
with the player's move set.

542
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:43,619
There's a lot of chaos in any game with lots of enemies on screen, which we knew we wanted.

543
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:47,042
And players needed to be able to react quickly to what they see.

544
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,945
If they start an action, they should be able to change their mind instantly.

545
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:57,250
And to help explain the importance of this, I'd like to reference an Apple design talk

546
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,052
called Designing Fluid Interfaces.

547
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,351
This talk discussed some of the philosophies

548
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:03,772
on making their iPhone UI feel fluid and good to the user,

549
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,892
and there's some great parallels to gameplay design.

550
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,953
They use this example that if somebody started walking

551
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:10,474
across the room and wanted to change their mind

552
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:12,114
and turn the other way, they don't have to wait

553
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:13,795
until they get to the end of the room to make that decision,

554
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,195
because this is reality, this is what people do all the time.

555
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:17,976
They start an action and they stop it whenever they want.

556
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:22,669
So when users are not capable of doing that in the user interface, it just feels bad,

557
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:24,271
not connected with their expectations.

558
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:27,713
So they designed everything in the iPhone UI to be interruptible.

559
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:31,216
They described it as making the UI feel like an extension of yourself.

560
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,598
And that's how we've always felt about Kratos.

561
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:35,659
God of War games are old.

562
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,220
If you think it, usually you can do it.

563
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,282
We allow canceling moves into other moves.

564
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:41,759
We prioritize defensive canceling,

565
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:43,340
since those are the typical actions

566
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,962
people want to do spontaneously.

567
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,484
In a car, you might be able to live with slow acceleration

568
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:50,127
in most scenarios, but you would like to stop instantly

569
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:50,928
to avoid accidents.

570
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:54,712
But in special scenarios, we do allow some offense

571
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:56,513
to cancel other offense if it's special enough.

572
00:20:57,194 --> 00:21:00,457
So here's a small example with our launch move.

573
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,440
So if you press R2, you do this launch,

574
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,721
and that's the move in its entirety.

575
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,802
But you can also cancel that at the end

576
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:09,704
of the recovery frame into block.

577
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:12,726
Or you can cancel it right after the hit frame into block,

578
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:17,349
or right before the hit flame, or just right away.

579
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,251
And we allow this canceling because simply pressing

580
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:21,972
the attack button shouldn't be a risky commitment

581
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:22,673
in a God of War game.

582
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:25,715
When you want to encourage, we want to encourage players

583
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:26,455
to play with their move set.

584
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:29,650
So let's look at how we applied this logic

585
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,930
to our new concept, the axe throw.

586
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,931
The axe throw has two primary commands,

587
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:35,712
L2 to pull aim, and triangle to recall the axe.

588
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:37,853
We wanted to ensure that these actions

589
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:39,894
had a God of War style canceling

590
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:40,854
to ensure that they felt right.

591
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:45,016
So we allow you to cancel the L2 throw, or the pull aim,

592
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:47,157
in scenarios where you're most likely to do it,

593
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:48,838
just after an action or after an attack.

594
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,859
This allows players to follow up most actions

595
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:51,619
with a quick axe throw.

596
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,240
We could have let you cancel the entire attack with that,

597
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,181
but then you might have a hard time doing combos,

598
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:57,641
hitting an enemy, and then following up with this.

599
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,139
The recall, though, was special.

600
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,300
We allow that to cancel any time.

601
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,920
So if you look at this, right in the middle of my kick,

602
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,521
I can just cancel that.

603
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:08,042
It looks a little weird, but we're OK with that

604
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:10,023
because the feel of recalling when you want

605
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:10,663
is more important.

606
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:13,284
You can even cancel that recall with an evade,

607
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:19,727
as shown here, because we've prioritized defense.

608
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:22,208
And when you combine everything together,

609
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:23,248
it could look like this.

610
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:26,235
This is kind of crazy chaotic,

611
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:27,756
just canceling everything all the time.

612
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:29,277
You could look at this and wonder

613
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:31,179
why you would even allow this in the game.

614
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:34,662
But it also enables things like this,

615
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:36,403
controlled deliberate canceling.

616
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:38,805
If you sidestep cancel mid-combo,

617
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,047
we allow that combo to continue if you keep pressing attack,

618
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:41,948
rewarding that decision.

619
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:44,256
And that allows precision and evasion

620
00:22:44,336 --> 00:22:45,397
while progressing your combo.

621
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,058
So we don't mind the chaotic results

622
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,660
because most players won't make the game look that bad.

623
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,241
But they will feel the difference

624
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:53,141
if they weren't allowed to play

625
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:54,142
with the move set in this way,

626
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:55,763
which is why we wish to retain that

627
00:22:55,823 --> 00:22:56,683
from the God of War of old.

628
00:22:58,484 --> 00:23:00,345
Next, the other part of playful combat

629
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:01,206
is playing with your enemies.

630
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:05,228
And we used to do this with the two core attack buttons

631
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:05,949
in every God of War.

632
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:07,409
So let's deconstruct their purpose.

633
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,611
Before they were square and triangle,

634
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:10,871
but now they were R1 and R2

635
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,292
because of the third person camera.

636
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,650
Most people would probably reference those as light and heavy attacks.

637
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:17,952
And the light attacks were pretty straightforward.

638
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:20,794
They gave us way to the most basic of offense

639
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:23,035
to allow the player to do simple combinations of attacks.

640
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,238
But why would the player ever press that heavy button?

641
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,539
What's the player choice when they're pressing that button?

642
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,861
Damage sounds like a good start.

643
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:33,542
It's called heavy attack after all.

644
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,288
But in playtests, it sometimes tends to be ambiguous.

645
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:38,929
We didn't have any damage numbers on the screen.

646
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:40,209
We didn't have any way to show

647
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,330
that it was doing that much damage.

648
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,711
So how much damage would it need to do to be worthy of use?

649
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,032
If it does too much,

650
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:47,712
then it competes with ever pressing the light button.

651
00:23:47,812 --> 00:23:49,193
And if you penalize me for pressing it,

652
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:50,253
well, that doesn't seem as fun.

653
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,995
You could give it a distinct ability such as breaking blocks.

654
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:55,875
That gives it a good reason to exist,

655
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:58,256
but only if you're actually fighting a character

656
00:23:58,276 --> 00:23:58,737
that blocks.

657
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,037
So we wanted people thinking about pressing this button

658
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,538
most of the time, not only in specific scenarios.

659
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:05,948
What about heavy reactions?

660
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:06,949
We had that in first playable.

661
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,511
Bigger reactions feel good in general.

662
00:24:10,712 --> 00:24:12,193
But if there's no difference strategically,

663
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,915
that nuance wears off over time.

664
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,737
And that's where we were at in our first playable demo.

665
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:18,919
The answer for God of War is that we actually

666
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:20,420
don't only call it this heavy button,

667
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,062
we call it the setup button,

668
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:24,023
because its purpose is to set up the enemies

669
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:25,144
for further attack.

670
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,987
We do this with a large enemy state change

671
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,408
that gives more options to the player

672
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:30,649
after hitting that character.

673
00:24:31,592 --> 00:24:33,872
Launching, for example, leads to an enemy air state

674
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:35,293
that encourages players to follow up

675
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:36,113
and attack them in midair.

676
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:38,414
And launching is inherently playful,

677
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:40,274
because you want to see how long you can keep them

678
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,435
in the air, like playing paddle ball.

679
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,495
And the significance of this is that enemies

680
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:45,896
are designed to be punching bags

681
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:47,296
that aren't meant to die right away.

682
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,137
I used to run around and say this in the studio

683
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,577
all the time, where it's like, the punching bag,

684
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:52,298
it feels terrible, and people would look at me

685
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:52,898
like I was nuts.

686
00:24:53,718 --> 00:24:55,399
And I didn't have this sweet GDC presentation

687
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:55,939
to make it clear.

688
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:59,733
Because what I meant by that is that in God of War,

689
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:01,114
players are supposed to play with their enemies.

690
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:02,315
They're not supposed to die that fast.

691
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,376
We want enemies changing state constantly

692
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,317
as you knock them around.

693
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:10,059
So let's go through some of the various hit reactions

694
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,900
in the new God of War to get more details

695
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,561
on how we did this.

696
00:25:13,181 --> 00:25:14,562
And I'm gonna split them up into two camps.

697
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:17,123
Normal reactions, which differ mostly

698
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:18,544
in translation and recovery time.

699
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:20,925
And setup reactions that are designed

700
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:22,446
to encourage some kind of player follow-up.

701
00:25:23,392 --> 00:25:24,953
And we actually had more reactions than just this,

702
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:27,996
but this suite was the core of what existed in the system,

703
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:30,017
and the game became more fun once we added these back.

704
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:32,700
So starting with the simplest, we have basic.

705
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,203
And all this is is just a reaction that's short enough

706
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:38,205
or long enough that you can continue your combo.

707
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:39,866
But if you look at that Draugr

708
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,087
and how long he kinda sits there,

709
00:25:41,147 --> 00:25:42,348
especially after this one attack right here,

710
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:43,970
that was actually good,

711
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,791
because it gave us plenty of time to look around

712
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,913
and not have to worry about the enemy, even after one hit.

713
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:52,664
Stagger is a more intense version of this reaction,

714
00:25:52,724 --> 00:25:55,005
which results from stronger attacks from the player,

715
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:55,705
like a sprint attack.

716
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:58,686
Longer recovery means even more time to make decisions.

717
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:02,268
And for our first setup reaction, we have launch.

718
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:03,648
And launch just feels good and powerful

719
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:04,729
for all the reasons that we said.

720
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:07,330
Took us a long time to put this back in the game,

721
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,971
because we were trying to make the game feel grounded.

722
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,191
But this reaction is just too fun.

723
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:12,892
It's fun to juggle, it's fun to follow up,

724
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:15,313
and it's immediately clear difference between R2 and R1.

725
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:21,114
Spin was a reaction we had in the past, but it had greater purpose than this new God of

726
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:21,354
War.

727
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:25,798
Because from this new camera angle, positioning an enemy's backside is intuitive and desirable.

728
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:29,961
This reaction allowed the player to expose an enemy's back without any positioning, and

729
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:32,563
lay into the enemy's back at will, making you feel powerful.

730
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,645
Trip was a quick way to get the enemy on the floor.

731
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:38,567
Tripped enemies would remain on the floor longer, giving you even more time to make

732
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:38,928
decisions.

733
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:41,937
In flyback, there's a knockback reaction.

734
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,338
Usually flyback would happen at the end of a combo

735
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:46,960
because we kind of want to eject the enemy from Kratos

736
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,081
after completing that combo.

737
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:50,463
That kind of forces a choice on the player.

738
00:26:50,503 --> 00:26:52,084
Either I follow up and I chase him down,

739
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:53,265
or I fight somebody else.

740
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:57,188
It's a nice little pacing break within our combos.

741
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:59,470
And the enemy that gets knocked back,

742
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,430
it's other enemies as well,

743
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,751
which all slam into walls,

744
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:02,892
they all get ringed out,

745
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,733
and it's very God of War.

746
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:07,477
And with this new camera angle, we had an opportunity

747
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:08,837
to emphasize our wall reactions.

748
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:11,018
So any basic hit would cause most enemies

749
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:12,958
to slump against it for a long recovery time

750
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:13,699
before they can move again.

751
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,779
And that's a really long recovery time.

752
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:17,680
So it helps with that one versus many thing

753
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,060
where I can knock a bunch of guys into walls

754
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,701
and turn around and not worry about them for a while.

755
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:26,442
And we also had a wall bounce if enemy was knocked

756
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:27,842
against the wall with force, like that.

757
00:27:29,763 --> 00:27:32,384
So similar to Kratos' move sets, reactions themselves

758
00:27:32,404 --> 00:27:33,904
are designed to be canceled into each other.

759
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:36,900
This encourages constant offense on the player,

760
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,482
since most enemies will always respond

761
00:27:38,502 --> 00:27:39,543
to a very God of War trait.

762
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,527
And tougher enemies will typically have limited reactions

763
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:43,428
and be less playful.

764
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:46,151
So an example of a reaction like that is Twitch.

765
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:50,829
And this basically is a reaction that the enemy recovers from so fast that they're allowed

766
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:51,569
to attack again.

767
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:55,591
This makes the player feel a little bit weaker, so we've got to use this reaction carefully.

768
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:59,692
We had one playtest where we went overboard on these reactions, because later enemies

769
00:27:59,752 --> 00:28:03,114
had almost all their reactions being demoted into Twitch to make them feel harder.

770
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:07,095
And every day I would see this one player kind of get his soul crushed more and more

771
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:09,756
as he was trying to play the game, and the game was getting harder and harder, and nothing

772
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:10,196
was working.

773
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,593
and his soul was just like dying right in front of me.

774
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,614
And on his last survey,

775
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:18,335
which is a basic question about the game,

776
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,536
he responded with this.

777
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:24,098
Because, exactly what you want to hear in a playtest.

778
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:27,480
So, this did give us some good information

779
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,441
on what difficulty feels good.

780
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:31,402
And we learned from this

781
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:32,823
when we tuned our harder difficulties,

782
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:34,243
because anybody who's played our harder difficulties

783
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:36,084
probably knows we actually do use Twitch

784
00:28:36,124 --> 00:28:37,525
for a lot of the base R1 attacks.

785
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:39,346
We want to encourage people to kind of move around

786
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,767
and use their deliberate abilities like setups.

787
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:44,158
But what we learn is that we don't demote

788
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:46,119
the setup reactions, so launches still work,

789
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:48,300
tripping still works, all that stuff still works,

790
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,081
you just have to think a little bit more when you do it.

791
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:53,602
So let's look again at the axe throw concept

792
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,323
and see how that contributed to playing

793
00:28:55,343 --> 00:28:56,424
with your enemies in God of War.

794
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:00,685
So to throw your axe, you hold L2,

795
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,167
and from that you can press R1 for a light throw.

796
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:06,848
Light throws just cause normal reactions most of the time,

797
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:08,269
nothing too exciting there.

798
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:10,950
But precision hits will cause those setup reactions.

799
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,667
So you could hit him in the head and spin him around,

800
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:15,527
giving instant access to his back,

801
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,168
or you could hit him in his legs and trip him,

802
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,868
giving that extra recovery time to make decisions.

803
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:20,789
So just with that move alone,

804
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:22,109
you have two options that you can make

805
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:24,130
a follow-up decision up right afterwards.

806
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,591
Or I could have pressed R2 and do my heavy attack.

807
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:30,311
That's slower to throw, but with no precision advantages.

808
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:32,952
But like a true setup button,

809
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,712
landing this attack will change

810
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:36,053
the enemy's state into frozen.

811
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:38,253
So when he's in a frozen state,

812
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:39,554
he's just there a sitting duck,

813
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:40,474
you can just go and wail on him.

814
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:42,693
Or you could kick this frozen enemy.

815
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,253
And you can kick the enemy into other enemies,

816
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,374
slowing them or knocking them to walls

817
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:48,134
and make them shatter.

818
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:51,415
And it helped us a lot because this was like a technique

819
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:52,595
that a lot of people wouldn't know at first,

820
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:53,895
so they'd feel good when they learned about it.

821
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:55,556
And it would give you a lot more time

822
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:56,216
to handle your enemies,

823
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:57,676
because you could apply frost to everyone

824
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:58,576
right from the start of the game.

825
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:01,477
So through this mix of R1 and R2 play,

826
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,037
you can have a lot of fun just playing

827
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:04,618
with enemy reactions with the axe throw alone.

828
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,418
Making the axe throw participate in playful combat

829
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,699
is what formally cemented it in the God of War play style.

830
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,990
And all this playful combat leads to improvisation.

831
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,912
And all games have improvisation to some level,

832
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:17,913
but for God of War, it was important to make sure

833
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:19,734
that it was a combination of playing with your moveset

834
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:20,854
and playing with your enemies.

835
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:22,315
If you allow the player to do that,

836
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:24,317
the players can create non-can combos

837
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:25,217
that they can improvise.

838
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:27,278
So if you have all that,

839
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:28,399
you can get the game to look like this,

840
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,960
a very deliberate long combo

841
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,481
that brings them all the way across the level,

842
00:30:32,902 --> 00:30:33,742
kicking them into this wall.

843
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,412
And all these enemies are tuned right now to not even attack or do anything.

844
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:42,155
Because this was like a barometer check that we always used to test the fun factor of the game.

845
00:30:42,636 --> 00:30:44,818
Is it fun just to go in this test level and knock guys around?

846
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:46,940
I'd be in meetings doing this while talking to people.

847
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,262
If I'm not enjoying myself, there's probably a problem.

848
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:54,766
Because if you couldn't do this, then it probably meant that our tools just weren't playful enough.

849
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:56,908
Or at least not as playful as the old God of War games.

850
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,673
So the last thing we wanted to make sure we retained

851
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:04,814
was that feeling of power.

852
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:07,256
Because obviously we dedicate a lot of time

853
00:31:07,596 --> 00:31:09,798
making sure the player feels powerful,

854
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:12,461
but what you really want is everyone to feel powerful,

855
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,522
not just the gaming elite.

856
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:15,623
So in the past God of War games,

857
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:17,285
we always had some kind of God mode meter,

858
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,026
and that meter gets full,

859
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,088
and the player gets access to some powerful attacks.

860
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:23,871
Often this meter is fillable by a resource,

861
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:25,372
or combos, or combat skill,

862
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:27,674
but it's also driven by lack of skill.

863
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:29,956
Because it filled up when the player got attacked.

864
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:33,913
So even if you're getting your ass kicked,

865
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,054
you're often given the means to come back and win.

866
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:39,716
And this allowed everyone to feel powerful,

867
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,297
no matter how well they were doing at the game.

868
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:45,219
So like the axe and the blades, it needed a thematic phrase.

869
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,821
And we came up with this, monster out of the box.

870
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,022
Because, and once again, we had a theme

871
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,044
that we could look back on to ensure our future decisions

872
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:54,124
were in the right direction.

873
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,085
And the theme here was that Kratos was letting

874
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,046
that monster out that we all knew that he had

875
00:31:58,086 --> 00:31:59,087
from previous God of War games,

876
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:00,648
because this was a sequel, it was a continuation.

877
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:02,827
And this is the moment where you'd feel the most

878
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:03,568
like you used to be.

879
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,729
And this rage meter, like previous God of War titles,

880
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:09,070
would fill up as the player made mistakes and took damage,

881
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,811
and also fill up a bit during attacks.

882
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:12,472
So this made it more likely to be available

883
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:13,272
when players needed it,

884
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:15,833
and ensured you get to see Kratos at his most powerful,

885
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:16,954
that all players could do that.

886
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:20,155
And Kratos uses bare hands in this mode,

887
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:21,996
and at first we followed down the same kind of

888
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:23,817
deliberate path as everything else.

889
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:27,198
But we realized quickly that players didn't want to feel

890
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:28,539
deliberate while playing this.

891
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:31,040
They just wanted that old school feeling of God of War.

892
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:35,754
They just wanted to feel powerful and making it less deliberate actually succeeded at that.

893
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:41,019
Another important thing about Rage Mode is that it provided a get-out-of-jail-free card

894
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:41,900
when the player is in trouble.

895
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:46,965
Out of all our cancelling rules, Rage Mode is the most flexible and can be used out of

896
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,106
most reactions in negative states for care of Kratos.

897
00:32:49,827 --> 00:32:52,610
We wanted this to be reliable so when the player is in the worst states they can feel

898
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,712
that turn the tide when they activate Rage Mode.

899
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,201
So here's a player using rage mode,

900
00:32:57,221 --> 00:33:00,061
and he's gonna usually actually just use one button,

901
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:01,762
but you can see the effect it has on the enemies,

902
00:33:02,002 --> 00:33:03,822
much greater than anything else that you could do normally.

903
00:33:04,822 --> 00:33:06,163
So when players would break out this mode,

904
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:07,223
they would get that sense of like,

905
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,303
ah yeah, this is awesome,

906
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:09,183
and they'd have to go back

907
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:10,484
and kind of be more deliberate feeling,

908
00:33:10,504 --> 00:33:11,924
but then they would go back to that when they needed it.

909
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:14,004
It was a nice pacing flow for the combat of the game.

910
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:17,505
So we had deconstructed that God of War feeling

911
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:18,865
that we wanted to bring out of players

912
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:20,526
by bringing some key things back.

913
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:23,466
Simple effective crowd control.

914
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:25,550
for one versus many fighting,

915
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,511
a playful combat system that encourages improvising

916
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:30,792
with create a smooth set and an enemy reaction set

917
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,412
that's built around knocking enemies around

918
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:33,092
like a punching bag,

919
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:35,133
and a simple no-brainer method

920
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:36,994
of fulfilling the power fantasy for everyone.

921
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:41,996
But we still had a few elements to think about.

922
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:44,597
And that's when we talked about reinventing

923
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:45,317
the gameplay loop.

924
00:33:45,597 --> 00:33:47,558
Because even when we added all of these things,

925
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:49,219
the kind of meta of the game,

926
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,739
or what you were thinking about moment to moment,

927
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:51,660
was actually very similar.

928
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:54,259
So there are a few additions we needed to make

929
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,379
to fully reinvent the game.

930
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:57,319
So we already had a head start here.

931
00:33:57,859 --> 00:33:59,720
I mean, just changing the camera view was causing us

932
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,920
to rethink how players handle Kratos and assess threats.

933
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,081
But if you think combat-wise, again,

934
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:06,841
the moment-to-moment was pretty similar.

935
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:09,262
So there's other things we wanted to investigate.

936
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:11,082
So while we're thinking about all the ways

937
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:12,642
we can make the combat system more deliberate,

938
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:14,683
naturally we thought about a stamina system.

939
00:34:15,463 --> 00:34:19,103
This is a regenerating meter that you need to attack

940
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,444
and defend, and if you run out of it,

941
00:34:20,504 --> 00:34:22,064
you get tired and you can't do anything for a while.

942
00:34:23,651 --> 00:34:24,952
At first, it seemed to hit all our goals.

943
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:26,232
It was deliberate, measured.

944
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:27,513
It would certainly make you think

945
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:28,573
about the attacks that you do.

946
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:31,074
But we scrapped that one really early,

947
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:32,555
and because we felt immediately

948
00:34:32,575 --> 00:34:33,775
that it wouldn't feel like God of War.

949
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:35,776
And since we deconstructed God of War,

950
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:36,537
we know what that means.

951
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:38,257
We want Kratos to be overly offensive.

952
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:42,659
We want your options to be available as often as possible.

953
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:44,120
Defense should always be available.

954
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,881
We didn't want players to have to stop and think too much

955
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:48,342
before reacting to what was on screen.

956
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,123
So in short, it just reduced our playful combat,

957
00:34:51,143 --> 00:34:51,723
so we scrapped it.

958
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:53,749
That's not to say stamina's bad,

959
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:55,189
a lot of games use stamina in great ways,

960
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:57,090
it just didn't match that God of War feel

961
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,770
that we were looking for.

962
00:34:59,491 --> 00:35:00,531
Now, there's another trope, though,

963
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:01,972
that a lot of games have that would fit well

964
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:03,252
with our direction, and this is why.

965
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:05,033
As we started playtesting the game,

966
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:06,213
we started to notice this behavior.

967
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:09,894
So Kratos was kind of going past enemies,

968
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,155
knocking them around, and you would turn around

969
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,075
and get a look at everybody,

970
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,376
and kind of have no idea who you last hit,

971
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:17,157
no idea how much damage you might apply to anyone,

972
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:19,858
if only there was some way to reveal that information.

973
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:22,225
And of course there was.

974
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:23,587
Life bars.

975
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:25,428
This was dead simple.

976
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:28,531
It added target prioritization in a way that we never had.

977
00:35:28,651 --> 00:35:29,852
Kill the enemy with the lowest health.

978
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:31,894
We had talked about life bars before,

979
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:32,935
but it was always rejected

980
00:35:32,955 --> 00:35:34,717
because we didn't want players really thinking about this.

981
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,098
We liked them just going in there

982
00:35:36,138 --> 00:35:38,240
and having a playful combat and knocking enemies around.

983
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,902
We didn't want them to overthink

984
00:35:40,082 --> 00:35:41,403
about what damage they were applying.

985
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,573
But this addition favored our deliberate camera control

986
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:45,433
for the reasons I gave.

987
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:47,335
You could stop looking at an enemy,

988
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:49,336
look at somewhere else, and then turn back

989
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,278
and understand exactly where you left off.

990
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:55,761
And it favored the direct attack style of the axe

991
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,102
because it allowed you to pinpoint an enemy

992
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,023
and kind of drill them down with health

993
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:00,264
if that's what you wanted to do.

994
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,626
These were added late in the project

995
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:03,927
in the last year of development,

996
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:06,289
but it was something that felt fit like a glove

997
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:08,350
with the new vision, and it opened the window

998
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,031
to the next concept we wanted to reinvent,

999
00:36:10,912 --> 00:36:11,773
which is grabbing enemies.

1000
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,574
because grabbing enemies was a huge part of God of War.

1001
00:36:14,594 --> 00:36:16,615
I remember when I first arrived in the studio,

1002
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:18,596
that was the thing that made the difference for me

1003
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,657
first off, because I was actually grabbing guys.

1004
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:22,038
I didn't do that in the other games I was playing.

1005
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:24,679
So from the get-go, we knew we wanted

1006
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,860
to have these signature kills again.

1007
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,020
The question was how.

1008
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,261
Previous games, you would damage an enemy

1009
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:31,222
until they were low health,

1010
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:33,503
and then a circle would pop over their head

1011
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:34,143
and you would grab them.

1012
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:37,204
We had been doing that low health thing for so long,

1013
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:38,285
felt like we needed to change that.

1014
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:40,915
So we wanted to retain the feeling of dominating

1015
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:43,017
your enemy like that, but reinvent the gameplay loop

1016
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:43,517
for doing it.

1017
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:46,219
So with that initial line in the sand,

1018
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,521
and especially the original line in the sand

1019
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:49,862
with no circles over enemies' heads,

1020
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:52,624
we had this idea pretty early in the project.

1021
00:36:53,624 --> 00:36:54,725
Use meters to grab enemies.

1022
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,867
So instead of that rage mode I was talking about,

1023
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,328
what if we just filled up a meter,

1024
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,129
and every time that was full, you could grab an enemy?

1025
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:03,691
This was actually featured in our 2016 E3 demo

1026
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:05,392
when everybody thought he was gonna pull out his blades

1027
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,192
with Spartan Rage.

1028
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:09,132
He instead used his Rage mode to go grab this troll.

1029
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:14,633
At first it seemed to hit all the new vision goals.

1030
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:16,994
Reduction of UI over enemies' heads,

1031
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,434
deliberate usage of grab whenever you wanted

1032
00:37:19,494 --> 00:37:20,254
as long as you had meter,

1033
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:22,635
and a heavy dose of improvisation

1034
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:24,955
because part of the reasons why this was an interesting idea

1035
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:26,795
was that players could now start the fight

1036
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:27,756
with a grab if they wanted to.

1037
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:28,556
They didn't have to attack anyone,

1038
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:29,556
they didn't have to weaken anybody.

1039
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:33,878
But this failed miserably because of the same problem

1040
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,981
that we've had in every God of War with this meteor.

1041
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,565
Everyone saves it, or they forget about it

1042
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:39,286
until they're in trouble.

1043
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,030
This meant long fights where enemies or players

1044
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,011
wouldn't grab anyone.

1045
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:45,195
They kill 20 enemies, maybe grab one, if that.

1046
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:50,018
So that sense of Kratos dominating his enemies repeatedly throughout fights just wasn't happening

1047
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:51,580
and it felt like a big part of the game was missing.

1048
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,744
Now note, the rage mode that I was talking about before does have this feeling where

1049
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:59,368
it's like you could save it and all that, but it was this burst of power that you actually

1050
00:37:59,388 --> 00:38:01,210
didn't want to happen all the time, so that was great.

1051
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:04,093
But for this, this was like a core to Kratos' character.

1052
00:38:04,113 --> 00:38:05,494
We wanted this to happen all the time.

1053
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:07,739
So what about a stun system?

1054
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,801
Stun system had been brought up before.

1055
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,762
God of War Ascension actually had a stun system,

1056
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,484
if people actually remember that.

1057
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:16,226
An enemy's stun meter would gradually fill

1058
00:38:16,246 --> 00:38:17,026
when an enemy's attacked,

1059
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:18,827
and it would start to decrease when you stop attacking,

1060
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:20,389
so the player is encouraged to continue

1061
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:21,830
attacking as much as possible.

1062
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:25,673
When the meter's full, the enemy would get stunned,

1063
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:26,913
and then the enemy could be grabbed.

1064
00:38:27,654 --> 00:38:29,275
But the meter in Ascension was invisible.

1065
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:29,956
You couldn't see it.

1066
00:38:30,836 --> 00:38:32,097
And it made it difficult to balance

1067
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:33,278
and hard for players to understand.

1068
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,640
But remember those life bars that we added

1069
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,361
late in the project.

1070
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,782
So as we were implementing those life bars,

1071
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:40,722
we also rechanged the entire grab system

1072
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:42,503
within a few days right before a play test.

1073
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:44,064
Production loved us, they couldn't get enough.

1074
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:48,146
But we believed in this because we thought

1075
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,246
that this would actually be the thing

1076
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:50,647
that now would give you a deliberate way

1077
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:51,767
to choose to grab enemies.

1078
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:54,708
So when we put it in, the results were huge.

1079
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:57,189
Immediately players were grabbing enemies in fights

1080
00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:58,770
and Kratos was starting to look like Kratos again.

1081
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,311
The gameplay loop was familiar.

1082
00:39:01,111 --> 00:39:02,231
Attack enemy, grab enemy.

1083
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,860
But the difference was now that the player could

1084
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,882
deliberately choose strategies to stun enemies

1085
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:07,622
versus damage them.

1086
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:10,744
And we could now reward all those deliberate actions

1087
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:11,885
we've been talking about for so long,

1088
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:13,426
like hitting enemies in the back,

1089
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:15,307
slamming them into walls,

1090
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:17,168
bare hand attacks versus the axe,

1091
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:18,669
all of those would do more stun.

1092
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,671
So all those deliberate actions we were thinking about

1093
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:23,392
now had a direct global purpose

1094
00:39:23,412 --> 00:39:25,294
that resonated with Kratos' core fantasy.

1095
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:27,555
And once that dam broke,

1096
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:28,876
allowing all that design information,

1097
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,637
we began adding even more to it.

1098
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,317
First, the stun bar as mentioned,

1099
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:34,878
then the R3 button,

1100
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,680
because we couldn't put circles over guys' heads,

1101
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,080
but R3s under life bars.

1102
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:38,821
That was a go.

1103
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:42,503
And then fire and ice element damage as well,

1104
00:39:42,763 --> 00:39:43,304
and even more.

1105
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:43,984
And just like that,

1106
00:39:44,244 --> 00:39:46,706
we went from single damage system to a multi-damage,

1107
00:39:47,066 --> 00:39:49,088
giving players even more reason to change attacks

1108
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:50,188
depending on what type of damage

1109
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,389
they wanted to apply to the enemy.

1110
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,991
So the stun system and damage types

1111
00:39:54,031 --> 00:39:55,832
emphasize another old God of War concept,

1112
00:39:56,292 --> 00:39:57,413
which was the happy accident.

1113
00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:00,695
And happy accidents is a non-deliberate action

1114
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:01,716
that alters players' actions.

1115
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,891
An example is the parry system in most God of Wars.

1116
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:07,333
Parry and block are both on the same button, L1.

1117
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:09,015
If you press L1, you'll block,

1118
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:10,396
but if you time it correctly, you'll parry.

1119
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:12,037
So what ends up happening is that sometimes

1120
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:13,858
you'll just try to block but parry by accident

1121
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,059
because you just happened to time it right,

1122
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
and that was a happy accident,

1123
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:18,362
one that a player could take advantage of

1124
00:40:18,402 --> 00:40:19,443
and turn the tide of combat.

1125
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:21,645
It also reminds people that the parry exists

1126
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:23,186
if they forgot, making it more accessible.

1127
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:25,988
So these happy accidents lead to deliberate actions

1128
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,529
like finding a $20 bill on the ground

1129
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:29,010
and picking it up, not turning it

1130
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,211
into your local police station,

1131
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,013
and instead going into the store and buying something.

1132
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:35,233
So while performing basic concept combat,

1133
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:37,214
you would see the enemy's stun meters change

1134
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,915
regardless of what people were trying to do.

1135
00:40:38,975 --> 00:40:39,875
They'd be hitting in the back,

1136
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:41,356
knocking them to walls unintentionally,

1137
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:44,017
but in doing that actually adding stun to all the enemies.

1138
00:40:45,297 --> 00:40:46,878
So nearly stunned enemies would prompt players

1139
00:40:46,898 --> 00:40:48,478
to actually start strategizing towards stun

1140
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:49,579
if they weren't thinking about it before.

1141
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:52,060
And if they just accidentally stunned an enemy,

1142
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,680
well that's even better, just grab them, that's great.

1143
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:56,301
So this worked for fire and ice

1144
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:57,642
and all the other status effects as well,

1145
00:40:57,682 --> 00:40:59,403
and it really added a different feel to the game.

1146
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,184
So we have this new emphasis,

1147
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:06,685
on target prioritization with the life bars,

1148
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:10,270
and multiple damage types, stun being the most important

1149
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,052
because that's the one that allows you to grab enemies.

1150
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:14,676
But there's still something I haven't talked about

1151
00:41:14,716 --> 00:41:17,179
in a while, and that's this little guy.

1152
00:41:21,098 --> 00:41:25,141
And as mentioned earlier, Atreus was initially not

1153
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,363
an exciting endeavor on the combat side.

1154
00:41:27,663 --> 00:41:30,565
This tiny kid was tagging along Kratos all the time,

1155
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:32,486
made it seem like he would be a nuisance

1156
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:34,327
that would disrupt all the stuff that we're talking about.

1157
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:36,388
But there were some interesting ideas there

1158
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:37,049
right from the start.

1159
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:40,331
Early on, the idea of a sun button would separate him

1160
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:41,872
from the typical AI companion

1161
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:42,973
that you might find in other games.

1162
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:43,973
You'd press this button,

1163
00:41:43,993 --> 00:41:45,895
you could actually take control of him briefly.

1164
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:48,703
And everybody envisioned this in their head,

1165
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:49,783
where Kratos would launch a guy,

1166
00:41:49,803 --> 00:41:50,663
and you'd press this button,

1167
00:41:50,683 --> 00:41:52,024
and Atreus' arrows would juggle him.

1168
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:54,004
Very God of War, very immediate.

1169
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:55,024
That's what we wanted to do.

1170
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:57,925
But power, I mean, we've been talking about that

1171
00:41:57,965 --> 00:41:59,665
a lot for Kratos, but it didn't feel like

1172
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:01,065
that was part of Atreus' journey.

1173
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:02,646
His fantasy wasn't about power.

1174
00:42:03,986 --> 00:42:05,146
So when thinking about Atreus,

1175
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:08,066
I liked thinking about an old quote from Michael Jordan.

1176
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:10,027
And his quote was,

1177
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:12,647
talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence

1178
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:13,647
wins championships.

1179
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:15,448
And that quote fit this vision.

1180
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:17,576
Kratos has all the talent in the world,

1181
00:42:17,737 --> 00:42:19,658
but to complete this new journey, he would need Atreus.

1182
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:22,140
And so a good thematic tagline for Atreus

1183
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,761
was simply being a great teammate.

1184
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,023
And this made sense.

1185
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:27,184
All our inspirational art

1186
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:28,465
has been showing this the whole time.

1187
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,647
Kratos and Atreus were a team.

1188
00:42:31,107 --> 00:42:33,069
So all design decisions should be centered around

1189
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:34,750
selling Atreus as a great teammate.

1190
00:42:36,672 --> 00:42:38,473
So if you think about sports or your development teams,

1191
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:40,715
what would you consider a good teammate?

1192
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,157
Probably somebody that doesn't get in the way.

1193
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:44,939
Team is better with this teammate on it.

1194
00:42:45,915 --> 00:42:47,457
Probably somebody that helps the team succeed.

1195
00:42:47,957 --> 00:42:48,858
The teammate has value.

1196
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:52,201
You probably want this teammate to take direction,

1197
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:55,383
get results, and you probably don't want the teammate

1198
00:42:55,403 --> 00:42:56,044
to wait to be asked.

1199
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:57,085
You want them to take some initiative

1200
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:57,985
and do some things on their own.

1201
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,309
And almost more importantly, he was a God of War teammate.

1202
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:04,070
So he should take part in all the stuff

1203
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:04,931
that we talked about before.

1204
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:08,534
That deliberate vision, the one versus many concepts

1205
00:43:08,574 --> 00:43:12,237
and playfulness, and reinventing the grab

1206
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:12,958
with the stun system.

1207
00:43:14,712 --> 00:43:16,853
So the sun button was Atreus taking direction.

1208
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:20,255
Each shot applied more stun to enemies than damage.

1209
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:23,477
This made Atreus a core part of Kratos' grab system

1210
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,238
right from the get-go, giving instant value

1211
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:25,998
in most encounters.

1212
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:28,699
It also separated him from the power fantasy of Kratos

1213
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,380
because Atreus wasn't the one doing the grabbing,

1214
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:30,921
Kratos was.

1215
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:34,163
His shots also distracted enemies,

1216
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:36,084
so this took pressure off the player,

1217
00:43:36,504 --> 00:43:39,205
creating a subtle bit of crowd control in his own way.

1218
00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:41,227
It also presented their backs to Kratos,

1219
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:42,687
which is a good setup because the players

1220
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:43,408
could take advantage of that.

1221
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,551
And lastly, that playful combat we were talking about,

1222
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:49,992
which worked exactly as we thought.

1223
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:52,374
Like launching a guy and shooting a guy in the air

1224
00:43:52,454 --> 00:43:53,994
kind of doesn't get old, it's just that kind of

1225
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:55,415
old school God of War feel that we wanted.

1226
00:43:56,476 --> 00:43:58,277
But some people forgot to even press this button,

1227
00:43:58,297 --> 00:43:58,777
to be honest.

1228
00:43:59,117 --> 00:44:00,378
We give him all these sweet abilities

1229
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:02,299
only for players to forget he even exists.

1230
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:03,560
We'd have a play test and we're like,

1231
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,320
hey, what'd you think about him?

1232
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,801
And he's like, I don't know, I forgot he was even there.

1233
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:09,783
So, but that's until he started taking more initiative.

1234
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:13,328
And Atreus didn't wait for Kratos to actually

1235
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:14,969
give a command to do anything.

1236
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:17,490
He could decide to attack, even combo,

1237
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,530
juggle enemies on his own.

1238
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:20,931
These autonomous attacks also added stun,

1239
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:22,292
meaning he could stun enemies on his own.

1240
00:44:22,852 --> 00:44:24,373
Even if the player didn't notice all this directly

1241
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:25,213
each time it happened,

1242
00:44:25,693 --> 00:44:27,134
all of this was helping with crowd control.

1243
00:44:28,915 --> 00:44:30,636
And these autonomous attacks also contributed

1244
00:44:30,676 --> 00:44:32,516
to the happy accidents that we've been talking about.

1245
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:34,777
You could strategically change your plan

1246
00:44:34,817 --> 00:44:36,778
based on what you might see Atreus do in the distance,

1247
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:38,879
which is what you want out of a good teammate.

1248
00:44:40,507 --> 00:44:42,188
So here's an example of Atreus taking part

1249
00:44:42,328 --> 00:44:43,228
in all these systems.

1250
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:45,869
Try to keep an eye on Atreus throughout.

1251
00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:47,110
He's gonna come in on the right side.

1252
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,350
So there he is.

1253
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,271
He's gonna jump on this guy, enhance this reaction for me.

1254
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:51,751
That's cool.

1255
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:54,713
Then he's just gonna stun him so I can grab him,

1256
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,133
beat him down, that's cool.

1257
00:44:56,993 --> 00:44:58,054
He's gonna boot this guy in front of me,

1258
00:44:58,094 --> 00:44:59,394
that's convenient, I'll just chop him up.

1259
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,696
He's gonna follow up on that guy, knocking him down,

1260
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:03,136
that's great.

1261
00:45:03,896 --> 00:45:05,617
Trip this guy for me, some free crowd control,

1262
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:06,357
no problems with that.

1263
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:10,786
He's going to come here, grab this guy, give me enough time to chop this guy in half.

1264
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:18,372
And lastly, when I kick this guy back, he'll kind of launch him on his own, do some juggling,

1265
00:45:18,412 --> 00:45:21,254
all without me pressing a button, give me plenty of time to do that.

1266
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:26,339
And that's when we had all that in and working.

1267
00:45:28,641 --> 00:45:32,023
When we had all that in and working, that's when Atreus officially became a part of the

1268
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:32,324
family.

1269
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:34,616
Playtesters were giving him positive feedback,

1270
00:45:34,636 --> 00:45:35,817
and Corey didn't have to remind everyone

1271
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:36,677
that he would never get cut,

1272
00:45:37,057 --> 00:45:37,717
because he never would.

1273
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:39,317
We'd all get fired instead.

1274
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:42,818
So that's because gameplay-wise

1275
00:45:42,858 --> 00:45:43,978
he was talking to all our systems.

1276
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,459
Everything from the vision

1277
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:47,159
to what we needed to retain from the older games,

1278
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:49,600
and to what we wanted to reinvent in the new game.

1279
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,040
In fact, Atreus himself is probably the culmination

1280
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,601
of everything we were changing about this game.

1281
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,282
So, some final thoughts on this.

1282
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,256
Determine your vision as early as possible,

1283
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:05,617
because if it's strong, you should be able to use it

1284
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:06,637
as a guiding point throughout.

1285
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:10,298
I'm a fan of those thematic phrases I've been mentioning,

1286
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:12,879
like ballet a fire and plow the road and monster in a box,

1287
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,080
because it's something very simple to explain

1288
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,800
and then refer back to

1289
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,820
if you're heading in the wrong direction.

1290
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:18,661
Like I'm mentioning all of this

1291
00:46:18,701 --> 00:46:20,922
as if we were like brilliantly making all these decisions

1292
00:46:20,982 --> 00:46:22,202
every step of the way, but we weren't.

1293
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:23,883
There was a lot of hindsight as 2020 here.

1294
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:27,775
Also deconstruct your inspiration

1295
00:46:28,236 --> 00:46:29,537
and break down the player's choices.

1296
00:46:30,277 --> 00:46:31,358
Since we were making a sequel,

1297
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:33,319
that partially meant us looking back on our own games,

1298
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,681
but honestly we deconstructed many, many games

1299
00:46:35,741 --> 00:46:36,822
along the course of development

1300
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:39,263
to determine what type of feel we were looking for.

1301
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:42,906
And lastly, determine your gameplay loop.

1302
00:46:43,727 --> 00:46:45,368
Because specifically those player choices

1303
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:46,349
are what you intend to add.

1304
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:48,890
Hopefully these choices go well with your vision

1305
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:50,952
in order to make a cohesive feeling game

1306
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:52,973
and also hopefully bring something new to the table

1307
00:46:53,253 --> 00:46:54,835
that's unique to your own game compared to others.

1308
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:59,119
So for us, that started with that vision,

1309
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,100
of close and personal, deliberate, mythical power.

1310
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,201
But while we did that, we wanted to retain

1311
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:07,162
the one versus many, that playful combat,

1312
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:08,703
and that power for all.

1313
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:12,744
And lastly, we wanted to reinvent the game as well,

1314
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:14,304
starting with that close camera,

1315
00:47:14,805 --> 00:47:16,545
new emphasis on target prioritization,

1316
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:18,466
multiple damage types that the player

1317
00:47:18,486 --> 00:47:19,666
could choose between at any time,

1318
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:21,727
and that great teammate in Atreus.

1319
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:23,968
And it was all those things combined

1320
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,328
that allowed us to take an ax to God of War gameplay.

1321
00:47:28,397 --> 00:47:30,837
So before I end this talk, I do want to mention

1322
00:47:30,877 --> 00:47:32,097
a few other talks that go deeper

1323
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:33,338
on some of the concepts I've mentioned here.

1324
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,878
If you want to know more about that great teammate,

1325
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:41,080
our senior designer Hayato is giving a talk later today

1326
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,920
called Raising Atreus for Battle in God of War.

1327
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,561
This talk will go in depth on how Atreus

1328
00:47:46,581 --> 00:47:48,081
became a great teammate and much more.

1329
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:50,802
And if you're interested in knowing more

1330
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:52,442
about how we solved problems regarding

1331
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:53,703
that close third-person camera,

1332
00:47:54,303 --> 00:47:55,643
please check out the talk from Mihir,

1333
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:57,163
our now lead combat designer.

1334
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:02,104
He has a talk called Evolving Combat and God of War for a New Perspective that goes deep

1335
00:48:02,564 --> 00:48:05,626
on the choices we made to actually land that close camera feel.

1336
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:07,667
Thank you so much.

1337
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:24,530
So we still have a little bit of time for Q&A if anybody's interested in that.

1338
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,252
And then after that I will go to a wrap-up room somewhere.

1339
00:48:27,753 --> 00:48:28,433
You'll be able to find me.

1340
00:48:29,895 --> 00:48:30,055
Hi.

1341
00:48:30,555 --> 00:48:31,456
Hey, what's up?

1342
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:32,477
Awesome talk, awesome game.

1343
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:33,138
Thank you so much.

1344
00:48:33,298 --> 00:48:33,778
Oh, thank you.

1345
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:38,723
My question for you is, it was a super huge surprise, you know, midway through this game

1346
00:48:38,763 --> 00:48:42,226
where it's like, you know, I fell in love with the axe, I bought it and, like, I'm into

1347
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:42,366
it.

1348
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:44,068
It's like, by the way, here's your blades back.

1349
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:48,810
I'm curious how that decision was made in terms of like, was that always in the vision

1350
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,151
book that Kratos would sort of discover this ancient power?

1351
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:57,813
And after making all these deliberate decisions about the axe, what was it like making the

1352
00:48:57,853 --> 00:48:59,914
blades fit into this new combat system?

1353
00:49:00,294 --> 00:49:00,734
Right, yeah.

1354
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:04,576
So the blades were not in that vision book at first.

1355
00:49:04,596 --> 00:49:05,516
It was all about the axe.

1356
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:07,056
It was all about this new feel for the game.

1357
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:10,918
Eventually, in a few revisions, we knew that the blades were coming back in story mode.

1358
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:12,278
We hid that from everyone, but we knew.

1359
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,390
And I think the next question was,

1360
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,312
how do we convert the blades to kind of fit this vision?

1361
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:21,894
So a lot of that came from just the third person camera alone

1362
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,036
because the things that we were learning about the axe

1363
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:25,537
in terms of holding enemies in place

1364
00:49:25,577 --> 00:49:29,380
and keeping enemies burning or freezing or whatever,

1365
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,342
they applied to all the things for the blades as well.

1366
00:49:31,822 --> 00:49:33,364
So when we worked on the axe,

1367
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:35,165
we actually probably delayed work on the blades

1368
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,887
probably too long for comfort for some people.

1369
00:49:37,387 --> 00:49:39,349
But what we were doing is kind of finalizing

1370
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:40,610
what the axe was going to be,

1371
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,771
and then it was easy to apply that to the blades afterwards.

1372
00:49:43,558 --> 00:49:44,238
Awesome, thank you very much.

1373
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:46,520
Hey, there.

1374
00:49:46,881 --> 00:49:47,541
Thanks for the talk.

1375
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:51,184
Is there anything in hindsight that you think didn't work well

1376
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:52,745
or that you would do differently next time?

1377
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:53,966
Oh, yeah.

1378
00:49:53,986 --> 00:49:55,087
I mean, all that stuff I talked about,

1379
00:49:55,107 --> 00:49:56,008
I would have did that a lot sooner.

1380
00:49:58,046 --> 00:50:03,389
Like, I think whenever you're doing something new, there's always a lot of doubt in terms

1381
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:03,929
of what you're doing.

1382
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:04,989
There's a lot of second-guessing.

1383
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:07,771
And sometimes that can distract you from actually moving forward.

1384
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:13,093
So we actually did do a good job of getting out of that haze quicker than it seemed like

1385
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:13,794
we would at the time.

1386
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,915
But I think it could have been even quicker.

1387
00:50:15,975 --> 00:50:19,276
We could have gotten to some of these decisions even faster if we kind of bought into the

1388
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:19,856
vision earlier.

1389
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,831
And as far as like the final product goes, do you feel like there were decisions that

1390
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:27,352
you made that you like, like if you'd gotten there sooner you could have developed, I don't

1391
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:29,253
know, this system more or something like that?

1392
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:32,394
Oh yeah, well I mean there's always, I mean there hasn't been a God of War game that I've

1393
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:35,035
made that there wasn't something that we could have added at the end.

1394
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:39,157
Thankfully we keep making them, so maybe we'll make another one.

1395
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:40,577
Alright, thank you.

1396
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:40,857
Yeah.

1397
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:44,669
Hi, great talk.

1398
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,595
So can you talk a little bit about some balance challenges

1399
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:49,980
you faced in terms of forming combo moves,

1400
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,387
especially when you started adding more elements like fire

1401
00:50:53,427 --> 00:50:54,248
and ice into the game?

1402
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,131
Yeah, so the question was like how do we balance like all the damage types?

1403
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:04,072
So every single damage type had a way to be scaled on difficulty and per enemy and everything

1404
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:04,372
like that.

1405
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:08,113
So we would decide on an enemy basis like which ones could stun faster than others,

1406
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:11,934
how would we bring that done, sorry, excuse me, bring that down.

1407
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,175
Does Atreus stun?

1408
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:13,875
Is that too easy?

1409
00:51:13,895 --> 00:51:14,635
We'll bring that down.

1410
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:16,096
Or maybe the Akazan is too easy.

1411
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:16,996
Bring that down.

1412
00:51:17,016 --> 00:51:18,616
Sorry, I punch stuff a lot when I'm talking.

1413
00:51:20,398 --> 00:51:26,802
So, we essentially just had tuning parameters for all those separately, and then as we were

1414
00:51:26,822 --> 00:51:31,105
tuning the game, we would go into each individual circumstance and change that as needed.

1415
00:51:31,866 --> 00:51:32,066
Cool.

1416
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:32,426
Thanks.

1417
00:51:32,446 --> 00:51:34,968
Someone from over there?

1418
00:51:35,307 --> 00:51:35,888
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

1419
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:36,548
I didn't even see you.

1420
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:37,930
I'm sorry.

1421
00:51:38,851 --> 00:51:41,373
Was the third-person camera the only reason

1422
00:51:41,413 --> 00:51:44,216
that drove you to move the attacks to the shoulder

1423
00:51:44,236 --> 00:51:44,616
buttons?

1424
00:51:45,077 --> 00:51:47,639
And follow-up question is, how long

1425
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,801
did it take you to give players the option

1426
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:50,882
to go back to the face buttons?

1427
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:54,781
Oh, so the question was, did we have the shoulder buttons

1428
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:56,881
as an initial thought, and yes it was.

1429
00:51:56,901 --> 00:51:59,323
The moment we knew that there was a third person camera,

1430
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:01,003
immediately the shoulder buttons

1431
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:02,004
were the things we wanted to use.

1432
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:04,205
It actually took us a long time to add an option

1433
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:05,305
for the face buttons as well,

1434
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:07,826
and that was mainly that as through development

1435
00:52:07,846 --> 00:52:10,868
we started adding more things to satiate everybody

1436
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:11,928
that might wanna play this game

1437
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:13,289
and might wanna play it a certain way.

1438
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:15,390
So we added the face buttons mainly for that,

1439
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,370
but the true way to play

1440
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,611
is probably the shoulder buttons for us.

1441
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:18,545
Thank you.

1442
00:52:19,906 --> 00:52:20,987
And sorry.

1443
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:21,547
Thank you.

1444
00:52:22,828 --> 00:52:30,494
So, one of the things I've noticed is that you mentioned like players, for example, forgot

1445
00:52:30,534 --> 00:52:33,015
to use a try us button to shoot, something like that.

1446
00:52:33,576 --> 00:52:39,340
And I was wondering, there's this issue in many action games where players will use like

1447
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:43,763
a third of all your cool abilities you have in the game.

1448
00:52:44,682 --> 00:52:47,404
And I was wondering how do you deal with this issue because,

1449
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,566
I mean, how do you deal with the possibility

1450
00:52:50,606 --> 00:52:53,908
that there's this player or there's maybe a lot of players

1451
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:56,850
that will generally use like the most basic attack,

1452
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,611
dodge, basic attack, dodge.

1453
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:01,913
How do you deal with this issue that kind of turns the game

1454
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:04,434
into a little repetitive thing?

1455
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:07,316
Yeah, so the question was that when you have all these

1456
00:53:07,336 --> 00:53:09,277
abilities and players start forgetting about them,

1457
00:53:09,457 --> 00:53:11,719
like what methods can we use to make them remember?

1458
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:14,100
Well, not only make them remember, but.

1459
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:20,243
give them a reason to use something else but the most basic attack.

1460
00:53:20,523 --> 00:53:24,667
Right, so what you're talking about is probably the most difficult part of gameplay tuning

1461
00:53:25,067 --> 00:53:29,151
because even in our game there were some people that on certain difficulties probably just

1462
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:30,091
didn't touch certain stuff.

1463
00:53:30,512 --> 00:53:34,114
You'd have to determine what is important for them to know and what you can live with

1464
00:53:34,134 --> 00:53:34,714
them not knowing.

1465
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:38,336
So, for example, in our game, like easy and normal difficulty, we kind of didn't care

1466
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:39,357
if you didn't do certain things.

1467
00:53:39,397 --> 00:53:42,218
So if you just played the game and ignored part of it, still were having fun, that was

1468
00:53:42,259 --> 00:53:42,779
fine for us.

1469
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:47,341
But the harder difficulties were tuned to kind of raise the value of those concepts.

1470
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:51,284
So a lot of what we try to do is we would look at analytics of what people are doing

1471
00:53:51,324 --> 00:53:51,784
and how they're...

1472
00:53:52,044 --> 00:53:53,605
playing the game and if we see them,

1473
00:53:54,145 --> 00:53:55,605
like a good example is actually the runic attacks

1474
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:57,446
where people would equip one runic attack

1475
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,106
and have that equip the entire game

1476
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,847
when we first put all runic attacks in.

1477
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:02,988
And part of that was just because the value

1478
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:04,628
of the other ones just weren't apparent.

1479
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:05,808
Like people couldn't tell the difference

1480
00:54:05,828 --> 00:54:07,889
between one versus the other so they just stuck with one.

1481
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:09,830
So we would keep tuning that and making it

1482
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:13,031
more pleasing feel-wise, more pleasing value-wise

1483
00:54:13,311 --> 00:54:15,632
until we start actually seeing more people start to use it.

1484
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,627
And unfortunately, you kind of have to take that as a case by case basis.

1485
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:20,928
You could just forcefully remind them, say, hey, press this button.

1486
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:24,710
Or we could have lock and keys where it's like, hey, this enemy forces you to do this

1487
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,991
if you weren't doing it before.

1488
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:31,473
But we try as much as we can to try to make sure the value of all these are unique and

1489
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:33,915
different enough that there's some scenario where you can make use out of it.

1490
00:54:34,122 --> 00:54:38,444
Yeah, because usually when you force it, a lot of players will just not really like that.

1491
00:54:38,564 --> 00:54:42,905
Yeah, because it just feels like work then, so you kind of want to encourage them to do it,

1492
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:46,606
encourage them to want to do that by the value in the specific thing that this move is adding.

1493
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:50,408
So you also said that you defined as a team,

1494
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:54,669
okay, this the players can leave without knowing, but this they have to know.

1495
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:56,002
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1496
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:59,526
Like there's some, you know, when you look at our combat system, there's so many things

1497
00:54:59,586 --> 00:54:59,786
in it.

1498
00:55:00,206 --> 00:55:04,171
We can't expect 100% of people to know everything, but there's certain things that we know we

1499
00:55:04,211 --> 00:55:06,393
want them to do, such as grabbing enemies.

1500
00:55:06,573 --> 00:55:07,454
That was important to us.

1501
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:08,675
We really wanted players to do that.

1502
00:55:08,996 --> 00:55:12,279
So we highlighted R3 over the life bar and we did all these things to make you want to

1503
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:12,479
do it.

1504
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,500
Alright, thank you.

1505
00:55:15,683 --> 00:55:22,607
So I know you touched a little bit on how the player would manage enemies, a little bit regarding adjusting the camera slightly.

1506
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:29,150
But there was two talks, I believe, last year, one regarding Doom and one regarding how late.

1507
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:35,034
Where in Doom, enemies would have a ticketing system where only a certain number of enemies could attack at a time.

1508
00:55:35,614 --> 00:55:41,336
And for Hellblade, all the enemies would try and go from the periphery or behind to the

1509
00:55:41,397 --> 00:55:44,758
player's front so they could manage all the enemies that way.

1510
00:55:45,138 --> 00:55:50,980
I was wondering if you guys had a similar system for either of those or if an enemy

1511
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,321
could attack, they were just going to.

1512
00:55:53,121 --> 00:55:54,142
So, yes, we did have it.

1513
00:55:54,162 --> 00:55:58,463
So the question was, like, when enemies circle around Kratos, was there some kind of system

1514
00:55:58,503 --> 00:55:59,364
controlling all of this?

1515
00:56:00,204 --> 00:56:01,204
And yes, there absolutely was.

1516
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:04,646
Like, ever since the first God of War, we've had, like, a fight circle system where enemies

1517
00:56:04,686 --> 00:56:04,826
would...

1518
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:08,390
similarly have some kind of token, it's not exactly the same, but something like that

1519
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,712
where they would have this aggression meter and a certain amount of enemies that can kind

1520
00:56:11,732 --> 00:56:14,174
of fill that meter and when it gets to full, characters can't attack.

1521
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:19,419
And actually you're kind of getting into the details I think in Mihir's talk, so you'll

1522
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:23,382
get a little bit more information on that, but essentially yes we did, because that's

1523
00:56:23,402 --> 00:56:24,543
the only way you're going to be able to do this.

1524
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:28,206
Like if you have enemies all swarming you and no way to control it, it just is unplayable,

1525
00:56:28,226 --> 00:56:29,066
so we've always had that.

1526
00:56:32,574 --> 00:56:36,057
Hi, thank you for your talk. My question is about Atreus.

1527
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:41,142
So how did you balance him to not take away intentionality from the player?

1528
00:56:41,282 --> 00:56:44,424
Say, for example, I'm waiting for an enemy to attack me and I really want to parry him.

1529
00:56:45,946 --> 00:56:48,928
But then before that happens, Atreus stuns him.

1530
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:50,195
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

1531
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:57,339
So the question is, how do we prevent Atreus from just screwing you over half the time?

1532
00:56:57,379 --> 00:57:00,701
So this was actually a big part of Atreus' design in a lot of the iteration, because

1533
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:05,504
a lot of the things that Atreus does is designed to not take him away from your position.

1534
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:08,166
So a good example is when he comes up and he grabs a guy.

1535
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:11,688
When he does that, all he's doing is making it easier to hit the guy that's already right

1536
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:12,148
in front of me.

1537
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:14,750
He's not pushing him aside or doing anything that's going to stop my view.

1538
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,272
Similarly, if I'm pointing my reticle at an enemy, that would be the worst time for Kratos

1539
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:18,492
to do that.

1540
00:57:18,953 --> 00:57:20,434
sorry, Atreus to knock him out the way.

1541
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:22,335
So we have a lot of checks to make sure

1542
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,757
that what Atreus does actually only enhances

1543
00:57:24,998 --> 00:57:26,219
what I'm probably already doing.

1544
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:28,440
So another good example is if I knock the guy away

1545
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,662
and he lands over here, it's fine for Atreus

1546
00:57:30,682 --> 00:57:32,223
to come here and just kind of beat him down.

1547
00:57:32,664 --> 00:57:34,686
But if he moves him, then that's gonna probably

1548
00:57:34,726 --> 00:57:36,387
screw me up if I was gonna evade and follow him.

1549
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:39,189
So we try to make sure that everything Atreus does

1550
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:40,730
is just an enhancement on what I'm doing

1551
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:41,671
so he never gets in the way.

1552
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:42,692
Thanks.

1553
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,665
Hi, you mentioned at a certain point,

1554
00:57:46,685 --> 00:57:49,908
switching to multiple different resources in combat.

1555
00:57:50,589 --> 00:57:53,452
And I'm wondering if you ever got to a place

1556
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,413
where you were worried that you had too many

1557
00:57:55,554 --> 00:57:58,036
or where players would be confused

1558
00:57:58,116 --> 00:58:00,038
by all the different element options.

1559
00:58:00,238 --> 00:58:01,740
And if not, how did you avoid that?

1560
00:58:02,163 --> 00:58:06,785
Yeah, yeah. So the question was, once we started adding all the damage types and various things

1561
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:11,987
in the game, what happens, when did it become too complicated or were we afraid of that?

1562
00:58:12,427 --> 00:58:16,549
And the answer to that, I think, is the entire studio is constantly afraid of that, especially

1563
00:58:16,569 --> 00:58:20,850
if you're not a combat designer. Everybody else is just always scared about everything

1564
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:23,271
you're going to add, especially if they're playing the game themselves and they're not

1565
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:23,912
doing those things.

1566
00:58:24,352 --> 00:58:29,054
So that's where playtests help a lot, because we had about 20 people each time coming in

1567
00:58:29,194 --> 00:58:33,016
playing the game, and then you would hopefully see within those 20 people a variety of things

1568
00:58:33,036 --> 00:58:37,199
that they're doing, because again, you don't expect just in one play session for everybody

1569
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:41,241
to gravitate towards everything, but everybody has their own play styles, and you try to

1570
00:58:41,281 --> 00:58:43,362
put things in the game that contribute to that play style.

1571
00:58:43,862 --> 00:58:48,626
So, we would look at that and try to see if players would start to gravitate towards it.

1572
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:52,850
And if we started to see things to be a bit too complicated, meaning that we'd ask them

1573
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:56,453
and see if they understand this and they already have no idea, we either try to simplify it

1574
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:57,954
or make it so they can understand.

1575
00:58:58,534 --> 00:59:02,377
But so much of my answer to the other question is like, we were okay if you didn't know some

1576
00:59:02,397 --> 00:59:02,637
things.

1577
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:04,499
Thank you.

1578
00:59:05,544 --> 00:59:06,766
Hey Jason, thanks so much for your talk.

1579
00:59:06,826 --> 00:59:08,367
It's good to see some of the magic behind the scenes.

1580
00:59:09,068 --> 00:59:12,973
My question is regarding how this combat system interfaced with bosses.

1581
00:59:13,253 --> 00:59:15,936
Were there any special considerations or adaptations you had to make?

1582
00:59:16,336 --> 00:59:19,300
Yes, absolutely. I mean the bosses, especially the big bosses like the dragon,

1583
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,503
they always have their own kind of system in terms of how they're going to attack you

1584
00:59:22,523 --> 00:59:24,165
because they're kind of outside the combat system.

1585
00:59:25,085 --> 00:59:31,627
Thankfully, other characters like the Stranger, no spoilers, but the Stranger, he was an enemy

1586
00:59:31,647 --> 00:59:35,908
that was in our combat system, so we always have special considerations for any special

1587
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:39,949
case things that need to happen, but generally characters like that operate within the combat

1588
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:40,189
system.

1589
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:50,042
Great talk, thank you very much. I've been playing God of War since God of War 1 back in, I don't know, when I was young I guess.

1590
00:59:50,563 --> 00:59:57,206
And I've always been able to beat them on the hardest difficulties, my favorite parts of games like this, especially in God of War 3.

1591
00:59:58,206 --> 01:00:02,908
Jumping into this game, obviously from the get-go you can't play the game on the hardest difficulty because it's like, you're clearly not ready!

1592
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:08,491
But like, I jumped into the difficulty above normal, and it demolished me.

1593
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:12,500
So I don't know if I'm just like Kratos, really old and angry,

1594
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,801
or if it's something that, a big thing I noticed

1595
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:16,722
about the difficulty was that it sort of just extended

1596
01:00:16,762 --> 01:00:19,163
enemy life bars to make them take a lot more hits

1597
01:00:19,223 --> 01:00:20,584
as opposed to other games that have just made it

1598
01:00:20,624 --> 01:00:22,305
to where the time to kill is the same,

1599
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:23,425
but the damage outputs are higher,

1600
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:24,706
so there's a lot more risk and reward.

1601
01:00:24,866 --> 01:00:26,506
Was there a lot of talk in the studio

1602
01:00:26,546 --> 01:00:27,907
of doing that deliberately for the purpose

1603
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:29,988
of a lot of the juggling mechanics you were talking about?

1604
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:31,900
Oh yeah, I mean there's a lot of gameplay tuning.

1605
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:36,524
I mean I can say that we didn't really extend a character's life bars just to make more

1606
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:37,305
juggling happen.

1607
01:00:37,785 --> 01:00:41,028
But usually what we're trying to do is we're trying to emphasize some of the more deliberate

1608
01:00:41,068 --> 01:00:41,669
decision making.

1609
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:45,492
So ideas like, oh I can launch a guy and throw the axe at him into a wall for an instant

1610
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:45,692
kill.

1611
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:46,873
It doesn't matter how much health they have.

1612
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,235
Things like that were things that we were trying to promote

1613
01:00:49,335 --> 01:00:50,356
on some of the harder difficulties.

1614
01:00:50,376 --> 01:00:52,037
So we would tune their health up slightly,

1615
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:53,478
but hopefully not too slightly

1616
01:00:53,518 --> 01:00:54,519
that it felt like you couldn't win,

1617
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,241
but more so that we wanted you to kind of take part

1618
01:00:57,301 --> 01:00:58,422
in some of those deliberate decisions

1619
01:00:58,462 --> 01:00:59,363
that I was talking about.

1620
01:00:59,663 --> 01:01:01,925
So like in that example where you could freeze a guy

1621
01:01:01,945 --> 01:01:03,586
and kick an enemy into multiple guys,

1622
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:05,908
that gives you a lot of time to kind of make these decisions

1623
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:06,909
but if you don't do that,

1624
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:08,690
it probably will be a rough experience.

1625
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:13,454
Oh, I think we're out of time.

1626
01:01:13,694 --> 01:01:14,215
So thank you.

1627
01:01:14,235 --> 01:01:15,556
I will head to the...

1628
01:01:15,576 --> 01:01:15,776
Thank you.
