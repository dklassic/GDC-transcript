00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:12,682
Hello! Welcome to my talk for the GDC showcase about making marketing mistakes.

2
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:17,950
I am super, super excited to talk to you about this because it's going to be a little bit

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,197
embarrassing for me, but hopefully we will all learn in the process together.

4
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:27,341
So as a brief introduction, hello, I'm Victoria Tran.

5
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,803
I'm the community director over at Innersloth.

6
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:32,845
We make a game called Among Us, and we've also made a game called

7
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,087
the Henry Stickmin Collection.

8
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:38,630
I was previously the communications director at Kip Fox Games,

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,894
which is a little indie studio that makes games like Boyfriend Dungeon,

10
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:45,036
also publishing games like Dwarf Fortress.

11
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:50,801
And yeah, you can find me on Twitter at the Vy Tran if at any point during this presentation

12
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:56,587
Like you have comments or questions or even want to share your own stories. I would love to hear it. Please please

13
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:57,828
I'm so embarrassed by myself

14
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:00,110
All right. Okay, great

15
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:04,953
So for both teams that I've worked on, we were pretty tiny, right?

16
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:09,914
So InnerSloth is a grand total right now of recording of five employees,

17
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:12,175
and Kitfox has a grand total of nine employees.

18
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:17,716
And from the outside, we certainly seem very successful in both studios,

19
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:20,857
and as we kind of just naturally worked our way into it

20
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:24,638
and had no issues, and we knew what we were doing the entire time.

21
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,152
But there's a lot of hidden work and failure that has gone into this,

22
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:34,395
and for me especially, to be able to learn how to market all of these different games correctly,

23
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:38,698
which is what I'm going to talk about. So really quickly on the agenda,

24
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:45,061
I'm going to outline why we fail, how to fail, my own failures, which will be

25
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:47,803
a little embarrassing, but it's fine, and then a little recap.

26
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:54,251
So first is we want to talk about why you want to fail and what success really looks like.

27
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,914
So success looks like a lot of different things for a lot of different people,

28
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:03,459
whether that's awards or press coverage, a successful Kickstarter perhaps,

29
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:07,743
or really a strong and new community following. It could be anything.

30
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:13,106
or even a ton of game sales, which is, you know, a lot of the things that we consider success.

31
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:18,048
But here's the thing, this is what success may look like to you, but it is actually built on.

32
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,369
Just trash. So much trash.

33
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:25,752
Success is built on the ruins of failures that nobody else has seen,

34
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:31,955
because they obviously just weren't picked up by the public, weren't talked about, or just completely forgotten about.

35
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:35,697
Or at least that's what my success has always looked like. Maybe there's someone out there who

36
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:41,699
has, you know, a lot of success and no failure, in which case I'm very jealous of them. But for me,

37
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:47,641
like, the thing is success isn't just built on, like, one pile of trash. It's built on so much

38
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:53,364
trash. So much trash failure. And sometimes even spectacular failures. But it doesn't need to

39
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:58,886
continue being trash that I continually regret. It can become compost.

40
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:04,560
Failure is more than just an embarrassing moment in my life that I want to bury.

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,481
I can learn from it, and it's not just that.

42
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:11,965
I can make it make me smarter, invigorate me, and a better, more well-rounded person.

43
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:17,289
Basically, failure becomes the compost and fertilizer for growth and success.

44
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,815
I want my trash to become a resource that feeds into the roots of my success and have it grow

45
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:29,962
into an entire garden that attracts cows to give me even more fertilizer and then I can

46
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:35,848
literally milk failure for all it has and never have to find unexpected failure trash again.

47
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:42,140
That was a very long-winded analogy to say that I basically tried to really change my

48
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,941
mindset towards failure.

49
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:48,424
I always want to succeed, but when failure does happen, there is value in it, and I want

50
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:49,784
to maximize that value.

51
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:56,881
So fair warning, I'm going to dive into this a bit more but I understand me saying failure at

52
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:01,824
things is coming from a very privileged position where the studios that I work for

53
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:07,068
either were in financial positions where I can fail but also that they cultivated a

54
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:10,350
culture in the team where it was okay and sometimes even encouraged to fail.

55
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:16,109
However, even if you're not comfortable and not coming from the same position or the environment

56
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,050
is not right for failure, I think this content is still useful for you, either to help you

57
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,452
with your mindset or to help encourage a better culture around failure and not just kind of

58
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:29,673
bury it under the dirt where no plants can grow and I can't have my cow farm.

59
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:36,088
Anyways, let's talk about how to fail, because there are different kinds of failures, some

60
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:40,230
of which are more desirable than others, and we need to know how we'll actually milk the

61
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,991
lessons for all it has.

62
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,952
Okay, I think that was like my last cow metaphor.

63
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:48,535
So first off, you want to do stupid things, but not actually stupid, I mean more have

64
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:53,398
fun and experiment, and we want to strategically create failures in the right places at the

65
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:53,798
right times.

66
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:54,398
And that's it.

67
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:55,519
I hope you learned something.

68
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,680
I'll see you next time.

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:56,760
Bye!

70
00:04:57,532 --> 00:05:02,377
There are basically a million permutations for how things can go wrong in game development and marketing,

71
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:07,462
but very broadly, and according to the Harvard Business Review, there are three main categories that they fall into.

72
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:10,846
So preventable, complexity-related, and intelligent.

73
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:14,430
In the first category, which usually falls into the blameworthy category,

74
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,295
we have things and failures that could have been prevented, and they're very predictable scenarios.

75
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:27,121
So these can be things like deviance, which means you knew A will definitely cause B, and then you did it anyway.

76
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:33,206
Inattention, so things like me not reading over my own tweets and kind of sending them out anyway.

77
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:36,408
Or a lack of ability. You literally just didn't have the skills to do it.

78
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:43,154
If you threw me at a game bug, and I don't know programming, I'm gonna mess it up, and I'm gonna fail completely.

79
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,976
So in the middle, we have system failures,

80
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:49,058
which are like game development and marketing,

81
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,560
have a lot of uncertainty in their processes.

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,464
And as we know, so oftentimes, things will probably go wrong during it.

83
00:05:56,464 --> 00:06:00,668
So whether that's due to difficulty, a lack of ability,

84
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:04,651
and we don't need to consider any of these process failures as bad, necessarily.

85
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:05,892
That's kind of counterproductive.

86
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:09,234
Avoiding huge failure means we need to be able to spot

87
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,956
and fix small minor failures.

88
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:14,057
and not leave them unnoticed and bury them under the rug.

89
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:19,220
And then on the other end of the spectrum, we have what HBR considers intelligent failures

90
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,582
because they kind of provide value and can help your studio leap ahead of the competition.

91
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:28,244
These are things that require experimentation because they're new ventures, so you know,

92
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:32,926
maybe you're trying out TikTok when it was first launching, exploring ads after researching them,

93
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,267
an amazing new marketing campaign idea.

94
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:39,430
These are things that are considered like trial and error,

95
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,652
but it's sort of a misnomer because error implies

96
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,393
that there was supposed to be a correct outcome

97
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:46,615
in the first place when you're more so experimenting

98
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,636
and seeing what works.

99
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:53,701
So now we need to dive into how to properly learn

100
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:55,122
from failures when they do happen.

101
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:57,824
And for that, we need to talk about accountability.

102
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:03,213
Accountability means we're asking what and not who.

103
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:07,114
So who means we're usually trying to blame someone like who did this

104
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:10,475
which is the wrong mindset. We need to ask the what in order to be able to

105
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:14,456
learn better from our failures. So unlike responsibility which is more

106
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:17,897
like you know the before, personal accountability is what

107
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,978
happens after. So let's say you've made a mistake

108
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:21,958
all right what are you going to do about it?

109
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:27,396
We like accountability because you stop trying to blame other people and make excuses.

110
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:33,950
Instead, you take the fall and you kind of ask what's next and decide what choices cause problems.

111
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:42,389
The first thing I do want to acknowledge is the guttural reaction that failure will probably

112
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,229
cause in you.

113
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,651
There's a lot of shame, I understand, it's very stressful, you might regret everything,

114
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:52,312
you want to bury yourself in a hole, screw everything, you're an imposter, you don't

115
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:55,093
belong here, all of that damaging self-talk.

116
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:56,233
And it's very normal.

117
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59,495
And yes, we all know conceptually everyone fails,

118
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,236
but with social media, it's hard to remember that.

119
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:02,977
But everyone does fail,

120
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:05,459
and you don't need to invalidate your feelings

121
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,660
when it comes to failure.

122
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,240
It's fine.

123
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,021
You'll be fine.

124
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,882
So maybe you have failed at one thing,

125
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:14,344
but that doesn't mean you are a noun failure.

126
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:19,276
So next we need to properly understand what has happened.

127
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:21,638
You know, after you get over that initial fear reaction,

128
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:24,160
it's time to ask yourself these four questions.

129
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,941
One, what is the problem?

130
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:28,463
Two, what am I doing or not doing

131
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,184
to contribute to the problem?

132
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:32,026
Three, what will I do differently

133
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:33,607
to help solve the problem?

134
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:36,189
And four, how will I be accountable for the result?

135
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,251
These are four really good questions

136
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,053
to just start you off in terms of accountability.

137
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,552
And please note, I said this before,

138
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:48,053
the culture around failure is very important.

139
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:49,114
It's not just on you, right?

140
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:52,535
Hopefully your studio manager, boss,

141
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:55,497
has created an environment where you feel safe

142
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,498
being accountable for owning up to your mistakes.

143
00:08:57,498 --> 00:08:59,419
Or if you're in a power position,

144
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,140
you have cultivated that environment

145
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,581
with your own employees.

146
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:07,663
Why would I ever want to kind of be accountable for anything

147
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:10,365
or tell you anything if the work environment

148
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:11,765
makes it feel like a death sentence?

149
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,182
And very importantly, you need to take accountability for your wins too.

150
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,664
It's still nice and good to remember you are talented and you are there for a reason.

151
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:25,686
You don't need to just take accountability for mistakes, take accountability for when you do well.

152
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,639
Okay, so once we've taken ownership of the failure,

153
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,142
it's time to dig into what we can really learn from it

154
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:35,024
and kind of tear it apart like that.

155
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,406
So the first way we're going to get insight

156
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:40,789
is by getting as specific as possible about why it happened

157
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,451
and not just general first-level reasons

158
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:44,432
why something failed, right?

159
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:47,835
So for example, I didn't read over my email

160
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:50,618
before hitting send, and it had a huge typo in it.

161
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:56,601
To properly understand it you need to look and dig deeper into the second and third reasons about why something happened.

162
00:09:56,601 --> 00:10:04,286
For instance, I didn't read the email, but that's because I had an overloaded work schedule and or I'm just not someone who often checks over things.

163
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:08,789
So I really need to make sure I schedule in like that extra five minutes to do so in the future.

164
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,513
The bigger the failure, the more likely there are intricate reasons why something failed.

165
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,956
There's multiple events in different fields of expertise at varying levels of the studio.

166
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:22,279
Understanding what happened and how to prevent it from happening again requires a really

167
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,923
detailed, often team-tiering-apart discussion and analysis of the failure.

168
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,086
And then one of the best things about failure

169
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:34,009
is that it's usually very clear what happened, right?

170
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,371
And it comes with a load of information.

171
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:38,753
Survivorship bias is a thing when someone succeeds,

172
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:40,235
but failure, when you fail, you're like,

173
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:41,736
all right, well, that didn't work.

174
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:44,299
It teaches us where effort is wasted

175
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:47,001
and encourages us not to repeat the same mistakes.

176
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,843
And there's two ways we can kind of learn from this.

177
00:10:48,903 --> 00:10:53,325
The first is informational, where it has a very definite, clear result that tells us, you know,

178
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:58,287
don't do this. The second is directional. It closes off a lot of different paths, but it also

179
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:02,489
leads us to new adventures to explore. Ow, I just hit my elbow on the desk.

180
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:09,332
All right, so finally we have different types of failure, which I will touch upon pretty quickly.

181
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,261
All right, so the first one is technical.

182
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:14,105
Basically, this is about performance standard.

183
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,087
It just didn't work.

184
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,089
The community event didn't work because

185
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:20,554
of some technical aspect.

186
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,317
The system crashed, that kind of thing.

187
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:26,815
Competence failure, which is based on your abilities

188
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:29,877
or inability to do something due to a lack of training

189
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,439
or knowledge, you just couldn't do it.

190
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:35,102
The third is something that I think is very important

191
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:38,144
that not a lot of people really take in mind sometimes,

192
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:39,686
which is the moral failure.

193
00:11:39,686 --> 00:11:41,908
So that's like I cheated sort of.

194
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:43,649
Failure isn't just about technicalities.

195
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,671
You could have succeeded at something,

196
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,293
but morally you or your studio fail to uphold

197
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,695
your own moral standards or your company values.

198
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,817
And those are important too, right?

199
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:55,279
So maybe your company made your sales goal,

200
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,481
but you used really unethical marketing tactics

201
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,923
that are short-term beneficial,

202
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:02,425
but ultimately damage your reputation long-term.

203
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:04,827
Fourth is parameter failure.

204
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:07,349
This means it's okay,

205
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:09,912
except it might've been over budget or too slow.

206
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,534
So marketing campaigns often have multiple success criteria,

207
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:15,236
which means there are multiple ways to fail too,

208
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,958
even when some parts of it succeed.

209
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,295
Next, you have hierarchical failure.

210
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,156
This is when something may succeed

211
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:23,397
in one level of the studio, but not in another.

212
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:25,978
So maybe the marketing campaign was a success

213
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,879
in terms of execution, but management

214
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,880
wasn't satisfied with the value of the result.

215
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,001
And lastly, you have subjective failure.

216
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:37,402
In some cases, things just fail for non-rational reasons.

217
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:39,023
You could have met all the correct criteria,

218
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,464
but for reasons that were subjective or just not

219
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:44,605
articulated to you, it's seen as a failure to some people.

220
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:50,823
Finally, we're going to take these insights and grow from it.

221
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:52,384
What am I doing?

222
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:55,666
So first, we got to dig into what skills you have and which you don't.

223
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,429
The insight you gain from the failure will be a really good sense of direction.

224
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:02,852
Do you need to learn more about marketing, PR, time management?

225
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:04,133
We're not born to do everything.

226
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,595
And I have my own weak spots when it comes to marketing

227
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:11,338
and being able to acknowledge and know where we are in our skill tree of life

228
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:12,079
is very important.

229
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:18,280
And again, we want to be specific and proactive about areas we need to develop on.

230
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,245
If you don't nail it down, vagueness kind of leads to inactivity.

231
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:26,049
When something gets in the way, assess it, resolve it, communicate it,

232
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:30,914
and do that all proactively to make sure your team or the studio are on board with your plan.

233
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:34,778
This will also help you gain back a lot of the trust that you might have lost when you made a mistake.

234
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:40,633
Another great way failure helps us to develop is it allows us to understand our expectations

235
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:41,674
much more.

236
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:47,764
I know I used to, and still do, actually, get caught up in saying yes to too many things,

237
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:50,789
and I get really afraid of letting people down by saying no.

238
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,571
This isn't really the proper way to go at it.

239
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,831
You need to set expectations not only for yourself,

240
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:58,392
but for other people and what's expected of you.

241
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:01,293
Being able to give proper time and attention to each task

242
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:03,254
is important in making sure you minimize

243
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:04,855
the catastrophic failure,

244
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:07,396
but also that every project that lands on your lap

245
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,697
is given the proper attention it needs to excel.

246
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:18,074
Alright, so we went through all of that, we learned about failures, so let's just go.

247
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:27,942
Let's get a little bit embarrassed with me about my own failures to show you that no matter where you are in your career, it's going to happen.

248
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:33,807
So the first one that is the most recent one, probably, are messed up tweets.

249
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,149
And not just like, you know, casual messed up tweets.

250
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:43,758
Basically, when I was launching the Among Us games account, the first day, my first three tweets,

251
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:49,919
I think, on it had spelling errors. Just, like, completely wrong. And also, I had copied and

252
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,500
pasted an emoji into Twitter, and it didn't translate right, and it screwed up into folded

253
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,741
hands. Like, it said folded hands instead of doing the folded hands emoji. It was an entire time.

254
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:05,942
And people noticed, right? Because Among Us was big enough that people were noticing I was typing

255
00:15:07,184 --> 00:15:15,108
badly and not spelling core ideas in our games right. But honestly it worked out and I did learn

256
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:22,231
a lot from it. So the first is that mistakes are fixable. You know, mistakes happen to everyone.

257
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:24,592
Some mistakes are, you know, harder to fix than others,

258
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:27,674
but it's good in human to make a mistake and people are used to it.

259
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:33,648
Second is ownership. Don't be a spectator, be an active owner of your problem. When you take

260
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:39,773
ownership for the mistake, you win back a lot of confidence in yourself when it does get better

261
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,636
and it just works out a little bit more. And third is inattention. Don't follow your own

262
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:48,760
bad habits. I was really nervous when I launched the Among Us Games Twitter account

263
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,103
and I didn't read over things because I was nervous.

264
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,411
Lesson learned, just take a breather.

265
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:58,072
And it'll probably save you a lot of heartache.

266
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:02,935
The second is the Moon Hunters contest.

267
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:05,536
And this was when I was working at Kitfox Games.

268
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:07,537
Moon Hunters was a game we were developing,

269
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:11,458
and we were basically putting it on the Nintendo Switch.

270
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,019
And it was very exciting.

271
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,841
And we decided, I decided, sorry, to do a fan art contest for it, right?

272
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:22,483
and it was going to work out perfectly. I was doing everything as they say, you know,

273
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:27,826
you tweet it out, you put on your social media, you have really cool prizes. We had three large

274
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:32,649
prizes and I was so excited for people to enter it and it was a really easy contest. You didn't

275
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:35,050
even need to draw anything, you just need to take a photo, right?

276
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:42,612
So three big prizes and we got a grand total of two entries.

277
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:45,633
I still think about, I still hate this.

278
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:48,754
We got two entries for our fan art contest, right?

279
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:49,654
Great, not great.

280
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,995
So I was really embarrassed when this happened,

281
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:54,956
especially because this was like my first console launch

282
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:56,356
when I was a community manager.

283
00:16:57,097 --> 00:17:00,138
I felt a lot of shame, but I did learn a lot from it.

284
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:03,880
So first is that I actually learned a lot about value.

285
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,921
Every ask, even when you think it's small like taking a photo,

286
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:11,223
is a lot of effort from someone and you need to provide even

287
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:14,384
more value to them, especially for a game that's older.

288
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:17,865
It was already out, a lot of people had already seen it, that kind of thing.

289
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:26,267
Second is to grow. The only reason that I really did the fan art contest was because I had seen

290
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:31,710
other people do it and I didn't actually consider like what was the goal of it,

291
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,812
did I really have any new ideas to bring to the table.

292
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:37,933
And third, as I said, what was the goal?

293
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,074
I didn't actually know what I wanted to accomplish

294
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:43,755
because the whole contest really was just remarketing

295
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:47,456
to people who already had the game or old fans,

296
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:49,276
and so were the prizes.

297
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,077
So it wasn't about capturing new people

298
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:53,237
to be interested in our game,

299
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,458
even though that was what I wanted,

300
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,439
I was more so just trying to ask old fans

301
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,519
to take photos of a game that they already own.

302
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,500
So who knows if they would have bought it.

303
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,382
on the Switch anyway if they already owned it on PC, right? All that kind of thing. And the third

304
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:15,423
mistake that I want to talk about. Moon Hunters really, really got hit hard by the Nintendo

305
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:20,825
Switch announcement. It was the Moon Hunters trailer for Nintendo Switch. So to explain,

306
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:26,066
you know, we had a little teaser that Moon Hunters was coming to the Nintendo Switch and...

307
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:30,501
I really should have taken this video down at this rate.

308
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:35,564
This screenshot here was the only time you could see gameplay of the game.

309
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:37,946
The rest of it was a silly skit.

310
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:40,848
And people noticed.

311
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:43,609
People noticed on the internet, as YouTube comments do.

312
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,511
They're actually kind of funny now.

313
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:50,714
But at the time, I was mortified that we had put out a trailer that didn't have gameplay.

314
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,475
Of course we needed gameplay.

315
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:53,696
Why didn't we think of this?

316
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:54,676
Why didn't I think of this?

317
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:57,873
But we learn lessons from it, right?

318
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:59,894
So first is to continue.

319
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:03,015
No wallowing, what are you going to do with this next?

320
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:04,776
How is this, how, what wrong assumptions

321
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,057
did we make about the audience?

322
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,818
And it's not the end of the world when something fails.

323
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:12,419
And your team has already felt the failure,

324
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,180
so they need to know what are you going to do next.

325
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:17,042
Second is audience.

326
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:19,003
Fundamentally, we forgot who we were talking to,

327
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:20,344
we weren't talking to old fans,

328
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:24,125
and we forgot to, again, add value into our content.

329
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,747
So now, what I ask myself all the time

330
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:29,048
is why does this content matter?

331
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,128
Why does someone care?

332
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,530
So that was a really valuable thing to learn from for me.

333
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,990
And third was skills.

334
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,071
I just needed a more holistic view of my own talents.

335
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:39,492
And also because I was still sort of new,

336
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:41,933
I needed to learn to speak up more,

337
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,214
but also figure myself out.

338
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,304
So that was the three big ones that I wanted to talk about.

339
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,366
But you know, there's more than three

340
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:54,309
in my career of community direction, communications,

341
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:55,290
all that kind of stuff.

342
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,532
There's so many failures, right?

343
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:00,935
So really quickly, we're just gonna go through a few.

344
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:07,158
for fun. One, this one time I forgot to hit reply all to a giant list of confidential emails,

345
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:13,961
or I didn't bcc them when I hit reply all for these confidential emails. Second is Imgur. I just

346
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:18,363
am very bad at getting traction on that website, even though a lot of people talk about it being

347
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:24,365
a great place to, you know, share information. I can't do it, and I'm not really even trying

348
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:29,208
at this, right? Third, I have emailed press with the wrong embargo date for

349
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:33,741
different games at some at one point that was very embarrassing.

350
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:38,918
In community management, I tried to keep the peace in our Discord,

351
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:43,920
and this caused a lot of people to be angry at me in the KitFox Discord, and they left,

352
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,122
so learn from that. And when we announced Boyfriend Dungeon for KitFox Games,

353
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:52,804
there was no Steam page that was tagged along to it, so we kind of lost a lot of wishlists,

354
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:58,826
which is unfortunate. And there's probably so many more other things that I have forgotten

355
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:03,788
when it comes to my failures, and I'm probably going to make a bunch more.

356
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:06,510
Who knows?

357
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,612
Cool, so now we're slowly going to the recap.

358
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:14,014
Thank you for being with me for this entire time.

359
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:16,236
As we kind of talked about, we want

360
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,577
to milk failure for all it has, because you

361
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,059
can learn a lot of valuable lessons from it

362
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,639
and not to be completely ashamed from it

363
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:24,781
and just try to bury it instead of learn from it.

364
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:31,528
Two is how to fail. There's a lot of accountability, insight, and development, and having fun that you can have with failure.

365
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:35,152
And third is lessons. Just learning our own limits and growing from it.

366
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:39,256
And again, because I think it's very important, leadership and culture matters in this.

367
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:43,791
Spotting big, painful, expensive failure is really easy,

368
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,254
but in many studios, any failure that can be hidden

369
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:49,476
is hidden as long as it's unlikely to cause

370
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,057
any immediate or obvious harm.

371
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:53,539
And the goal should be to surface those things early

372
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:55,741
before they mushroom into a disaster

373
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:59,603
or before you realize that, oh, like this failure

374
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:01,285
that you did would have been a really good

375
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,607
learning opportunity for you and the team possibly.

376
00:22:04,652 --> 00:22:08,073
I would love it if you would walk away from this, remember what mistakes you've made,

377
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:12,214
and see if you can pick them apart to see what happened and actively think about how

378
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,254
you've grown from it.

379
00:22:13,254 --> 00:22:17,655
And please feel free, again, to tweet at me if you do so.

380
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:23,917
For me, failure is really important, and I am always trying to fail sometimes because

381
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:27,618
failure means that you're playing at your upper limits and you're trying.

382
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:32,159
And any time you're trying is a really noble and positive thing to do.

383
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:38,755
So yeah, thank you so much for listening to my talk about failure. I hope you had fun. I hope

384
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:46,137
you like my cow metaphor and all that kind of stuff. You can find me on Twitter at the Vy Tran.

385
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:52,379
I'm also at Among Us Game, technically. And I have a website, victoriatran.com, where I put a lot of

386
00:22:52,379 --> 00:23:00,282
my talks and articles up there. And yeah, feel free to tweet at me, to talk to me, be in chat,

387
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:01,482
that sort of thing. Cool.
