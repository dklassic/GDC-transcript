1
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:19,387
Was it so very long ago, before I knew the dragon, that was in 1975, when I first encountered

2
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:22,069
the concept of a computer game.

3
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,652
That was a new concept to me.

4
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:29,156
For me the computer had always been a tool for scientific calculation.

5
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,077
And now...

6
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:39,466
The notion of using it to play, well, that was a fascinating and utterly unconventional concept to me.

7
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:42,908
And so, I decided to begin to acquaint myself with this technology.

8
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:48,629
I had no dream as yet. For me, the dragon still slept.

9
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,890
But, I wanted to learn.

10
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,371
And so, I set to work.

11
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:54,771
I, uh...

12
00:00:55,638 --> 00:01:00,820
Started programming a mainframe computer. That was technologically eons ago.

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,842
Fortran, Punched Car, JCL, IBM mainframes.

14
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:11,945
But in the life of one man, it's not that, but not so very long ago.

15
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:15,467
And in 1976, I got my first computer game running.

16
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,348
Strategy War Game on a hex grid.

17
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:23,028
And at the same time, I decided that I was going to get a microcomputer.

18
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:26,190
I wanted to own my own machine.

19
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,212
I wanted to understand this technology.

20
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:37,177
So I set to work teaching myself everything I could about TTL and power supply, LM309K

21
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:43,641
voltage regulators and 7476JK flip flops and the difference between a pantelum and an electrolytic

22
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:44,141
capacitor.

23
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:53,632
which end of the soldering iron gets tossed.

24
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:58,053
And then in January of 1977, I got my first computer.

25
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:04,114
A Kim 1 single board microcomputer with a 6502 processor, 1K of RAM, and I was set.

26
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:09,235
And you know, within one month, I had got that thing hooked up and running.

27
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:12,756
I had learned a code in 6502, machine code.

28
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:17,160
and I had written a game and gotten it working in 1K of RAM,

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,462
a little strategy war game on a hex grid.

30
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:23,603
And then I, like all microcomputer hobbyists,

31
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:27,585
I started expanding my system and expanding my game.

32
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:32,227
And then, in 1978, I bought my first appliance computer,

33
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:33,288
Commodore PET, 8K of RAM.

34
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:40,872
And in the same year, I sold my first commercial computer game.

35
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:43,042
That was in 1978, 15 years ago.

36
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,703
It's been a long time.

37
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:45,744
In 1979, I joined Atari.

38
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:49,966
Did a game on the video computer system.

39
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,787
Then I went to work on the Atari 800,

40
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:55,489
because this was the premier graphics and sound

41
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,031
machine of the industry.

42
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:03,454
The 800 was so far ahead of everything else,

43
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:06,295
it was the machine to learn on.

44
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:08,837
And I knew nothing about graphics and sound.

45
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:10,538
So I hurled myself in the machine.

46
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:16,557
absorbing everything I could, learning all about graphics and sound.

47
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:22,242
Some of you may find it ironic to learn that for a time there I was known as the graphics

48
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:22,703
wizard of Atari.

49
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:28,969
And indeed, there was a period of time there where my game, Eastern Front, was the most

50
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:33,553
graphically advanced product on the market today.

51
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:40,549
Because that was a phase I needed to go through. I needed to understand graphics and see flow.

52
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,690
I needed to feel that I had a good grip on it.

53
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,732
And so all through this period, from 1975 to 1981, for six years,

54
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:51,553
I was apprenticing myself to this technology.

55
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:54,694
I was turning it over and over in my hands.

56
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:57,255
I was getting the feel of it in my fingertips.

57
00:03:57,255 --> 00:04:01,056
And for six years, I had no dream at all.

58
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:02,737
All I did was learn.

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,341
By 1981, I felt that I understood the technology.

60
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:12,182
I felt that I knew what this medium was about.

61
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:13,002
But I had no dream.

62
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,463
I couldn't see the dragon.

63
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,983
But by 1981, I could hear him thrashing about in the forest.

64
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,724
I knew he was out there somewhere.

65
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:24,104
I knew he was big, whatever he was.

66
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:27,805
And I wanted to find him.

67
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:32,466
Then, in one of those fortuitous circumstances that is so perfectly timed,

68
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,974
that we can only ascribe its occurrence to the workings of faith.

69
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:40,276
Then, Alan Kay came into my life.

70
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:44,880
Alan had been hired at Atari to form a corporate research group.

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,205
And the first thing he did when he got to Atari was he asked around to see if there were any

72
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:55,970
angry young Turks who were possibly in danger of leaving the company.

73
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,893
And everything was pointed at him.

74
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:04,604
Okay, I'll take your job, Alan. So I went to work in corporate research.

75
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:11,225
And then Alan very carefully set about planning his division and starting to interview and hire other people.

76
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,466
But it was three months before he hired anyone else.

77
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:20,647
Which means that for three months I had Alan Kay all to myself.

78
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:25,689
This is the computer scientist's equivalent of being marooned on a desert island.

79
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:26,549
Maryland was rough.

80
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:30,530
Alan and I talked about all kinds of things.

81
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:33,628
And I learned so much from him.

82
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:43,897
You know, some of you may have noticed over the years that I tend to have a fairly generous

83
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:47,059
assessment of my own talents.

84
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:48,641
You don't have to laugh that loud.

85
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:55,606
And of course, the bondingly ungenerous assessments of other people's talents.

86
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,808
Let me tell you this.

87
00:05:57,808 --> 00:06:00,590
Alan Kay is so much smarter than I am.

88
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:04,106
I feel stupid when I'm talking to him.

89
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:08,969
I mean, most other people, when they think, they go in little tiny steps.

90
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,751
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

91
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:18,455
Alan doesn't work that way. He goes in big leaps.

92
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:18,575
A, J, M, R, Q.

93
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:26,539
Boy, if you want to keep up with Alan when he's talking, you've got to run along behind him, filling in the blanks.

94
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:27,199
B, C, D, E, F, G, H, A, K, L, M, N, O, P.

95
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,681
And it's hard for that to work.

96
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,860
I used to walk out of meetings with him saying,

97
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,601
Alan, I can't take it anymore.

98
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,822
I've got to go back to my office and stare at the wall

99
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:37,162
for a while.

100
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,364
So I learned a tremendous amount from Alan.

101
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:45,486
But you know, the tricky thing is, most of what I learned

102
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,167
were the blanks that I filled in.

103
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,249
And it's impossible to say whether the blanks that I

104
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:53,290
filled in were blanks that he intended for me to fill in

105
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,312
or blanks that just came from my own experience.

106
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,231
I learned from Alan was how to dream well.

107
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:12,532
You know, before I met Alan, I dreamed like most other people, and

108
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:17,373
most people dream in a very shoddy fashion, very lazy dreaming.

109
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:19,513
Good dreaming is hard work.

110
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:24,875
It takes energy and talent and experience, but mostly work.

111
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,115
And one way to understand dreams is to, uh,

112
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:31,556
to think of them as existing between two extremes,

113
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:33,317
fantasy and planning.

114
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:37,977
Fantasy is the free indulgence of human desire,

115
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:41,097
unconstrained by the crass limitations of reality.

116
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:46,118
Whereas planning exists entirely in the world of reality.

117
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:50,339
When we plan, we have a narrow objective that

118
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,800
we've already boiled our desires down to a specific objective,

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,861
and then we create a sequence of steps that will achieve that objective,

120
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:01,501
and it all lives and breathes the air of reality in us.

121
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:01,902
Dreaming!

122
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:10,526
Dreaming exists in the netherworld between easy fantasy and plodding planning.

123
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:17,270
Dreaming is an odd mixture, an integration of fantasy and planning.

124
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:25,656
To dream well, we must weave together the warp of fantasy with the warp of reality

125
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:28,438
to create a fabric that is strong.

126
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:31,660
That fabric, if we do it well, is a good dream.

127
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,020
A dream!

128
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:42,882
A fantasy spreads its wings and soars off into the cosmos where a plan plods along,

129
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:43,963
earthbound.

130
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:49,405
But a dream, a dream takes a running leap and jumps up as high as it can to catch a

131
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,266
handhold by which it can hoist itself up.

132
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:57,688
And that, that's hard because there are lots of people who can fantasize, and there are

133
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:00,990
lots of people who can dot I's and cross T's.

134
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:04,916
The people who can do both well at the same time.

135
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:13,139
People who can keep their eyes on the stars even as they walk without tripping across broken ground.

136
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,419
Such people are very rare.

137
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:15,259
And it takes work.

138
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:22,922
Another way of viewing dreaming is to think in terms of alternate realities.

139
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:26,243
There is, of course, reality. The real reality.

140
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:29,283
But when we fantasize, we create.

141
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,888
an imaginary, a desired universe.

142
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:37,952
But we don't care about whether the universe works, whether it's possible.

143
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:43,515
Only when we dream do we create a universe that is actually possible.

144
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:47,297
A dream universe is a desirable universe that is possible.

145
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:52,160
That means that we have to work out the ramifications of our fantasies.

146
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,163
We have to figure out the consequences and how everything fits together.

147
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:57,723
Oh, sure.

148
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:00,856
I can fantasize about Sally's Sex Bomb.

149
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:07,358
I can fantasize about what it would be like to go to bed with Sally's Sex Bomb,

150
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:10,459
but if I'm going to dream about Sally's Sex Bomb,

151
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:15,601
well then, I'm going to have to think about where we're going to live,

152
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:21,723
and maybe whether we're going to have children, and who's going to do the dishes.

153
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:23,663
That's part of the dream, too.

154
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:27,385
So, under Alan's coding, I set to work to dream about computer games.

155
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:27,645
What?

156
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:38,633
You know, most people, when they dream, they draw a sketch of the dragon, but they do it in pencil, and all they do is sketch out the barest outlines of the dragon.

157
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:45,755
Under Alan's coding, I had to fill in every detail, I had to see every scale, every eyelash.

158
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:52,538
I had to know what was inside the dragon, where the kidneys were, how big the lungs were, and what the skeletal structure was.

159
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:57,439
So it took me a year and a half just to hammer together my basic dream.

160
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:57,780
I worked...

161
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:01,825
As part of this, as an exercise, I wrote a book,

162
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:08,447
The Art of Computer Game Design, and that was really an exercise to help me dream more clearly.

163
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:10,228
By 1983, I had my dream.

164
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:14,790
I could see the dragon clearly in my mind's eye.

165
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,892
Let me tell you about my dream.

166
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:25,594
I dreamed of the day when computer games would be a viable medium of artistic expression,

167
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:26,715
an art form.

168
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:34,131
I mean the computer games encompassing the broad range of human experience and emotion.

169
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:37,774
Computer games about tragedy or self-sacrifice.

170
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:41,517
Games about duty and honor, patriotism.

171
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:47,282
Satirical games about politics or games about human folly.

172
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:50,945
Games about man's relationship to God or to nature.

173
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:54,548
Games about the passionate love between a boy and a girl.

174
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,849
or the serene and mature love between husband and wife of decades.

175
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:03,690
Games about family relationships or death, mortality,

176
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,352
a boy becoming a man or a man realizing he is no longer young.

177
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:11,673
Games about a man facing truth at high noon on a dusty main street,

178
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:16,595
or a boy and his dog, or a prostitute with a heart of gold.

179
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:21,436
All of these things and more were part of this dream.

180
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:21,717
But...

181
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,211
By themselves they amounted to nothing.

182
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:29,232
Because all of these things have already been done by other art forms.

183
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,832
There's no advantage, no purchase, no...

184
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:35,313
nothing superior about this dream, it's just an old rehash.

185
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:43,175
All we are doing with the computer, if all we do is just reinvent the wheel with poor grade materials,

186
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,975
well, we don't have a dream worth pursuing.

187
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:50,899
But there was a second part to this dream that catapulted it into the stratosphere.

188
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:55,764
The second part is what made this dream important and worthy.

189
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:58,246
That is interactivity.

190
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:04,492
Let me explain to you why interactivity is so overwhelmingly important.

191
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,896
Let me talk about the human brain.

192
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:11,659
You know, our minds are not...

193
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:15,374
passive receptacles, they are active agents.

194
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,615
It's not as if we have a button on the side of our head,

195
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:19,956
and they come along and push the button,

196
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:21,476
and the top of our head flips open,

197
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:23,797
and then they take a picture full of knowledge

198
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:24,977
and pour it into our skull.

199
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:26,217
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

200
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:29,518
And then they close the top of our head and shake well

201
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,439
and say, congratulations, you're educated now.

202
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:33,899
It doesn't work that way.

203
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,140
How does a little boy learn about butterflies?

204
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,201
Does he read a big, thick book about butterflies?

205
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,182
No. He catches one, tears its wings off.

206
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:48,104
Ah, look! Lots of green stuff coming out of his body.

207
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:51,165
I wonder what it tastes like!

208
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,106
That's how they learn!

209
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:57,628
And this isn't some gross characteristic of little boys only.

210
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:02,470
The only difference between us and them is we've learned to hide that.

211
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:07,397
This is fundamental to our nature. It's wired into our brains.

212
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:10,218
And if you really want to understand that concept,

213
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:13,358
sometime you ought to watch a couple of kittens at play.

214
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:16,439
Here are these two kittens here.

215
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,640
What do they do? Well, one of them sees a little bug.

216
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,301
So he decides to follow that bug all through the house.

217
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:28,483
The second kitten, well he sees the first kitten and he gets an idea.

218
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:32,004
What does he do? Well, he gets down low.

219
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:35,697
holds his ears down flat so it'll be harder to see.

220
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:38,880
And then he creeps forward stealthily until he gets close enough,

221
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,684
and then he gets ready, and then he pounces on the kitten! Ha-ha!

222
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:46,926
And he kicky-kicky-kicks, and he clawy-clawy-claws, and he bitey-bitey-bites!

223
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:51,470
And the two kittens roll around on the floor, and we all laugh!

224
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,392
We say, kittens are having fun!

225
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:57,535
Kittens do nothing but play all day long!

226
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,177
Kittens don't have a care in the world!

227
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:03,722
and we would be wrong.

228
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:08,143
Because, you see, those kittens are not goofing off.

229
00:15:08,143 --> 00:15:11,964
They're engaged in some very serious business.

230
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:16,065
To understand the nature of this business,

231
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:19,265
you need merely ask yourself the question,

232
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,926
what is the job description of an adult cat?

233
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:25,907
Well, here's the adult cat standing in the house,

234
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:28,827
just keeping an eye on things,

235
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,568
when all of a sudden, he's seen.

236
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:34,346
A mouse.

237
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:37,268
And what does he do?

238
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,649
Well, he gets down low.

239
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,231
And he folds his ears down flat so it'll be harder to see.

240
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:47,634
And then he creeps forward stealthily until he gets close enough.

241
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:50,335
And then he gets ready and then he pounces on the mouse. Ha ha!

242
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:57,259
And he kicky kicky kicks and he clawy clawy clawss and he bitey bitey bites.

243
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,260
And that's how adult cats earn their living.

244
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,680
So you can see.

245
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,261
Except at my house.

246
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:00,841
Ha ha ha!

247
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:01,721
So you can see.

248
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:06,685
kittens are not wasting their time in idle entertainment.

249
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:09,247
They're engaged in job training.

250
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:11,428
This is serious business for them.

251
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,110
You don't see a bunch of kittens lined up in nice, neat rows

252
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,992
with some old geezer of a cat standing at a chalkboard

253
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:26,837
drawing anachronical diagrams of mice with approach angles and attack vectors.

254
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:27,978
They don't do it that way.

255
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:33,455
All the higher mammals learn by playing, by doing, by interacting.

256
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:41,061
And indeed, the higher the mammal, the more of its life it spends in play to prepare itself for adulthood.

257
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:47,286
So you can see, this active role of the mind is fundamental to the way we think.

258
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:48,908
It's wired into our brain.

259
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:04,230
Suppose after this lecture I go down to the lunchroom and I eat the orange hamburger,

260
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,292
and it makes me sick, and I come back to you and say,

261
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,894
hey, don't eat the orange hamburger, it's going to make you sick.

262
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:15,856
Well, that way you've learned something without ever having to get sick, and that's good.

263
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:20,499
And in fact, most of the things that you know, most of the facts in your mind,

264
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:23,721
are things that you learned from other people.

265
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:29,126
So language is a way of allowing one person to learn from many different people.

266
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:32,609
But you know, we've also learned to turn that concept around,

267
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:37,873
to use language as a way of allowing one person to teach many people.

268
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:39,995
This is the concept of mass media.

269
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:44,139
And in fact, by mass media I don't mean just radio and television.

270
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:50,505
Mass media goes back 100,000 years to a circle of people sitting around a fire with one guy telling a story.

271
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:57,683
This lecture is mass media. Look, right now, I'm teaching 200 people.

272
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:01,865
Think about how tremendously efficient that is.

273
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:07,649
That's really an enormous improvement in the efficiency of a single conversation.

274
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:14,553
However, we've learned over the years that there's a responsibility associated with this.

275
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,434
That is, if I'm going to give you guys this lecture,

276
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:19,896
I'm going to take up all of your time.

277
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,400
It is incumbent upon me to do a good job.

278
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,121
I better prepare this lecture carefully.

279
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:29,842
I better outline it, plan it, and rehearse it over and over

280
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,303
until I have a lecture that is worthy of all of your time.

281
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:35,403
So there's a real responsibility here.

282
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:38,784
In fact, over the years, we have also

283
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,025
learned that if you run with that responsibility,

284
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:46,926
you do a really good job, why, lots and lots of people

285
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,906
will want to hear about your communication.

286
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:49,247
For example.

287
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,624
Suppose this lecture was a really fantastic lecture.

288
00:18:55,624 --> 00:19:01,648
Suppose I prepared it and I had special effects of a spaceship shooting across behind me,

289
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:07,232
all sorts of fabulous things going on, and this lecture was just so great, so wonderful,

290
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:10,515
the after was over, y'all went running out into the hall saying,

291
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:13,157
Hallelujah! Brother Crawford has chosen a wife!

292
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,438
And everybody wanted to know...

293
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:25,895
Lecture videotapes, and everybody wanted to buy Chris Crawford Lecture audio tapes, Chris Crawford Lecture t-shirts, coffee mugs, tea tins, yes!

294
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:28,177
But, uh, I'm not that good.

295
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:33,681
I think I'll have to scratch the t-shirts and coffee mugs.

296
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:38,385
But, uh, the principle remains the same.

297
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:43,969
And in fact, this is the genesis of art.

298
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,223
Because art really is just a way of communicating ideas.

299
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:52,785
For example, consider Michelangelo's statue,

300
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:55,767
the Pietà, showing Mother Mary holding

301
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,189
the crucified body of her son.

302
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:03,272
This tells you something about the nature of motherly love.

303
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:07,554
And Michelangelo invested so much talent into that statue,

304
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,175
so much energy and so much time.

305
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:15,250
that the result conveys to you, the audience, its message of motherly love

306
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,351
with tremendous power, it is compelling, it is clear, it is powerful

307
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:24,912
and because of these things it is so great that we call it beautiful.

308
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:30,934
That is the spring, that is how art comes about.

309
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:37,515
However, we have also learned over the years that the responsibility works both ways.

310
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,336
This is a two-way street, honey.

311
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:41,687
You don't get off scot-free.

312
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:43,267
You have a responsibility too.

313
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:46,288
Your responsibility is not to mess up my beautiful speech!

314
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,909
I mean, if I was all of trouble to prepare this damn thing,

315
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,790
you better not disrupt it!

316
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,410
So don't get up and move around.

317
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,871
Don't, don't, uh, wrestle your papers and drop them on the floor.

318
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:01,753
Don't stomp your feet. Don't crack your knuckles.

319
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:06,714
Don't pounce. Don't fart. Don't do nothin'!

320
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,215
Just get there! Quietly! Passively!

321
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:08,415
Prepare!

322
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:15,305
Didn't I just say, uh, I think it was about here somewhere.

323
00:21:15,305 --> 00:21:24,509
Didn't I say something about the human mind being an active agent, not a passive receptacle?

324
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:24,969
What gives?

325
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:30,351
I mean, here we have the march of civilization, every day and every night, and it gets better

326
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:31,191
and better.

327
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:35,513
And the grand culmination of this glorious march is the creation of art.

328
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:42,515
in a passive role, which we have just shown to be fundamentally in conflict with the basic

329
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:45,276
structure of the human mind.

330
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:46,657
What gives?

331
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:53,420
Well, maybe I can illuminate the nature of this contradiction a little with an imaginary

332
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,081
alternative.

333
00:21:54,081 --> 00:22:00,284
Suppose, suppose I were to, instead of giving this lecture, suppose I were to take each

334
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:01,884
of you one at a time.

335
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:03,925
We'll start with you, David.

336
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,091
and you and I would go off to a little group together

337
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:09,673
and we would have a conversation instead of a lecture

338
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:13,315
an interactive conversation instead of an expository lecture

339
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,516
and so I would start saying something about my dreams

340
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:16,997
and then you might ask a question

341
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:19,158
and then I'd answer your question

342
00:22:19,158 --> 00:22:21,299
and then you might have another question

343
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,900
I'd answer that and then you'd start to argue with me

344
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,760
and I'd argue back

345
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,741
and we'd go back and forth and back and forth

346
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:26,682
and we would interact

347
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:30,704
and that would be a lot different, wouldn't it?

348
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:30,964
Because...

349
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:38,185
You'd be a lot more active. You wouldn't be sitting there on your back, but you'd be doing something.

350
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:44,189
The juices would be flowing, the wheels would be turning, your mind would be going a mile a minute.

351
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:46,771
You'd learn a lot more, wouldn't you?

352
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:52,455
Yeah, and from my point of view, I would convey my message a lot more effectively, wouldn't I?

353
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,358
But the problem is, there's 200 of you and there's only one of me.

354
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:59,780
And if I were to use that method, I'd be here forever!

355
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:06,411
So, the lecture method is a lot more efficient than the conversation method.

356
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:10,874
And that's the basic problem we face.

357
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:18,939
The interactive conversation is effective, but the expository lecture is efficient.

358
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,139
That's the trade-off we make.

359
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:24,862
And over the centuries, we humans have learned that the gains in efficiency

360
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:27,664
outweigh the losses in effectiveness.

361
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,661
And therefore we choose expository methods.

362
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,702
But the sacrifice remains real.

363
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:37,623
We haven't ever solved that problem.

364
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:40,863
It's been with us since the beginning of history.

365
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:43,144
Every single artist has faced it.

366
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:48,725
Every communicator, every teacher, every novelist, every sculptor, every singer, every musician, every painter,

367
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:53,267
every novelist, every single artist, through all of human history.

368
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:59,981
has been forced to sacrifice effectiveness for efficiency.

369
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,422
Until now.

370
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:05,526
Because now we have a technology that changes everything.

371
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:11,471
With the computer, I can take my ideas that I want to communicate,

372
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:14,693
I can express them in the form of an algorithm.

373
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:20,378
Then I can take that algorithm and I can write it up as program code.

374
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:22,140
And then I can put that program code

375
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:27,839
onto a floppy disk, and then we can mass produce that floppy disk.

376
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,943
We can make millions of copies of it, spread it all over the world, so that millions of people can play my game.

377
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:37,165
They can interact with my ideas.

378
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:41,148
And because they are interacting, I achieve effectiveness.

379
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:47,172
And because we are mass producing the disks, I achieve efficiency.

380
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:51,935
That, that is the revolutionary nature of the computer.

381
00:24:52,382 --> 00:25:00,169
It allows us to automate interactivity to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency.

382
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:04,514
That was the most important part of my dream.

383
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:10,279
And so, in 1983, I set about the long task of realizing that dream.

384
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:14,283
And of course, any truly worthy dream...

385
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:19,087
cannot be realized in a year or two or five.

386
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:22,009
A truly good dream needs a lifetime to be realized.

387
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:26,272
But that didn't stop me from at least identifying

388
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,473
the fundamental problems that had to be solved

389
00:25:29,473 --> 00:25:32,775
and the very first problem that required my treatment.

390
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:34,816
The very, the biggest problem we face here

391
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:37,958
is the lack of people in our games.

392
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,540
Have you ever noticed computer games,

393
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,821
all of our games are about things, not people?

394
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:50,300
We shoot things. We chase things. Things shoot us. Things chase us.

395
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:57,826
We manipulate things, maneuver things, allocate things, manage things, but it's always BANG! BANG! BANG!

396
00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:00,488
There are never any people in any of our games.

397
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:01,489
No, sure, I've...

398
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:07,753
I've seen the pitiful excuses for characters in our games, and their fates.

399
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:10,115
They are Potemkin villages.

400
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:12,317
That the characters in our games...

401
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:20,391
Or like a cardboard box with a picture of a face pasted onto the front, but nothing inside.

402
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,912
There's no heart and soul in them.

403
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:24,714
All they have are a couple of buttons on front.

404
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:27,716
You push one button and he says,

405
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:29,798
I am your friend now.

406
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,560
And you push the other button and he says,

407
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,302
I am your enemy now.

408
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:40,359
that the characters we have in our games have as much to do with real characters

409
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:45,701
as an inflatable doll has to do with sex!

410
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:49,183
That may be good enough for most people!

411
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:50,684
That's not good enough for me!

412
00:26:50,684 --> 00:26:56,567
If we want real characters in our game, there are three

413
00:26:56,567 --> 00:27:00,849
fundamental technological hurdles that we must jump. First...

414
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:05,938
The technology of human facial expression.

415
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:09,780
We've got to be able to show people's faces, emoting.

416
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,921
We've got to show our characters laughing and smiling and crying,

417
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:23,085
looking frightened and skeptical and suspicious and greedy and lustful and romantic.

418
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:28,207
We've got to have a library of a hundred different facial expressions,

419
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,888
each of which can be put onto the face of any member of our cast.

420
00:27:30,888 --> 00:27:31,748
You can't do that yet, can you?

421
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:32,088
I can.

422
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:32,288
I can.

423
00:27:32,288 --> 00:27:32,368
I can.

424
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,492
The second thing we need is artificial personality.

425
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:39,373
The algorithms of human behavior.

426
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:45,315
We need equations that show how people feel, how they behave, how they react to different situations.

427
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,476
And we need this on a gigantic scale.

428
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:55,039
We need to be able to handle hundreds upon hundreds of different behaviors

429
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,060
with thousands of different equations.

430
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,221
You can't do that yet, can you?

431
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,461
I have.

432
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:01,202
And lastly...

433
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:04,650
We need a language of emotional expression.

434
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:11,195
We need to allow our players to interact with the characters in an emotionally significant fashion.

435
00:28:11,195 --> 00:28:22,545
It's not good enough to be able to stab them or shoot them or take something away from them or give something to them or talk to them about where the princess is.

436
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:24,046
That's not good enough.

437
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:29,430
We've got to be able to talk about feelings and emotionally significant events.

438
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,991
You can't do that yet, can you?

439
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:31,212
Yes.

440
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:40,977
I have. And I don't say these things to boast, I say them to point out how long I've been working on it and how long the path in front of you is.

441
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:45,180
I've been working on this stuff for ten years, you've got a lot of catch-up to do.

442
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,803
My very first interpersonal relationships game, Gossip, was published in 1983.

443
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:57,688
It had human facial expressions, artificial personality, and a language of emotional expression.

444
00:28:57,688 --> 00:28:59,870
It was primitive, but you know...

445
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:05,106
that this industry still hasn't published anything as good as gossip?

446
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:06,147
That's pretty sad.

447
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:09,629
Well, I continued to advance my work on it,

448
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:14,472
on a very opportunistic basis, trying different approaches,

449
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:18,895
successes and failures. It was a very herky-jerky development path I followed.

450
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:24,158
In 1987, I published a game called Trust and Betrayal, Legacy of Seabootin',

451
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:25,799
and that one was a commercial failure.

452
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:28,708
At the time, I blamed it on my own failings.

453
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:31,569
I thought, well, you know, I'm still learning this stuff.

454
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,850
This is, I was way out on a limb.

455
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,010
I thought that the fault was all mine.

456
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:40,172
What I didn't understand was that I was really up against some fundamental forces

457
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,713
that work in the industry, forces that I didn't understand at all.

458
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:47,655
But in 1990, something else happened that served as the kick in the side of the head

459
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:48,535
that woke me up.

460
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:52,617
And that was the reaction to my game, Balance of the Planet.

461
00:29:54,125 --> 00:30:00,087
When I set out to do Balance of the Planet, I wanted to do a game about environmental policy.

462
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:04,389
But I wanted to do a game that had some honesty in it, some integrity.

463
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:08,131
I didn't want to do dolphin dancing across the screen.

464
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:11,592
I didn't want to do Zork dressed up in Greenpeace clothing.

465
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:17,675
I wanted a game that honestly addressed environmental policy issues.

466
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:22,937
And that, that was a pretty tough problem, but I was very proud of the approach that I, uh...

467
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:27,865
came up with. The solution I came up with was a pretty good one.

468
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:32,507
It really did address those issues and in fact, Bounds to the Planet remains

469
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:36,610
the best way to learn about environmental policy trade-offs.

470
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,831
It's better than any book or television show or video tape.

471
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:45,715
You really want to understand it. That's the best way. So boy was I proud of that product.

472
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:50,497
And so I was really stunned when the industry rejected it.

473
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:50,878
Pretty widely.

474
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:59,264
Distributors, retailers, customers, press, game designers too, pretty much rejected this game.

475
00:30:59,264 --> 00:31:03,226
They turned thumbs down. No good.

476
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:10,989
Perhaps the, I think the overall reaction of the industry was best summarized in a review of the game

477
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:14,571
written by some fellow at Computer Gaming World.

478
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:17,432
Let me just read it to you.

479
00:31:17,432 --> 00:31:19,553
He said, regarding Balance of the Planet,

480
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:20,653
it is the closest thing to art.

481
00:31:21,321 --> 00:31:23,923
told as computer entertainment.

482
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,905
But it's just not fun!

483
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:29,969
Therefore, the game is not fun.

484
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:35,494
It simply wouldn't be right to ignore it.

485
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:40,438
A more explicit rejection of my dream cannot be imagined.

486
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:45,322
Here they are saying, yes, it's art!

487
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:46,663
But it's not fun!

488
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,045
Therefore, now.

489
00:31:54,503 --> 00:31:56,864
It kept me up with nightmares for three nights.

490
00:31:56,864 --> 00:32:00,665
But, gosh, well, it's just not fun!

491
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:03,145
I mean, can't we get a few belly laughs in there?

492
00:32:03,145 --> 00:32:07,086
Maybe we can have the best teleview mother-in-law jokes to invite.

493
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:12,267
Yeah, and you, Mr. Beethoven, your ninth symphony,

494
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:19,528
oh, it makes my heart soar in awe at the majesty of the cosmos.

495
00:32:19,528 --> 00:32:21,748
But, you know, it's just not fun.

496
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:24,318
I mean, we need something we can dance to!

497
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:29,041
We need some cute, catchy little tunes we can snap our fingers to!

498
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,462
Ehhh...

499
00:32:31,462 --> 00:32:32,542
What can I do?

500
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,763
At first, I fought it.

501
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:36,904
I just couldn't believe it. I was furious.

502
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:40,126
I fought back. But then...

503
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:45,348
Then I realized that this was not really attributable to any fundamental...

504
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,850
to the obtuseness of individuals.

505
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,381
No, no, this was a fundamental force.

506
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:54,323
This was the marketplace at work.

507
00:32:54,323 --> 00:32:56,524
Let me explain to you what was going on,

508
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:59,166
what is still going on in our industry.

509
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,687
Think in terms of a scale of difficulty,

510
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:06,069
with simple games at the bottom and hard games at the top.

511
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:09,091
But the scale applies to people as well,

512
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:12,132
with inexperienced people at the bottom

513
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:14,233
and very expert game players at the top.

514
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:17,735
Now, any given day falls.

515
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:21,339
somewhere on this scale, but it doesn't fall at a single point.

516
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:27,040
It actually has a window. There's the lower level of difficulty and the upper

517
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,601
level of difficulty. And when you first start playing a game,

518
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:34,202
you normally start off below the lower level. And what happens?

519
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:38,263
You get stunked! The game clobbers you and you lose.

520
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:42,083
But no problem, you come back and try again and you learn.

521
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:45,424
You get better. So you start climbing the ladder.

522
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:52,107
And as you climb the ladder, pretty soon you climb above the lower level of difficulty and you climb into the fun zone.

523
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:55,208
Where the game is challenging and interesting and fun.

524
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,930
But you keep playing and so you keep learning.

525
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,931
You keep climbing the ladder.

526
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:03,532
As you do, the day comes when you climb above the upper level.

527
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:06,474
Now the game is too easy to beat.

528
00:34:06,474 --> 00:34:07,954
It's boring.

529
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:10,976
You don't play it anymore, you put it aside.

530
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:12,397
And then what do you do?

531
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:14,498
Well, you buy another game.

532
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:19,217
But this game is going to be a little more difficult than the previous one.

533
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:21,419
It's going to be higher up on the scale.

534
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:24,242
And so you'll climb up through that game and put it aside and buy another game.

535
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:25,403
And another! And another!

536
00:34:25,403 --> 00:34:28,966
And you're going to just climb right up that ladder, improving your expertise.

537
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:32,569
And the result is something I call games literacy.

538
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:34,892
And it really depends on the genre.

539
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:35,392
For example...

540
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,657
I'm really literate when it comes to flight simulators.

541
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:40,738
I've played a lot of these.

542
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:43,359
And so, when I got Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe,

543
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,001
I took that thing, plugged it in, fired it up,

544
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,504
and within five minutes, I was shooting down T-51s.

545
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,786
But, uh, when it comes to graphic adventures,

546
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:56,409
uh, I, every year or two, I get the latest graphic adventure.

547
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,651
I plug it in, fire it up, and within five minutes,

548
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:01,573
I'm bashing my head against the brick walls,

549
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:03,054
stumped and frustrated.

550
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:05,175
I mean, I'm so bad at this.

551
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:09,345
I have to call up Brian Moriarty and get hints for the LUL!

552
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:15,951
But we all have different literacies.

553
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:20,655
And so, think about the population of people out there.

554
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:24,018
It's divided into three groups.

555
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:30,048
At the very bottom of the scale are the millions of personal computer owners who are not literate.

556
00:35:30,048 --> 00:35:33,409
They don't play games very often, so they're way down at the bottom.

557
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:37,871
Then there's a very small group of people climbing the ladder at any given time.

558
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:45,595
And then at the top of the ladder, there are the aficionados, the experts, the people who play the games a lot.

559
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:48,496
There are a few hundred thousand of these people.

560
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,817
Now, simple question.

561
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:53,738
If you're a developer or a publisher...

562
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,030
or a distributor, or a retailer, which of these three groups do you want to sell to?

563
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:05,587
And the only possible answer is group number three, the aficionados.

564
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:08,348
Why? Because they're so easy to sell to.

565
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:11,630
They're connected. They read all the magazines.

566
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,270
They're on the electronic networks.

567
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,911
They all have a big circle of friends.

568
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,352
They're always talking about the latest, greatest games.

569
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:19,493
They hang around the stores all the time,

570
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:22,054
and they spend money. These people buy games a lot.

571
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,335
And so they're easy to sell to.

572
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:26,877
I mean, best proof of how easy they are,

573
00:36:26,877 --> 00:36:29,538
look at the success of Wolfenstein 3D.

574
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:34,096
Here's a game with zero formal marketing, and everybody's talking about it.

575
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:36,237
How did they find out about it?

576
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,899
The network, the connections.

577
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:43,002
Everybody here in this group knows about Wolfenstein 3D.

578
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:47,705
That's the proof of just how powerful this group really is.

579
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:52,208
By contrast, how do you sell to the people at the bottom end of this tale?

580
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,829
How can you even tell them that your game exists?

581
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:56,050
Advertise on nightly news?

582
00:36:56,354 --> 00:37:01,495
I mean, these people don't read any of the regular magazines, they don't log on to CompuServe every 35 minutes.

583
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:02,915
They just... you know, they're...

584
00:37:02,915 --> 00:37:14,397
These people, the way they buy games, they wander into the computer store once a year to get a new ribbon for their dot matrix printer.

585
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:19,798
They get lost in the store, and they bumble into the games section.

586
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:23,139
And they say, oh gosh, computer games, that's right.

587
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:26,200
You know, I haven't played a game in, uh, two years.

588
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:31,868
Maybe I ought to buy one. Let's see.

589
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:33,229
Oh look, here's a pretty box.

590
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:33,869
Harpoon!

591
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:34,370
Oh that's...

592
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,831
I think I'll buy it.

593
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:38,453
I'll bet it's about whales.

594
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:41,395
How do you sell to these people?

595
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:43,817
You know, and these people here,

596
00:37:43,817 --> 00:37:48,180
these are the ones to sell to because

597
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,702
they tell you what they want.

598
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:51,816
I mean, it's really...

599
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,658
Designing for the bottom crowd, it's hit or miss.

600
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:56,279
You spend a half a million dollars on a game,

601
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:58,481
you put it out there, if they don't like it,

602
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:00,302
they won't even tell you they don't like it,

603
00:38:00,302 --> 00:38:01,122
they just won't buy it.

604
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:04,345
But these people, boy, try to stop them from telling you.

605
00:38:04,345 --> 00:38:05,465
They'll send you letters,

606
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:08,287
they'll fill out the feedback form,

607
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:08,828
send you email,

608
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,250
they'll call you up in the middle of the night

609
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,332
to tell you what's wrong with your game

610
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:15,252
and how to make it better.

611
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:19,575
These people, boy, it's easy to figure out what they want.

612
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:22,200
And what do they want?

613
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,161
They want more depth.

614
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:29,825
Yeah, they've invested a lot of money and a lot of time climbing that ladder.

615
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:31,926
And they don't want to throw away that investment.

616
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:34,827
They don't want to start all over on a new ladder.

617
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,488
They want to keep climbing the ladder.

618
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:38,029
They want to go higher and higher.

619
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:39,470
They want more depth in their game.

620
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,012
And think about how that compares to my dream.

621
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:48,675
Because I want to encompass the broad range of human experience and emotion.

622
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:49,295
What I want...

623
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:54,787
Brett, what the customers want is debt.

624
00:38:54,787 --> 00:38:59,268
I am at cross purposes with my audience.

625
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:03,149
And there's only one conclusion I can draw.

626
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:05,269
I have to leave. I don't fit in here anymore.

627
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:10,311
Now, I realize that's, uh, that's kind of strange.

628
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:16,292
But, you know, many years ago, I left the crowded cities of the eastern seaboard and...

629
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:22,986
I crossed the Appalachian Mountains and came upon the virgin forests of Kentucky.

630
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:27,208
There I built myself a cabin and I hunted the dragon.

631
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,528
I wasn't very good back then.

632
00:39:29,528 --> 00:39:31,789
I only bumped into him at night by chance.

633
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:35,750
And my encounters with him were brief and desperate.

634
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:40,851
I'd wave my sword frantically and hear his claws hissing through the air.

635
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:43,132
And then he would be gone.

636
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,293
I was learning.

637
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:45,773
It was fun.

638
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:50,061
More people came.

639
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:53,363
They, uh, were hardy pioneers, and they built cabins near mine.

640
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:56,206
And pretty soon, we had a lot of cabins.

641
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:59,448
Pretty soon, we had a village there, with lots of houses.

642
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:02,631
And then more people came until now.

643
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:08,055
Now we have a town with stores and people being busy

644
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:13,520
and streets and property lines and lawyers and...

645
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,023
This place has gotten too damn civilized for me.

646
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:17,223
I mean...

647
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:25,628
I just don't fit in, so I hoist my backpack onto my shoulders.

648
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:28,648
I walk down the main street one last time.

649
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:33,610
I wave goodbye to a few old friends, but most of the faces I see belong to strangers.

650
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:39,491
They look askance at me and turn to their neighbor and say,

651
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:41,491
Who is that scruffy old tramp anyway?

652
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:44,312
I'm glad he's leaving town.

653
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:47,433
We don't need his kind in our town.

654
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:49,653
At the edge of town I...

655
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:53,537
Turn and look back one last time.

656
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,198
It's a good town.

657
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:57,920
I'm proud of the role I played in its creation.

658
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:06,666
But out there, to the west, beyond the Mississippi, beyond the Great Plains away, the Rocky Mountains,

659
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:10,609
there are no people there.

660
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:16,494
Just rocks, trees, clear blue sky, and a dragon.

661
00:41:16,494 --> 00:41:18,335
He is there, waiting for you.

662
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:24,305
I can hear you saying, Chris, this is crazy.

663
00:41:24,305 --> 00:41:26,186
You don't want to leave all this behind.

664
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:29,187
You've got too much invested here.

665
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,567
This is insanity.

666
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:33,768
And you know, you're right.

667
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:34,008
This is crazy.

668
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:37,730
But let me tell you about another crazy old fool.

669
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:45,552
I'll tell you about a guy by the name of Don Quixote de la Mancha.

670
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:46,653
You know.

671
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,622
insanity is an inability to come to terms with reality.

672
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:55,943
Don Quixote was definitely insane because

673
00:41:55,943 --> 00:41:57,663
he couldn't come to terms.

674
00:41:57,663 --> 00:41:59,844
But there was a reason.

675
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:03,545
The reality in which Don Quixote lived

676
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:05,645
was a sordid and ugly reality.

677
00:42:05,645 --> 00:42:09,026
The people were scrabbling for survival.

678
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,127
Don Quixote didn't want that.

679
00:42:12,127 --> 00:42:14,328
He wanted to live in a world

680
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:16,348
where there was truth and human dignity.

681
00:42:16,348 --> 00:42:16,868
And yes, love.

682
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:22,478
And try as he might, he couldn't accommodate that to the real world.

683
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:27,160
Other people were able to compromise enough to reach an accommodation.

684
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,021
But Don Quixote, for him, the gap was too great.

685
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:32,482
He couldn't bridge it.

686
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:37,464
And so instead of giving up on it, he imposed his reality onto the real world.

687
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:43,926
Where other people saw a filthy country hostel, he saw a castle.

688
00:42:43,926 --> 00:42:45,947
Where other people saw a flock of sheep...

689
00:42:46,328 --> 00:42:48,850
He saw a mighty army!

690
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:54,794
Where other people saw a windmill, he saw a dragon.

691
00:42:54,794 --> 00:42:54,854
Yes.

692
00:42:54,854 --> 00:43:00,399
Don Quixote was a crazy old fool.

693
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:06,083
But you know, he was more honest about his dreams than most people.

694
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,505
And for that, I honor him.

695
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:13,028
So, time has come for me to make my commitment.

696
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:20,844
I am, I am, I have committed myself, I have dedicated myself to the pursuit of the dragon.

697
00:43:20,844 --> 00:43:28,786
And having made that commit, having, having decided that once and for all, now all of a sudden, I can see him.

698
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:32,487
There he is, right in front of me, as clear as day.

699
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:38,029
I never thought that, that I would see you this clearly.

700
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:42,590
I, I always saw you with brief glimpses in the dark.

701
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,090
But now...

702
00:43:44,043 --> 00:43:49,646
Now, you're so much bigger than I'd ever imagined.

703
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:53,547
And I'm not so sure I like this.

704
00:43:53,547 --> 00:44:00,310
I mean, yes, you're glorious and beautiful, but you're ugly, too.

705
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,711
Your breath breathes of death.

706
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:07,713
No, I never had any childish fantasies of conquering you.

707
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:11,574
That thinking is for children. You are beyond that.

708
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:16,868
Indeed, I can see stretched around your feet the bodies of my predecessors,

709
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:23,031
and all you have to show for it is a few nicks and scratches.

710
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:25,592
But... do you have to laugh at me that way?

711
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:31,575
Am I- am I so pitiful that- that you can sneer in my face like that?

712
00:44:31,575 --> 00:44:33,756
Yes! Yes, you frighten me!

713
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:34,397
You hurt me!

714
00:44:34,397 --> 00:44:38,098
I felt your claws dripping through my soul!

715
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,123
But I'm going to die someday, and before I can do that, I've got to face you eyeball to eyeball!

716
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:52,646
I've got to look you right in the eye and see what's inside!

717
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:55,667
But I'm not good enough to do that yet! I'm not experienced enough!

718
00:44:55,667 --> 00:45:03,911
So I'm going to have to start learning today! Here! Now!

719
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:07,873
Come, dragon! I will fight you!

720
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:08,173
TURN YOUR FACE!

721
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:11,860
I saw!

722
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,221
For truth!

723
00:45:13,221 --> 00:45:20,527
For beauty!

724
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:23,810
For art!

725
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:28,695
Charge!

726
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:02,139
I don't know.
