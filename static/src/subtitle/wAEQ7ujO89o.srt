1
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:07,118
Hello, that's nice.

2
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:09,939
It's like a little friendly group of us.

3
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:11,120
You're gonna get to hang out right now.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,161
How is everybody doing?

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,541
It's the end of a long week.

6
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:19,043
It's good to hear.

7
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:20,083
Thank you for being here

8
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:22,464
and not either at the experimental gameplay workshop

9
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:25,085
or face down in a bucket of margaritas,

10
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:27,286
which is where I intend to be in,

11
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:29,787
you know, 68 minutes or something.

12
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:34,928
Selling my soul.

13
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:37,454
That's why we're here.

14
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:42,919
This is a slightly different from any talk I've given before.

15
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:47,622
The nice folk at GDC got in touch earlier in the year and said,

16
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:51,806
would you be interested in giving a talk about what it's been like going from

17
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:55,489
kind of deep art house indie to commercial free-to-play,

18
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:57,691
which is the change that I've made over the last couple of years.

19
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,113
And I thought it sounded great.

20
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,334
It's interesting, there's been, you know...

21
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:05,238
I've learned a lot in the course of doing that.

22
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,120
Would be fun to share some of those conclusions

23
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:09,081
with you guys.

24
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:12,925
But then I realized that really what that talk added up to

25
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:16,488
was something a little bit less palatable

26
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:18,009
because there's no way of,

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,491
there's certainly no way of talking truthfully

28
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:22,733
about how I got from there to here

29
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:24,034
and what that journey has been like

30
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:27,137
without exposing the realities

31
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:29,599
of some of the bumps along the way.

32
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:29,659
So,

33
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:34,923
I'm Margaret, and you're about to discover more

34
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:35,944
about my career and my life

35
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:37,485
than you were perhaps bargaining for.

36
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,267
So let's start out by kind of giving you your bearings a bit

37
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:42,069
in terms of how that journey stacks up.

38
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,132
So I think what was in people's minds

39
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:48,774
when they were asking me to do this talk

40
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,275
was the time that I spent at Hide and Seek.

41
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:55,419
Hide and Seek was a experimental game studio

42
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,259
founded in London.

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,481
We branched out and had a New York studio

44
00:01:58,641 --> 00:01:59,662
that I moved over and ran.

45
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:03,486
And we were kind of best known for very hybrid games.

46
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,648
So often that meant digital worlds with a,

47
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:07,450
digital games with a real world component

48
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,513
or collaborations between digital game makers

49
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:12,495
and artists or choreographers,

50
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,638
kind of all points in between.

51
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:17,841
So here's a super quick survey of some of our projects

52
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:18,562
that people may have heard of.

53
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:27,670
Board game remix kit was an early independent project that we did that we designed in the

54
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,434
middle of having a depressing conversation about how much we were all dreading going

55
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:36,357
home for Christmas, because when you go home at Christmas, somebody pulls out that mostly

56
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,801
broken awful board game from the top of a cabinet and you all have to play Monopoly

57
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:45,145
or Trivial Pursuits with the cards that are 25 years out of date, so nobody knows any

58
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:45,786
of the answers anymore.

59
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:54,950
So Board Game Remix Kit was a physical card set and smartphone app that kind of mashed

60
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,913
up and remixed a bunch of games that you are likely to have, Monopoly, Clue, Druid Pursuit,

61
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:05,696
Scrabble, and gave you new rule sets or new kind of combined ways of playing them.

62
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:06,896
Some super, super nice stuff in there.

63
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,297
That was fun.

64
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:13,544
We made an iPhone game called The Show Must Go On, which is the world's first opera platformer.

65
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:16,328
This was in collaboration with the Royal Opera House.

66
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,215
Cast you as a put-upon stage manager who was trying to get the show...

67
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:28,117
up and running, but it was in the course of finding out that everything had gone wrong.

68
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:31,739
The costumes had got messed up, the set hadn't been built, the sheet music for the orchestra

69
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:37,563
had blown away, and you'd play a bunch of kind of one step above WarioWare little puzzle

70
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,004
games to solve those problems.

71
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:45,989
And then at the end of it you would watch the performance that happened as a result of your preparations.

72
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,472
If you played well, then you got a little nice animation where everything went great.

73
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:56,178
If you messed up, then you got a little dynamically generated animation where things went wrong depending on which games you had failed in.

74
00:03:56,398 --> 00:04:03,484
So if you found all the sheet music, then you got a gorgeous orchestral recording of the real Royal Opera House Orchestra playing the score.

75
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,346
If you didn't, you got a terrible...

76
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:08,164
janky chiptune version that we made.

77
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:11,567
The stunts go wrong, the costumes change around.

78
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:12,869
Cute, fun, nice thing.

79
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,993
This is Newer Games, which was a city-wide game

80
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:20,096
that we ran on New Year's Eve in Edinburgh a few years ago.

81
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:22,658
New Year's Eve is a massive celebration in Edinburgh

82
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,203
and they wanted to follow it up with another huge public.

83
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:33,407
event the next day and so we ran a series of distributed games across the whole city

84
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:36,970
where you could play and collect tokens. We put you in a team and you were

85
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:43,734
trying to win the... whichever team won, that team earned the right to set the...

86
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:47,296
give a blessing to the city for the rest of the year, give a tone for the city for the rest of the year.

87
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:47,597
So the

88
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:52,700
National Poet of Scotland wrote two blessings, one for each of the two teams and then depending on which one won that was going

89
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,303
to set the tone for the rest of the year. So you collect tokens and did things and danced in the streets and wore ribbons.

90
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:01,909
And then the hub of the game was this huge central square underneath Edinburgh Castle

91
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:06,735
where we would play mass, mass, mass multiplayer real world games.

92
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:13,002
So that culminated in a 5,000 player game of basketball in which nobody was hospitalized.

93
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,165
So that's a game design claim to fame.

94
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,426
This is Tiny Games, which some people might just remember.

95
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,726
We kick-started it a few years ago.

96
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,248
This was born out of a series of giant vinyl stickers

97
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,389
that we stuck on sidewalks all over London that kind of gave

98
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,090
you, in a sentence, a game that you could play using

99
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,450
the surroundings immediately around you.

100
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:33,072
They were a surprisingly big hit on the streets,

101
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:34,192
so we decided to make them digital.

102
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:35,893
And then this was just a very simple system

103
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:37,873
where you could play.

104
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:41,475
you tell the game where you are, what kind of mood you're in, how many people are there,

105
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:48,619
if you've got a particular prop that might help, and then the engine serves you the perfect little game that you could play there and then.

106
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,782
Most of these are no longer currently available, which is a thing we can talk about later.

107
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:57,527
But even before and after that, I was doing a bunch of crazy stuff.

108
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,331
If anyone's interested in any of these, I can tell you more after.

109
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:01,974
I don't want to bog us down too much in these.

110
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:06,180
But before I was at Hide and Seek, I was on the team behind Papa Sangre, which was an

111
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:09,565
iPhone 3D dungeon explorer.

112
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,968
It's a revival game, except with no visuals.

113
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:15,009
So you had a completely black screen,

114
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,211
and everything about the world was presented

115
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:20,613
via binaural 3D audio.

116
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:22,134
So you were navigating by sound alone,

117
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:24,996
which is an experiment that started out as a question

118
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,217
about whether or not we could make a horror game

119
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:30,399
that was as accessible to non-sighted players

120
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,220
as sighted players.

121
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,361
And Drunk Dungeon is a thing I made after I came to New York, which is a game built

122
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,441
out of drinks coasters.

123
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,562
It's designed for a whole party to play together.

124
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:43,743
You get put into a team when you arrive and then every time you get a drink, you get a

125
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:47,163
coaster with the drink and the coaster is a play piece that either helps you build out

126
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:53,144
the dungeon that the game is happening in, or lets you fight battles or move pieces around.

127
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:58,105
And you have to kind of find the right way to coordinate with every other drunk person

128
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,526
in the bar to figure out how to make that work.

129
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:04,010
So that, I did that for a long time.

130
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,534
And I'm game director at a company called Dot.

131
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:08,666
We're in New York.

132
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,527
There's about 50 of us.

133
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:15,248
One of those is me, but you don't win a prize for figuring out which.

134
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:16,148
Maybe you do.

135
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,709
It's harder than it looks.

136
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,810
You should check us out.

137
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,471
We're on the internet with that improbably short URL.

138
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:27,072
We're also on the socials, if you're a fan of the socials.

139
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:30,193
Our Instagram is particularly pretty.

140
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,653
Recommend our Instagram to you.

141
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,814
And we're called Dots because our first game was this game.

142
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:36,835
This game is called Dots.

143
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:39,504
It was about connecting dots.

144
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:47,351
This kind of came out of a kind of incubator,

145
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:50,194
skunk worksy thing at a tech startup in New York.

146
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,717
To everyone's surprise, it was a pretty colossal hit.

147
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,740
Got a lot of attention and a lot of players.

148
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,062
And so we followed it up with this game,

149
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:00,664
which was called Two Dots.

150
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:07,068
which is exactly the same mechanic but kind of expanded out a little bit bigger

151
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:11,390
library of game mechanics got into it and much more configured to be a

152
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,213
profitable free-to-play game and then last year we released this game which is

153
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:16,533
called

154
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,268
Dots and Co, because I wasn't...

155
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,551
I couldn't go with three dots, couldn't do it.

156
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,974
Because when you go next, you can't do four dots.

157
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:25,977
You've got to call time on it somewhere,

158
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:26,718
so we call time on it.

159
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,300
And this is what we make.

160
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,636
We're lucky that they're popular,

161
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:36,477
and that means we make enough money

162
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,077
to have 50 people in New York making them.

163
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,658
But it's obviously pretty different

164
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:43,698
from where I was spending my time before then.

165
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,218
So I thought I'd pick up on a couple of key areas,

166
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,360
and just poke at that question of what is different

167
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,620
between doing that thing in an indie or house environment

168
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,660
versus a highly commercialized environment.

169
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,721
So, speaking of highly commercialized,

170
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:00,981
let's start with the money.

171
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:03,577
And I do start with the money.

172
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,518
This is the first thing I look at every day.

173
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:11,320
These are our, this is our company-wide KPI email

174
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:11,940
that comes out every day.

175
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,620
Don't get excited.

176
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,701
I've deleted all of the interesting numbers.

177
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:17,162
Not sharing anything that should get me into trouble

178
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:18,222
that I shouldn't be sharing at GDC.

179
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:21,304
But it's true.

180
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:23,526
Every day you get up and you look at where those numbers are sitting.

181
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:27,830
Every single design choice that I make, I'm getting feedback on in terms of the metrics

182
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,692
that our analytics team feedback to me.

183
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:35,917
I'm very conscious of every decision that I make.

184
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:40,539
from a production perspective, an artistic perspective,

185
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,439
a game design perspective,

186
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,060
has specific financial ramifications.

187
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,781
And that feels a lot like it comes with the territory,

188
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,882
with being not just in a commercial company,

189
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:52,943
but a commercial company where you're getting

190
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,464
minute to minute feedback on whether or not

191
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:56,745
the thing you're doing is hitting the financial targets

192
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:57,865
that you hope that it will hit.

193
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,767
Except, this is a thing called the COD.

194
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,498
I can't remember why it's called the COD.

195
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,201
No one can remember why it's called the COD,

196
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:09,325
but it was a thing we used at Hide and Seek

197
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:13,112
to track all of our spending and all of our income.

198
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:14,375
This is it.

199
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:15,557
I haven't hidden any of the numbers here

200
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:16,960
because there's no exciting numbers to hide.

201
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,642
But you'll see at the top there's some nicely dynamically formatted cells that go pink,

202
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,604
in this case on the 18th of March.

203
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:30,668
And they go pink because that's our go bus date, as some people would call it.

204
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:36,533
We tended to call it our go bus date because that's really what it was.

205
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,275
We were a bootstrapped company.

206
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:39,335
We had no resources.

207
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,697
we could only pay ourselves the next month

208
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:45,939
if we got paid the previous month.

209
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,086
And especially for the people

210
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:56,453
you know, who were kind of mostly concerned

211
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:57,835
with running the company if Humor was won.

212
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:04,259
it dominated your waking hour to an extent that I could never really articulate at the time.

213
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,964
Because you knew that you couldn't pay rent next month if this didn't happen,

214
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,987
but also that a bunch of people who you adored, who you had lured away from possibly perfectly

215
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:18,589
successful, sensible person jobs to come and work with you, wouldn't get paid.

216
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:23,032
And that pressure was super intense. So that pressure was a waking up at two in the morning

217
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:26,175
intense pressure, not just a rolling out of bed and checking my KPIs.

218
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:32,357
So the amount of time I spend thinking about money, now that I work for a free-to-play company, is much reduced.

219
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:39,380
And certainly the amount of energy and friction that I'm dealing with in terms of money is radically reduced.

220
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:41,181
It's much nicer.

221
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:50,224
But you saw those screenshots at the beginning.

222
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,244
seems like a fair question to ask whether or not that has come at the expense of abandoning

223
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:58,646
interesting, unpredictable work for...

224
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:00,988
I mean...

225
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:06,493
I don't want to say boring, but you can see how similar those three screenshots are to each other.

226
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:08,355
This is the same game three times.

227
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:09,636
And that's what I do.

228
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:12,778
And...

229
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:15,481
What I found is...

230
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:16,982
a thing I wasn't expecting to find.

231
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:17,983
So these are...

232
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:21,006
Don't worry, they don't make sense.

233
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:26,449
These are early prototypes for the last new puzzle mechanic

234
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:27,810
we introduced in two dots.

235
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:29,611
They're called paddles.

236
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:36,336
The kind of idea here is that if you clear dots along,

237
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:40,798
so they're a set of tiles that function together.

238
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:42,319
Along one side is a hinge.

239
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,521
If you clear dots along the hinge, then they flip,

240
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:46,062
and then whatever they land on, they squish.

241
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:49,824
And then if you clear dots on the other side of the hinge,

242
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:50,465
then they flip back.

243
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,886
And while they're not flipping,

244
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,628
they act like gaps and dots can fall through them.

245
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:58,650
It's a relatively simple idea,

246
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,552
but two dots is three years old nearly.

247
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:04,214
We're coming up on our third anniversary in May.

248
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,816
And that means there's a huge amount of stuff

249
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:07,436
in the game already.

250
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,658
This is level 1000, which we just released.

251
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:12,300
And this has every mechanic in the game so far.

252
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,261
So you make those two connections

253
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:15,682
that are the only two connections you can make.

254
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:18,287
which then drops the cloud, which triggers the cloud,

255
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:20,168
which lets the lotuses trigger, which hits the gems.

256
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:22,270
The gems explode, they hit the bombs, the bomb goes off.

257
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,412
That hits the slime, the train triggers,

258
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:26,693
that connects the magnets, the magnets trigger,

259
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:29,936
and that explodes the, oh, the monster dot fell,

260
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:35,420
then the thing went, and now the paddle is gonna trigger.

261
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:38,703
And that was your first move in that level.

262
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,769
I've never got to play with something so intricate in my life.

263
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:55,158
The interactions between all these different mechanics are currently endlessly interesting.

264
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,443
The joy of getting to drop a new one into that every month or two and see what it changes

265
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:05,668
and what it enables and how it inflects the flavor of the game is incredibly satisfying.

266
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:13,385
A hesitation that I had when I took the decision

267
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:15,946
to join the company was how am I gonna feel?

268
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:18,628
Like it's literally spots before your eyes.

269
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:20,749
There's a point where can you really look at this

270
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:23,611
all day every day for however long?

271
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:25,112
Well I've been doing it for two and a half years

272
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:28,894
and I'm nowhere near done with enjoying looking

273
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,776
at this particular set of things.

274
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:33,457
And that's partly because at Hide and Seek,

275
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:36,299
this was us, this was our logo.

276
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:39,750
This was our tagline.

277
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:40,792
This is what we did.

278
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,856
We invented new kinds of play.

279
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:48,164
Number of problems with that, even as a claim.

280
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:51,971
It's also just so dumb.

281
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:53,053
It's such a.

282
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:56,649
bad purgatorial way of being a game designer.

283
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:00,150
We would iterate, well, iterating is even the word.

284
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,331
We were ideating so many new projects

285
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:06,072
in so many crazy configurations

286
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:07,733
where every single thing was on the table.

287
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,133
We're, oh no, we're gonna do this with motion sensors.

288
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:11,354
No, we're not, we're gonna do it with

289
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:15,275
super weird targeted speakers that know where you are.

290
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:16,355
No, we're not, we're gonna do it with

291
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:18,136
a partnership with Nike.

292
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,216
No, we're not, we're gonna do it with whoever.

293
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:20,817
Everything was possible.

294
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:25,151
And you very rapidly stop being a good...

295
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,916
or you risk stopping being a good game designer

296
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:31,660
and just being a good game describer at that.

297
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,823
That becomes your job, that you just show up in a room

298
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,926
and you say a bunch of stuff that sounds good

299
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,328
about a thing that doesn't exist.

300
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,011
And then maybe you get to make it, but if you do get to make it, you're going to spend three months making it,

301
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:43,933
and you're not going to have time to get it right,

302
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:47,495
but it doesn't really matter because everybody's going to be on to the next thing three weeks after that.

303
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:55,941
And it's invigorating, and there are, I think, serious merits to going through that process,

304
00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:58,483
but it certainly put me in a position where I'm...

305
00:15:59,344 --> 00:16:05,790
now could not be happier to have this really, really precisely defined puzzle box that I have

306
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:13,377
this, you know, I feel like a jeweler trying to perfect a gemstone rather than somebody trying to

307
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:20,924
whatever it was we were trying to do that whole time. But I thought for sure I was leaving art

308
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:24,468
behind. So I still feel a bit weird about this but...

309
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:36,824
Hide and Seek was fundamentally conceived of as an art studio, as an arts institution.

310
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:41,348
We were artists in residence at the Southbank Centre in London, which is one of, if not

311
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,170
the biggest, arts centres in London.

312
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,511
We made work like this.

313
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:48,515
I did a talk about this at GDC a while ago, so I won't take you through it, because you

314
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:49,876
can vault it if you care.

315
00:16:51,037 --> 00:17:10,203
But this was a piece that we made as a counterpoint to a documentary film about a very distressing story of the discovery in a London apartment of the body of a 36-year-old woman who had lain undiscovered for three years.

316
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:14,384
And a woman called Carol Morley made a searing...

317
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:18,283
emotional, amazing documentary about it.

318
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,224
And we got asked to make a partner piece

319
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:22,325
so that people could kind of extend and explore

320
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:25,807
the issues in the story that the film told online.

321
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,468
Making it was hard and beautiful and weird,

322
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:30,889
and I've never seen anything like it.

323
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:32,409
And I don't know if we got it right, but it was,

324
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,351
you know, it definitely felt like being an artist,

325
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:41,333
even if I don't know if I wanted to call myself an artist.

326
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,053
And that was a huge amount of how we thought about ourselves

327
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:46,773
and what we thought we did.

328
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:51,638
A year later, this company came to us.

329
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,179
They're called Capgemini.

330
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:53,960
I don't know what they do,

331
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,543
but apparently it's consulting technology and outsourcing.

332
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:00,526
They wanted, I think,

333
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:02,648
to do.

334
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:13,724
make a mobile web thing that would tell their clients,

335
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:20,425
or convince their clients, that buying smart mobile devices for

336
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:25,566
their client's employees would overall up company productivity

337
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:27,907
more than the devices would cost.

338
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:30,954
And we said we've got just the thing.

339
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:36,718
And so we took the game that had been that beautiful documentary piece

340
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,860
and we stuck a bunch of...

341
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:42,569
I stock photos in it.

342
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:43,850
This is, I draw your attention to the fact

343
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,031
this photo is literally called

344
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:47,553
Adult People Having a Business Lunch.

345
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,476
And then with Captain Devino's help,

346
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:53,718
we wrote a lot of choose your own adventure,

347
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,900
business productivity dialogue.

348
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,021
I suggest you don't read all of this

349
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,282
because it's too gruesome,

350
00:18:58,362 --> 00:18:59,663
but there's some highlights

351
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:00,484
that you might want to dwell on.

352
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:08,288
And that was a project for us because it pushed that go bus date a couple months down the road

353
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:13,750
It was a thing we could do it felt good to be building on the technology that we'd already developed

354
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:21,113
but it's a really stark contrast to the stuff that we wanted to do and the stuff that we cared about doing and

355
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:25,335
Because I'm lucky enough to be at a game studio that's

356
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:30,797
Founded by a bunch of people who care about culture beyond the culture of games

357
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:33,784
it hasn't necessarily meant leaving this behind.

358
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:35,965
So this is contemporary magic.

359
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,926
This is a side project that DOTS put out last year,

360
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:44,848
a collaboration with a woman called Stacey Engman

361
00:19:44,928 --> 00:19:48,529
who had put together a collection of commissioned.

362
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:53,052
interpretations of tarot cards from artists around the world.

363
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:56,395
So she had the cards, but she wanted to make a digital version of the cards.

364
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:58,457
And she was looking for a good partner to do it.

365
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:04,482
And for us, we're at the scale that that's not a scary decision to say, well, this is

366
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:07,145
a pretty simple little standalone thing that we can put together.

367
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:12,129
And so, although I have in theory left all of this behind,

368
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:16,672
to my surprise, it's amazing how much of it

369
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:19,535
you can take with you if you're in an environment

370
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:21,376
with the right kind of people,

371
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:22,457
which we'll talk about more.

372
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:25,179
Similar thing.

373
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,101
This has really surprised me

374
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:29,502
and I feel a bit torn about it.

375
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,425
Part of why I wanted to...

376
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:37,054
work with Hide and Seek, where I wanted to stay at Hide and Seek was...

377
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:40,257
I can't remember, did I? I don't know. Are either Alex or Holly here?

378
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:41,938
I don't think they made it.

379
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,561
There's other very good Hide and Seek people here this week.

380
00:20:46,522 --> 00:20:47,823
If you find them, you should talk to them,

381
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:49,505
because it'll be fun.

382
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,247
This was a thing I was super proud of.

383
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,610
Well, stay with me.

384
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,274
This was the ARG we made for the launch of the Green Lantern movie,

385
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:02,856
starring Ryan Reynolds.

386
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:05,736
which none of you saw.

387
00:21:07,837 --> 00:21:09,497
Right, it's terrible.

388
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,139
But they wanted an ARG and that's the kind of thing we did.

389
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,560
So we felt we could have some fun with it.

390
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,660
And part of how we had fun with it was

391
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:29,486
with this project. I knew some folks at Cambridge University who were trying to run some citizen

392
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:34,812
science digital tools to deal with a weird problem that now apparently exists in astronomy,

393
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:41,719
which is we have really good photographic resources of space now. This picture that

394
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:43,781
you're looking at here is from the Spitzer Space Telescope.

395
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:51,066
So we have this huge amount of raw material of images of space, but computers are still pretty bad at

396
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:54,908
doing visual analysis or photographs. They were certainly even worse

397
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,810
whenever this was six or seven years ago that we were doing it.

398
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:03,994
So what actually ends up happening is that grad students are just expected to invest hours of extra time in

399
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:07,757
manually going through all of these photos to see if they can see anything that looks interesting.

400
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:10,298
And this project was specifically about trying to find

401
00:22:13,574 --> 00:22:15,895
photographic evidence of the birth of new stars.

402
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:19,096
And what happens when,

403
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:21,817
like if anybody who actually understands

404
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,357
any of this stuff is here, just do this for now,

405
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:25,618
because I'm on shaky ground here,

406
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,319
but for the sake of the talk.

407
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,420
What happens when a star is born is there's a huge explosion.

408
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,521
All this stuff, sorry, all this stuff,

409
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:36,842
not that there's much space stuff,

410
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:38,942
but there's some space stuff that was around the star

411
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:40,203
when it explodes gets pushed out.

412
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:45,771
and you end up with a globe of stuff which to a 2D camera looks like a ring

413
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:49,273
and then it's hard to see because the colors are the pictures have any color

414
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:52,215
in them so you tint them the way this one is tinted to make it look spacey and

415
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:58,459
cool. What you get what you get is a green ring in space for the Green

416
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,340
Lantern movie!

417
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:07,397
I was pretty pleased.

418
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,119
So we had this cute thing that if you played the ARG,

419
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,161
it would take you through,

420
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:15,143
we re-skinned their citizen science tool

421
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:16,324
to be within the game fiction,

422
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:18,025
then you do it amongst yourself,

423
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,386
you would maybe find a star

424
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:20,487
that no one had ever found before,

425
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:22,389
and then you got a certificate from NASA at the end

426
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:23,650
saying thank you for being a scientist.

427
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,211
And that seemed,

428
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:28,353
this was like high on the job satisfaction score, right?

429
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,794
That seems like a really nice thing to put together.

430
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:41,708
The truth is, it's utterly eclipsed by a thing that I had a much smaller hand in,

431
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:46,212
which is that when the travel ban hit a few weeks ago,

432
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:53,178
led by former FIRA CEO, but with just enough of support of a ton of people in the company

433
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:59,660
who were on Slack over the weekend, we put an announcement in all our games,

434
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,823
kind of stating our opposition to anything that was limiting free and fair immigration

435
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:09,264
and directing people to the ACLU donation page.

436
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:15,120
and that pushed half a million visitors through from us to the ACLU.

437
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,784
Can't then track the onward donation because the technology wasn't in place, but it was there.

438
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:24,390
Thank you.

439
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,013
We got a bunch of unbelievably nice letters.

440
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:33,366
We got a bunch of mean letters, and in the interests of balance,

441
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,327
I was going to also put those on screen,

442
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:38,269
but the truth is they are so ugly and hate-filled and racist

443
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,891
that I'm not willing to give them the oxygen.

444
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:42,973
So you're just going to get the nice ones.

445
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:48,217
But it was a real, you know, we, as a commercial company,

446
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:50,518
we had to stop and think about what we might be looking at

447
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:53,080
in terms of the repercussions, and we were able to do that

448
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,821
and determine that it was worth doing.

449
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,952
And there is a kind of numbers game reality

450
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:02,194
that Hide and Seek had a huge amount of freedom,

451
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:05,536
but we just had this really tiny reach,

452
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:07,357
even when we were trying to surf,

453
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,118
you know, we were trying to find cool ways

454
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:10,859
to hitch the ideas that we wanted to do

455
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,880
up to a major movie release.

456
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:14,881
And now being at a studio

457
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,362
that has hundreds of millions of installs,

458
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:19,064
when we want to have this kind of impact,

459
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:20,585
we have a capability to do it

460
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:21,766
that we wouldn't otherwise have.

461
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:30,326
And some of that is just to do with this kind of weird, simple bit of math I didn't do

462
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:32,446
until fairly recently.

463
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:38,228
There's lots of things about working for a commercial free-to-play company that only

464
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:42,269
really makes one kind of game that doesn't seem very exciting or enlivening.

465
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:46,650
But what is true is I'm now in a place where...

466
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:50,278
All everyone in that room cares about all day,

467
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,498
every day is games.

468
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:53,820
And all the people who are our customers want from us

469
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,240
all day, every day is games.

470
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,262
I just, I live in this delicious game bubble.

471
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:02,564
And my old job, I got to do a bunch of cool stuff,

472
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:05,365
but it was nearly always in collaboration

473
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:06,046
with somebody else.

474
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,508
And those organizations were full of wonderful people

475
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:11,148
and they were doing great and interesting things,

476
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,170
but they mostly cared about chocolate or opera

477
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,431
or prescription prices.

478
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:16,951
And they didn't.

479
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:21,603
They didn't even not like games as much.

480
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:24,264
They didn't, they just, they didn't, games didn't,

481
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:25,964
they didn't know about them.

482
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:26,865
They didn't believe in them.

483
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:28,945
They didn't know how to interface with them.

484
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:33,847
They didn't know how to write contracts for them.

485
00:26:33,907 --> 00:26:35,888
They just, they just, it, you know,

486
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,929
there was just a real boundary there

487
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:38,689
that was hard to cross.

488
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:42,310
And I spent so much more of my time defending

489
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,691
and explaining and, and,

490
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,837
lobbying for games than I ever spent actively making them.

491
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,539
Whereas when I walk in now to my office every morning,

492
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,620
I'm not, there's no friction.

493
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,921
I'm just walking with a bunch of other people

494
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:56,582
who want to do game stuff.

495
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,524
I should say in all this, I'm painfully aware

496
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:02,126
that there are lots of different ways

497
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,507
to be a commercial free-to-play company,

498
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:04,828
lots of different ways to be an indie,

499
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:08,390
and I know indies who don't do anything like this.

500
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:14,653
So, please don't think that I'm suggesting

501
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:15,694
this is the only way around it is,

502
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:19,916
but this is the bit of it that I know about,

503
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:22,937
so I thought it made sense to start there.

504
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,161
It's rainbow.

505
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,382
Because here's the thing, maybe this whole premise,

506
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:34,142
this whole question about the transition from...

507
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:39,276
indie to commercial is just a big pile of rainbow poop.

508
00:27:39,837 --> 00:27:43,238
Maybe it's not really a meaningful transition at all.

509
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:47,560
Because I think what I found, and I spoke to a few people

510
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,221
who've been through similar changes

511
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:52,222
before coming into this today,

512
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:53,603
they're kind of saying the same thing.

513
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:55,964
What doesn't change is the work is the work.

514
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:11,570
If you make Games for a Living, what you're up against in terms of all of the weird technical, psychological, artistic, commercial challenges that you face,

515
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,412
of like starting with nothing and trying to get to a thing.

516
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:23,514
four weeks, four months, four years later, that people will understand and know how to use and stick with and derive a sense of accomplishment from

517
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:31,276
and doesn't fall over all the time, whatever else might go wrong with it. It just doesn't change. This is an awesome

518
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:32,256
collection of Richard Serra

519
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:35,376
ink drawings

520
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:40,297
from an exhibition called Work Comes Out of Work, and that phrase gets stuck in my head a lot

521
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:42,418
even though it's a bit hard to explain because I

522
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:45,348
Feels like what it means to me is that the,

523
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:47,630
you know, you think of work in terms of an artwork,

524
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,511
the work is like this finished object

525
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:50,572
that you see in a gallery.

526
00:28:51,853 --> 00:28:54,916
But the way you get to that thing is through the work,

527
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,798
is through the daily, boring, stupid,

528
00:28:57,178 --> 00:28:58,579
trudgy work that you do.

529
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,742
And you can't get there without here.

530
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:03,643
And in fact, you can't directly make that.

531
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:05,125
You just need to do this stuff

532
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:07,086
and you do enough of it for long enough

533
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,888
and then the thing emerges at the end of it.

534
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:10,389
And that just feels the same.

535
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:11,170
I mean, the truth is,

536
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:16,510
I probably burst into tears a little less often,

537
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:18,592
but working on a new mechanic for Dots

538
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,454
doesn't feel fundamentally different

539
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:22,595
from working on a game about death.

540
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:26,919
I still have a bunch of logic flows I can't resolve,

541
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,301
and I need a bigger piece of paper

542
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:31,102
because I always need a bigger piece of paper,

543
00:29:31,122 --> 00:29:32,263
and then I sit there for three hours

544
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,624
until I figure it out, and then I figure it out,

545
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:35,445
and then I go and talk to an engineer,

546
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:37,387
and then the next day we play it,

547
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:38,468
and then hopefully it's better.

548
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:39,689
That's just the same.

549
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:41,679
It just doesn't change.

550
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,741
So for all that it looks like,

551
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:49,104
I've been through this kind of massive career U-turn.

552
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:51,246
It in practice doesn't feel like it at all.

553
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:53,688
But I think there are some things

554
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:57,450
that came out of being in that crazy indie environment

555
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,231
that I brought into commercial free-to-play

556
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:01,113
that I wouldn't have come any other way.

557
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:02,754
This is one of them.

558
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:05,035
This is a crying child.

559
00:30:06,997 --> 00:30:08,938
My work used to involve a lot more crying children.

560
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:14,392
When you make real-world games, physical world games,

561
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:18,478
really often, especially when you're developing them,

562
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,422
when they're still being designed,

563
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:23,245
your players and your playtesters are...

564
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:27,843
They're in the room with you, but they are so in the room with you,

565
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:28,304
you probably...

566
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:33,706
There's no mediated thing where you give them a screen and you get to sit back.

567
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:35,146
You're probably going to say stuff.

568
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:38,588
If you're me, you're standing on a chair because you're 5'2 and no one can see you.

569
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:40,609
You're going to tell a bunch of people to do things,

570
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:43,770
and they are trusting you that doing them is going to be fun.

571
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,591
And they do them and it stinks because the game is still in development.

572
00:30:47,031 --> 00:30:48,372
And then they come back and they yell at you.

573
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:50,733
And that is what making games is like.

574
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:52,253
And that's bad enough.

575
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,113
What's worse is when they're three years old,

576
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:57,534
we did a, the tiny games project I mentioned earlier,

577
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:59,935
we followed up with a collaboration with Sesame Street,

578
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:03,496
which was an amazing, delightful experience.

579
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:06,236
But we did a bunch of similar tiny games

580
00:31:06,336 --> 00:31:08,117
for sort of three and four year olds,

581
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:09,637
and their parents were caregivers.

582
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:11,197
And you have to playtest those things.

583
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:19,685
and not wreak psychological catastrophe on the children who are playtesting them in the course of doing that.

584
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:20,866
Not always easy.

585
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:25,871
Turns out that one three-year-old is better at cup stacking than her four-year-old sister,

586
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:29,655
and the four-year-old isn't okay with that, and a whole thing happens.

587
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:40,321
And so I think the intimacy and the immediacy of the playtesting experience that I had in an experimental, real-world play-focused studio

588
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:46,325
taught me things that I never would have learned working just in a digital studio and just in a casual digital studio.

589
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:54,796
I talked earlier about the downside of the inventing new kinds of play thing,

590
00:31:54,836 --> 00:31:56,637
where you never get to the bottom of an idea,

591
00:31:58,238 --> 00:32:00,219
but there's a pretty big upside.

592
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:04,221
Can I show you this for half a second, because there's preparatory stuff on it?

593
00:32:04,982 --> 00:32:11,166
That was pulled out of a real email, a team email.

594
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:13,707
We do a team email each week, I think, of all the things we're working on,

595
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,049
that just listed out all of our projects,

596
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:19,471
and that was one from a few months before we took the decision to close.

597
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:25,480
This is a kind of translation of what we were doing.

598
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:29,406
So on the left is the stuff that was live,

599
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:30,807
that was actively in production or release.

600
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:32,088
So the Sesame Street thing I just showed you,

601
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:33,109
the tiny games we just talked about,

602
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,591
we were making prototypes with Leap Motion

603
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:38,413
for an in-house project that we wanted to do.

604
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:42,476
We were installing seven foot playable carrots

605
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:45,299
at the Royal Botanic Gardens in London.

606
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:47,420
We had a thing going with the Government Policy Research

607
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,701
Unit that I can't remember much about.

608
00:32:49,262 --> 00:32:50,623
Those plastic, those vinyl stickers

609
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:51,704
were going down somewhere.

610
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:54,426
We were doing a movie marketing thing that wasn't.

611
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,765
Green Lantern, Holly, if she was here, was writing a twine game of philosophy for the

612
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:00,768
Open University, that terrible.

613
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,937
Capgemini device thing was happening, we were making a

614
00:33:06,978 --> 00:33:13,280
iPhone, an iPad app for young learners of the violin

615
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,701
that would listen to them play and then tell them

616
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:18,922
what to do to correct in this kind of music course

617
00:33:18,942 --> 00:33:19,902
that we were putting together for them.

618
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:22,443
And we had a large installation at Kensington Palace

619
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:24,764
where you played a bunch of games.

620
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:26,184
It was a very, very, very

621
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:33,267
astonishing kind of medieval museum in London. We had games installed throughout the palace and you

622
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:36,608
played things and you collected things. Then when you got to the end, it was for Christmas, kind of

623
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,369
aimed at kids and their families. We got to the end, if you played well enough you became king

624
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:44,950
or queen, you got to choose your royal name, you built a big placard for yourself that had your

625
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,272
name on it, and then we had a smart throne. You sat on the throne, it could feel that you sat down

626
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:54,793
and it read your board because your board was full of RFIDs and then it played a fanfare.

627
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:58,576
a dynamically generated fanfare that was just for you and your name,

628
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:01,458
so that your dad could take a photo of you.

629
00:34:01,478 --> 00:34:03,459
It was kind of nice.

630
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:06,401
So that was live that week.

631
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,002
That was the stuff we were doing live that week.

632
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:10,424
And then the stuff that we were pitching on that week was

633
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:13,866
a therapy app with a major dementia charity,

634
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,087
who was interested in whether or not

635
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:18,389
occupational therapy could be extended to digital play therapy.

636
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,051
It was in the middle of the gamification of money stuff,

637
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:24,391
so we had an investment management company who thought we could help them,

638
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:26,232
we had a pension company who thought we could help them.

639
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:28,193
A thing was happening that I can't remember about,

640
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:31,133
some guys who, a big slot machine company,

641
00:34:31,274 --> 00:34:34,194
thought maybe that there should be an experiential real-world game

642
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:36,735
that sat around the slot machine experience,

643
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:37,716
so we were trying to help them with that.

644
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:40,636
The UK government wanted a bunch of people to go to a tourist destination

645
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:42,557
that everybody was going to, and they thought an ARG could help.

646
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:45,619
There was a lightly pornographic movie,

647
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,760
I'll leave it up to you to guess which one it was,

648
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:50,461
that wanted a text adventure.

649
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,003
I still think I did some of my best game design for it,

650
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:54,744
different question.

651
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,166
There was a stupendously enormous movie deal

652
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:00,007
that I still can't talk about, but,

653
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:03,729
oh, we're taking Tiny Games to Indicade,

654
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:04,529
which was a long way away.

655
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,390
One of the companies that did the,

656
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,511
you know when you go to a museum,

657
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:09,752
you can like hire a digital,

658
00:35:10,648 --> 00:35:14,610
guide that tells you a bunch of stuff about where you are, the people who make those were

659
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,972
interested in doing tiny games for one of those, a mall wanted a three-story playable

660
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:24,935
sculpture thing that was kind of half a helter-skelter and half an escape the room.

661
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,577
that we would charge people money to go into.

662
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:29,939
There was another movie that wanted a thing,

663
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,300
there was another government thing that wanted a thing,

664
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,082
and a major Hollywood visual effects studio

665
00:35:34,603 --> 00:35:35,924
was wondering if they should stop just making

666
00:35:36,204 --> 00:35:36,985
visual effects for movies

667
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:38,146
and start making games of their own,

668
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:41,869
so we were in development with a major new project for that.

669
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,112
Six people worked at the London office,

670
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,514
and every week was like that.

671
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:51,866
and you get really good at having ideas fast

672
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,307
in that environment.

673
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:55,669
Because we needed to chase all of those things

674
00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:58,291
because only every 30th would turn into a thing

675
00:35:58,331 --> 00:36:00,092
because most of them, as you can see, are bonkers

676
00:36:00,252 --> 00:36:01,353
and should never have happened.

677
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:07,498
And so the fluidity and the fastness of feet

678
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:10,180
that you need to develop to kind of survive that stuff

679
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,300
is really profound.

680
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:14,843
And you also need to get really, really good at,

681
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:17,105
oh, hang on, I skipped a slide.

682
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:23,052
Social is another thing that you design for differently when you're in that environment.

683
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:27,137
If you live only in the digital social world, I think you tend to have these kind of creepy

684
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,166
kind of virology.

685
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:38,570
analogies for social spread.

686
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,452
I know we don't talk about K-factor anymore,

687
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:45,275
but there is this kind of like creepy sense

688
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:47,117
that things spread without any kind of real autonomy,

689
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:49,179
that this isn't about any of the particular individuals,

690
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,480
it's just if you package it right

691
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,421
and you incentivize it correctly,

692
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:55,103
then you can count on a certain percentage of people

693
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,805
to press the button and a certain percentage of the people

694
00:36:56,825 --> 00:36:58,126
that button goes to to press the button.

695
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:00,728
If you're designing physical space social games,

696
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,950
you have a much, much clearer understanding

697
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,250
that the...

698
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:14,678
the unit of social interaction is one-to-one and one-to-one between two individuals with their own dynamic and preferences and priorities.

699
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:20,182
So this was probably the most successful social feature that I designed,

700
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:23,024
and one that I think I never would have designed if I hadn't come out of that feature.

701
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:29,749
This was a crazy text adventure we did for Skyfall, the Bond movie.

702
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,841
with a natural language chatbot.

703
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:36,403
So the hook was that you were going through

704
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,684
your initial test to find out whether or not

705
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:39,286
you could be a good MI6 agent.

706
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:43,089
So you got hooked up to the system that was,

707
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,952
the conceit, I guess, was kind of that MI6 agents

708
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,653
have like codecs that they type into

709
00:37:47,673 --> 00:37:48,935
when they're having a bad day.

710
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:54,866
that would fly, and so you hook in and they're like,

711
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,087
oh, this has all gone wrong, I don't know what to do,

712
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,289
I'm stuck, help me, and you would type your way through it,

713
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:00,211
figure out how to solve their problem,

714
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,753
and if you won out, you would get an email,

715
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:04,474
psychological analysis that told you

716
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:08,038
the fake MI6's assessment of how you played

717
00:38:08,058 --> 00:38:08,918
and what kind of person you were.

718
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:11,861
So in this one, I played manipulatively.

719
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:16,145
But then we would tell you that you were looking

720
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:17,366
for a different kind of agent.

721
00:38:18,514 --> 00:38:20,355
So a ruthless agent or an unpredictable agent

722
00:38:20,475 --> 00:38:21,576
or an impetuous agent.

723
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:24,077
And so in this recruit friends box,

724
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:27,219
we would ask you to nominate somebody.

725
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,620
So we'd hook you through to your Facebook friends,

726
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,881
but you could only pick one.

727
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:33,323
And it was kind of fun.

728
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:34,084
When you get a thing that says,

729
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:35,504
who is your most manipulative friend,

730
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,766
and you look through your list of Facebook friends.

731
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:41,755
You can't help but kind of go, oh no, not her, but him.

732
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:46,277
And what we got was through the roof rates

733
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:49,599
for both this share, but then also the response rate

734
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,520
from the people that we shared it to

735
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,700
because they felt like they were getting

736
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,340
something meaningful.

737
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:55,182
We also, this was a collaboration with Ryan and Kennedy,

738
00:38:55,362 --> 00:38:57,003
and they had a super cute idea

739
00:38:57,883 --> 00:38:59,184
that if you tried to circumvent that

740
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:00,484
and share it more widely,

741
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,926
it showed up on your Facebook feed as redacted.

742
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:07,289
So you could share the URL, but everything showed up with a text blacked out.

743
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:08,390
It looked super cool.

744
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:14,155
So we just said, no, you don't, you have to, one person, pick one person.

745
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:15,276
And it worked so well.

746
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:18,579
I know I never would have done it if I hadn't made a bunch of real-world social games

747
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:19,960
that operate kind of very differently.

748
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:22,603
So that still feels different and better.

749
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:23,744
That's that.

750
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:24,785
And then...

751
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:34,249
When I started out working in games and as a game designer, I'd come up as a game journalist and a game designer,

752
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,413
and if you asked me to express myself, I would write you an essay.

753
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:42,298
I would do a nice design document, with headings, and that's what you would get.

754
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:48,042
And I went from that to being smashed into a room with people from Widen and Kennedy,

755
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:53,104
or RGA, or Mother, or whatever else, or people from Tate Modern, or Royal Opera House.

756
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:56,505
The expectation of your ability to communicate visually,

757
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,246
and the expectation of your ability to present your ideas

758
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:04,088
kind of to the best of their capabilities,

759
00:40:05,308 --> 00:40:07,669
was a lot of pressure very fast.

760
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:10,110
And I mean, you guys are...

761
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:17,604
going to be the judge of it, but I'm hoping that I'm a little bit better at presenting

762
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:22,589
my ideas than I was when I started out with those endless Word documents.

763
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:27,294
So I'm contractually obliged to give you takeaways.

764
00:40:27,314 --> 00:40:29,716
I think I might actually be contractually obliged to give you takeaways.

765
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:31,978
That joke doesn't work in America, does it?

766
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:35,482
Have we got any Brits who can give me a takeaway laugh?

767
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:35,542
No?

768
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:36,303
All right.

769
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:39,330
You're lucky you didn't get a picture of a munchie box, which

770
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:43,460
sounds like you shouldn't Google, but you can Google, but then you'll still kind of wish you hadn't Googled.

771
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:44,662
Um...

772
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:47,148
So I try to think about...

773
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,233
Can I give any advice that's actually real useful advice

774
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,834
and advice that I can imagine myself having followed

775
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,975
either at the indie studio when I was helping run that

776
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:02,176
or at the commercial studio that I'm helping run now?

777
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:04,897
And I decided that in both cases,

778
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:11,138
it's all about the three Fs.

779
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:15,800
I'm lucky to be in the studio that I'm at now

780
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,920
and a big part of...

781
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,003
What's enabled that is just the people that we have.

782
00:41:22,284 --> 00:41:23,686
We have a weird mix of people,

783
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:26,251
and we are very unprejudicial

784
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:28,094
about what people's backgrounds are.

785
00:41:28,976 --> 00:41:30,358
We don't care about experience,

786
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,462
and we don't care about industry background.

787
00:41:33,677 --> 00:41:38,781
What we do care about, or certainly what I care about when I'm looking to hire game designers,

788
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:41,223
is that kind of fundamental fluency.

789
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:45,906
Are you fast? Are you used to having to undergo a bunch of playtesting?

790
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,688
Are you good at taking that kind of feedback?

791
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,331
Are you good at communicating your ideas effectively and visually to a team?

792
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,392
I do not care how you've come by that experience.

793
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:55,254
I don't care whether you've got a degree. I don't care.

794
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:59,877
I don't care if you do have experience and you're bringing it to me out of a free-to-play studio,

795
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,998
I don't care if it's a bunch of game jams that you've done,

796
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:07,742
I don't care if it's some skills that you can transfer across from having been working in advertising or whatever else,

797
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:11,604
I don't care. If I feel like you can do it, that's my number one concern.

798
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:17,768
I do care a bit about your degree of familiarity with the space that I'm in.

799
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:20,890
Free-to-play has a bunch of weird habits and...

800
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,360
best practices that it's very useful to know,

801
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,423
but I don't care whether you know them

802
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,604
as a player or a designer.

803
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:34,888
If you have some degree of fluency with what that takes,

804
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:39,292
or how that works and how it fits together,

805
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:43,696
then that's all you need to make it on my list.

806
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:45,698
And then the third F is experience.

807
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:55,344
Because it helps, you know, I think that thing that I talked about earlier in terms of knowing what it takes to take something over the line does matter.

808
00:42:55,544 --> 00:43:10,553
Knowing, you know, there is an amount of grit and a kind of breadth of focus that you need as you come to the end of a project to make sure that it debuts fulfilling all of the hopes that you had for it.

809
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:14,575
But again, I don't necessarily care about whether or not that's strictly speaking in games.

810
00:43:14,615 --> 00:43:14,996
And I think...

811
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:24,531
The value for doing that is there's a different talk I could have been giving today.

812
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:28,998
If I was at a different studio, I wouldn't have been able to say so many of the nice things that I said about,

813
00:43:29,078 --> 00:43:32,362
oh, hey, we did this ACLU thing, or hey, we got to do this artist collaboration.

814
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,046
I know that not everybody who's working in free-to-play is in that sphere.

815
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:36,248
But...

816
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,308
In a successful business, there just is the scope.

817
00:43:39,648 --> 00:43:45,410
I know that from being in a absolutely down to the bones, impoverished indie studio.

818
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:48,212
We never had the scope to do those kind of things.

819
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:51,953
And in a bigger studio, you can if there is the institutional will.

820
00:43:51,973 --> 00:43:54,875
And the institutional will is built out of the people who make up the studio.

821
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:58,277
And so the more you bring in people who are gonna help you

822
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:00,959
stay connected to a wider cultural sphere

823
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:04,721
and a more diverse set of attitudes and beliefs,

824
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:07,263
the more it becomes credible that you can start to

825
00:44:07,804 --> 00:44:10,165
kind of incubate those kinds of projects and activities

826
00:44:10,205 --> 00:44:11,646
within that commercial environment.

827
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,548
For any of these, it's also the three Fs.

828
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:16,270
Actually, or three Fs this time.

829
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:18,211
Last year, I made a sequel.

830
00:44:18,371 --> 00:44:19,812
I made Dots and Co, it's a sequel to Two Dots.

831
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:22,194
It was unbelievably hard.

832
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,894
So hard, kinda hated it.

833
00:44:26,614 --> 00:44:28,415
Learned so much, super proud of it.

834
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:31,136
I never did that as an indie.

835
00:44:31,156 --> 00:44:32,997
You never make a sequel as an indie, are you crazy?

836
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:36,278
You're lucky if you survive releasing anything once ever,

837
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:37,858
and then even if you make it that far,

838
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:39,659
you probably have to do something different the next time.

839
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:43,901
And so the design education I got

840
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:45,981
out of really, really tearing down,

841
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:50,024
an existing successful game. It was such a hard challenge because it

842
00:44:50,784 --> 00:44:53,186
often when you make a sequel you made a game and you released it and it did or

843
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:56,008
didn't do okay and then time passed and now you're going to make another version

844
00:44:56,048 --> 00:44:58,569
of it. That's cool. In the modern games and

845
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:00,270
services age that's not how it works. Two Dots

846
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:04,453
isn't going anywhere. It's wildly successful.

847
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:08,576
It's iterating incredibly fast. Month on month on month it gets better and cooler

848
00:45:08,936 --> 00:45:11,738
and grander. Coming in on top of that to say well

849
00:45:11,778 --> 00:45:14,200
how do I make a sister game that sits next to that meaningfully?

850
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:18,512
meant I had to go through a process of deconstructing

851
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:20,113
all of the stuff about how 2Dots works,

852
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:21,054
but also where it's going,

853
00:45:21,454 --> 00:45:22,814
but also where this could go that's different.

854
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,855
It was just like no design challenge I'd ever had.

855
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:30,798
So, I exhort anybody out there

856
00:45:30,818 --> 00:45:32,499
who's working in an indie or art house space

857
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,401
to see if they can find a way to make a follow-up.

858
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,022
Now, I know that's not necessarily simple.

859
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:39,663
I know enough about being an indie

860
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,064
to know you don't always get an awful lot of choice

861
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:41,804
about what you do next.

862
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:43,905
If you can't make a follow-up for real,

863
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:45,526
And just pretend.

864
00:45:46,107 --> 00:45:47,007
Just do a thought experiment.

865
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:49,509
Just sit down with a thing that you made six months ago.

866
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,372
It's a very different process than doing a post-mortem.

867
00:45:52,992 --> 00:45:54,453
Go back to a thing that was finished

868
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:57,556
and imagine that you were gonna do a sequel to it.

869
00:45:57,576 --> 00:45:58,717
You were gonna release a new version of it

870
00:45:58,877 --> 00:46:00,598
three months, six months, a year from now,

871
00:46:01,379 --> 00:46:02,339
and see what it teaches you.

872
00:46:06,427 --> 00:46:13,112
Yeah, because you may not realize that there's a whole kind of design thinking that you're never confronting

873
00:46:14,173 --> 00:46:16,554
if you're working in a way that's more free-form and independent.

874
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:20,938
And then this is maybe one of the toughest takeaways for me.

875
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:24,520
I loved working independently, I loved the crazy things that I got to do.

876
00:46:25,421 --> 00:46:29,404
But I'm seeing now what being at a more focused studio is enabling me to do.

877
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,411
you know, reveling in that opportunity.

878
00:46:34,372 --> 00:46:35,692
Alex Fleetwood, who isn't here,

879
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:37,994
my business partner in Hide and Seek,

880
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,675
in the time, we shut out Hide and Seek

881
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:43,697
three years ago, I think, maybe three and a bit.

882
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,118
In the time since then, he's caught his breath

883
00:46:46,158 --> 00:46:48,439
and then come back with a project that was inspired by

884
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:50,940
a very, very, very embryonic project we did at Hide and Seek

885
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,161
maybe six or seven years ago.

886
00:46:52,181 --> 00:46:54,862
And he's spent...

887
00:46:57,653 --> 00:47:00,075
two and a bit years, and is now focusing energy

888
00:47:00,115 --> 00:47:02,597
of five or six people, and one thing and one thing only,

889
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:05,478
which is this, this is Beast of Balance, his new game.

890
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,021
He's been, he showed it at the last two GDCs,

891
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,903
he just told me earlier, today was the first time,

892
00:47:13,183 --> 00:47:16,265
this GDC was the first time where he came to show the game,

893
00:47:16,305 --> 00:47:17,626
instead of having to bring it in a suitcase,

894
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:20,207
when he got to San Francisco, he just went to the store,

895
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:22,089
and he bought a copy of it in the store,

896
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:23,149
and then brought it to the thing,

897
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:24,770
and it's a great and proud moment.

898
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:26,671
And I look at that, and,

899
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:29,869
It looks to me like two things.

900
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:32,229
It looks to me like a thing we could have made at Hide and Seek.

901
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:33,169
It's so much.

902
00:47:33,189 --> 00:47:33,770
You should check it out.

903
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,010
It's super cool and crazy and weird.

904
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,050
It's so much the kind of thing we love to make there.

905
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:42,771
It's like one part game, one part poem, one part educational app,

906
00:47:42,931 --> 00:47:44,872
one part sculpture.

907
00:47:46,132 --> 00:47:48,352
It's exactly the kind of thing that we love to do.

908
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,053
And it's also exactly the kind of thing

909
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:51,933
that we would never have accomplished.

910
00:47:52,053 --> 00:47:55,294
Because the way you do this is you do nothing else for two years.

911
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:57,714
And I think.

912
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,312
If I had it all to do again, I think as an indie,

913
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:07,114
we got bounced so much into trying to do everything

914
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,515
because we never wanted to turn anything down

915
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:09,676
and we never had the confidence

916
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,357
to just try and pick one thing.

917
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:15,120
And I do now really wonder what, you know,

918
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,901
some of those ideas I showed at the beginning

919
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:19,042
were cute ideas, that board game remix kit was a cute idea,

920
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:20,203
Tiny Games was a cute idea.

921
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:23,105
But we put this much focus into it

922
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:25,607
and then had to transfer it to something else.

923
00:48:25,787 --> 00:48:26,207
And I think,

924
00:48:28,835 --> 00:48:34,040
I think if I've learned anything moving into the commercial world,

925
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,702
actually, it's not about following the money,

926
00:48:36,762 --> 00:48:38,244
and it's not about worrying about the margins,

927
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:42,607
but it's about what a commercial,

928
00:48:42,948 --> 00:48:46,991
the focus that a commercial structure can enable

929
00:48:48,713 --> 00:48:50,074
that you struggle to get elsewhere.

930
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:53,737
Because that's really the thing, this, I opened with this,

931
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,740
this is Uncle Death, any Uncle Death fans?

932
00:48:58,627 --> 00:49:00,028
I can't see you, but there you go.

933
00:49:00,048 --> 00:49:02,408
So this is Uncle Death, he's your,

934
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:05,809
I don't know what he is, he's your mentor,

935
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:07,370
he's your bully, he's your something or other

936
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:13,012
in Let It Die, which is Suda51's weird,

937
00:49:14,392 --> 00:49:19,233
free-to-play console brawler.

938
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:24,351
And that's interesting because...

939
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:28,916
I mean, I picked him just because he was my favorite Grim Reaper I could find in games.

940
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:32,059
I try to find good devils in games, and it's a weird space.

941
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:37,564
Once you decide you don't want to do a Diablo thing, you don't know what else you're going to do.

942
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:38,965
His site's a golf club.

943
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:44,330
But yeah, so I picked him because he's cool.

944
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,953
But also, I mean, there is somebody who has...

945
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:52,529
whose career has taken him from making things that are very much on the margins

946
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:57,151
and very much kind of creatively auteur-style defined and delivered,

947
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:00,073
through to a point where, you know, I make free-to-play games,

948
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:02,254
and he makes free-to-play games now, and they're pretty different,

949
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:05,356
and, you know, we have nothing to do with each other,

950
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:07,917
but it seemed like an interesting end.

951
00:50:08,017 --> 00:50:11,099
But, so he's a cute choice of Grim Reaper, but he's not really appropriate,

952
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,621
because this is more about rebirth, I think.

953
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:16,742
We work in a super volatile industry.

954
00:50:16,862 --> 00:50:17,162
I don't...

955
00:50:18,193 --> 00:50:21,396
There's probably nobody here, or functionally nobody here,

956
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,620
who's been cozy and happy in the same company

957
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,802
for the last 25 years making the same kind of games.

958
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:29,065
That's not how it works for us.

959
00:50:29,646 --> 00:50:32,609
There's too many winds of change blowing around.

960
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:36,571
games. It's part of what we love about games. The technology changes or the business model changes

961
00:50:37,352 --> 00:50:43,214
or the audience changes or we uncover some kind of new control mechanism or new paradigm.

962
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:49,457
We're all dodging all of your stuff out there right now. It's never going to let us rest easy.

963
00:50:50,237 --> 00:50:56,580
And so for me the biggest thing I've learned in this transition is those fundamentals, that kind

964
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,683
of the work is the work core practice stuff, comes with you. Like even if everything else

965
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:07,424
falls apart and we, Hide and Seek had an elegant end.

966
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:09,484
We never hit that go bust date,

967
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,885
despite the fact it tried its best.

968
00:51:13,665 --> 00:51:15,825
And we were able to find the right moment to say,

969
00:51:15,925 --> 00:51:19,186
this isn't gonna work anymore and finish our projects,

970
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:20,046
close things down elegantly,

971
00:51:20,086 --> 00:51:22,247
treat everybody who worked there, I hope well.

972
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:23,807
We believe that we did that well.

973
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,208
Still felt god awful.

974
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:31,228
It felt absolutely excruciatingly miserable.

975
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:37,119
And I know that I'm not necessarily safe from that again in the future.

976
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:41,202
Right now I'm at a happy, successful company that all our expectations are,

977
00:51:41,242 --> 00:51:44,665
we'll continue to be happy and successful, but I've done this long enough to know that,

978
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,547
you know, there are fates that await game companies.

979
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:53,231
They get bought by less friendly game companies, or their fourth sequel doesn't do as well,

980
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:56,213
or they back the wrong horse in terms of a technology platform,

981
00:51:56,253 --> 00:51:57,934
or an input mechanism, or whatever it is.

982
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:07,094
So I probably won't be here forever either, but now I've got a clearer sense of how translatable

983
00:52:07,635 --> 00:52:10,516
the skills that I have are, not necessarily to different industries, but just to different places

984
00:52:10,596 --> 00:52:15,159
within the same industry. And I think we'll do better if we recognize that in each other,

985
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:21,382
that rather than just ending up with a much more kind of closed circle where indies know how to

986
00:52:21,402 --> 00:52:24,744
talk to indies but are skeptical about people who've come from a free-to-play background,

987
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:25,904
or vice versa, we...

988
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:30,828
recognize that there are fundamental capabilities

989
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:32,950
that transcend those categories.

990
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:36,574
That is what I have for you.

991
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:38,676
We're hiring.

992
00:52:40,678 --> 00:52:42,540
That's it, you're done, GDC's over!

993
00:52:57,935 --> 00:52:59,516
Your questions are welcome.

994
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:05,479
So the topic that was most interesting to me about the

995
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,181
transition, a lot of what you're describing to me feels

996
00:53:08,221 --> 00:53:10,883
like going from a consulting environment in some ways,

997
00:53:10,903 --> 00:53:13,144
because you're also doing projects for these corporate

998
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:13,545
clients.

999
00:53:14,742 --> 00:53:18,566
Going to free-to-play, the thing that has struck me,

1000
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:21,049
like coming to GDC over the last five years,

1001
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,952
was there was a lot of discussion about free-to-play

1002
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:28,377
where it was whales and it's about paywalls

1003
00:53:28,817 --> 00:53:33,542
and ads and offers and skinner boxes, frankly,

1004
00:53:33,803 --> 00:53:35,765
where it felt very skeevy to me.

1005
00:53:36,405 --> 00:53:39,227
So for me, when I'm thinking about free-to-play,

1006
00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:42,528
that's the part that creeps me out, to be perfectly honest,

1007
00:53:42,649 --> 00:53:43,009
is that.

1008
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:47,571
Obviously, Dots has a model.

1009
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,153
How much does that influence your design work,

1010
00:53:52,213 --> 00:53:55,315
how you feel about what you do, when you look at free-to-play

1011
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:56,515
and what you associate with?

1012
00:53:57,256 --> 00:53:59,697
So it's sort of a broad question.

1013
00:53:59,757 --> 00:54:00,197
No, I got it.

1014
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:00,397
Got it.

1015
00:54:07,634 --> 00:54:12,858
I, what's, DODS is a very classic free-to-play approach.

1016
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:16,701
And a thing that makes my life very easy

1017
00:54:16,841 --> 00:54:20,203
is that we don't, we don't do anything

1018
00:54:20,243 --> 00:54:23,446
we would be uncomfortable if our players knew about.

1019
00:54:23,466 --> 00:54:27,209
That's kind of our litmus is, would we feel okay

1020
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:29,270
about if someone who loved our game came in

1021
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:30,331
and said, how does this work?

1022
00:54:30,371 --> 00:54:31,913
And we went, oh, well, it's like this.

1023
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:36,116
Would they feel like we'd been tricking them?

1024
00:54:37,096 --> 00:54:39,037
There's a couple things that we're not super public about

1025
00:54:39,077 --> 00:54:40,718
just because they're complicated,

1026
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,261
but we'd very happily talk anyone through them at length.

1027
00:54:44,301 --> 00:54:45,441
It's just hard to put it in a tweet

1028
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:48,063
in a way that won't misconstrue.

1029
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:50,424
There's like a bunch of like super dense

1030
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:51,865
spawning rules around objects

1031
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:53,386
to make sure that the games stay fun

1032
00:54:53,446 --> 00:54:54,867
even when players do weird things.

1033
00:54:55,027 --> 00:54:56,608
And so those are hard to explain,

1034
00:54:56,648 --> 00:54:58,970
but they're designed only to make sure

1035
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,871
people continue to have happy game experiences.

1036
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:02,752
They're not revenue focused.

1037
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:12,614
It's weird. I've made games that are just supposed to be about joy.

1038
00:55:13,575 --> 00:55:16,277
I've made games that are in a consulting or educational environment

1039
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:21,781
where you're taking people to a point where there's some kind of threshold

1040
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:25,945
you have to cross. Where they have to learn a thing or do a thing.

1041
00:55:26,725 --> 00:55:30,909
Sometimes that thing is they have to click on a link to go to the Green Lantern trailer.

1042
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:34,031
And sometimes they have to prove that they've learned a Greek verb

1043
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:37,094
or sometimes whatever they are. And now I'm in this place where...

1044
00:55:38,995 --> 00:55:41,997
We have a sumptuous, expensive game that we give away for free,

1045
00:55:42,117 --> 00:55:44,119
and then we get people to a point where we say,

1046
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:48,143
if you want to keep going right now, you need to put your hand in your pocket.

1047
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:52,537
And those things just feel super identical to me.

1048
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:55,218
Like it's definitely not harder or weirder

1049
00:55:55,238 --> 00:55:57,099
to get somebody to give me a dollar

1050
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:58,940
than it is to get them to watch the Green Lantern trailer.

1051
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,041
And it's actually not that different.

1052
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:04,522
In fact, maybe quite a lot easier

1053
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:06,823
than when I'm designing a street game for Edinburgh,

1054
00:56:06,983 --> 00:56:10,184
where what I'm trying to construct

1055
00:56:10,684 --> 00:56:11,885
is a set of gaming incentives

1056
00:56:11,905 --> 00:56:14,426
where you will go and hold the hand of a stranger.

1057
00:56:15,736 --> 00:56:20,120
And frankly, if you give me the design challenge to make you give me a dollar,

1058
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,142
versus the one where you have to hold hands with a stranger, I'll take the dollar, right?

1059
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:24,163
That's easier.

1060
00:56:24,943 --> 00:56:29,667
So I think that the design challenge doesn't feel any different.

1061
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:30,248
It's about...

1062
00:56:33,174 --> 00:56:35,255
motivating your player and then restricting the resources

1063
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:36,775
that they have to reach the thing that you've motivated

1064
00:56:36,815 --> 00:56:38,716
them to reach, and then giving them interesting options

1065
00:56:39,456 --> 00:56:42,377
to resolve that restriction, and then spending

1066
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:44,418
is one of them, but you're always gonna wanna offer

1067
00:56:44,438 --> 00:56:47,639
your player that choice anyway, and so it's just

1068
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:49,079
what you swap in and out of those categories.

1069
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,640
That doesn't, it just feels exactly the same.

1070
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,221
Where it would feel different is if there was stuff

1071
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:55,582
that I thought was exploitative or underhanded,

1072
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,723
or designed to mislead or trick people.

1073
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,824
We just don't have any of that, so it seems easy.

1074
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,301
Is that at all helpful?

1075
00:57:05,601 --> 00:57:09,084
Yeah, I think if I was going to try to replay it,

1076
00:57:09,424 --> 00:57:11,445
the real core is, as long as you're

1077
00:57:11,465 --> 00:57:14,088
transparent with the users and you

1078
00:57:14,108 --> 00:57:17,330
feel ethical about what you're producing, it's OK.

1079
00:57:17,971 --> 00:57:20,312
And that might be part of that design process,

1080
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:22,674
too, about where do you put in your loops

1081
00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:23,975
and how do you construct them?

1082
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:25,696
Are these things feeling ethical or not?

1083
00:57:25,997 --> 00:57:28,719
If you feel good about it, then, well, you can sleep at night.

1084
00:57:29,527 --> 00:57:31,809
That's kind of what I think I'm hearing.

1085
00:57:32,029 --> 00:57:32,709
I think that's right.

1086
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,631
That doesn't feel at all controversial to me.

1087
00:57:37,252 --> 00:57:41,114
And I think some of it definitely comes from designing face-to-face with players.

1088
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:49,359
The model that I always have in my head is that an individual human is going to want to sit down and ask me questions

1089
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:51,800
about any design choice that I make.

1090
00:57:54,866 --> 00:57:56,888
Yeah, it kind of just makes it trivially easy.

1091
00:57:56,928 --> 00:57:59,150
It's like, do I know how to answer that person's questions?

1092
00:57:59,731 --> 00:58:00,732
Cool, then I'm doing the right thing.

1093
00:58:00,832 --> 00:58:03,114
If I'm uncomfortable, then we do something else.

1094
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:03,575
It's easy.

1095
00:58:03,615 --> 00:58:06,117
Yeah, that's helpful, because that also will allow me to,

1096
00:58:06,177 --> 00:58:07,559
one of the things I'm struggling,

1097
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:08,900
I'm sorry, you guys have a question,

1098
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,704
is how do I test out my monetization strategy?

1099
00:58:13,044 --> 00:58:15,386
And so if I can sit with somebody and face-to-face and.

1100
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:18,721
know that they're going to say, okay, well, no, that's skewier, that's good.

1101
00:58:18,741 --> 00:58:19,962
That also gives me a design.

1102
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:23,204
Well, I do, I, I, I pen and paper test all my monetization stuff.

1103
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:26,267
Well, I pen and money test all my monetization stuff.

1104
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:30,990
I have a cup of dollar bills on my desk and, and tokens and

1105
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,131
everything gets tested like that.

1106
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:32,951
Okay.

1107
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:33,172
Thank you.

1108
00:58:35,165 --> 00:58:35,345
Hi.

1109
00:58:36,005 --> 00:58:37,846
So there was another talk today.

1110
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:41,569
There's a researcher who is surveying game designers

1111
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:44,871
to get their definition of success.

1112
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:49,694
So what's your definition of success,

1113
00:58:49,774 --> 00:58:54,377
and did it change when you moved from one studio to the other?

1114
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:01,217
You didn't have to answer.

1115
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,058
Um, yeah, I've...

1116
00:59:03,078 --> 00:59:06,259
I have so far been 100% unsuccessful, I would say.

1117
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:10,720
I've never, like, I feel like I'd maybe be successful if I

1118
00:59:12,141 --> 00:59:14,781
made a thing that I felt was good and that I was proud of.

1119
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,402
I don't really feel like that.

1120
00:59:16,982 --> 00:59:20,123
Everything is full of compromises and missed opportunities.

1121
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:22,204
The games that I love...

1122
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:28,244
have a essentialism about them that you know that you couldn't, you can't change a single

1123
00:59:28,304 --> 00:59:36,348
rule of that game because it's just right, it's just perfect. And I'm fascinated by those games

1124
00:59:36,928 --> 00:59:42,971
and in all of them and I know I've not come close to making anything that good. So there's like,

1125
00:59:42,991 --> 00:59:48,153
I guess, yeah, I guess I have two definitions of success. There's that one which I haven't hit and

1126
00:59:48,173 --> 00:59:48,753
maybe I'll never hit.

1127
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,020
Keep trying.

1128
00:59:50,681 --> 00:59:53,521
And the other one is, oh my god, I make games for a living.

1129
00:59:54,782 --> 00:59:57,922
Any year where I can pull that together is a success.

1130
00:59:58,722 --> 01:00:00,683
And I've done it for 10, and maybe I'll

1131
01:00:00,703 --> 01:00:01,723
get to do it for more.

1132
01:00:02,623 --> 01:00:07,064
And I think as long as I'm within that ethical territory,

1133
01:00:07,745 --> 01:00:10,365
I'm not that fussy about what it is,

1134
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:14,266
because it's this weird, wonderful, absorbing task

1135
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:15,747
that I'm nowhere near tired of yet.

1136
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:23,999
I just want to say I really loved your talk and the really personal, wander-y style you

1137
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:24,260
used.

1138
01:00:25,382 --> 01:00:29,589
I think it's fantastic and very honest and I appreciate that.

1139
01:00:30,691 --> 01:00:31,332
Now for my question.

1140
01:00:33,974 --> 01:00:36,856
You've talked a lot about, or hinted at your design process,

1141
01:00:37,056 --> 01:00:39,498
and it seems to be pretty rigorous and rational.

1142
01:00:40,259 --> 01:00:42,060
But also, I think a lot of people in free-to-play,

1143
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,602
especially in mobile, feel that there's an element of luck

1144
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:47,124
to a game becoming a smash hit.

1145
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,686
And I would like your thoughts on that.

1146
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:54,469
Do you believe, for example, Dots was mostly genius

1147
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:55,190
with a bit of luck?

1148
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:57,691
Do you feel like it was a lot of luck with a bit of genius,

1149
01:00:58,272 --> 01:01:00,654
or hard work, or good process, or, you know?

1150
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:04,375
coming from a good design thing.

1151
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:07,317
Yeah, that's my ill-formed question for you.

1152
01:01:08,657 --> 01:01:13,379
I mean, the cheat answer to that is

1153
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:14,580
it's always about the work,

1154
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,581
and the work needs to be perfect,

1155
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:19,802
and then luck is the thing on top of that.

1156
01:01:19,862 --> 01:01:20,882
But I don't think you believe that,

1157
01:01:20,902 --> 01:01:22,443
and I know I don't believe that.

1158
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:23,704
I mean, I'll tell you this.

1159
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:25,444
The last game I launched was Dots & Co.,

1160
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:29,086
and we launched it two weeks after a thing.

1161
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:29,826
Was it?

1162
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:33,400
Pokemon Go was that game?

1163
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,661
Yeah, so that just changes the fundamental dynamics

1164
01:01:37,721 --> 01:01:40,282
of the App Store charts in a way

1165
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:41,343
that you have no control over.

1166
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:44,944
And that was very different from when

1167
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:49,105
we launched our previous game, where the App Store wins

1168
01:01:49,145 --> 01:01:50,946
blue in our direction, not against us.

1169
01:01:51,826 --> 01:01:54,787
And so that kind of thing.

1170
01:01:57,027 --> 01:02:01,068
It's like a really identifiable quantifiable kind of luck.

1171
01:02:01,128 --> 01:02:03,209
Like that's not some weird, you know,

1172
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:04,729
touchy feely, don't know.

1173
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:13,272
Here's, I guess,

1174
01:02:14,092 --> 01:02:17,914
maybe my slightly more sophisticated cheat answer here,

1175
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:22,975
is we are really bad at clearly differentiating

1176
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:24,276
between luck and capital.

1177
01:02:26,697 --> 01:02:30,358
One of the reasons that nothing we did at Hide and Seek

1178
01:02:30,398 --> 01:02:31,998
ever got off the ground was it was partly because

1179
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:33,499
we had too many things going on,

1180
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:34,839
and in some cases I'm sure it was probably

1181
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:35,800
because we were bad at our jobs.

1182
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,961
But we could never afford more than one roll of the dice.

1183
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:40,561
We'd put this thing out there and if it didn't work,

1184
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:42,802
we weren't gonna eat that month,

1185
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:44,403
so we had to run and do something else instead.

1186
01:02:45,443 --> 01:02:46,203
Big companies.

1187
01:02:47,428 --> 01:02:49,970
get lucky, because they can try over and over.

1188
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:53,432
And that doesn't even necessarily look like

1189
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:56,714
launching a thing that doesn't work

1190
01:02:56,734 --> 01:02:57,494
and then launching a new thing

1191
01:02:57,514 --> 01:02:58,495
and then launching a new thing.

1192
01:02:59,836 --> 01:03:01,517
2Dots has been alive for three years.

1193
01:03:01,937 --> 01:03:03,438
Over the course of that three years,

1194
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:05,740
we've been able to make all kinds of additions

1195
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,761
and amends and alterations to it.

1196
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:10,263
We've been able to bring it out on extra platforms,

1197
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:11,644
we've been able to do all of these things.

1198
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:14,886
You know, that's a game that's been commercially successful

1199
01:03:14,906 --> 01:03:15,586
all the way through,

1200
01:03:16,647 --> 01:03:16,887
but...

1201
01:03:18,522 --> 01:03:20,604
if we hadn't been a studio with income,

1202
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:22,165
if we hadn't been a studio with investment,

1203
01:03:23,006 --> 01:03:24,467
had we hit more bumps in the road,

1204
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:25,488
they would have killed us dead

1205
01:03:25,528 --> 01:03:26,889
and we wouldn't have been able to do anything about it.

1206
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:34,960
I'm not saying luck still isn't a factor, but when you look at a specific thing and

1207
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,585
think well those specific people got lucky, it's worth broadening your examination of

1208
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:43,789
the odds to say well how many rolls of the dice did they get, and how many rolls of the

1209
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:48,574
dice am I going to get, and how do I sustain myself through those things.

1210
01:03:48,934 --> 01:03:51,116
And then you just try and get smart about the other stuff.

1211
01:03:52,077 --> 01:03:52,478
We couldn't...

1212
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:55,619
We couldn't quite have navigated around Pokemon Go,

1213
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:57,600
but we were navigating around a bunch of other stuff

1214
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,821
in the app store that we did know about,

1215
01:03:58,841 --> 01:04:01,822
that we had researched, that we had kept our ears open for.

1216
01:04:02,482 --> 01:04:04,303
You can certainly mitigate that kind of risk.

1217
01:04:05,523 --> 01:04:08,724
And similarly with how you're handling

1218
01:04:09,945 --> 01:04:11,325
market testing of visual assets,

1219
01:04:12,126 --> 01:04:13,486
or you know you love them,

1220
01:04:13,506 --> 01:04:14,627
but is anyone else gonna love them?

1221
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:18,808
You can amortize a bunch of that stuff,

1222
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,629
but never all of it.

1223
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:22,590
Slightly less cheaty answer?

1224
01:04:24,082 --> 01:04:25,443
Absolutely, I think that's a really great model

1225
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:27,224
for thinking about it, thank you.

1226
01:04:27,845 --> 01:04:28,165
Thank you.

1227
01:04:31,127 --> 01:04:32,408
We're done, it's all over.

1228
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:34,450
Margarita time, thank you everyone.
