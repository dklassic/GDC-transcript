1
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:09,778
People, welcome.

2
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:13,684
It is Friday, the last day of GDC 2017.

3
00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:16,988
This is Achieving Two Worlds Every Year,

4
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:19,772
how Magic the Gathering sustainably doubled

5
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:20,573
its world building.

6
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:25,755
To tell you a little bit about who I am and potentially why you should care.

7
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:32,056
My name is Jeremy Jarvis. I am the principal designer of worlds and IP for Magic.

8
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:37,517
My background is in freelance illustration. I was one of the last water colorists.

9
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:43,599
And I was hired in-house in 2005 as lead concept artist for Magic.

10
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:49,920
I failed upwards within a year to be senior art director for Magic and spent a decade in that role.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:49,980
So...

12
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:54,363
From Lorwyn to anything you've seen now,

13
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:56,725
I personally art directed that world.

14
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,949
I commissioned and art directed over 9,000 cards.

15
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,750
I was the sole art director for a while.

16
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,493
So that thing you remember from the last decade,

17
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,294
that great magic card, I did that.

18
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:11,077
That thing you remember from the last decade that you hate,

19
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,580
screw it, I did that too, whatever.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,321
God don't give with both hands.

21
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,903
So that is who I am.

22
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:19,324
Why you should care.

23
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,370
I don't know, they gave me a microphone for an hour,

24
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:25,033
so maybe you shouldn't.

25
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:26,876
On a related note, please rate this talk.

26
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:32,445
It's important to GDC, it's important to the track,

27
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:33,347
it's important to me.

28
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:34,569
So.

29
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,055
Full disclosure, this will be one of those

30
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:39,555
oddly specific talks.

31
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:42,416
So we are going to be talking about Magic the Gathering.

32
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,676
I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with Magic

33
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:46,477
and are players or fans.

34
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,417
Those of you that are other industry professionals,

35
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,638
I know you don't make analog card games.

36
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:52,459
We are going to be talking about Magic,

37
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,959
an analog card game, and specifically,

38
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,160
a lot of the examples are going to be about Kaladesh

39
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,660
because that is the most recent public set

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,201
and I can show you some behind the scenes stuff from it.

41
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:03,181
So.

42
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:08,923
While we're talking about world building and how we achieve world building, this is what the talk's really about.

43
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:14,685
Creating and maximizing flexible solutions to solve inflexible needs.

44
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:19,626
The reason I didn't call the talk that was, holy God, did you hear how that sounds?

45
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:22,047
So we're going to be talking about world building.

46
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:26,308
So here is a brief history of magic, in case you don't know.

47
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:32,333
Magic was created and introduced at Gen Con in 1993.

48
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:36,336
Its original genesis was as a way to spend time

49
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,457
between games of D&D.

50
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:44,100
So 1993 to 2017, someone at work helped me do the math.

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,582
That's 24 years, 24 years of product releases.

52
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:50,364
Let me help you visualize what that looks like.

53
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,870
Each of these logos represents hundreds of cards

54
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,172
to the outside world.

55
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,917
To us at Wizards, it represents learning and iteration.

56
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:06,321
And this is the stuff from before when I started working,

57
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:07,523
so let's talk about the better stuff.

58
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:12,505
I want to say Cold Snap was not my fault.

59
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:16,346
It was not my fault. I was there, but we were just following orders.

60
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:26,850
So over these 24 years, through all of these product releases, we have learned, we've iterated,

61
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,812
and I want to talk about what magic is today and how we've grown through those 24 years.

62
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,634
So here's what we look like.

63
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:42,726
Magic is still a card game, we're a really great card game,

64
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:47,887
but we approach our worlds as cinematic and immersive.

65
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,808
We want players to believe in them and care about them

66
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:52,348
and care about our characters.

67
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:54,709
This is our quality bar.

68
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,589
We have set it so high for ourselves

69
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:59,350
and now people expect it and we love to deliver on that.

70
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,110
We want to be world class in the way we look,

71
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,031
what our look feel is, our world building,

72
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:05,951
because we want to be in the company

73
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,352
of the other great games we enjoy and are fans of.

74
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:12,174
And we do this twice a year now.

75
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:14,697
We build these worlds twice a year.

76
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:20,783
So, I wanna talk about some context around what that means,

77
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:24,046
what it takes to achieve those two worlds a year.

78
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:26,508
So let's start with the challenges.

79
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:30,447
It is not blue sky world building.

80
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:34,068
It would be awesome if the job was just twice a year,

81
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:36,209
create two crazy good worlds, right?

82
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:37,290
That's hard enough.

83
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,271
But it's not.

84
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:40,511
There are constraints.

85
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,793
The first constraint is the very fundamental

86
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,653
nature of magic.

87
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:46,894
The five colors of magic.

88
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:50,515
Every world we build has to cover those five colors.

89
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:51,856
It's a five up.

90
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,218
There are land types.

91
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:58,018
associated with those five colors of magic.

92
00:04:58,058 --> 00:04:59,578
That's magic's resource system.

93
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:02,519
If there is a world premise that can't accommodate

94
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,920
those five land types, we don't get to do it.

95
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,201
Crazy fire elemental world, that's pretty cool, right?

96
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,121
Are there islands?

97
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,221
No, not gonna do it.

98
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:12,582
It's just the nature of it.

99
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:20,347
Other constraints, again it's not blue sky, we are always working with a mechanical theme.

100
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:24,169
We very much believe that magic is at our best.

101
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:29,152
We are doing our best work when the world creative and the set's mechanics are lock

102
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:30,153
step with each other.

103
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:33,435
Examples of those mechanical centers, artifacts matter.

104
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:36,716
Enchantments Matter, Color Pairs, Big Creatures,

105
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:39,217
and you've seen the output of us working

106
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,457
in these mechanical spaces.

107
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:43,078
Artifacts in Kaladesh, Enchantments in Theros,

108
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,639
Color Pairs, of course, Ravnica and its guilds,

109
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:48,340
Big Creatures, the Eldrazi of Zendikar.

110
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:52,642
So again, we're starting with a confined space

111
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:55,403
based on trying to do the best creative

112
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:57,604
for the mechanics for the set.

113
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:00,084
I want to show you our creature grid.

114
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:02,606
This is a visualization of what we call the creature grid.

115
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:05,848
This has to be solved for every set.

116
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:07,529
The cards will demand it.

117
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,032
There will be small blue flyers in a set.

118
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,874
And just to kind of explain the constraint space,

119
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:16,275
the squares that are X'd out,

120
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:17,776
magic doesn't do those.

121
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,797
Red no longer gets small flyers.

122
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:23,918
We get medium and large flyers in red, dragons and whatnot.

123
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:28,799
If an artist creates the best, coolest flying Hydra

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,160
in the mind of man and God, we don't

125
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,481
get to use it because green doesn't get flying

126
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,401
and Hydras are green.

127
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,962
So I want to talk about one of these boxes in particular,

128
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:42,483
just to kind of talk about the constraints, for Kaladesh.

129
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:47,158
Let's just talk about medium-sized black non-flyers.

130
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:50,660
Now typically, the default, the go-to,

131
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,261
is vampires and zombies.

132
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:55,262
But remember, we were trying to do a specific thing

133
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:55,923
with Kaladesh.

134
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:00,656
It's optimistic, it's beautiful, it's brightly lit.

135
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:03,279
Can you imagine what zombies and vampires

136
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,860
would have felt like here?

137
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:06,702
Oh, God, who is that for?

138
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:07,804
That makes no one happy.

139
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:12,028
But it probably makes a couple people happy,

140
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:14,671
and I can't speak to that.

141
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:21,276
So again, the cards are going to demand answers for that square.

142
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:25,280
So for Kaladesh, we created a new fantasy race.

143
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,743
We created the Aetherborn, which Kaladesh

144
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,325
is about a plane of inventors that uses ether

145
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,387
to power these crazy inventions.

146
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,829
And as a result of that ether use,

147
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,433
these Aetherborn are a living output of that cycle.

148
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,195
And they are short-lived.

149
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:43,856
They are opulent.

150
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,776
They're pretty selfish, which is why they're black,

151
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:46,976
because they know they're short-lived.

152
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,777
You can see that they kind of crumble away,

153
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,697
releasing the ether back into the environment.

154
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:52,698
So they're beautiful.

155
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,198
They fit within Kaladesh.

156
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:55,919
They're kind of romantically tragic.

157
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,340
And more importantly, they are very of Kaladesh.

158
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,581
They fit the world cosmology.

159
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:08,729
And all of that work, and it was a lot of work, that's one box.

160
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,170
There are lots of boxes.

161
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,651
They all have to be solved for everything.

162
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:15,292
Another constraint.

163
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:18,093
Now that we're going to two worlds a year,

164
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:20,354
it is more important than ever that we do what

165
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,035
we call swinging the pendulum.

166
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:30,038
So starting with the open vistas and the beauty of Zendikar

167
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:33,900
to the kind of quiet, tight, claustrophobic dread

168
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,760
of Innistrad.

169
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:38,640
to the bright sky and optimism of Kaladesh.

170
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,468
to Amonkhet, which comes out in a few weeks,

171
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:43,569
and I can't really talk about it.

172
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:44,689
But it's not Kaladesh.

173
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,932
We know it's important to change the look

174
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:50,694
and the tone of the settings, because we need people

175
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,535
to be excited twice as often now.

176
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,856
We're going to two worlds a year.

177
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:58,439
So we are constantly planning, not only as we world build,

178
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:02,242
to keep it off the last world, but to keep it off the worlds

179
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:03,462
that we're going to do.

180
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,604
So we have to be deliberate with our spins.

181
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:15,234
Most of those are creative constraints or constraints given to us by the card set.

182
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:17,055
Let's talk about a logistical one.

183
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,997
Simultaneous global release.

184
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:24,361
Our dates will not move. There is no soft launch. There is no soft patch.

185
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:27,343
We cannot move by a day because of this.

186
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,863
We print magic in 11 languages.

187
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:36,685
We sell it in over 70, seven zero markets around the world.

188
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:39,146
And it has to hit those stores at the same day.

189
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:41,927
Our organized play system around the world,

190
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:44,128
tournament organizers have rented venues

191
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,409
sometimes years in advance.

192
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,250
Our dates are not gonna move.

193
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,770
That's a very hard constraint.

194
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,374
OK, so with that pile of constraints in mind,

195
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:56,055
let's talk about what our inflexible need is.

196
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,855
We need to build two worlds every year.

197
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,156
It is our release model.

198
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:03,576
It is what the organization demands.

199
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:07,537
Now, in order to do that, we need two of these every year,

200
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:08,737
a world guide.

201
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:13,698
It is the world guide that allows us to ensure quality

202
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:17,919
and ensure a vision across all of the cards within a setting.

203
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,360
Because.

204
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:23,085
It is a global talent pool that we have

205
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:25,646
built to illustrate the cards.

206
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,846
I don't think a lot of people realize

207
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,387
that it is zero people's job within the walls of Wizards

208
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:33,628
of the Coast to paint magic cards.

209
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:35,948
We do not have an art studio set up.

210
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:39,189
All of it is outsourced to this robust illustration

211
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,990
pipeline of the most talented people

212
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,290
that we can find to be our partners in bringing

213
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,171
the worlds to life.

214
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,291
So it is that world guide that allows

215
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,051
us to fully utilize.

216
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:52,276
that worldwide talent pool.

217
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:55,003
And we are constantly adding to that talent pool

218
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,450
because we have to, because we're going

219
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,453
to make lots and lots of cards.

220
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:05,062
So the world guide has to be rich enough and robust enough

221
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:07,345
to cover the needs of all of the cards.

222
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,808
It is hundreds of concept illustrations

223
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:12,810
and often hundreds of pages.

224
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,790
It's not just for artists.

225
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,052
It's for writers as well.

226
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,395
And so it's not just a simple turnaround per race.

227
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:23,319
We need variation and variety because cards,

228
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,041
because lots of cards.

229
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:27,043
And that's not even, that's not close.

230
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,891
That's close, but still not right.

231
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,932
About 450 cards.

232
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:36,755
A normal block needs about 450 cards

233
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,818
worth of illustrated content.

234
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:42,300
And remember that these are game objects.

235
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,881
The art has a job to do.

236
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,023
If you misread a card based on the art,

237
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,245
even upside down and across the table,

238
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,146
that can cost someone a game.

239
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:53,528
And right at the kitchen table, that sucks.

240
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:56,811
Losing a pro tour because of it is terrible.

241
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:57,632
And so.

242
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:01,873
there is a real job for that world guide to do.

243
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,694
It has to do a lot of lifting.

244
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:06,815
All right, so let's recap what our needs are.

245
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,036
We need two world guides a year.

246
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:11,717
Each one has to cover 450 cards.

247
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:15,438
They are working from a constrained mechanical space.

248
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:18,539
We have set ourselves a very high quality bar

249
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,960
that we love and now players expect.

250
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,781
Our dates will not move.

251
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,881
And we have

252
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:28,502
Two concept artists in-house.

253
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,184
We do this with two concept artists.

254
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:34,546
And we've trained the organization to expect that pile

255
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,387
of assets to happen in three weeks.

256
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,689
So let's talk about our solution.

257
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,271
Our solution to all of those constraints

258
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:49,033
and to all of the demand is contractors.

259
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,914
We bring in contractors just like everyone else.

260
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:51,655
That's what we do.

261
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,737
What if that was the talk and I just walked off right now?

262
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:58,843
So we do bring in contractors.

263
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:00,865
We bring in five people for three weeks.

264
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,927
But the real solution is our concept push.

265
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,309
And so what we're going to be talking about

266
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:09,711
is how we have learned to organize ourselves

267
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:13,253
and to optimize our processes for this solution

268
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,575
to be sustainable and successful.

269
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:17,736
All right, so let's dig into that.

270
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:19,398
Let's start with the simpler time.

271
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,328
I'm nostalgic about this, when this was our release model,

272
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:28,889
and we only, only had to build one incredible world a year.

273
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,410
What takes Hollywood six to eight years,

274
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,210
and a lot of games, two to four.

275
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,231
We just had to build one a year.

276
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,472
One world guide would cover three sets,

277
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,093
and then there was a core set that historically did not

278
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,353
need concept support.

279
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:45,614
So within that model.

280
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:50,917
Let's break down our solution and how we've made it work.

281
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,958
Let's start with Magic R&D's organization.

282
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,901
We have our noble and righteous creatives.

283
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:02,663
We have our game designers.

284
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:10,928
And both of these halves of R&D

285
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:13,670
report in to the same leadership body.

286
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,244
And that's magic R. I might really be in trouble right now.

287
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:23,306
My department has not seen this.

288
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:26,288
So that is magic R&D.

289
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:29,350
And the point here is our creatives are not a

290
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,371
service department.

291
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,872
We do not want a culture of handoffs.

292
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:36,415
We are literally the same team and not in the touchy-feely,

293
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:39,157
we're all on the same team for magic sense.

294
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,484
in the sense of we share bosses, right?

295
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:45,568
That's the sort of integration we want for magic.

296
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:49,112
Again, because we believe ourselves to be at our best

297
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:52,396
when mechanics and world creative is lockstep.

298
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:55,359
And this is the most fundamental visualization

299
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,683
of us wanting that to be true.

300
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:00,585
We are literally organized that way.

301
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:05,805
Now, our process, again, we want integration,

302
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,866
not a culture of handoffs.

303
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:11,208
Here is a visualization of our process.

304
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,610
Now, you start with a block concept

305
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,012
that can be bottom-up, like a mechanical desire,

306
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:20,554
like two-color factions, or it can be top-down,

307
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:22,516
like magic does Egypt world.

308
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,197
We agree on the block concept,

309
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:28,119
and then both of those wings of R&D start working.

310
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,261
And very quickly, we start sharing members

311
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,102
between the teams.

312
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:36,803
We have a design member on our initial world building team,

313
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:38,644
then they move into vision design,

314
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:41,384
we have a creative liaison on the vision design team.

315
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:45,205
We are constantly informing and responding to each other

316
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,526
and collaborating through the entire process.

317
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,326
And yes, there are handoffs,

318
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,047
like a process can only be so soft,

319
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,907
but we are not a culture of handoffs.

320
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:54,527
We want to be a culture of integration

321
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:58,228
for the good of the product, for the fun of the player.

322
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:03,325
So I'm going to give you a couple examples of how this can potentially break down.

323
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:07,048
It's a little bit of a cautionary tale.

324
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:09,310
2011, we introduced Innistrad to the world.

325
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,652
Innistrad's mechanical center is Graveyard Matters.

326
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:17,376
Things going into the graveyard, coming out of the graveyard, being in the graveyard.

327
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:22,861
And so it's creepy, it's gothic horror, there are vampires, there are zombies.

328
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:24,522
So, makes sense, right?

329
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:26,804
Graveyard Matters, gothic horror.

330
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,244
A decade before, another set had that same mechanical center.

331
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,226
Odyssey was also Graveyard Matters.

332
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:38,208
Things going into the graveyard, coming out of the graveyard, being in the graveyard.

333
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:46,115
It was about pit fights and these octopus people called Cephalids and Merfolk and an

334
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,796
artifact called the Mirari.

335
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:50,298
There were Aven and Cartographers.

336
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:52,639
Graveyard matters, right?

337
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:56,760
Now at some point, clearly, if you A-B the two,

338
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,620
Odyssey broke down somehow.

339
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,781
There was a disconnect from too many handoffs

340
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:05,061
or not enough integration,

341
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:07,782
and the creative and the mechanical center

342
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,262
just diverged from each other.

343
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,503
And it's not that it looks bad, it looks great.

344
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:13,723
There's a lot of great art in Odyssey,

345
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:16,884
but the world concept is certainly not lockstep

346
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:19,745
with the creative center, with the mechanical center.

347
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,265
So they got a little lost and disconnected

348
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:23,486
through that process.

349
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:24,866
We don't want that.

350
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,709
So phasing our own work, front-loading the problem space,

351
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,790
this is where we in creative especially

352
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,451
have really learned through iteration.

353
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,191
How much work of our own work,

354
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,272
the work that we are going to do anyway,

355
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:45,133
how much of that is healthy to front-load?

356
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,534
And here's why it's important for the concept push.

357
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:50,130
We have three weeks.

358
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,912
We don't have time to shop.

359
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:55,595
We don't have time to have that, I'll know it when I see it,

360
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,796
art director attitude.

361
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,238
Again, we don't have that art studio setup.

362
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,960
If we did, OK, fine.

363
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,401
That might be a great attitude to have.

364
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,162
We don't have that luxury.

365
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:05,944
And so.

366
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,207
We don't want to be overly prescriptive to the artists,

367
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,969
but we do want to know enough about our own work

368
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,251
to set them up for success so they don't come in

369
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,813
and waste time blindly swinging.

370
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,275
And here's a healthy balance we found

371
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:21,178
in what work is productive and healthy to front load.

372
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,983
Codifying what magic's twist on the given subject matter is.

373
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:29,065
Here is a real world example.

374
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,006
This is Amonkhet.

375
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,815
people can hear the same word and get to different places mentally.

376
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:39,318
Magic does Egypt world. Okay, we needed to codify

377
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:43,701
that this is not dirty, dead, archaeology, tomb raiding world.

378
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:47,264
This is a living, thriving, beautiful fantasy Egypt.

379
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:54,370
It is magic's take on Egyptian mythology and it is the stronghold of Nicol Bolas.

380
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:58,394
And so just codifying that so that people are able to jump in and hit the

381
00:18:58,414 --> 00:18:58,914
ground running.

382
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,809
Also, codifying what's off the table.

383
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,891
What parts of a given genre or trope space

384
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,033
are we not interested in seeing?

385
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:10,875
Again, we have to be stingy with subject matter

386
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,836
if we want to keep making magic sets,

387
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:15,438
so we will take stuff off the table for future us.

388
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:18,180
A great example from Kaladesh

389
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,942
is we wanted this plane of inventors

390
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,583
where there's going to be a lot of artifacts,

391
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:24,524
a lot of people, a lot of artifact creatures.

392
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:27,727
We wanted that to be about innovation and optimism.

393
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:31,075
not about a rise of the machine story.

394
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,616
And just saying a plane of inventors

395
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:35,957
that create artifact creatures, it

396
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:38,698
would be very easy for people's minds to go there.

397
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:41,359
We went ahead and just nailed that down on the front end.

398
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,360
Don't bother making cards about that.

399
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,220
Don't bother drawing pictures of it.

400
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:46,661
We're not doing that here.

401
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,774
What fantasy races populate the world and why?

402
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:53,936
And this really goes back to that creature grid.

403
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:57,039
We try to make those decisions up front,

404
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,782
whether there are elves here or naga, what they're doing,

405
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:04,946
what are they about, what is our white non-human race?

406
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:05,727
Is it leonin?

407
00:20:05,827 --> 00:20:06,647
Is it dwarves?

408
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,328
Are they in red?

409
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:07,969
Are they in white?

410
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,451
We need to make those decisions instead of being like,

411
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:11,152
I don't know.

412
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,033
You know, we'll know it when I see it, feel it out.

413
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:14,295
Maybe elves, maybe not.

414
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:17,879
And I don't mind telling you that we used to make that mistake.

415
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,460
That's why we've learned so much about this.

416
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,125
The attitude used to be, hey, words are more flexible,

417
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:25,527
more responsive than art is.

418
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:28,991
So let the artist come in and do a bunch of impressive work,

419
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,753
and then the writing will cater to that.

420
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:36,657
And what we realized iteration over iteration is we were wasting a lot of time.

421
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:42,480
Sometimes we were frustrating the artists and we ended up after the concept push still having

422
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,423
too much work to do to get to a hard stop. And so that is one of the conversations we

423
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:52,826
front load making decisions about the creature grid. This one's related.

424
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,748
What groups are here and how are they awesome?

425
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:02,450
A lot of times we have creative super types, whether that is a guild or a clan or a faction.

426
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:11,233
And the way we approach setting artists up for success so they're not blindly swinging

427
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:16,115
without being prescriptive because we don't want to tell them what to come in and draw.

428
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:21,017
Right? If we wanted to say Boros is about pointy helmets and curvy swords,

429
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:24,799
we could be working with much less talented people to get those results.

430
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:28,301
We want to be working with the most talented illustrators

431
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:33,163
that we possibly can, and we want to give them as much freedom as we possibly can.

432
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,985
But at the end of the day, we still need our worlds to be our vision.

433
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:40,387
and we still need to make sure that our needs are met.

434
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,630
And so we talk about and front load

435
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,532
what these groups are doing, what they care about,

436
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:48,313
what their role in the world is,

437
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:51,155
so we can talk about Boros through the lens

438
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:53,517
of kind of righteous military

439
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:55,698
and let them solve what that means visually

440
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:58,600
instead of wasting their time talking about curvy swords.

441
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:03,180
So that's mostly what we front load,

442
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,903
and that takes us to our first milestone

443
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:09,447
to set ourself up for success,

444
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,829
which is the kickoff document.

445
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,372
This is literally a picture

446
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:16,014
of the Kaladesh kickoff document.

447
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:21,738
There is, it is not an impressive achievement of technology, but it is a great achievement

448
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:25,501
of thought and us, again, front-loading the work that we're going to do anyway.

449
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:30,605
There's also a presentation, and it's what we use on the first day of a concept push

450
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:36,069
to present to the artist, to compel them and excite them towards our vision of the world.

451
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:37,530
Because

452
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:40,996
The more invested, you guys know this, any given creative is,

453
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:42,438
the better the work they're going to do.

454
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:44,602
So we give them as much freedom as possible.

455
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:46,946
We give them the kickoff presentation

456
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,369
and let them start working.

457
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,830
This is where we start to create a feedback loop.

458
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,590
We use that global freelance talent pool

459
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,431
to staff these concept pushes.

460
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,832
So I'm gonna talk more about the feedback loop later,

461
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:06,092
and I don't mean feedback loop in the like,

462
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:09,733
healthy communication with time to pivot sort of way.

463
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:12,454
I mean feedback loop in the audio sense

464
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:16,235
of when the microphone becomes aware of its own output,

465
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:17,975
when the originator of a signal

466
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,655
becomes aware of its own output.

467
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:21,196
So remember the feedback loop,

468
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:22,336
we're gonna talk more about that later.

469
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:26,200
So, we're going to bring in five artists for three weeks.

470
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,985
They're going to be our partners in an incredibly important phase of making magic.

471
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:37,511
So, here's how we maximize that concept team.

472
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:45,827
Certain worlds have needs that others do not,

473
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:50,109
and we're able to cater those five slots to specialists

474
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:52,110
that can address that problem space.

475
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,711
A great example is Ravnica.

476
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:57,573
Ravnica is a plane covered entirely by city,

477
00:23:58,454 --> 00:23:59,534
and so guess what you need?

478
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:03,697
a lot of artists who are very comfortable with a lot of architecture.

479
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:06,799
We can even add people if we need to.

480
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,363
So again, this is where the flexibility of the concept push concept really starts to

481
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:13,004
come into play.

482
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:18,067
We are able to ensure team culture, which is important.

483
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:21,970
Again, like it's because we are drawing from our freelancers.

484
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:28,096
It's been college since a lot of these people were in a collaborative environment.

485
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:30,799
Some of them have never been in an office environment.

486
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:36,726
And it's been a long time since they've stood at a wall with other people and received open

487
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:37,967
feedback about their work.

488
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:41,151
So it's really important that the people we pick

489
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:46,022
are going to give us this sort of culture and not this sort of culture.

490
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:52,684
So if we have two illustrators that we think might not get along, we just don't bring them

491
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,585
in at the same time.

492
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,285
We get to make those decisions on a case-by-case basis.

493
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:03,908
We get to mitigate other challenges simply by who we're able to bring in.

494
00:25:03,928 --> 00:25:05,388
Like, just think about communication.

495
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:10,854
Because we are bringing in partners from around the world,

496
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:14,235
not all of them speak English as their first language.

497
00:25:14,675 --> 00:25:16,935
And that's fine, we just have to be aware of it

498
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,356
so we don't invite too many people at the same time

499
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:22,637
and get into a scenario where they are literally

500
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:25,658
having trouble communicating with each other or with us.

501
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,778
We are very deliberate about who comes in when

502
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,179
just to avoid potential issues.

503
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:38,963
And once we have made the decision about which five people are correct for the setting, that

504
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:40,044
is our second milestone.

505
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:47,346
We have hopefully created the optimal concept team for that particular world, for those

506
00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:48,426
particular challenges.

507
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:53,727
At this point, we have either set ourselves up with the right people to be able to come

508
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,808
in and hit the ground running, or we haven't.

509
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:57,148
It is a milestone.

510
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:04,025
So let's talk about how we structure those precious three weeks.

511
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,171
Week one, free exploration.

512
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:11,554
After we give the concept push kickoff,

513
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,456
that document and that presentation,

514
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:16,938
we let them just explore whatever spoke to them,

515
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:18,219
whatever excited them,

516
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,501
regardless of what their specialty is,

517
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,403
regardless of what we thought they were going to do.

518
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:24,224
First week is free reign.

519
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:25,785
We get a lot of weird stuff.

520
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,227
We don't end up using a lot of it,

521
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:30,729
but it can lead to the lightning strikes

522
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,311
that we don't ask for, that we didn't know we wanted.

523
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,373
And again, we're bringing in very talented people for a reason,

524
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:39,255
and we don't want to stop those lightning strikes from happening.

525
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:42,558
So, the first week, free reign.

526
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:47,041
Second week, we start to tighten up some.

527
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,823
We need to start to force the world to take shape.

528
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:53,866
This is an actual picture of one of our concept walls.

529
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:56,469
This is back from, looks like, the Theros concept push.

530
00:26:57,911 --> 00:27:00,133
And we have our first tyranny pass,

531
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:04,157
where the art director has to apologetically go and start

532
00:27:04,177 --> 00:27:05,959
to take stuff off the wall that's not working.

533
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,623
We start making decisions about materials and shape language.

534
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:18,492
We start to take design motifs and really loudly bless them to be spread across more

535
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:22,316
assets so that we start to work towards a unified world vision.

536
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:25,740
Week three, we get tactical.

537
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,302
We start to give assignments.

538
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:31,126
And as you all know, artists love assignments.

539
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:34,931
Regardless of it, that's Eric Duchamp,

540
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,192
regardless of that funny picture,

541
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:40,497
it really is a very positive process

542
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:41,178
because

543
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:45,080
After, it's just kind of tightening that funnel

544
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,061
of starting very broad and tightening up.

545
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,002
And they understand that by week three,

546
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:51,583
the challenge is now to be heroic.

547
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:54,465
I need you, talented artists, to solve

548
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:55,886
what a dragon is here for me.

549
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:58,827
I need you to fix this thing that isn't quite working yet.

550
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:01,048
And they really step up to that challenge.

551
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:04,110
So week three is tactical assignments.

552
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,792
And at the end of week three, we hit our third milestone.

553
00:28:09,023 --> 00:28:11,404
which is the resulting pile of concept art.

554
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:13,286
And it is a pile of stuff.

555
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:14,707
It's a lot of assets.

556
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:18,729
And at this milestone, the world guide

557
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:21,631
is either set up with the quality and the content it

558
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:23,012
needs, or it's not.

559
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,421
So there is a cleanup and finalization stage

560
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:31,702
where our two in-house concept artists take the reins

561
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,422
and really start doing the edits

562
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:35,423
and bringing things in line with each other

563
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:36,403
and filling holes.

564
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:38,764
And this can go on for some months

565
00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:42,324
as we really unify to ensure the quality and vision

566
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:43,285
of that world guide.

567
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:47,025
Because the world guide is our fourth, final,

568
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:48,726
and most important milestone.

569
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:52,928
When the world guide's done, the product, the cards,

570
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:57,250
our artist pool is either set up for success or it's not.

571
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:02,233
So that's the process that we've iterated on

572
00:29:02,553 --> 00:29:05,395
from Lorwyn through Khans of Tarkir.

573
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:11,178
And that simple life ended with Khans of Tarkir.

574
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,800
Then the need changed.

575
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:17,902
Our product release model moved from this

576
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:23,862
to this, two two-set blocks a year,

577
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:26,202
each with its own creative.

578
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:30,903
So what that meant was our inflexible need,

579
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:33,684
which was only one incredible world guide

580
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:36,124
to populate hundreds and hundreds of cards

581
00:29:36,364 --> 00:29:40,465
with world-class assets, turned into two of those.

582
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:41,906
We needed to do it twice.

583
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:46,947
Without sacrificing quality, we don't just get more time.

584
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:49,287
We don't get to double our head count.

585
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:54,990
And we had to figure out how to accomplish this and how to accomplish it sustainably.

586
00:29:57,073 --> 00:29:59,777
And so our new flexible solution was...

587
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:03,298
our old flexible solution, we just do it twice.

588
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:05,479
It's a flexible solution, it's scalable.

589
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,982
Like all of those learnings that allowed us to do it once

590
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:11,144
and how much is healthy to front load,

591
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:12,626
how our organization should work,

592
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:17,330
how we avoid a culture of handoffs,

593
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,972
all of those things work, it scales.

594
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:21,693
We just have to take ownership of it.

595
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:25,682
it did create a new problem.

596
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:28,044
This cleanup and finalization phase,

597
00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:29,986
we used to have months to do it.

598
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:33,269
And our concept artists no longer had that luxury.

599
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:35,391
And so we needed to find a new way

600
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,614
to get to a hard stop faster so that we could start

601
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:42,257
front loading that healthy work for the next push.

602
00:30:43,138 --> 00:30:48,343
And so in order to do that, our concept is still scalable.

603
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:49,303
We just did it more.

604
00:30:50,172 --> 00:30:59,038
So we have a small push after the push prime where three artists come in for another three

605
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:01,420
weeks and help us get to that hard stop.

606
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,543
This has led us to further customize who we invite in and when.

607
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:13,228
As an example, we bring in more international talent for that primary push and we have learned

608
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:19,292
that a really great thing to do for that follow-up push is bring in more local artists.

609
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:24,236
We have a lot of our illustrators, several of them, are local to the Seattle area.

610
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:27,138
They've been working with us for years and they're able to come in.

611
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:31,781
They understand that it's a different challenge, that the challenge is to clean up and edit

612
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:33,342
and help us get to that hard stop.

613
00:31:33,962 --> 00:31:36,024
And we have really built that relationship with them

614
00:31:36,404 --> 00:31:38,045
so less communication is needed.

615
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:39,526
They understand the job.

616
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:40,787
They understand what they're doing.

617
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:44,149
And they come in and just take a hatchet to it,

618
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:45,370
knock it out of the park.

619
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:49,953
So a flexible solution will scale.

620
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:52,195
That's literally how we do it.

621
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:54,336
Solving it for the first time, solving it

622
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:57,779
when it was just once a year, was actually much harder,

623
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:01,081
much harder than scaling it once we knew what we were doing.

624
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,111
This is tangential, but it's worth talking about.

625
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:07,992
The concept push as experience design.

626
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:12,093
There is a potential pitfall in this wonderful, flexible

627
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:12,593
solution.

628
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:16,335
That pitfall is it depends on freelance illustrators,

629
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:17,796
very talented ones.

630
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,037
Those freelance illustrators have all the work

631
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:22,057
they want to do.

632
00:32:22,778 --> 00:32:23,738
They owe us nothing.

633
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:25,078
They can say no.

634
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:27,539
And we need them to want to say yes.

635
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,721
because we want that level of talent in-house.

636
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:34,744
So, beyond the normal niceties of being good people

637
00:32:34,804 --> 00:32:36,145
and picking them up at the airport,

638
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:38,787
and we are, all of our creatives are good people,

639
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,909
I am the worst of us, I'll just tell you.

640
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,571
You know, we hang out with them.

641
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:46,833
We take them on hikes.

642
00:32:47,814 --> 00:32:50,156
I never leave the office, but allegedly there

643
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,858
are cool things to do in Seattle.

644
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:55,081
There are trails and a mountain, and Frazier lives there.

645
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:57,703
So we play rock band with them.

646
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:00,525
I'm pretty sure this is illegal.

647
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:02,247
That's too many people in one car.

648
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,688
But they really had a good time.

649
00:33:04,408 --> 00:33:08,892
And we get to know them outside of the office environment.

650
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:13,375
They get to understand our culture inside the office environment.

651
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:18,297
We get to know them personally and, you know, we have a sense of them from working with

652
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:20,318
them, outsourcing art.

653
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:21,538
We certainly know their talent.

654
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:23,059
We certainly know their reliability.

655
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:27,061
We have a pretty good beat on whether or not they are personally a sociopath.

656
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:33,163
But we get to spend that face time with them and because of that, the concept pushes have

657
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:35,484
become a stealth hiring pipeline.

658
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:39,924
It was, it actually used to be a stealth hiring pipeline until this presentation.

659
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:49,070
Of our seven art side creatives, five of them have been hired through this process

660
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:53,013
of being card illustrators, being brought in on a concept push,

661
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:57,456
and then when we had an opportunity to add to our organization.

662
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,777
we're able to just reach out to someone who's

663
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:03,177
been part of this weird, wonderful process

664
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,158
that we do a couple times a year,

665
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:07,778
and knows us, and knows Wizards culture,

666
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:09,159
at least in broad strokes.

667
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,579
And it's worked very well.

668
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,759
Three of our four art directors came out of this,

669
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:15,700
and both of our in-house concept artists.

670
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,081
So let's look at that flexible solution

671
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:26,902
and how it has come to inform that feedback loop that I

672
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,022
was talking about earlier.

673
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:34,322
when the originator of a signal becomes aware of its own output.

674
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:37,603
We have this organization, a well-structured organization

675
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:41,785
of Magic R&D. Magic R&D's job is to make cards,

676
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:43,345
lots and lots of cards.

677
00:34:43,986 --> 00:34:45,866
Because we're going to make lots and lots of cards,

678
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:49,427
we need this robust global talent pool.

679
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:52,729
Then we mine that global talent pool

680
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,569
to pick the perfect five partners

681
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:59,031
to come in and work with us for three weeks on a concept push.

682
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:02,945
And that concept push outputs a world guide,

683
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,749
and that world guide is used to make cards.

684
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,371
Lots and lots of cards, because we have an organization

685
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:12,554
that makes lots of cards, and so we need a global talent pool,

686
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:14,335
and then we use the concept, and so on.

687
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:17,098
And then, when we have an opportunity

688
00:35:17,478 --> 00:35:18,959
to add to our organization.

689
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,107
The concept push is our recruiting ground.

690
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:26,630
And so we have this entire system

691
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,714
where because we have chosen to do the work this way,

692
00:35:31,354 --> 00:35:33,897
over time the work becomes easier

693
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:35,718
and more sustainable to do.

694
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,594
So I'm going to pose some closing questions.

695
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:44,317
One of the exercises, it can be a little frustrating,

696
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:49,620
but I really enjoy running, is when we figure out something

697
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,582
that is true for magic, either an aesthetic value

698
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:56,744
that we care about, or a way of doing something, or a process,

699
00:35:56,844 --> 00:36:00,086
or whatever it is, when it was counterintuitive to get there,

700
00:36:00,387 --> 00:36:01,847
but we got there and it works really well.

701
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:08,353
try to backwards engineer what the correct question would have been to lead us to that

702
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,515
answer, had we been smart enough just to ask ourselves that question.

703
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:18,241
And so were we more clairvoyant, here are the questions we could have asked ourselves

704
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:22,844
to get to these answers to this process that is working really well for us.

705
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:24,366
I will ask them to you.

706
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:30,880
Can your organizational layout better reflect your desires for the product?

707
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,044
This goes back to that org chart.

708
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:39,675
We have the same bosses because we want the creative and the world concept to be fully

709
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:40,196
integrated.

710
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:48,329
Can you better phase the work that you own to set the next phase up for success?

711
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,510
The work that you own that you're going to do anyway.

712
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,631
I'm not talking about organizational revolt.

713
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:55,191
Your sandbox.

714
00:36:55,551 --> 00:37:01,953
Can you better set the next phase up for results just based on how you approach and phase your

715
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:02,353
own work?

716
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,753
Can you find a sustainable answer for problematic annualized needs?

717
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:15,896
The concept push used to be a crisis for us, and it happened every year.

718
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:21,879
If it's going to happen every year on schedule, there is no reason to let it be a recurring

719
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:22,419
crisis.

720
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,201
Figure out how to sustainably meet that thing.

721
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:30,183
It should only be so miserable to make games that make people really, really happy.

722
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:33,725
Find a solution for annualized needs.

723
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:38,379
Where can you introduce a flexible solution

724
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,900
within your inflexible production cycles?

725
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:46,563
How can you fully maximize every ounce of that flexibility?

726
00:37:49,756 --> 00:37:51,076
And this really is the last one.

727
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,637
If you don't take anything else away,

728
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,597
I would really love for you to think about this,

729
00:37:54,777 --> 00:37:55,857
whatever your discipline is,

730
00:37:56,237 --> 00:37:59,078
where can you answer a need with a process or pipeline

731
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,199
that fortifies itself over time?

732
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,599
Again, that feedback loop.

733
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,460
Are there places where you can set up systems,

734
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,240
processes, pipelines, whatever,

735
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,801
that because you have chosen to do the work that way,

736
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:15,882
over time, it becomes easier to do the work that way?

737
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,839
So with that, we have some time.

738
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,262
I want to open this up to questions.

739
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:26,928
I would love to answer anything you guys have to ask.

740
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,334
All right, guys, this is the last day of GDC.

741
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:43,439
I know that every hour at GDC is a major decision,

742
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,102
a significant time spent.

743
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:48,346
There's so much talent here and so many things to learn.

744
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:51,610
I really appreciate you spending one of those hours with me

745
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:54,154
and with Magic and with Wizards of the Coast.

746
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:54,734
Thank you.

747
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:06,663
Oh, oops.

748
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:08,745
You're backlit.

749
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:09,085
Sorry.

750
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:09,445
Great.

751
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:10,986
Hi.

752
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:12,507
Thanks for such an insightful talk.

753
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:15,008
As an aspiring producer, it was great to gain insight

754
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:16,929
into how you manage your art pipeline.

755
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:20,471
My question is, you said that your company is

756
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:22,152
very specific in your timeline.

757
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:23,913
So do you ever deal with crunch time,

758
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:26,274
like what you have to release on this certain day?

759
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:28,875
So what do you do if you're not quite there?

760
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:30,836
Do you have to, how does that work for you?

761
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:32,008
It's going to release.

762
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,188
No matter what.

763
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:35,029
Yes, yes.

764
00:39:35,129 --> 00:39:36,670
We have not missed a street date since,

765
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,650
I don't know that we've ever missed a street date.

766
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:42,832
So the real answer to that, what do we do with crunch times,

767
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:45,313
is, again, we have lots of reps in this.

768
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:48,995
We release a major block product every three months.

769
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:51,576
So if you hit a crunch time.

770
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:59,162
more than two or three times, we try to accommodate with a new process or a new way to phase the work.

771
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:03,587
I believe that all great process is versus something.

772
00:40:04,107 --> 00:40:09,632
Like, you know, I'm not smart enough to just be like, in the abstract, here is the perfect process to accomplish this.

773
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:13,036
But I know what I don't like seeing happen over and over again,

774
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:17,219
and we will pivot and figure out the best way to accomplish that work.

775
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:26,148
Yes, crunch times can happen. A lot of that pressure comes from our desire to work up

776
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:31,694
until the last possible moment on the development of the set. We're trying to get as much real

777
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:36,278
world feedback on the play environments as possible. So while we would

778
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,579
In theory, just love to start earlier and earlier.

779
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,700
We need to wait as late as possible

780
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,600
to get that real-world feedback for our best development

781
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,081
for the set and the good of the play environments.

782
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,782
And so there can be crunch times, last-minute changes.

783
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:53,082
Sometimes cards change to the point

784
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,723
where the art no longer works for them.

785
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:57,283
We have to call in favors to our friendlies

786
00:40:57,323 --> 00:40:58,443
in that art pipeline.

787
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,464
So the answer is try to see it coming.

788
00:41:01,784 --> 00:41:02,584
Don't let it happen.

789
00:41:03,024 --> 00:41:04,385
If it does, suck it up.

790
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:06,565
That's why it's called work and not happy fun time.

791
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:09,458
All right, let's go over here.

792
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:10,358
Hey, thanks.

793
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:12,059
That was an absolutely kick-ass talk.

794
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,319
Thank you.

795
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,680
So it feels like you've really refined

796
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,941
this process for this one game over a very

797
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:18,662
long period of time.

798
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,323
And it seems like that's a well-oiled machine at this

799
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:25,204
point, I'm wondering how easy do you feel it would be to

800
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:28,186
transplant those exact learnings onto another game?

801
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,847
Or do you think this is exactly how this one game

802
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:34,608
works, and this is the perfect process for Magic, but other

803
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:36,609
games are going to have to take 10 years to figure out a

804
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:37,490
process this good again?

805
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:43,777
So I think it is a very good process for magic.

806
00:41:44,658 --> 00:41:46,480
And the reason that I kind of audibled

807
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,901
at the beginning of this and was like, people,

808
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:49,723
it's going to be weird, noddily specific,

809
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:52,946
is because I don't think the way we phase stuff,

810
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:56,129
the way we whatever, I do think those questions at the end

811
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:58,591
are good questions to ask yourself.

812
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:02,073
But every game, like D&D, we're in the same building.

813
00:42:02,113 --> 00:42:04,775
They have very different processes, different needs.

814
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,856
We do share learnings back and forth.

815
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:09,718
Sometimes we share team members.

816
00:42:10,158 --> 00:42:12,160
But we make things in very different ways.

817
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,901
And if we're making things in different ways

818
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:16,923
on the same floor of the same building,

819
00:42:17,403 --> 00:42:19,924
I'm certainly not foolhardy enough to stand up here

820
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:22,026
and be like, I've solved this for all of you, all of you.

821
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,407
All you need to do is bring in five people for three weeks.

822
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:25,228
Thank you.

823
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:27,709
So it does work very well for us.

824
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,451
I'm not claiming it's perfect yet, right?

825
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:33,152
But it's working well, and we are

826
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:37,534
able to consistently ensure that quality without it

827
00:42:37,614 --> 00:42:41,855
being a weeping gnashing of teeth meltdown every time.

828
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:44,797
And so for the time being, I'll take it.

829
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:46,657
Cool.

830
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:46,918
Thank you.

831
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:47,138
All right.

832
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:47,438
Thank you.

833
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:56,236
Hi, my question is about how this very well-designed process is integrated with R&D and mechanics.

834
00:42:57,277 --> 00:43:02,385
Like, how early, for example, do the mechanics have to be set in stone for art to start?

835
00:43:02,485 --> 00:43:04,067
Or is it all happening at the same time?

836
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:06,770
Sure, that is a good question.

837
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,052
And the answer changes from setting to setting.

838
00:43:10,812 --> 00:43:15,235
We have what is called arc planning, where there is a cross-functional team of us that

839
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:20,819
from different disciplines within R&D gets together and decides what the product lineup

840
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,360
will be.

841
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,261
It used to be the five-year plan.

842
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:24,743
We always had a five-year plan.

843
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:26,204
We knew what settings we were going to,

844
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:28,206
whether that was top down.

845
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:31,149
It's finally time to do Greek mythology,

846
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,633
or it was bottom up, like we want wedge factions.

847
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:38,337
That five-year plan, once we doubled our world building,

848
00:43:38,437 --> 00:43:41,460
became a five-set plan that no longer gets us five years.

849
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,302
But coming out of art planning,

850
00:43:44,343 --> 00:43:50,689
We know kind of what the heart of the set is, whether that is a creatively driven heart or a mechanically driven heart.

851
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,873
So to answer your question, if it's a mechanically driven heart like

852
00:43:55,534 --> 00:44:03,843
Khans of Tarkir, where it was, we don't know what the creative is, but it's going to be five wedge factions of some sort and

853
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:07,546
we want to do a Draft Matters set, so it should probably be time travel.

854
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,091
But that was the answer.

855
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:15,214
Never, if you are a creative, never, ever tell a time travel

856
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:15,534
story.

857
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:16,374
It's so miserable.

858
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:19,616
It's really, really hard not to ruin your whole thing.

859
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:23,098
So we will often have that much information

860
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:23,979
if it is bottom up.

861
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:30,483
If it's top-down, we know less, and that vision design process starts iterating on mechanics,

862
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:33,846
and that's why we are constantly informing and responding to each other.

863
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:40,571
A lot of those mechanics get thrown out, just like a lot of the concept art gets changed or doesn't make it through to final.

864
00:44:41,391 --> 00:44:45,234
But we are constantly aware of when something's working really well, and...

865
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,277
Design sometimes will come over to us and be like,

866
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:52,238
we nailed down a mechanic, it's really good,

867
00:44:52,638 --> 00:44:54,860
it's really fun, can you build around this?

868
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,441
And we say, no, screw you.

869
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,922
Like, just because it's fun, we're like, no, we say yes,

870
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:00,943
let's build around that.

871
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:02,864
Turns out we want to make fun games.

872
00:45:03,945 --> 00:45:05,145
And conversely, when we're like,

873
00:45:05,325 --> 00:45:07,306
we accidentally discovered a new hotness,

874
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:08,807
like one of those artists came in

875
00:45:08,847 --> 00:45:09,948
and did something really cool.

876
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:13,790
An example of that, the meld mechanic from Eldritch Moon.

877
00:45:14,752 --> 00:45:17,554
Vincent Proce was one of the artists that came in.

878
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:21,836
He did a great concept plate of two angels fused together

879
00:45:21,897 --> 00:45:23,277
in a fairly horrible way.

880
00:45:23,798 --> 00:45:26,259
The designer, one of the designers, saw that and was

881
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,561
like, hey, I've been wanting to do this mechanic where you take

882
00:45:28,581 --> 00:45:32,204
two double-faced cards and they transform and stick together.

883
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,825
And that's where MELD came from.

884
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,426
So we're nailing down things constantly,

885
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:39,168
but the sequence is never knowable.

886
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:45,618
Like a lot of our process is again having enough flexibility to have the confidence

887
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:49,443
that we will get to the answers because we have the right people involved.

888
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:52,928
So the answer is it changes time to time.

889
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,150
Thank you.

890
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:54,731
Thanks.

891
00:45:56,569 --> 00:46:01,831
Hi, great talk. Thank you. Thank you. So my question was similar to his but a bit more specific and that was em

892
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:07,554
At what point in the world building and concepting process? Do you actually decide on what the individual cards should be?

893
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:11,555
Hmm and then is our when you go to the talent pool

894
00:46:11,575 --> 00:46:15,797
Do you say I need a piece of art for this particular card and does it ever work in reverse?

895
00:46:16,057 --> 00:46:19,599
I somebody creates a cool piece of art that could be a great card afterwards

896
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:27,822
Sure. So the way it works is the World Guide is not only for external partners, it is for

897
00:46:27,922 --> 00:46:33,344
ourselves. Like, again, it is setting us up for success. It's us throwing a pass forward

898
00:46:33,684 --> 00:46:39,826
to future us to be able to deliver on the job we need to do. So that World Guide is

899
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:42,147
used by our writers that we have.

900
00:46:42,707 --> 00:46:44,408
of MagicRD's creative team.

901
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:46,290
We have artists, we have writers.

902
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,132
Our writers, on a card by card basis,

903
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:52,254
go through, look at the raw mechanical jargon,

904
00:46:52,694 --> 00:46:56,657
and say, okay, it costs red, red, it's two, one.

905
00:46:56,797 --> 00:46:59,779
When it comes into play, it destroys an artifact.

906
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:01,640
Well, it's probably a goblin, right?

907
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:04,462
And then they write an art description

908
00:47:04,963 --> 00:47:07,885
that points to concept plates in the world guide.

909
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:11,067
And they find a fun and of the world way

910
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:12,448
to represent that concept.

911
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:16,251
And then they do that card by card, hundreds of them.

912
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:19,213
And then the art directors take those card concepts

913
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,375
from the writers and hand select which

914
00:47:22,515 --> 00:47:24,717
artist is best to paint that goblin who

915
00:47:24,797 --> 00:47:25,838
really hates artifacts.

916
00:47:26,618 --> 00:47:26,779
And.

917
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,144
then we, you know, get the results and we go through sketches, we get feed, we give feedback,

918
00:47:32,164 --> 00:47:38,772
we get to final. We will work backwards from art sometimes and when that usually happens...

919
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:43,181
is if in development, the card changes enough

920
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:45,622
that the piece of art no longer works,

921
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:47,564
we have to recommission that.

922
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,145
We can't have that, you know,

923
00:47:49,185 --> 00:47:51,127
if it's really a cognitive disconnect,

924
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,428
that's not fun for anybody.

925
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:54,049
But if that art's really great,

926
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:55,671
we'll go ahead and buy it and pay for it

927
00:47:55,951 --> 00:47:57,152
and put it in a holding pin

928
00:47:57,492 --> 00:47:59,394
and ask designers to find a home for it.

929
00:48:00,535 --> 00:48:02,997
Our best place to deploy that is currently Commander,

930
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:04,659
since we don't have a core set.

931
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:06,080
The core set used to use a lot of that.

932
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,222
So there are many cards that you guys

933
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:11,565
have seen in Commander products that were art, just waiting

934
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:14,788
for a good home, that a designer stepped in and heroically

935
00:48:14,828 --> 00:48:15,289
rescued.

936
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,890
Awesome.

937
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:17,271
Thank you.

938
00:48:17,371 --> 00:48:17,631
Thanks.

939
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:19,513
Hi, I'm curious.

940
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:22,576
With these three-week pushes, a couple times a year,

941
00:48:22,616 --> 00:48:23,437
what's the best way to deploy a core set?

942
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:26,973
I mean, it's great that you treat the artists so well while they're there, but why not just

943
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:30,955
keep them on staff, keep them in house, keep them working for longer periods of time and

944
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,336
help them study income?

945
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:32,816
Right.

946
00:48:34,357 --> 00:48:42,301
So, even if, even if someone came to me and said, hey, Jeremy, how would you like a staff

947
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:43,462
of 40 artists?

948
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,224
And that's my CEO right there.

949
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:47,924
Hey, Chris, can I have a staff of 40 artists?

950
00:48:50,826 --> 00:48:51,006
Yeah.

951
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:52,867
So, so.

952
00:48:56,476 --> 00:49:03,377
Even if that were offered to me, and it has not been, I would still want to have a concept

953
00:49:03,397 --> 00:49:03,637
push.

954
00:49:03,657 --> 00:49:05,178
It is such a creative explosion.

955
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:11,699
It is one of some of the flexibility it offers us as we try to swing that pendulum and keep

956
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:13,480
our settings fresh and off of each other.

957
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,720
We have different people working on them.

958
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,882
people that have different aesthetic values,

959
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:19,464
whose brains work different ways,

960
00:49:19,904 --> 00:49:23,388
so you don't get into a, yep, it looks like a magic setting.

961
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,730
Kaladesh is clearly not Amonkhet.

962
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:28,393
And a lot of that is from the ground up

963
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:31,757
because of that concept push, because different talent

964
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:32,618
was involved.

965
00:49:33,198 --> 00:49:34,239
I would still want.

966
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,942
to bring fresh people in.

967
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:40,184
Like of those five slots for every concept push,

968
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:42,987
we have jobs for those slots usually.

969
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,709
Like we have a pace setter, someone that we know

970
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:47,931
is going to work fast so that we don't have

971
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:49,172
to ask people to work fast.

972
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:50,654
They'll just see what that person's doing

973
00:49:50,694 --> 00:49:52,595
and be like, oh shit, I needed a helmet faster.

974
00:49:54,337 --> 00:49:58,860
But one of those slots is for an X-factor, for someone who has been impressing us with card art

975
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:05,265
that we can bring in and see how they are in-house and deliberately to add new ideas,

976
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:07,466
new blood to the process.

977
00:50:08,398 --> 00:50:11,839
So I really love that flexibility it gives us.

978
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:16,039
And because part of scaling the process,

979
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,040
part of why I'm able to flippantly be like,

980
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,420
I don't know, we just did it again.

981
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,641
We did have to staff up.

982
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:23,941
We did have to add a writing resource,

983
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:25,121
an art direction resource.

984
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:27,082
We went from one concept artist to two.

985
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:31,563
But their job is to help us run that flexible process.

986
00:50:31,983 --> 00:50:35,467
to help own those concept pushes and world guides

987
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,609
so that we can continue to scale them.

988
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,311
We have people that know what they're doing,

989
00:50:39,451 --> 00:50:40,693
that have been through the process,

990
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:43,015
that can come in and help us own the process,

991
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:46,519
and then continue to have a very flexible solution to it.

992
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:47,961
Does that make sense?

993
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:49,543
Mm-hmm.

994
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:49,723
Great.

995
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,723
Hi, I know you're more creative than design,

996
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:55,605
but I was curious, what are your thoughts

997
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,027
on the switch from the one block

998
00:50:58,227 --> 00:51:00,029
or one block of three sets per year

999
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:02,831
to the two blocks of two from the design

1000
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:04,252
and play testing perspective?

1001
00:51:04,272 --> 00:51:06,574
Do you think that that team has encountered

1002
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:09,016
similar challenges to scaling up,

1003
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:11,859
or do you think that process is pretty much the same?

1004
00:51:13,545 --> 00:51:17,049
So I certainly can't dig down on that.

1005
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,993
The best I could do is tell you what I hear people

1006
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:24,099
complaining about, and I don't want to do that.

1007
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,743
But yeah, I can tell you that both teams have had to adjust.

1008
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,085
Like we both hit.

1009
00:51:29,766 --> 00:51:33,689
Like, you know, Magic R&D is full of very, very smart people.

1010
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,113
And so you can theorycraft about what the resulting problems

1011
00:51:38,153 --> 00:51:38,854
are going to be.

1012
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:41,717
You'll hit some of them, maybe even a lot of them.

1013
00:51:41,757 --> 00:51:42,998
You're not going to get all of them.

1014
00:51:43,118 --> 00:51:45,840
The unknown unknowns have bitten us both.

1015
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:47,041
I can tell you that.

1016
00:51:47,642 --> 00:51:50,584
But again, because we are outputting

1017
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:51,926
a set every three months.

1018
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:57,010
We are able to respond to that, and you don't get to slap us twice.

1019
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,232
We'll figure it out, even if it takes us some iterations.

1020
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:02,274
But yeah, doing new things is hard.

1021
00:52:02,294 --> 00:52:04,596
Thank you.

1022
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:05,417
Yeah, thank you.

1023
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:09,520
Hi, with the three weeks to do the concept push and bringing

1024
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:13,303
the contractors, the five artists, I just want to know how often

1025
00:52:13,503 --> 00:52:15,185
or what's your process for reviewing?

1026
00:52:16,227 --> 00:52:18,290
being able to foresee problems, course correcting.

1027
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,171
OK.

1028
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:22,535
So we give that concept push kick off.

1029
00:52:22,615 --> 00:52:24,517
Week one is free exploration.

1030
00:52:25,278 --> 00:52:26,800
We don't take anything off the wall.

1031
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,043
We let them put stuff up and talk about it

1032
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:29,924
and cross-pollinate.

1033
00:52:31,005 --> 00:52:31,446
We will.

1034
00:52:32,327 --> 00:52:36,729
If there's something on the wall that we don't love and we know it isn't going to make it through

1035
00:52:37,189 --> 00:52:42,731
and it starts eking out into other people's work, we will step in and say, hey, let's not,

1036
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:47,873
that's enough of that. Like, let's not do this anymore. We do have typically two reviews that

1037
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:49,714
first week where we'll talk about.

1038
00:52:50,194 --> 00:52:55,339
Not to talk about what we don't like, what we really try to do is find the stuff that we love,

1039
00:52:55,399 --> 00:53:03,386
the stuff that we want to see more of, and bless it really loudly so that the artists are able to just do more of the things naturally that we're wanting.

1040
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:08,050
In that second week, there are two to three reviews at the wall.

1041
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:14,356
Our process is to have the creatives and some of the stakeholders, our internal people,

1042
00:53:14,876 --> 00:53:17,038
talk at the wall, discuss with each other,

1043
00:53:17,438 --> 00:53:19,120
outside of the presence of the artists

1044
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,021
so they don't hear mixed signals.

1045
00:53:21,562 --> 00:53:23,403
And then we bring the artist back to the wall

1046
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:27,207
and the art director collates that feedback,

1047
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:28,828
makes his or her decisions,

1048
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:31,911
and the art director is the only voice the artists hear.

1049
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:36,435
And third week, we have at least three reviews at the wall

1050
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:37,896
as we try to get to a hard stop.

1051
00:53:38,617 --> 00:53:38,897
Thank you.

1052
00:53:39,157 --> 00:53:39,778
Yeah, thanks.

1053
00:53:40,716 --> 00:53:44,457
Hi, what are your three favorite or most proud of sets

1054
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:45,417
that you've worked on?

1055
00:53:45,737 --> 00:53:47,498
Oh, you're asking me to pick between my kids?

1056
00:53:47,578 --> 00:53:48,158
Mm-hmm.

1057
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:51,879
I like the one that got a scholarship.

1058
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:59,602
So world building.

1059
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:05,404
is I find two different sorts of rewarding.

1060
00:54:05,964 --> 00:54:09,047
One is when you're working within a known trope space

1061
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,149
and you're able to really knock it out of the park.

1062
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,211
I know you guys haven't seen Amonkhet yet,

1063
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:17,754
but early on in that arc planning phase,

1064
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:21,077
both Sean Main and I were doing some exploration

1065
00:54:21,097 --> 00:54:24,400
about whether or not there was enough good material

1066
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,782
to populate all of those cards.

1067
00:54:27,202 --> 00:54:29,444
Right? Because some world premises just don't scale.

1068
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:34,349
And it's not based on the depth of the mythology, it's based on the depth of

1069
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:38,753
what people know. Like the job isn't to make trivia.

1070
00:54:39,034 --> 00:54:42,457
It's like you have to play into what is in the zeitgeist.

1071
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:49,067
And I was like, I was really not super positive on the prospects of an Egyptian world.

1072
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,790
I was like, yeah, it's been done to death.

1073
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:53,094
And just going through that research phase, just digging down in Google image search,

1074
00:54:53,114 --> 00:54:53,514
I was like, oh, God.

1075
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:53,895
No, no one's.

1076
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,075
No one's.

1077
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:54,376
No one's.

1078
00:54:54,396 --> 00:54:54,576
No one's.

1079
00:54:54,596 --> 00:54:54,836
No one's.

1080
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:55,117
No one's.

1081
00:54:55,137 --> 00:54:55,377
No one's.

1082
00:54:55,397 --> 00:54:55,578
No one's.

1083
00:54:55,598 --> 00:54:55,758
No one's.

1084
00:54:55,778 --> 00:54:55,978
No one's.

1085
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:56,179
No one's.

1086
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:56,359
No one's.

1087
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:57,180
No one's.

1088
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,360
No one's.

1089
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:57,561
No one's.

1090
00:54:57,581 --> 00:54:57,941
No one's.

1091
00:54:58,142 --> 00:54:59,502
No one's knocked this out of the park yet.

1092
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:00,922
No one's done this yet.

1093
00:55:01,783 --> 00:55:03,103
People have played in that space.

1094
00:55:03,143 --> 00:55:05,184
The best versions, actually, of Egypt

1095
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:06,804
are kind of the sci-fi takes on it,

1096
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:09,125
where it's like a really interesting twist

1097
00:55:09,725 --> 00:55:12,666
on taking the aesthetic and completely recontextualizing

1098
00:55:12,706 --> 00:55:15,207
it, but so far as taking the mythology itself

1099
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:18,288
and delivering an alternate version of it.

1100
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:22,609
That is really, really fun, to be able to show people.

1101
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:28,746
a version of something they already like that is just better than what they've seen before,

1102
00:55:28,986 --> 00:55:32,589
hopefully, and this is me, I'm whatever, I'm being selfish, like yeah, it's great.

1103
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:35,392
Theros is another example of that.

1104
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:36,833
That's very rewarding.

1105
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:41,417
And also, when you're able to rock a Henry Ford and be like, had I asked the people what

1106
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:43,098
they wanted, they would have said faster horses.

1107
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,082
People didn't know that they were going to really like Kaladesh, right?

1108
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,864
Kaladesh started as we need...

1109
00:55:51,075 --> 00:55:53,497
An artifact set, this is in the product lineup,

1110
00:55:53,557 --> 00:55:54,638
this is a good home for it.

1111
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,320
We don't want it to be Mirrodin

1112
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,821
because Mirrodin's now New Phyrexia

1113
00:55:57,841 --> 00:55:59,523
and that's kind of off message for what we're doing.

1114
00:55:59,843 --> 00:56:01,524
So non-Mirrodin artifact set.

1115
00:56:03,106 --> 00:56:06,408
Steampunk, Magic hasn't done that yet, let's do Steampunk.

1116
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:08,931
But it's, you know, it's not gonna be Steam

1117
00:56:08,971 --> 00:56:10,732
because the game's called Magic, so.

1118
00:56:11,253 --> 00:56:12,934
And none of that Dirty Brown stuff,

1119
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:16,217
like I don't want 450 cards of Dirty Brown rusted metal.

1120
00:56:16,737 --> 00:56:17,078
So,

1121
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:23,643
We could set it in India because of British stuff,

1122
00:56:23,763 --> 00:56:25,324
and steampunk is Victorian.

1123
00:56:25,364 --> 00:56:28,726
Yeah, but let's not do that, that whole colonial thing.

1124
00:56:28,766 --> 00:56:30,287
That's not super awesome for people.

1125
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:35,151
So yeah, steampunk that's not steampunk in the Victorian

1126
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:37,052
that we stripped all the Victorian out of

1127
00:56:37,373 --> 00:56:39,914
and gave the veneer of a fantastical India.

1128
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:43,994
Right? I, no one actually emailed me and asked for that.

1129
00:56:44,474 --> 00:56:46,796
But holy God, it's so much fun and it looks so good.

1130
00:56:47,116 --> 00:56:50,018
And so it feels really, really good when through our process,

1131
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:53,320
we're able to come on something that we haven't, you know,

1132
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:54,521
we haven't seen before.

1133
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:57,583
There's nothing to, that concept push kickoff document,

1134
00:56:57,864 --> 00:56:59,505
that presentation was really hard

1135
00:56:59,805 --> 00:57:03,828
because we could not find any images of what we wanted.

1136
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:05,409
Like it just didn't exist.

1137
00:57:05,649 --> 00:57:10,112
The images we had, the starting place of Kaladesh was jewelry.

1138
00:57:10,873 --> 00:57:13,834
was ornate jewelry, and we said, hey, look at that earring.

1139
00:57:14,274 --> 00:57:15,754
Show me a gear made out of that.

1140
00:57:16,074 --> 00:57:17,695
And then we built a world from those gears.

1141
00:57:18,255 --> 00:57:20,695
So over-delivering on expectations

1142
00:57:21,076 --> 00:57:24,817
and delivering on the lack of expectations,

1143
00:57:24,997 --> 00:57:25,717
those are my favorite.

1144
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:27,177
I know those aren't particular settings,

1145
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:29,398
but I'm not gonna do that.

1146
00:57:29,858 --> 00:57:30,778
Thank you.

1147
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:31,798
Thanks.

1148
00:57:33,564 --> 00:57:37,730
Hi, so you've talked about sort of the R&D process for the main block releases.

1149
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:43,519
Are there similar R&D processes for like commander sets or conspiracy sets?

1150
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,426
Yeah, yeah. Typically they are smaller teams.

1151
00:57:48,547 --> 00:57:54,190
But certainly there is always a creative rep on, let's take Commander for example.

1152
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:59,053
There is a creative liaison on Commander that is working with them

1153
00:57:59,093 --> 00:58:01,195
about who the commanders are, what the cards are.

1154
00:58:01,975 --> 00:58:05,597
Commander is for typically a very enfranchised crowd.

1155
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:09,960
And so we get to do kind of insightful throwbacks and oh, let's set this one

1156
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,201
on Kamigawa and people will get a kick out of that.

1157
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:19,386
But yeah, the process, it's not as long and often not as structured, but that collaboration

1158
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,348
is absolutely a part of everything we do.

1159
00:58:22,128 --> 00:58:22,328
Thanks.

1160
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:22,869
Thanks.

1161
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,471
It was similar vein to his.

1162
00:58:25,491 --> 00:58:29,013
I just wanted to see, like, there's reprints going on with modern masters, and I want to

1163
00:58:29,033 --> 00:58:32,856
know where do you choose to do different art, and where's the story being told?

1164
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:37,379
Like with Terminate, you see a Sun Titan being destroyed, and then there's a Razed Dead,

1165
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,260
where the Sun Titan is being brought back.

1166
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,822
Where do you find these arcs, and where do you find to make those?

1167
00:58:42,002 --> 00:58:46,365
Sure, so when I was working on those master sets

1168
00:58:46,405 --> 00:58:51,808
or any 100% reprint set, my target for when to,

1169
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:54,269
when you make new art for an existing card,

1170
00:58:54,649 --> 00:58:55,670
it's one of two things.

1171
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,231
It's either alt art.

1172
00:58:57,851 --> 00:58:59,792
Right? Where it's typically a side grade,

1173
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:01,993
we're just making it different, like promos, for example.

1174
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:03,613
Right? They get alternate art.

1175
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:06,954
And then there's facelifts, where there's something

1176
00:59:06,974 --> 00:59:09,195
that we honestly think we can make better.

1177
00:59:09,856 --> 00:59:13,377
And so, I would work with the developers

1178
00:59:13,577 --> 00:59:15,978
and have them give me kind of a stack rank list

1179
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:18,639
of what the most exciting cards were, what were going

1180
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:20,940
to be the most meaningful to players to see again,

1181
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,001
and then pick those that I thought I could honestly

1182
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:25,261
facelift and improve.

1183
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:28,423
in a way that people would find exciting.

1184
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:31,744
But in my opinion, just changing the art for the sake

1185
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:34,625
of changing the art doesn't really make people happy.

1186
00:59:35,465 --> 00:59:39,427
And we actually saw that with From the Vault Legends.

1187
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:42,508
All of that art was perfectly good to excellent.

1188
00:59:42,928 --> 00:59:44,609
And it's like, yeah, but part of the value

1189
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:47,090
of the SKU is people really like alternate art.

1190
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,531
And so we arbitrarily changed half of it.

1191
00:59:49,991 --> 00:59:50,571
I did that.

1192
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:51,832
I was told to and I did it.

1193
00:59:51,952 --> 00:59:52,652
Nobody liked it.

1194
00:59:52,992 --> 00:59:53,873
That was for nobody.

1195
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:56,515
And so I love to facelift things.

1196
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,577
I wish we would do less alt art.

1197
00:59:59,858 --> 01:00:00,418
One more.

1198
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:02,860
When you got the invitational cards

1199
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,782
were made after the people that created the cards,

1200
01:00:04,822 --> 01:00:06,403
and now you have the new ones which are there.

1201
01:00:06,443 --> 01:00:08,625
There's a vein that people don't like that.

1202
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:11,727
Where do you, why is that done as such?

1203
01:00:11,867 --> 01:00:13,529
Or is that just because?

1204
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:15,610
Why do we take real world people off of cards?

1205
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:17,112
Because it breaks immersion.

1206
01:00:17,692 --> 01:00:18,773
Because it's vanity press.

1207
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:23,947
And the game needs to be for everyone.

1208
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:27,451
And when you do that, and it's nothing

1209
01:00:27,511 --> 01:00:30,254
against those cards or the people represented on them.

1210
01:00:30,654 --> 01:00:33,437
It's just it becomes trivia, right, of who is this

1211
01:00:33,477 --> 01:00:35,339
and why does it feel a little out of place.

1212
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:39,260
And so no one's going to show up to people's houses

1213
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,020
and take their invitational cards away.

1214
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,241
You get to keep them forever.

1215
01:00:43,021 --> 01:00:44,861
But as we reprint them going forward,

1216
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:48,402
we want it to feel of the time, of the place,

1217
01:00:49,022 --> 01:00:53,683
and we don't want to cater to too few people

1218
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:54,924
with any given decision.

1219
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:58,064
We want, we have a global audience,

1220
01:00:58,424 --> 01:01:00,625
and we want to do the correctest thing for the most people.

1221
01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:01,425
Thank you.

1222
01:01:01,905 --> 01:01:02,125
Thanks.

1223
01:01:03,804 --> 01:01:05,765
Yeah, this is outside your area, but I'll ask anyway.

1224
01:01:05,905 --> 01:01:07,906
I was just wondering how much computer simulation

1225
01:01:07,926 --> 01:01:11,428
you do in playtesting, if any?

1226
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,309
I can't answer that.

1227
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:15,990
OK, I thought that could happen.

1228
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,572
I can tell you that I do zero computer simulation when

1229
01:01:20,592 --> 01:01:22,773
I'm looking at pictures and coloring at my desk.

1230
01:01:26,252 --> 01:01:32,857
Hi, thanks so much for disclosing so much. It was pretty cool. A big part of the game

1231
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:38,040
itself is the large set versus the small set, and a lot of times, or at least so far, there's

1232
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:43,604
a shift in tone. You know what we literally call that? What? The tonal shift.

1233
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:45,611
Pretty good name.

1234
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:46,071
You nailed it.

1235
01:01:46,932 --> 01:01:52,737
How much of the world-building three weeks are spent trying to identify the large block

1236
01:01:52,777 --> 01:01:58,522
versus the smaller block, or do you have a mini-cycle that mirrors this development as

1237
01:01:58,582 --> 01:01:59,843
a follow-up for the small set?

1238
01:02:00,023 --> 01:02:03,726
It's that follow-up push that typically owns the brunt of that.

1239
01:02:04,606 --> 01:02:08,869
We talk about it a lot in our initial world building when we're trying to front load that

1240
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:11,031
work of what that tonal shift will be.

1241
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,215
For example, in Kaladesh, the skyline has a good deal of amusement park on it, right?

1242
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:21,118
In Aether Revolt, it squares off.

1243
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:27,023
The buildings change and that whimsical skyline becomes harsher and more right angled.

1244
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:33,247
Now, we didn't get a lot of that right angled concept work out of the push prime, out of

1245
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:38,850
that first three weeks, but we set up the skyline so that we could A, B it and get those

1246
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,872
results from the follow-up push.

1247
01:02:41,352 --> 01:02:45,415
So we think about it early enough that we can set it up with the primary push, and then

1248
01:02:45,455 --> 01:02:48,577
if we need to, we can pay it off with the follow-up push.

1249
01:02:49,397 --> 01:02:49,618
Thank you.

1250
01:02:49,658 --> 01:02:50,538
That's a great question.

1251
01:02:51,439 --> 01:02:52,600
I didn't know people cared.

1252
01:02:53,908 --> 01:02:54,728
Thanks for a great talk.

1253
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:58,670
What are your contingencies, your crisis contingencies?

1254
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,931
Say you're in week two or week three, and it's really not

1255
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:01,812
where you want it to be.

1256
01:03:01,832 --> 01:03:03,053
How would you handle that?

1257
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,794
Like the quality's just not, eh.

1258
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:07,995
Well, I mean.

1259
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:14,125
I'm trying to think of the worst situation we got ourselves into.

1260
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:16,627
Like, how do you plan for that scenario?

1261
01:03:17,188 --> 01:03:22,211
We plan for that scenario by having already worked with the illustrators on multiple,

1262
01:03:22,251 --> 01:03:23,592
multiple things, right?

1263
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:28,916
Some of them have been card artists working with us as partners for years before we bring

1264
01:03:28,936 --> 01:03:29,457
them in-house.

1265
01:03:29,997 --> 01:03:33,479
Right? And we've never had someone, the real liability, honestly,

1266
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:35,080
because we have a sense of their talent.

1267
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,922
They've, the reason we bring them in is they've been just smashing stuff

1268
01:03:38,942 --> 01:03:40,462
out of the park for years for us.

1269
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:46,786
The real liability is if someone were to come in and just crumble under the environment

1270
01:03:46,886 --> 01:03:49,767
and the pressure of an office environment.

1271
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:51,188
And we haven't had that happen.

1272
01:03:53,453 --> 01:03:56,814
The times when we found ourselves short or thin

1273
01:03:56,954 --> 01:03:59,135
in places, it's been our fault.

1274
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:04,936
Like going back to Shards of Alara, which was we were working

1275
01:04:05,036 --> 01:04:09,057
on that in 2006, it was the first full world guide

1276
01:04:09,837 --> 01:04:10,837
that I art directed.

1277
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:14,398
We didn't know, like we didn't even have placeholder names

1278
01:04:14,478 --> 01:04:14,998
for things.

1279
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:18,979
Bant wasn't Bant, it was the white, green, blue house.

1280
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,740
And we were saying house so we wouldn't say guild

1281
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,500
because of Ravnica.

1282
01:04:24,482 --> 01:04:27,405
And Esper, oh God, Esper was really hard.

1283
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:29,667
We knew that every creature there was going

1284
01:04:29,707 --> 01:04:32,911
to be part artifact and so we wanted it to be, you know,

1285
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:34,633
they replaced parts of themselves

1286
01:04:34,693 --> 01:04:37,456
but we hadn't really thought about it because the idea

1287
01:04:37,476 --> 01:04:40,279
at the time was that idea that like words are more,

1288
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,505
flexible than pictures are, let the pictures come first.

1289
01:04:46,385 --> 01:04:51,788
And Zoltan Boros and Gabor Szeksai came in from Hungary.

1290
01:04:52,248 --> 01:04:55,250
And I remember, at some point, they just really fixated on it.

1291
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:58,592
Like, it was the thing to solve, and they were going to do it.

1292
01:04:58,912 --> 01:05:01,013
And they worked really hard, and it just wasn't working,

1293
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:01,794
and it wasn't working.

1294
01:05:02,454 --> 01:05:06,676
And Gabor, who's like, I don't know, 600 feet tall,

1295
01:05:06,997 --> 01:05:09,598
I remember him coming over to me, and he's like, Zsézsé.

1296
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:12,263
Blue is the big suck.

1297
01:05:12,863 --> 01:05:15,044
And I was like, yeah, buddy, it is.

1298
01:05:15,284 --> 01:05:15,824
I know it is.

1299
01:05:15,864 --> 01:05:16,764
Blue is the big suck.

1300
01:05:17,044 --> 01:05:19,245
But that was our fault. We hadn't talked about it enough.

1301
01:05:19,285 --> 01:05:20,665
We hadn't front loaded enough work.

1302
01:05:21,905 --> 01:05:24,346
Now when people come in, like for Dragons of Tarkir,

1303
01:05:25,006 --> 01:05:26,766
we're not talking about, OK, there's

1304
01:05:26,806 --> 01:05:28,706
five two-color dragon clans, and there's

1305
01:05:28,726 --> 01:05:31,207
going to be a white blue one because they're ally colors.

1306
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:34,728
And it's led by, unironically, a white blue dragon.

1307
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:35,848
So I don't know.

1308
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:36,488
Figure it out.

1309
01:05:36,848 --> 01:05:38,188
No, we're talking about Ojitai.

1310
01:05:39,009 --> 01:05:42,750
And it's perfectly reasonable to ask someone to solve for the white-blue dragon clan,

1311
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:50,392
but it becomes an opportunity when they get to prove themselves and solve for Ojitai herself,

1312
01:05:50,672 --> 01:05:56,034
right? And that just takes us front-loading the work and setting them up for it to be a good

1313
01:05:56,054 --> 01:06:00,856
experience and a rewarding experience because, to your initial question, I've rambled a little bit,

1314
01:06:01,236 --> 01:06:04,357
they already have the talent. Now, if someone did come in and choke,

1315
01:06:04,977 --> 01:06:07,819
we would use the flexibility in the system

1316
01:06:07,979 --> 01:06:09,960
and just bring in more artists on that backup push.

1317
01:06:10,581 --> 01:06:14,583
Like there have been sometimes if we scope it correctly

1318
01:06:14,623 --> 01:06:18,065
and we're like, man, this is a lot for five people,

1319
01:06:18,705 --> 01:06:20,766
we can just add people to that solution.

1320
01:06:21,287 --> 01:06:24,088
and I'll walk into Magic's Director of Operations

1321
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:25,469
and be really pitiful and I'll be like,

1322
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:29,431
Ken, not gonna be able to do the thing you asked to do,

1323
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:33,152
so I need another $5,000 to bring in another person,

1324
01:06:33,212 --> 01:06:34,553
and Ken will be like, I will give you 10

1325
01:06:34,613 --> 01:06:36,314
to shut up and get out of my office.

1326
01:06:36,894 --> 01:06:38,415
And I'm like, yay, I work well with people.

1327
01:06:39,615 --> 01:06:42,137
So, you know, as long as you scope it correctly,

1328
01:06:42,157 --> 01:06:44,097
you can achieve things.

1329
01:06:47,399 --> 01:06:48,460
All right, that looks like it.

1330
01:06:49,674 --> 01:06:51,308
Thank you guys, I really appreciate it.
