00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:13,054
Hello and welcome to this talk, How the Industry Can Change the Games or Bad Narrative. I am Dr.

2
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:17,996
Rachel Cowart. I am the research director for TakeThis. For those who are not familiar with

3
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:23,698
TakeThis, we are the first mental health non-profit to form serving the gaming industry and the gaming

4
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:28,841
community. We seek to de-stigmatize mental health challenges and provide mental health

5
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:30,382
information and resources.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,102
My role at TakeThis is in research and education.

7
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:36,583
I am a research psychologist by trade.

8
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,205
I'm also a science content creator on YouTube,

9
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,147
Zeitgeist, where I talk about the science of game studies.

10
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:45,208
I speak there and on virtual stages

11
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,229
like this on a range of topics relating

12
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:48,949
to the uses and effects of digital games

13
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:52,191
and specifically their impact on physical, social,

14
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:53,732
and psychological well-being.

15
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:58,475
As you can imagine, I've spoken a lot about the narratives in and around games,

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:03,077
but never directly to the industry itself, and that is what brings me here today.

17
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:09,341
I'm here today to discuss the discrepancies between what we know in the research community

18
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:14,524
about the uses and effects of games and the narratives that we are told by the world around

19
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,345
us about the uses and effects of games.

20
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,030
Now, one thing that's often missing from discussions like this

21
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,612
is the role of the industry in the creation and sustainment

22
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:27,413
of these narratives, specifically how research collaborations

23
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:30,315
between academia and the video game industry

24
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:33,676
have the potential to catalyze societal shifts away

25
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,317
from the inaccurate negatives we receive from society,

26
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:38,958
inaccurate narratives we receive from society,

27
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:42,400
the what about the children, and towards more accurate

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,522
and nuanced discussions that reflect scientific reality.

29
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:50,163
the utility and fun and joy of video games.

30
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:57,345
Common discourse in and around games has been fueled by moral panic

31
00:01:57,345 --> 00:02:01,606
for certainly as long as I can remember. For those who are unfamiliar with the term

32
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:08,048
moral panic, a moral panic is an irrational approach to observable and quantifiable

33
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:13,470
phenomena that can best be understood as separate from subjective evaluations.

34
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:17,339
This definition is clearly the academic in me, but I will clarify.

35
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:21,700
So moral panics are rational approaches to a problem because at their core,

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,702
they're about ascribing a easy solution to a complex problem that can best be

37
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:30,783
understood as separate from subjective evaluations refers to the fact that moral

38
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:34,785
panics are ascribing an easy solution without taking the time to try and

39
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:39,666
understand the issue from a more subjective approach, a subjective evaluation.

40
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:44,064
Now, video games are certainly not the first new technology

41
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,004
to face moral panic.

42
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:47,366
We've seen these kinds of panics come and go.

43
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:50,087
We've seen it with Dungeons and Dragons, and comic books,

44
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:50,608
and Elvis's Hips.

45
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:54,090
But what sets the moral panic about video games apart

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,391
is the fact that it's the longest standing

47
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:57,792
moral panic of our time.

48
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,113
The moral panic around video games

49
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,395
started to pick up steam in the early 1970s, well,

50
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,136
the late 1970s, really, when people

51
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:07,317
were concerned about the weird activities that were

52
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:07,758
happening.

53
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,834
in dimly lit arcades that were gaining in popularity

54
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,214
across the globe.

55
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:15,875
Flash forward 50 years, five zero years later,

56
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,477
and the moral panic about video games remains strong.

57
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:22,518
And we can see this in the way that video games continue

58
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:25,039
to be represented in pop culture.

59
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,659
For example, the classic episode of South Park

60
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,180
about World of Warcraft, or more recently,

61
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,561
poor unhealthy Thor playing video games in Avengers Endgame.

62
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:39,187
You see the pizza box and the energy drinks and he's quite aggressive when he's playing in the movie.

63
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:44,933
The stereotype and the representation of pop culture hasn't really changed much over the last 50 years,

64
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:51,039
but perhaps more striking and ubiquitous is the prominence of moral panic in and around games within the news media.

65
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:56,750
Now, there's no shortage of examples I could draw from the news media,

66
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,712
but here are just a couple to kind of show you the range of what we see about games in the news,

67
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:05,314
from the generally innocuous kind of blanket statement,

68
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:09,777
video games are bad, to the more specific and ever pervasive narratives,

69
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:14,600
like the link between video game violence and specifically video games and mass shootings.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,802
particularly when it comes to young male offenders.

71
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:21,284
Now this is classic moral panic, ascribing an easy solution

72
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:23,766
to a complex problem that doesn't consider

73
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,127
subjective evaluations.

74
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:28,670
For example, with the violence in video game narrative

75
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,012
not considering the role of frustration tolerance

76
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:35,155
or previous exposure to violence or peer delinquency,

77
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,917
all of which have been found to contribute to real world

78
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,758
violent behaviors.

79
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:42,200
Unlike video games, which for the record,

80
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,981
have not been linked to real world violence.

81
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:49,354
And there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of studies examining its potential contribution.

82
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:55,857
Now that's just one discrepancy between science and society when it comes to the narratives around

83
00:04:55,857 --> 00:05:02,060
games and perhaps the most pervasive example of the moral panic driven, driving the games

84
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,082
are bad narrative. Here's another example.

85
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:10,378
In January 2021, I made some waves when I took to Twitter

86
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,459
with this moral panic-fueled headline

87
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,041
that was printed on the literal front page of The New York

88
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,142
Times, if you had a physical copy.

89
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:20,303
The title is, Children's Screen Time

90
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,384
Has Soared in the Pandemic, Alarming Parents

91
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:23,825
and Researchers.

92
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,846
I mean, those parents look disappointed.

93
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:28,147
Look at the expression on their faces.

94
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:31,089
Now, this article did focus on screen time generally,

95
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,270
but games had a starring role because, of course, they

96
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:38,646
As with all articles that came before it, it was far more moral panic than actual science.

97
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:43,209
This article was particularly upsetting to myself as a researcher because it was specifically

98
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,532
discussing increased video gameplay during the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown,

99
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:52,674
when many researchers were preaching about the potential of not just social screen time,

100
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:58,218
but video gameplay specifically for social connection and stress release and social play,

101
00:05:58,218 --> 00:05:58,478
but I died.

102
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:04,299
So here are a few snippets from this article in case you happen to miss this one.

103
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:08,781
Here's the first. Classic moral panic. You see here at the bottom the cost will be

104
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:13,002
borne by families because increased online use is associated with anxiety,

105
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:16,743
depression, obesity, aggression, and addiction to the medium itself.

106
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:21,326
Again, for the record, none of these claims are strongly supported by the scientific literature

107
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:25,811
when we're talking about games specifically, and I wish I had more time to go into that

108
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:29,875
because that's my jam, but as I mentioned earlier, I have an entire YouTube channel

109
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:34,540
dedicated to that if you're interested more in the science of games and their uses and effects.

110
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:39,532
Another quote is the negative framing of escapism,

111
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,753
which is classic.

112
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,413
We see here, Dr. Radesky said,

113
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:44,394
the mingling of all these functions

114
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:47,215
not only gives children a chance to multitask,

115
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:48,515
it also allows young people to escape

116
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:50,996
from any uncomfortable moment they may face.

117
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:53,017
If they're doing schoolwork that bores them,

118
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:56,118
she said, they can easily move into a pleasure cocoon

119
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:58,058
by watching YouTube, chatting with friends,

120
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:59,879
or playing a game.

121
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,680
I personally love the idea of a pleasure cocoon.

122
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,040
I found my pleasure cocoon of choice on Netflix recently.

123
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,685
and I know I'm not the only one, but we see she's talking more generally about screen time here.

124
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:16,610
Now historically video games have been specifically singled out as a negative escape because no one

125
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,834
really ever has anything bad to say about escaping into a good book or even an old Netflix binge,

126
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:27,579
right? This is really kind of an old hat when paired with video games and another consequence

127
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,040
of moral panic in the media.

128
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:36,598
Research has found that games, YouTube videos, books, Netflix, anything with Henry Cavill are cathartic forms of escapism

129
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:39,478
associated with stress reduction and mood management.

130
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,480
This was my favorite part of the article, so I had to mention it.

131
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,442
What are you going to do when you're married and stressed? Tell your wife you need to play Xbox.

132
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:53,240
I feel like if this was a live event, I would pause for laughter here.

133
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,402
Because yes, games are fantastic stress relievers,

134
00:07:56,402 --> 00:08:00,486
which I'm sure many of you watching here today can attest to.

135
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:02,988
I know for me, nothing gets my stress and frustration out

136
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:08,092
like saving a town heroically or toiling away on my Stardew Valley farm.

137
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:09,914
And again, the research supports this.

138
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:13,748
So why am I belaboring this point?

139
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:16,110
I'm sure you're all very familiar with the reputation

140
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,572
that games have in popular media and culture.

141
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:20,213
The reason I'm bringing this up today

142
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:21,694
is because you may not be aware

143
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,795
that researchers have been actively working

144
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,357
to combat this moral panic and misinformation

145
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:28,839
about games for the last 50 years.

146
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,500
And despite the wealth of information we have generated

147
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,682
as a research community, we have largely failed

148
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,524
to make any significant long-term change

149
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,005
to the public discourse.

150
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:41,555
Case in point, the continued link between violent video games

151
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:45,697
and real-world violence, despite a lack of scientific support.

152
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:47,939
And to be honest, if anything, the moral panic

153
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:49,680
in and around games has continued

154
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,962
to intensify over the last five decades,

155
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,703
alongside its continued rise in popularity.

156
00:08:56,772 --> 00:08:58,172
So why is this the case?

157
00:08:58,172 --> 00:08:59,393
Well, there are several reasons.

158
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:01,934
First, the moral panic plays into our human nature.

159
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,715
To be cognitive misers or lazy thinkers,

160
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,975
we want an easy solution to a complex problem.

161
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:09,136
And that's really at the heart of the moral panic.

162
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:11,717
But also, games researchers are not the best

163
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,158
at reaching out to the public.

164
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:16,759
First, in terms of having access to press and public relations,

165
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,740
but also being able to express scientific information

166
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,241
in relatable and understandable ways.

167
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:24,642
You did see my definition of moral panic earlier.

168
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:30,805
wasn't particularly relatable or understandable. But perhaps more foundationally, the moral

169
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:35,027
panning narrative has failed to change because our research simply isn't good enough.

170
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:41,510
The narrative remains, at least partially, due to limitations in our ability as a research community

171
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:47,032
to dispel many of these myths in systematic ways. But the good news is that many of these

172
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:51,915
limitations we face as researchers could be overcome through collaborative efforts with

173
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,175
industry partners.

174
00:09:55,342 --> 00:10:00,524
There are several players at hand when it comes to shaping our understanding of what games are and what they are not,

175
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:05,966
and consequently, the public discourse or narratives that we have in and around games.

176
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:09,707
There's the public, there's researchers, and there's the industry.

177
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:16,209
Information that derives from and is largely discussed within the public sphere

178
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:22,937
comes from stereotypes, pop culture, news media, personal experience, and anecdotal evidence.

179
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:27,642
This is why we have that South Park episode and why oftentimes when I'm interviewed at least one

180
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:32,788
question starts with, well I know someone who, and it's a question about violence or addiction.

181
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,783
Now, some of these sources of information in the public sphere

182
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,665
are informed by the work of researchers

183
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:42,330
through academic work and press and general advocacy.

184
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,452
Perhaps less informed than I would like them to be.

185
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:46,194
And of course, as we noted before,

186
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,677
it tends to focus more on the negative than the positive.

187
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:50,900
But somewhat informed nonetheless,

188
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,002
some information gets through.

189
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:55,786
Now the industry is another contributing voice

190
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,129
to the narratives around games.

191
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,573
The work of the industry is more insular,

192
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:02,037
far more so than what we see in academia,

193
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,059
which is saying something,

194
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,822
because you know academics like to live

195
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:05,383
in their ivory tower.

196
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:08,531
The industry's primary potential contribution

197
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:11,334
to the narratives and discussions about video game

198
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:13,877
uses and effects are things like user research

199
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:15,819
and other proprietary work.

200
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,302
However, this kind of research remains exclusively

201
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,005
within the particular walls of any particular studio

202
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,809
and doesn't really trickle out to either researchers

203
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:24,790
or the general public.

204
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,050
There are some exceptions to the insular nature of the industry

205
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,632
work, like the occasional general advocacy and outreach.

206
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:35,214
For example, what we see with the Raising Good Gamers

207
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:37,756
initiatives established by Games for Change

208
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:40,738
to catalyze positive change in the culture and climate

209
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:41,838
of online gaming.

210
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,960
They have several industry representatives

211
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,862
that serve on the advisory board for this initiative who

212
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:49,023
actively contribute their expertise and data.

213
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:53,243
This is a great example, but these kind of collaborations

214
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:54,724
are really rare.

215
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:57,725
Now, apart from collaborations like Raising Good Gamers,

216
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,007
the only other exception that I could

217
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:03,569
find to the insular nature of the industry's contribution

218
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,631
to the narrative about games is the ever-elusive practice

219
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:08,312
of data sharing.

220
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:12,354
Now, I know that made everyone sit up straighter, start

221
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:13,555
sweating, or both.

222
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:17,397
So what do I mean by data sharing?

223
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:19,518
Sharing information about a game.

224
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:24,238
whether it's about in-game actions, transactions, or player information

225
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:27,962
that is collected from the developer or publisher of any particular game

226
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:31,246
and shared with researchers from outside the particular

227
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:35,431
developer or studio, researchers from universities or organizations.

228
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:38,379
Why is data sharing important?

229
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,101
Because high quality data is the greatest limitation

230
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,762
that researchers face in game studies

231
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,784
and the most significant roadblock

232
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:47,386
to combating moral panic thinking and the games

233
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:48,727
or bad narratives.

234
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,350
The work of researchers is limited by the resources

235
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,292
we have access to, and our greatest limitation

236
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,754
is access to representative and robust data.

237
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:04,745
Lack of access to high quality data creates a range of challenges and limitations.

238
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:09,468
Firstly, it impacts our research designs. The vast majority of the work in game studies

239
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:13,952
assesses a snapshot of players, for instance. It collects information from a singular moment in time

240
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:17,974
rather than following the same players over time, which would allow for a better

241
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:22,017
assessment of change over time and examine potential cause and effect relationships.

242
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:25,885
A lack of direct access to players limits our scope of work.

243
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,367
Representative samples of players are difficult to come by in the wild,

244
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:32,829
and typically we have to rely on what we call snowball sampling,

245
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:35,790
which is posting a request to participate on social media

246
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,612
and hope that other players share in their networks

247
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:40,253
and the recruiting efforts snowball.

248
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,974
This kind of method tends to recruit the most keen players,

249
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:46,135
the most active players, rather than a representative variation

250
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:49,036
in player samples, which is part of the reason why so much work

251
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,818
in game studies has focused on the extremes, the most involved

252
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:55,779
players, because that's what we're most able to recruit.

253
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:58,581
Lack of players access also impacts

254
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,261
the number of participants we can recruit.

255
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:02,982
Sample sizes are a consideration.

256
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:06,284
If I'm lucky, I get 200, 300 maybe respondents to the work

257
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:07,304
that I do.

258
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,625
And it's hard to draw robust conclusions about,

259
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:09,945
you know, like.

260
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:13,273
2.5 billion gamers from a sample of 300.

261
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:18,695
There's also the impact on data that we can't even collect.

262
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:21,336
For example, researchers have to rely heavily

263
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:24,317
on self-reported data of time played rather than server log

264
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:24,617
data.

265
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:27,638
This is the difference between asking how many hours a week

266
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:30,979
do you play games versus knowing how many hours somebody logged

267
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:32,100
in Overwatch last week.

268
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,541
This is less than ideal, particularly

269
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,162
as we are terrible estimators of the amount of time

270
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:38,602
we spend doing it.

271
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,986
Having active collaboration with industry partners

272
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:44,927
could remedy all of these limitations.

273
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,529
Access to representative samples of players,

274
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,710
heaps of them, access to gameplay data,

275
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,832
and strengthen the ability for us as researchers

276
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,454
to generate more cohesive and accurate narratives

277
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:57,415
about the uses and effects of games.

278
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:03,584
Now, the next question that I'm sure you have in your mind is why should the industry bother

279
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:08,909
working with outside researchers? We don't have these limitations as members of the industry.

280
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:14,114
This is a you problem, right? You might also say, you know, outside researchers are kind of annoying

281
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:19,860
or terrible at time management and have different goals and no money. First of all, harsh. Second of

282
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,762
all, I have excellent time management skills.

283
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:28,168
But the truth is, researchers from the outside bring objectivity to the table,

284
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,851
which is key for informing public discourse.

285
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:33,854
Of course, game companies can write a white paper and say games are great.

286
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:35,555
That's to be expected.

287
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:40,360
But working together with outside objective research partners that can make

288
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,045
independent evaluations, you know, from academia or from non-profit organizations, for instance.

289
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,552
That's where the real power lies.

290
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:50,713
It's about working collaboratively

291
00:15:50,713 --> 00:15:53,314
with researchers who can make independent evaluations

292
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:57,276
with the support and resources of the industry behind it.

293
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:59,877
It's about working together to understand

294
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:03,859
the uses and effects of games as digital social interactive

295
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:04,240
medium.

296
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,769
Working collaboratively through data sharing

297
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,151
is how we go from this to this.

298
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:13,393
It's how the networks become integrated,

299
00:16:13,393 --> 00:16:15,915
our fronts united, our Triforce completed.

300
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:19,418
That was a missed opportunity to use a Triforce reference.

301
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,099
It's also how the dialogue starts to shift.

302
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,921
So I'm going to give you a couple of examples.

303
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:26,624
First, an illustration of how limitations

304
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:29,806
in the work of researchers have led to inaccurate narratives.

305
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:35,737
This 2020 paper looked at the estimation of iPhone use.

306
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:40,140
In the abstract, it says, among a sample of 325 iPhone users,

307
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,421
I told you sample sizes would be small.

308
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:46,003
They're hard to come by big sample sizes.

309
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:48,444
We found that participants misestimated

310
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:51,005
their weekly overall iPhone use by 19 hours

311
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:53,386
and social media use by 12 hours.

312
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:59,068
correlations between estimated use and well-being variables were stronger than the correlations

313
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:03,989
between actual use and well-being variables, and the degree of inaccuracy in estimated use

314
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:09,011
was associated with levels of participant well-being and amount of use. What does this mean?

315
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:13,812
First, we're terrible estimators of time, overestimating by almost 20 hours a week of actual use.

316
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:20,083
Now, keep in mind, almost all studies in technology use, but game studies specifically,

317
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,587
use this methodology of recalling how much time that you spent doing it.

318
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:28,753
And that estimated use was associated with negative well-being outcomes,

319
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:30,815
but actual screen time wasn't.

320
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:34,606
TLDR, self-report data can be widely inaccurate

321
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:36,267
and skew the findings and narratives

322
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,128
towards the negative, perpetuating

323
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:41,249
the moral panic in society about well-being and technology.

324
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:42,650
And yes, the same has been found when

325
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,931
it comes to games, which I'm going

326
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,251
to talk about in a minute.

327
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:47,732
Now, what happens when you have hundreds of papers using

328
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,733
this methodology of self-reflection,

329
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:52,755
finding negative relationships between well-being

330
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,796
and technology, whether it be iPhones or games?

331
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:58,698
You find someone compiles them into a very popular book that

332
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:00,559
fuels a new wave of moral panic.

333
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,541
which then gets passed on to popular culture,

334
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,242
news media, and ingrained in the public,

335
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:06,904
and the cycle continues.

336
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:09,205
And as I mentioned, yes, the same can be said for games.

337
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:11,167
And this has put us in a position

338
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,488
where we're playing catch up

339
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:17,171
to these very ingrained, skewed, and inaccurate negatives.

340
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:19,032
It's narratives, not negatives.

341
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:19,833
It's an uphill battle,

342
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,376
but not one that can be overcome in isolation,

343
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:24,917
because we've been trying for 50 years.

344
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,559
Now, I know the proof is in the pudding,

345
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,960
so here is your dessert.

346
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:30,785
This paper was released in 2020.

347
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:32,946
In this paper, Yohannes and colleagues

348
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,548
assess the relationship between video game play and well-being

349
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,708
in a unique way.

350
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,709
They analyzed players' actual play behavior

351
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:44,791
through a collaboration, a data-sharing collaboration,

352
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,812
with Electronic Arts and Nintendo of America.

353
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:50,093
In this study, they surveyed players

354
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,814
at Plants vs. Zombies, Battle for Neighborville,

355
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:54,795
and Animal Crossing New Horizons.

356
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,658
for their well-being and play motivations during play

357
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:01,062
and merged their responses with logged gameplay data provided

358
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:01,963
by the companies.

359
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:03,885
What did they find?

360
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:06,709
On average, players overestimated their gameplay,

361
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,512
just like we saw with iPhone use by two hours,

362
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:11,795
further supporting the idea we were terrible estimators

363
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:12,075
of time.

364
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,922
When it came to looking at the relationships between video gameplay and well-being,

365
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:21,324
the researchers found a positive relationship between playtime and well-being.

366
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:24,366
It was significant and it was positive using the server data.

367
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:27,267
But when they used the self-reported estimates,

368
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:31,509
the same positive relationships only remain for players of Animal Crossing

369
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:33,430
and not plants versus zombies,

370
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,472
highlighting the importance of objective rather than subjective playtime data.

371
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,331
So contrary to the fire and brimstone,

372
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:42,853
we often hear when it comes to the impact

373
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:44,554
of video games on well-being,

374
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:47,716
the researchers found a positive relationship

375
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:49,437
between gameplay and well-being.

376
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:52,799
They found that players who objectively played more

377
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,201
over the last two weeks also experienced greater well-being.

378
00:19:56,007 --> 00:20:00,429
As discussed in an interview, one of the researchers on the team, Andy Shabilsky, noticed, if we

379
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:05,892
look at the bottom three sentences here, if you play Animal Crossing for four hours a

380
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:10,394
day, every single day, you're likely to feel significantly happier than someone who doesn't.

381
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:14,296
This doesn't mean Animal Crossing by itself makes you happy, he added.

382
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,798
Forty years of previous research has suggested the longer people played, the more unhappy

383
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:19,018
they were.

384
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:22,372
That's not even the best part.

385
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:24,993
Because they were provided with objective play data,

386
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:27,554
the researchers were able to look objectively

387
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:30,475
at the relationships between well-being and playtime

388
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,876
and ended their paper with this nugget of goodness.

389
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:35,717
Although our data do not support causal claims,

390
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:38,118
they do speak to the broader conversation surrounding

391
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,859
the idea of video game addiction.

392
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:42,040
The discussion about video games has

393
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,181
focused on fears for a large part of players

394
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:45,161
becoming addicted.

395
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,498
Given their widespread popularity,

396
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,881
many policymakers are concerned about the negative effects

397
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:52,021
of gameplay on well-being.

398
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:53,923
Our results challenge that view.

399
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:56,145
The relation between playtime and well-being

400
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:59,287
was positive in two large samples, large samples,

401
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:02,629
because they had access to players from the companies.

402
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,112
Therefore, our study speaks against an immediate need

403
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:08,094
to regulate video games as a preventative measure

404
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:09,515
to limit video game addiction.

405
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:15,296
If anything, our results suggest that play could be an activity that relates positively to people's mental health,

406
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:19,058
and regulating games could withhold those benefits from players.

407
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:21,779
The magic word, regulation, right?

408
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,062
This singular paper, powered by collaboration with the industry,

409
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:32,525
contributed more robust evidence in the last 10 years of research done in isolation

410
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,186
against regulating games as a safeguard for players.

411
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,575
It also got an incredible amount of PR.

412
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:40,676
This study was lauded by the press.

413
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,377
I mean, look at these headlines.

414
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:44,498
Did you ever dream you would see so many headlines

415
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:46,379
about video games with the word good in them?

416
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:49,521
These headlines were only possible, excuse me,

417
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,422
were only possible because of the industry collaboration

418
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:56,344
with research partners outside of their four walls.

419
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:58,605
Data sharing allowed for independent evaluation

420
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:01,207
of the data from researchers from the Oxford Internet

421
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:04,148
Institute to demonstrate strong evidence

422
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:05,869
between the link between play and mental health.

423
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:12,134
Having industry support also brought weight and clout and more legitimacy to the strength of the

424
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:17,836
paper and the findings discussed within it, which in no doubt contributed to the increased press

425
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:23,958
coverage around it. The industry has such an opportunity when working together with researchers

426
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:29,380
outside their four walls to change and rehabilitate the narratives in and around games,

427
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,720
and these headlines are case in point.

428
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:38,244
Having active industry research partners is key to moving beyond this moral panic.

429
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:45,774
Now, by not partnering with external researchers, the industry is limiting their ability to craft a more accurate,

430
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:52,341
not moral panic driven, narrative in and around video game effects within broader societal context.

431
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,303
Aren't you tired of the games and violent old hat?

432
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:56,964
I am.

433
00:22:56,964 --> 00:22:59,528
And there's also a whole other range of things to explore

434
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:01,531
like games and mental health and games and learning

435
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:03,313
and games and social connection.

436
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,703
Working together is how we get from alarmist headlines,

437
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:11,064
like the one from the New York Times,

438
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:13,365
to more nuanced and accurate headlines,

439
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:16,085
like we see here in relation to the Oxford study,

440
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:18,586
that reflect the utility and reality

441
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:21,527
that the role that games play in our everyday lives,

442
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:25,368
whether it's about our well-being or games and learning

443
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:28,988
or social connection or family connection.

444
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:31,609
My hopes with the example here was to highlight

445
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:34,330
how critical of a component the industry is.

446
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:38,087
for creating more balanced and informed narratives around games,

447
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:42,228
and how collaboration can start to pivot conversations about video games

448
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:46,389
away from moral panic fears and towards a more accurate understanding of what

449
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:47,990
games are and what they are not.

450
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,291
To be clear, this is more than just about good PR.

451
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:56,972
The repercussions of having the power of industry behind this work

452
00:23:57,457 --> 00:24:02,140
will have wide-ranging effects for both science and society.

453
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,762
For science, providing researchers with industry-collected data

454
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:10,206
allows them to produce more robust research with higher external validity

455
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:13,828
that more accurately reflects the uses and effects of games.

456
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,890
This has a range of effects for society.

457
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,453
Having more robust research, consequently more press about the research,

458
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:24,335
will start to shift the games or bad narratives from the bottom up

459
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,877
to more accurately informed.

460
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:31,874
public opinions. Another societal consequence, well-designed and executed research, is the

461
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:37,117
foundation for political and policy debates around games, which we didn't touch so much on today,

462
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:43,861
but is equally rooted in moral panic. This is from 2021. GTA blamed for recent surge in

463
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:50,005
carjackings in Chicago. As I'm sure many of you are aware, this headline was discussing

464
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,227
a recently proposed sales ban on byline video games because of

465
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:58,848
of links, presumed links, between simulated violence in games and real world violence,

466
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:02,552
which I mentioned briefly is not something supported by the scientific research.

467
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:07,296
This policy decision, putting a sales ban bill up for debate or vote over

468
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:11,821
Fart God I Don't Think It Got Very Far This Time, was based on bad science.

469
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,602
Researchers and industry share the same goal when it comes to promoting well-informed,

470
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:23,265
evidence-based decision making. And working together, we can create a strong foundation

471
00:25:23,265 --> 00:25:29,208
for it, as we saw from that closing quote in the Johannes article. But to do that, we have to be

472
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:34,791
more engaged in independent research with outside organizations. This is how together we advance a

473
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:39,913
more active advocacy agenda, which benefits us all and is clearly needed.

474
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,923
Games are tools and pretty freaking great ones at that.

475
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,665
Tools for fun, tools for connection, tools for learning

476
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:51,069
and not tools for carjackings.

477
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:52,550
But in not working together,

478
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,232
the industry is missing the opportunity

479
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:55,593
to be a proactive partner

480
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:58,435
and shifting the narrative away from moral panic

481
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:00,958
and towards a more accurate and nuanced discussion

482
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,519
that reflects scientific reality.

483
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,722
It's about advancing an advocacy agenda

484
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:06,762
based on good science,

485
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:08,564
based on the best science that we can produce.

486
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:12,512
And we do that by joining together.

487
00:26:12,512 --> 00:26:15,473
Like coffee and a donut, we are better together.

488
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,154
And we must join together if we're

489
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:19,035
going to rehabilitate the narrative of games.

490
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,816
Think I'm the coffee in this analogy,

491
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:24,257
because I feel like games have to be the donut,

492
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:25,918
because everyone loves a donut, right?

493
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,950
Thank you guys so much for coming to this talk.
