1
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:11,785
get started. It is a long title for this talk. Whose game is it anyway is the question. How

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,947
community relationships shape games, five years of Warframe. So that's what we're going

3
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:20,109
to talk about today. My name is Rebecca Ford. I do live...

4
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:20,329
Stop!

5
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:20,469
Stop!

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:21,069
Stop!

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:21,309
Stop!

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:21,489
Stop!

9
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:21,629
Stop!

10
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:21,769
Stop!

11
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:22,049
Stop!

12
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:22,630
Stop!

13
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:22,950
Stop!

14
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:23,490
Stop!

15
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,750
Stop!

16
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,991
Stop!

17
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:25,251
Stop!

18
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:28,749
I paid them all to do that.

19
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:32,690
I'm, yes, I do live ops and community at Digital Extremes.

20
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,670
I've been there for about seven years

21
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,271
and I've worked exclusively on Warframe in that time.

22
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,191
So there's two things on this

23
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,692
that you might need to know a bit more about

24
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:43,652
to understand the context of this talk

25
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:46,473
and that is who are Digital Extremes and what is Warframe.

26
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:48,953
So geographically, Digital Extremes,

27
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:50,994
London, Ontario, Canada, my beautiful,

28
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,654
I know we have a multimedia guy here on our team

29
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:53,815
who probably hates this slide.

30
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,716
But that's an arrow pointing to us.

31
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,459
Our closest US city is Detroit, so that could give you

32
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,500
an idea of climate and or other things.

33
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,803
But the company has been around for 25 years, actually,

34
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:04,204
this year.

35
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,146
This is 1993 founding.

36
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:10,509
And in 2012, things really changed for the company,

37
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,891
and that is because of Warframe.

38
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,594
So this is a marketing version of what the game is.

39
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:18,716
In my words, it's free to play.

40
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:19,797
It's co-op.

41
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,879
It's a third person action looter shooter.

42
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:25,420
And that's what's, you know, we've been doing it for five years,

43
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,521
and I'm standing here today to tell you about that journey.

44
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:32,123
And I'll do it kind of structured in the classic Agenda style.

45
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:35,144
This is sort of what we're going to get through today.

46
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:37,585
We're going to talk about how we operate with Warframe

47
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:39,966
as a free-to-play game that's been operating for five years.

48
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:42,969
Then we're gonna get to the hits and the misses.

49
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,532
This is sort of, if you take as many swings at bat

50
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:46,973
as we have with all our updates,

51
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:48,755
some of them are hits and some are misses,

52
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,278
and when I say misses, this isn't disparaging work

53
00:01:51,298 --> 00:01:52,279
that we've done a bad job,

54
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,722
it's just the way the community responded to it.

55
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:56,384
And we have an amazing group of developers

56
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:59,107
and just sometimes things don't go the way we had hoped.

57
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:01,950
And then if there are questions at the end,

58
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,591
we can absolutely talk about those.

59
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,752
So again, multimedia cringe,

60
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:07,393
but I tried to make my character look like

61
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,374
the operation board game guy, but it didn't work.

62
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:15,778
So anyway, we went from a 750 meg file to 30 gigs.

63
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:16,878
That's a lot of growth.

64
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:18,959
That's a lot of game changes.

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,220
And how did we do it?

66
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:24,103
I bolded the only word that matters, which is consistency,

67
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:26,424
but the rest is, you know, good note taking.

68
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,127
It's because we really do update consistently with Warframe.

69
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,148
When you're a Warframe player on PC,

70
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,029
every week you're getting something.

71
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,151
If you're a Warframe player on console,

72
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,092
likely every month you're getting something,

73
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:42,335
and that consistency sort of makes its way in three areas.

74
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:44,276
It's either a fix, a change, an addition,

75
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:47,178
one of those, all of those, some combination of the two,

76
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:48,219
or the three, rather.

77
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,500
And that's a routine that our players really expect.

78
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,221
If it's a Wednesday on PC,

79
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:55,962
and we don't have a hotfix node out,

80
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:56,822
the players start asking,

81
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,162
where is it, what's happening this week?

82
00:02:58,442 --> 00:02:58,963
And we tell them.

83
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:00,383
We say, okay, well guess what?

84
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,984
We are a bit late with this week's update,

85
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:02,984
so expect it tomorrow.

86
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:06,785
Or we tell them, oops, it's actually gonna be Friday.

87
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,026
Or sometimes we say, actually,

88
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,086
we can't do anything this week.

89
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:12,387
But the communication is always consistent as well.

90
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:17,750
And that's with every relationship, I think it's the first part that is a take away is

91
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,173
that the community understands our routine of what we're doing with Warframe and when

92
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:26,715
they come to the forums to see what update we have, they know that we're going to have

93
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:30,978
something for them to read, whether it is the update or status of where that is.

94
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:34,006
But that routine has visuals.

95
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:34,988
It looks like this.

96
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,792
A weekly update for five years tends to change

97
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:38,733
the way the game looks.

98
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:41,758
So in 2012, a player would have come to Warframe

99
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,380
and seen what's on the left there.

100
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,922
They saw some blue menus,

101
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:46,164
they saw their character in the middle.

102
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,706
And in 2018, if a player comes to Warframe,

103
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:50,426
they see, you know, this is the same screen.

104
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:51,687
It serves the same function,

105
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:54,548
but they're seeing five years of growth and consistency.

106
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,408
They're seeing a UI overhaul.

107
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:57,469
They're seeing better lighting.

108
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,930
They're seeing a physical space for their character

109
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,750
rather than sort of floating in space.

110
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,531
And they see cloth physics, which is great.

111
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:10,635
That's a great from a dev lens, you know, you can see really clearly the improvement that the game has gone through from the hard work of a team.

112
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:15,377
But from the community lens, because that's what we're talking about today, it looks a little more like this.

113
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:19,679
It's Space Barbies now. We have hot pink and we have...

114
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:24,582
purples and we have a very, very nice stance going on here.

115
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,124
And I know it's a bit of a joke to say space Barbies,

116
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,805
but the relationship that this picture shows

117
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,646
actually is quite in depth.

118
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:34,488
And it starts with something silly like a bobblehead.

119
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,450
Cause you know, when Warframe added spaceships to the game,

120
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,631
players thought a good thing for a spaceship

121
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:40,452
would be a bobblehead.

122
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,113
So Dev made it so.

123
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:46,056
And players are quite talented, and the community can really

124
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:47,877
foster some interesting artistic talent.

125
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,139
So we started doing user-generated content,

126
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,400
and players had that idea.

127
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,622
We were able to do it, so dev made it so.

128
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:59,025
We have my, I think it's my right foot on my left thigh,

129
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,427
looking quite graceful, because players wanted

130
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,988
more in-depth customization.

131
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,990
So they said, we should be able to mix and match

132
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,251
animation stances, so dev made it so.

133
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,864
I'm holding a gun here that is only accessible

134
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:13,386
if you've played the game for a long time.

135
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,050
It's a loyalty reward of sorts, a login reward system.

136
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:19,115
Our original login system wasn't particularly rewarding,

137
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:21,839
so the players wanted a new one, so dev made it so,

138
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,041
and now you can get weapons through it.

139
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:27,542
And the last sort of thing that's hidden behind all my other arrows, I guess,

140
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,623
is a beautiful cape.

141
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,163
You know, what's a game without capes?

142
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:33,424
But that was something that Dev actually wanted.

143
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,604
They thought having cloth physics in Warframe,

144
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:37,385
being a little more robust, would make it look better.

145
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,945
And players agreed.

146
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:41,986
So Dev wanted it. Players thought, hey, that's pretty cool.

147
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,866
So again, Dev made it so.

148
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:46,167
And that's really the simplified version

149
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:47,387
of how our relationship works.

150
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,588
can want something and dev makes it so.

151
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:52,748
But of course it's not that simple

152
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,789
because there's sometimes thousands of players

153
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:58,290
when we were starting and now we have millions of players.

154
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,511
So when millions of players want something

155
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,351
and you only have about 200 devs to make it so,

156
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:05,732
how can you solve that problem?

157
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:08,353
So what we try to do is empower our community team

158
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,013
to try and make sense of all that,

159
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:14,594
to prioritize, to learn how to say no or yes

160
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:17,255
to either sides of this equation, the beginning or the end.

161
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:20,818
And basically with this structure,

162
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,481
we've been able to have a lot of hits and misses

163
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:24,222
with our community.

164
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:26,104
We have tried a lot of different things

165
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:27,245
in Warframe's lifetime.

166
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:30,729
And it's been a long and wonderful five years,

167
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:33,271
and we will start talking about what the hits and misses

168
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,433
have been with the community relationships

169
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:36,915
on these deployments.

170
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:40,277
And when I say deployments, I truly mean

171
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,739
a lot of deployments and a lot of swings over time.

172
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,820
This is some publicly available data from Steam.

173
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,941
It's our concurrency on Steamspy,

174
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,322
so you can see that we started,

175
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:52,063
and luckily we've grown and grown,

176
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,264
and it's going up and it's great.

177
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,205
And of course, there's timestamps of years on this,

178
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:58,846
so we should talk about those years,

179
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,147
and we should talk about what happened,

180
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:01,568
what good and bad things happened

181
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:04,289
with the community relationship based on Warframe.

182
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,570
So a bit more structure for you, as time is linear,

183
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,771
I will start in 2012 and make my way over the years

184
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:14,312
leading up to today to really give you a hit,

185
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:17,113
give you a miss, talk about what we did, and then recap it.

186
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:20,414
But all Warframe stories should probably start

187
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,035
at the beginning, so to 2012 we go.

188
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,556
So once upon a time, Digital Extremes, the company,

189
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:30,237
is mid-layoffs, and Warframe really is a last ditch effort

190
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:32,458
for the company to not go under.

191
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:37,850
So this year we were, the hit of this year was infrastructure.

192
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,011
And this is something that isn't reflected in the game,

193
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:43,472
but it's reflected in the tools we built around the game

194
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:45,152
to do it ourselves.

195
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,293
Because we had no publisher.

196
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,534
We only had the sort of, I'll say,

197
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,094
desperation to make it work.

198
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:52,235
So what did that mean?

199
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:54,576
We did a lot of research into things like Zendesk

200
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:58,037
having forums, having a scalable back end,

201
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:01,578
which is some fun stuff to work with for a free-to-play game.

202
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,799
How are people going to download the game client?

203
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,720
How are they going to log in?

204
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,161
How are they going to authenticate emails?

205
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,481
So doing all that type of research,

206
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,963
it was a very accessible game in 2012,

207
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,485
which was great if the game didn't have a miss,

208
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:15,966
such as bad free-to-play design.

209
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,167
So not that it was bad, it was just

210
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:19,908
we were making a lot of mistakes.

211
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,811
And those mistakes are scary when you're doing it yourself

212
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:25,832
because to release a free-to-play game

213
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,733
and have some of the first reactions to it be pay-to-win,

214
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:34,558
That's very dangerous and for us, very early on, we really spent a lot of time making mistakes

215
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,721
that we didn't know we were making because we had never done free-to-play before, which

216
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:41,744
could be the case for some of you, could not be the case, but it's scary and it feels really

217
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:47,249
bad to see that your community that was born two months ago is starting to say things about

218
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,309
it.

219
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,613
the game that you might not have realized was negative.

220
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,374
And it's really easy to pinpoint,

221
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:54,016
if you listen to the community,

222
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:56,018
what the mistakes looked like.

223
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,561
So another red arrow, a different styled one this time,

224
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,363
is pointing at this gold icon,

225
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:03,065
which our community calls potatoes,

226
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:07,650
which in early 2012, Miss Warframe signified pay to win.

227
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,132
It signified having access to power levels

228
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:11,714
through real money.

229
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,564
And that was bad, and that's not a good way to start your free-to-play journey.

230
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:19,725
So what did we do?

231
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:22,367
It's quite misleadingly simple, in fact.

232
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:26,309
This year we just listened and changed very quickly.

233
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:29,892
So we're sitting at forums that, of course, we did not invent forums,

234
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,753
using software for support that, of course, we did not invent.

235
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:37,617
But we used it with the desperation of a company that was on its last legs

236
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:40,679
to really do what we said we wanted to do,

237
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:42,340
and that was to make fair free-to-play.

238
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,741
And what we found was that relying on the community

239
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,382
to decide what is and isn't fair

240
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,422
was a really important part of early Warframe.

241
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,623
And we knew from, you know,

242
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:53,304
as we learned from the error of our ways,

243
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,664
which had no malice behind them,

244
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:55,945
we were just simply, we didn't know.

245
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:58,406
We knew that we wanted fair, free to play

246
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,846
to be a part of Warframe's DNA.

247
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:04,570
Which leads us to the next year after 2012, which is 2013,

248
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,294
which is a year that was really interesting for Warframe.

249
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:10,236
We started doing some real-time communication

250
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:12,699
with our communities that did change the relationship.

251
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,862
And the first hit of this year

252
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,604
isn't an in-game thing yet again.

253
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:18,265
It's the way we talked about our game,

254
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,527
which was with dev streams.

255
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,490
So dev streams are something we started in 2013.

256
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,892
We've been doing them for five years now bi-weekly.

257
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:27,654
This is a thumbnail from almost every stream we've done.

258
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:29,656
Get all the devs on there,

259
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,958
sometimes the regular crew, sometimes not.

260
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,821
What we did was we just talked about the game.

261
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:36,282
We talked about what's changing,

262
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,724
and we used it as

263
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:40,066
a scalable way to answer questions from our community.

264
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,728
If you have 200 forum posts asking the same question,

265
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,131
you can answer one and hope your answer spreads,

266
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,955
or you can see that there's clearly a need for a broader,

267
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:51,137
more scalable communication, in which case,

268
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:52,558
ta-da, we did Devstreams.

269
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:53,239
We do them on Twitch.

270
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,763
It's one of the many tools we use for community.

271
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,056
including, you know, you have your forums, you have Reddit,

272
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:02,857
you have, of course, DevStreams, the Wikia is good for us,

273
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:05,098
as well as, you know, your web tools

274
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:07,759
that you can sort of customize for blogs and what it may be.

275
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,841
But these have been great and, you know,

276
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:11,961
five years going with them.

277
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,342
However, in the actual game sense,

278
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,663
a hit this year for the community was Clans.

279
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:20,244
This is an explicit social structure in Warframe.

280
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:23,845
This is someone coming into Warframe, doing their missions,

281
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:26,486
but then staying in Warframe because their clanmates are there.

282
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:29,306
And they're staying in Warframe because they get to build this

283
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:33,167
space treehouse dojo that is theirs and theirs alone.

284
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:38,528
And that's really great for the social and relationship experience between clans, but...

285
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,173
Statistically, we've found that the sooner someone's in a clan, the longer they play

286
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:47,355
Warframe, the more they engage with, so it's good for retention as well.

287
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:51,799
And it's actually also really interesting from a relationship point of view, because

288
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,200
clans have identities.

289
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,824
You know, if you've been in a clan that's PvP focused, or perhaps customization focused,

290
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:02,347
competitive, it gives people on the inside a way to access...

291
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,049
a member of that clan, perhaps the leader of it,

292
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:07,591
and get really concise information about players

293
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,633
with that goal set for the game.

294
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:11,775
So they're really useful if you can get close

295
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,996
with the clan members sometimes.

296
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,338
They don't wanna get close to you, but it's totally fine.

297
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:16,179
You just gotta make it work.

298
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,121
Yes, now The Mist.

299
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:21,984
This is always the fun part because things go wrong.

300
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:24,966
This is a fun comic from Penny Arcade.

301
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:26,228
You know, you got your player.

302
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:32,232
your Warframe landing in and he looks over at his co-op buddy and he's all decked out in cosmetics because of course

303
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:39,177
In free-to-play you'll often find cosmetics are a way to monetize and we have done that with great success

304
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:43,381
But it's not always been a consistent success because early Warframe

305
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:50,866
Stats had cosmetics and if you're buying something and it changes the way you play that's also dangerous for free-to-play. So

306
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:55,310
We stopped doing that in 2013. We said no more stats on cosmetics

307
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:59,497
But the eternal war had only begun in that line of work

308
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:02,681
because here I am in 2018 with a screenshot of my character

309
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,384
with a helmet that has stats on it.

310
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,628
So in 2013, we got rid of stats on cosmetics,

311
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,931
but in 2018, I still have the item.

312
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:11,872
So how can that be?

313
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:13,274
How can these things coexist?

314
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,316
And the answer is community relationships are complicated.

315
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,518
So this is when your eyes may begin to lose focus

316
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:20,839
because it's a lot of words on a slide,

317
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,760
but it is a complicated history

318
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,862
and that's sort of the essence of change

319
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:28,104
and community growth is that there usually is a history.

320
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:31,686
So in 2012 and 2013, our nice looking helmets

321
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:33,667
had stats on them that Dev decided.

322
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,569
But in 2013, we saw that the community didn't want that

323
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:38,390
because they didn't want to have to spend money

324
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,771
on things that changed the way they looked.

325
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:42,653
So we said, okay, no more stats, but guess what?

326
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:44,975
Anyone that had that item, you're grandfathered in

327
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:47,096
because you can't take away a loyal player's investment.

328
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:50,199
So then 2014 rolls around and those loyal players

329
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,700
wanted to take off those stats,

330
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,401
so we added a tool for them to do that.

331
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:56,523
And then 2015 rolls around and you know what?

332
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:58,625
What if we put stats back on cosmetics

333
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:00,507
but players could choose their own stats?

334
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:01,407
So we did that.

335
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,889
And now it's 2018 and literally two weeks ago,

336
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,310
cosmetics don't have stats anymore.

337
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:10,111
So if that's making your head explode,

338
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:12,192
that's sort of the point.

339
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,534
Community relationships are complicated,

340
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:17,356
and just a little slice of the work we do,

341
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:19,537
even if something as simple as stats on cosmetics,

342
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:22,059
it has history, and the history always,

343
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,440
in our case, at least we try to respect

344
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,442
the player investment up until that point.

345
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:29,484
So a loyal player that liked the stats on cosmetics,

346
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:30,744
they should get to keep them,

347
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:32,546
even though we're changing the way the system works.

348
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,867
So yeah, it's sort of 2013's myth that carries on

349
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:38,027
to the eternal war to this day.

350
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,228
But what did we do?

351
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,389
In the same way that Goku can take the energy of people

352
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:45,030
and turn it into something useful on the community team,

353
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,590
we sort of tried to do the same thing.

354
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,771
You really just need to focus on the consistency

355
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:52,532
across the players' messages to you

356
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:54,633
to make sure that what you're taking in

357
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,893
and putting back out is useful.

358
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:59,294
And you know, nothing's better than a spirit bomb sometimes.

359
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:00,655
But, great.

360
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,741
Recapping that real quick, in 2013 what we found was,

361
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,062
for this relationship with our Warframe players,

362
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,402
we had to grow our channels to communicate

363
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:11,443
and we had to use them to talk about change.

364
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:12,863
We don't just sit on a dev stream and say,

365
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:14,544
here's a new thing you can buy in two months.

366
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:15,984
It's, hey, guess what?

367
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:17,264
This change is coming again.

368
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,185
And you know, you see Twitch chat explode

369
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:21,405
with sometimes negativity, but that's okay

370
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:22,846
because you're there and you're gonna deal

371
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:23,726
with it on the spot.

372
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:27,802
And 2014 rolls around as you would expect.

373
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:33,231
And for the game this year, things went a little rapidly crazy with change.

374
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,073
We're on a

375
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,622
of a year where we're changing combat, we're changing visuals, and we're actually adding

376
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:41,203
story to our little looter shooter.

377
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:44,224
So in, you know, 2014 we have our hit.

378
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,425
I'm not going to play the sound on this, or will I, because I don't have a choice.

379
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:48,886
Okay, I'll talk over it.

380
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:49,766
But this is Melee 2.0.

381
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:56,389
So Melee 2.0 comes around, it allows a player to equip their melee weapon and do combos,

382
00:15:56,409 --> 00:16:01,671
they can block incoming fire, and they get to equip that sword and that sword alone.

383
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,973
Up until this point, players had only been able to quick melee,

384
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:08,455
so their swords were sheathed, and they could only pull them out quickly

385
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:10,836
and maybe do a charge attack, but that was it.

386
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,538
And we redid our melee system because the players wanted us to.

387
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:18,761
They were growing a collection of melee weapons that they felt were too similar,

388
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:22,383
and they thought it was about time that we redid that system.

389
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:25,124
So if you've been making a game for two years at this point,

390
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:26,865
and you hear it's time to redo systems...

391
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:29,646
Well, you better get started if you're us.

392
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:36,108
So we didn't just redo it, we redid it sort of biweekly reports to our community.

393
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:41,129
We showed our team, our community rather, through the dev streams like here's a gray

394
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:44,550
box of what I was working on two minutes ago and this is what it's probably going to look

395
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,371
like because it allowed us to, and then the one on the other.

396
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:48,832
that's actually a really cool gift,

397
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:51,173
but that one is a newer melee thing that's coming

398
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:52,454
because we're still working on this.

399
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,636
Even in 2014, introducing the system was one thing,

400
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:57,337
but players still wanted more,

401
00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:59,178
so we continued to revisit it to this day.

402
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,299
And that was a massive change for the game

403
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:03,780
because we added so much more to the system

404
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,882
that players were asking for in the effect of,

405
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,723
I want to go out there with my own sword like a ninja

406
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,444
instead of always having to have a gun with me.

407
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:11,305
And we did it.

408
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:13,126
and we showed them the progress.

409
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,026
So, a miss.

410
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,726
The words grind frame sometimes come to mind

411
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,907
for people with Warframe, and it's not, you know,

412
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,608
I play all the time and this is the world we live in,

413
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:25,988
but it's easy for us to sometimes contribute

414
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:27,608
to that narrative if we're not careful.

415
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:29,849
And we're never malicious about anything,

416
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,229
but it's just really hard to balance resources

417
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,790
in a free-to-play game, because the way players engage freely

418
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,751
with your game, they have to earn their gear,

419
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:39,271
and they get to go collect resources.

420
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,192
And this particular resource, you know,

421
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:43,893
it looks quite innocuous at a glance,

422
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:46,755
it's nice and crystally, but it's actually called Oxium,

423
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,496
and it's something we added to the game

424
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,458
just to give players something else to go after

425
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,239
to build the new content we were making.

426
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:56,120
Because we're adding, and in order to have people

427
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,622
start all from the same place to get that gear,

428
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:00,803
everyone gets a new resource to go after to do it.

429
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:06,988
And sometimes we miss the mark on balancing that and understanding that a player maybe

430
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:10,330
doesn't want to spend six hours doing the same thing over and over again, or maybe they're

431
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,712
okay with it if the gameplay is a little different.

432
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:18,015
But ultimately, Oxiom represents sort of the beginning of the difficulties we've had with

433
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:19,296
resource balancing.

434
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:24,859
And what's really interesting statistically is when the community notices, which, you

435
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,901
know, they notice the moments that something like this happens, they keep track of it.

436
00:18:28,702 --> 00:18:32,004
And there's often a point from the community where they'll say something like, you guys

437
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,985
must be raking in the platinum because you made this so hard to get.

438
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,146
And that's actually not true.

439
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:38,808
A lot of the data that we've looked into for this.

440
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:42,049
is if you look at something that has a high grind cost,

441
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,250
it doesn't actually sell any better

442
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,171
than the things that are easier to make.

443
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,852
So we're not really benefiting from it at all.

444
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:52,834
All it's doing is giving the community points of,

445
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,015
basically pain points to say,

446
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:56,476
this doesn't feel good and you shouldn't do this.

447
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:58,037
So you always need to think about that

448
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,137
before you release something.

449
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:01,158
But if you're releasing an economy from scratch,

450
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:03,559
you do your best, but it doesn't always go right.

451
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:05,353
So what did we do this year?

452
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:07,874
In many ways, we just took it all in.

453
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,075
The great things that were coming from Melee 2.0

454
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:13,215
were extremely positive feedback,

455
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,736
engagement with the Melee system.

456
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,837
Players were very satisfied with that,

457
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:20,418
but at the same time, we were taking in all the feedback

458
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,179
about what players were saying Warframe was becoming,

459
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,400
which was grind frame, which has a negative connotation,

460
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,041
but ultimately, the way of the game is to get your resources.

461
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:31,661
So it's tricky.

462
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:32,648
So you just take it in.

463
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:35,910
And in 2014, we learned that change is one thing,

464
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:36,951
overhauling is another.

465
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:38,432
So don't just change, of course.

466
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,273
You should overhaul.

467
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:41,414
And when the community does start to weigh in

468
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,416
on grind tolerance, take note.

469
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:46,298
So on our team, we were taking note of how,

470
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,539
what was the difference between someone saying,

471
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:49,560
oh, I can't get this now,

472
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,862
or the more voices added to that

473
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:54,523
particular line of feedback.

474
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,535
All right, another year, here we go, 2015.

475
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:00,837
This was a really interesting year for Warframe.

476
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:03,619
We added our first cinematic quest this year,

477
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,981
as well as our first region locked content,

478
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:09,604
which simply put, we added a really good surprise this year

479
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:10,824
and a really bad surprise.

480
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:13,566
So the good surprise was the second dream.

481
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,408
And I do have a little video on this

482
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:18,110
because of course the word community relationships

483
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,651
were heavily in my title.

484
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:24,674
Having a good surprise for a player at this point who had been playing for three years,

485
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:30,019
the way they reacted to us surprising them with content that told an emotional story,

486
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:33,161
because up until this point, you know, you're going into different maps,

487
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:36,464
you're shooting, you're getting your loot, your character's starting to feel really awesome,

488
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,526
but there's no emotional weight to what you're doing

489
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:43,269
to the degree of what we unleashed this year with The Second Dream.

490
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,690
So I'll quickly play this video.

491
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,652
And it's just a collection...

492
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:48,773
Well, you'll see, I'll show it.

493
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:59,614
Wow. Oh my god, that looks sick. What is going on?

494
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:10,759
Oh my god. That is mind-fuckingly amazing. Just incredible. Oh my god. What?

495
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:19,564
Oh my god, that's so cool. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Wow, this is so cool.

496
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:21,505
This was unbelievably amazing.

497
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,327
Oh my god, I enjoyed that more than anything I've ever enjoyed in Warframe.

498
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:36,504
Right, so if you are in a three-year relationship

499
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:38,285
with your community and for the first time ever

500
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,466
you get a reaction like that, it feels great.

501
00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:42,067
And the reason we were able to do it

502
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:43,228
is because we surprised them.

503
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:45,389
So on the one hand you have these dev streams

504
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:47,851
and you're showing the gray boxes of your melee animations,

505
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:50,792
you're showing just crazy things happening

506
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:51,893
in the game that they expect.

507
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:53,474
And then to deliver the unexpected

508
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:56,295
to that loyal player base, yielded a reaction like that,

509
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:58,337
which for the relationship with the community

510
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:01,298
really expressed a turning point in,

511
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:02,279
not only did they want us.

512
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:09,563
They didn't just want the entertainment of Warframe space ninjas, they now wanted more story and they wanted to relive this moment again.

513
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,905
So we've been trying to do that year after year. It's not easy, but we'll get there.

514
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:20,709
So that's a good surprise, but a bad surprise. This picture again quite innocuous without context, but this is Umbra.

515
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,350
This is when 2015 hit Warframe

516
00:22:24,351 --> 00:22:27,733
got a deal to launch in China and to hype it up we

517
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,383
had added region-exclusive content to that build.

518
00:22:31,603 --> 00:22:34,204
And the global player base saw it and said,

519
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:35,045
when do we get that?

520
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,006
And we didn't have an answer, because we didn't know.

521
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:41,008
So everyone's Google translating the Chinese press release.

522
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:42,749
I'm reading them saying, is this true?

523
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:43,649
What's going on here?

524
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,491
Because we had a bad surprise in many ways.

525
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,471
And we weren't prepared.

526
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:50,393
to communicate this information to our loyal players

527
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:52,194
who wanted nothing more than to know

528
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:53,075
when they were getting this.

529
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,577
Which, by the way, they still haven't gotten.

530
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:59,699
And even last year when we announced Warframe's open world

531
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,122
on live television, the most used words in chat were Umbra

532
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:05,823
because they had waited so long.

533
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:08,725
And even though we just minorly teased Umbra last year,

534
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:11,867
that's what the Twitch chat really grabbed onto.

535
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:13,048
So you can see on the left-hand side.

536
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:14,509
So that's a bad surprise.

537
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,890
There's always hindsight with community relationships.

538
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,631
I wish we had communicated it differently.

539
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:22,231
I wish we had known about it in advance.

540
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:25,172
But that doesn't, you can't, that'll never work.

541
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:26,672
You can never go back and redo something

542
00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:27,933
in a community relationship.

543
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:29,713
So what did we do?

544
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:31,474
Well, we did two things.

545
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:33,994
On the one hand, it was, you know,

546
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,655
with the dawn of streaming and YouTubing,

547
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,415
I'm sure everyone sees how big that's getting,

548
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,856
having the players broadcast themselves,

549
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,336
playing our content, allowed us to capture the moments

550
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:42,856
that really,

551
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:47,307
you know, the surprise and delight of doing a Warframe quest for the first time.

552
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:48,530
And on the other hand, uh...

553
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:52,043
We had to try and put out a lot of fires with Umbra

554
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,824
that we actually continue to do to this day.

555
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:56,064
And what can you do?

556
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:59,125
Bad surprises linger, but there's a thirst for it now,

557
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:01,106
which is kind of interesting to observe.

558
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:04,167
But either way, 2015 was all about taking risks

559
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,948
and really planning to surprise our loyal players

560
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:10,009
with the good surprises, but not bad ones.

561
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:11,790
Well, what can you do if a bad surprise comes out?

562
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,610
Because usually you're caught in the crossfire as well.

563
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:17,673
So, on the heels of that inspiring reaction video

564
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:20,495
about The Second Dream, 2016 rolls around

565
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:24,517
and the way that the players reacted to The Second Dream

566
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,740
was starting to sort of deteriorate the desperation DNA

567
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,980
we were having as a company,

568
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:30,982
because we really felt like we were onto something.

569
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:32,463
Because when your game you've been working on

570
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:35,264
for three years starts to elicit a response like that,

571
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,026
it really feels like, okay, we're doing this now.

572
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:40,488
Let's see what we can do with this.

573
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:42,789
So, of course, what best way to take a...

574
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,491
a successful moment than to not just turn around and look back and say,

575
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:47,991
what did we leave behind along the way?

576
00:24:48,091 --> 00:24:50,812
So 2016's hit was a little bit of nostalgia.

577
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:54,033
Up until this point, the game had continued to change, grow.

578
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:56,774
I don't know exactly what our file size was in 2016,

579
00:24:56,814 --> 00:24:59,735
but you know point A was 750 and point B today is 30.

580
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:02,036
So we're talking somewhere around 20 gigs probably.

581
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:04,076
and that's a lot of change and additions.

582
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,057
So we decided to redo our navigation system

583
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:08,838
for about the fourth time this year

584
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,318
because the players wanted us to.

585
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,499
We had given them this in 2016 and a bit earlier,

586
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,460
which was a console-friendly, we thought,

587
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,360
a user-friendly way to navigate our game.

588
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,781
You know what planet you're going to,

589
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:21,081
you pick your mission tile.

590
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,722
But it turns out the players didn't like it

591
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:25,302
and had been telling us for a long time.

592
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:27,183
And not only that, it actually was worse

593
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:29,604
for retention, statistically.

594
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:29,664
So.

595
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:34,138
with all great things, go back to some nostalgic roots,

596
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,901
and return the star chart to its node and line form,

597
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:39,703
which was something the players had really wanted

598
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:41,804
since we abandoned it for the tile system.

599
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:43,806
And this brought, even though this was a bit

600
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:45,607
of a bumpy launch, as it can happen,

601
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,150
the players saw our commitment to the past Warframe vision

602
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:52,153
and felt that even though we had changed the story

603
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:55,235
in the year prior, the roots were still there, especially.

604
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:58,818
in the visuals access points to all things Warframe.

605
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:00,779
Every planet and every mission was starting to look

606
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:02,640
a little more like it used to.

607
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:06,563
And Amiss this year, so with every hit comes Amiss,

608
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,005
this is something that, again, it's a brief video,

609
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:13,707
that it was the most fun I think a lot of people

610
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,929
at DE had developing it, which has,

611
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,191
that doesn't mean the player as well.

612
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:19,891
So let's take a look.

613
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:24,294
You have refused the blood of the conclaves.

614
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:30,816
I call to you to join us in honor-bound tradition.

615
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:34,063
Team Aurora, at the ready!

616
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:50,782
Okay, so we were at PAX and we were coming off the heels of the second dream and we showed

617
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:53,623
that video and we were all grinning because we were like, yes, players are going to love

618
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:53,884
this.

619
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:57,446
And because we love, you know, you heard the chanting in the video, that's the devs in

620
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:59,868
the theater, like having a great time.

621
00:27:00,188 --> 00:27:04,331
We were adding a sport to Warframe because Warframe is not a competitive game, it's cooperative.

622
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:06,572
So surely the way to do competition is with a sport.

623
00:27:07,072 --> 00:27:10,016
and it was just silent, the reaction at PAX East.

624
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:12,638
And we had to release it, of course,

625
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,221
and we still, I still love it,

626
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:18,104
and I just know that even though we loved making it,

627
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:20,787
it did not resonate with our player base at all.

628
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,689
And you kind of had to.

629
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:24,606
acknowledge that.

630
00:27:24,806 --> 00:27:26,906
And you had to look at it and look at the way it released

631
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:30,327
and say, okay, I guess we're not updating

632
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,507
that content type anymore,

633
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,528
even though we had a lot of fun making it.

634
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:36,089
Which was sort of, what did we do, right?

635
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:37,629
Well, in the same way that,

636
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,010
we tried, and honestly, the team worked so hard

637
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,811
on surprising our players with different things,

638
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,931
and I wouldn't have not done it ever

639
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:47,012
because it was just so fun.

640
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:49,712
But the players understood that we were taking risks

641
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,533
and trying, and they're not gonna be mad

642
00:27:51,593 --> 00:27:53,193
about your mom embarrassing you.

643
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:54,635
you know, it's fine.

644
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,099
And we also found that this year, 2016,

645
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,103
we were really hitting our stride on our platform launches.

646
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:02,146
So we're not just a PC game anymore,

647
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,330
we're also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox.

648
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,753
So things were starting to get a little muddy

649
00:28:06,813 --> 00:28:08,355
about who's getting what information.

650
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:10,517
So because we eat a lot of Domino's pizza,

651
00:28:10,577 --> 00:28:12,777
we thought we should do a pizza tracker for our builds.

652
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:15,418
So we built, because you know you get your pizza,

653
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:17,559
George is making it and Tracy's bringing it to you.

654
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,860
So on our website, we built a sort of,

655
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,140
that version for our platforms.

656
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,501
So on PC, there's really only two states

657
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:25,601
in development and live,

658
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:28,422
but on consoles you have development, cert, and live.

659
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:31,563
And these always point to a human source of information.

660
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,464
So one of our community members on that team

661
00:28:33,804 --> 00:28:35,545
makes a thread, says, hey everyone, guess what?

662
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:38,186
the build's in the oven, and it's going to have this, this, and this,

663
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:39,947
and we'll let you know when it's insert.

664
00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:42,990
And we used this, we just made this little widget.

665
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,932
It points to, you know, different statuses and different links

666
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,034
for you to always base in our forms,

667
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,055
just to have these conversations with your players

668
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:52,456
about where their builds are.

669
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:55,378
And of course, if you have a complex multi-platform game

670
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:58,340
with no build parity, you might want something like this,

671
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,481
which is our case.

672
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:03,205
So, yeah, 2016, what we learned that year

673
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:04,986
was never stop changing and overhauling.

674
00:29:05,387 --> 00:29:07,549
And as a group of devs who have, at this point,

675
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,572
four years of lessons, the fun you have developing

676
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:13,396
something might not resonate with your players,

677
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:15,378
and maybe you should move on quickly from that,

678
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:16,199
if that's the case.

679
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:20,641
And so we did, even though, I don't think I played it in our own like a year, but I'm

680
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:23,483
going to now because I got nostalgic, which apparently was a lesson from 2015.

681
00:29:24,644 --> 00:29:25,644
Oh no, actually 2016, sorry.

682
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:32,588
Anywho, so 2017, this is last year, and this was a year for Warframe when we talk a literal

683
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:33,749
community relationship.

684
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,229
We had one of the worst.

685
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:37,906
and best moments in the same year.

686
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:40,507
So I'm gonna start with the miss this year,

687
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:41,647
and then I'll talk about the hit.

688
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,628
So whatever structure I gave the past years,

689
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:46,648
just not anymore, the miss.

690
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:48,929
So DE versus data mining.

691
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:50,830
So for all these years now,

692
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,730
we had really turned a blind eye

693
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,591
to the data mining side of Warframe

694
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:56,511
while we had done things under the hood,

695
00:29:57,592 --> 00:29:59,572
you know, to make sure that we weren't leaking content,

696
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:01,313
that we weren't ready to announce or anything.

697
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:03,593
We just really hadn't.

698
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:06,048
acknowledged it, I suppose.

699
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:07,869
But when we literally ask the question,

700
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,750
whose game is it anyway?

701
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,392
If someone has a free game on their PC,

702
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:14,415
is it within their rights to go through the files

703
00:30:14,455 --> 00:30:15,436
and start looking at things?

704
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:18,619
And that's the community's vision of it.

705
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,421
So we're not one to say, okay, stop doing that,

706
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:21,542
unless it gets ugly.

707
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:22,963
And this year it got ugly.

708
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:26,146
We were seeing some things happening that,

709
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:27,787
remember that Umbra I was talking about

710
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,269
that isn't in the global build.

711
00:30:29,989 --> 00:30:36,976
it was in the global build somehow because somehow some people had hacked it and added it in and we were able to conclude

712
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:43,022
where it was coming from and what the source of it was so we had to take action and it was in that time that the

713
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:43,823
players had

714
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:49,248
seen an action from us that they felt was the worst thing we had ever done by going after data mining

715
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:55,594
we had become the bad guy because we were now trying to hide things and any transparency

716
00:30:55,654 --> 00:31:00,238
that they felt Datamine offered them as a community to see like, oh, DE screwed up a

717
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,881
drop rate or whatever it may be had vanished by us taking action.

718
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:08,425
So it was really tricky because we, like, of course we would have handled it differently

719
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:08,665
now.

720
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:12,028
And we just at the time were really scared because we didn't want

721
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:16,989
things leaking because again we were wanting to surprise and delight our community again

722
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:21,270
with something like the second dream and that was the hit of this year which was open world.

723
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:27,752
So you have your sort of data mining scandal and then all of a sudden all eyes are on us because

724
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:30,952
we have a big announcement for our community. We want to tell them we have something really

725
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:35,773
exciting for you guys and that was open world. This was a day in Warframe's history where we

726
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:40,354
walked through a set of doors and showed the community what we were sort of being so secretive

727
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:40,635
about.

728
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:44,037
And that was this, this was the Plains of Eidolon announcement,

729
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:49,222
which we did live in front of our audience, and it was wonderful.

730
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:52,605
And this was a really great moment for Warframe and the community,

731
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:56,950
because they saw us do something that they and we had said was impossible.

732
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,053
And our procedural game had gone from that.

733
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:03,022
thanks to the developers to now open world.

734
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:05,803
And that was a really special moment in the relationship

735
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,303
because it was that surprise and delight

736
00:32:07,323 --> 00:32:08,583
without it even being released yet,

737
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:09,723
which was quite exciting.

738
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:11,664
And what did we do?

739
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:13,224
Well, we looked and we said,

740
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:15,024
wow, people really liked that.

741
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:19,545
You released this most hype update in Warframe's history

742
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:20,465
and we took a look at it

743
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:23,726
and we saw that it had put Warframe in a position

744
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,366
it had never reached before.

745
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:29,387
And it of course reinforces the ambition

746
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:30,207
to do things like that.

747
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:32,408
of course, leading into this year as well.

748
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:35,649
And that was a really, really, really exciting time for us

749
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:38,110
because we had a community that was overwhelmed

750
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,451
with support for the idea that we were going to do that.

751
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:43,972
But so, of course, you're excited and want

752
00:32:43,992 --> 00:32:44,732
to keep that alive.

753
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:47,273
But when I go back to data mining just now,

754
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:49,114
because I'm going to tell you what we did about that,

755
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:50,514
because data mining is really tricky,

756
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:51,795
and we're a free-to-play game.

757
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:52,895
We have drop rates.

758
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:55,836
So what did we do in that situation when that happened?

759
00:32:56,376 --> 00:33:01,022
We built a drop site repository because we saw the most

760
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:07,810
The most feedback on the the players point of view about us going after dynamiters was that we're not being honest anymore

761
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:13,457
And we felt that the best way to be honest was to give them the info directly for what they were looking for

762
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:17,161
So now the community team has a new routine every update

763
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:19,304
thanks to some tools that Dev built us

764
00:33:19,724 --> 00:33:23,169
that we basically run a script of every drop table in the game

765
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:26,493
and output it to a web page and upload it to our web server

766
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:29,436
and we update it any time our drop tables get touched.

767
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:35,444
we did it because we recognized that the community wanted that information and

768
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:39,629
they were getting it but if we could provide it ourselves, you know, we would

769
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:43,633
show them that we didn't go after data mining for that reason, it was a broader

770
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:44,675
issue with hacking.

771
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:47,464
And this website, even I use it all the time

772
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,124
because it allows people just to get information

773
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:51,305
about Warframe more quickly.

774
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,726
And that's someone that's engaged in your game

775
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:54,866
and they want to know more.

776
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:57,327
And it's very rare for someone to go,

777
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:59,268
which is actually quite surprising.

778
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,088
People don't go on this website and look at it

779
00:34:01,468 --> 00:34:03,409
and send screenshots to our inbox

780
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:04,769
about how rare something is

781
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:07,510
because that's not what we want to do.

782
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,091
We have rarities, of course,

783
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:12,212
but we're not in it to look to trick anyone

784
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:14,633
into a rarity that they may or may not have expected.

785
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:16,914
So yeah, this website is an interesting thing.

786
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,234
We only added it last year.

787
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:21,075
It starts with a disclaimer about, you know,

788
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,616
we don't even know if we should be doing this,

789
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:25,157
but you guys want it, so here we go.

790
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:27,438
And yeah, but there's some people in the room

791
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,018
that have helped build this, so I can see them now.

792
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:29,438
Thank you.

793
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:31,659
It's been great for the community relationship,

794
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,840
which I can, of course, succinctly recap

795
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:38,302
in sort of the advice that if you become the enemy

796
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:40,082
in a relationship, work on repairing it

797
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:40,883
with more than words.

798
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:44,525
which is what that website represents as an action

799
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:45,546
because you can always say,

800
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:48,468
don't worry, we're not gonna do X, Y, or Z,

801
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:52,911
but if you show a plan to address the community concerns,

802
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:55,452
it is great for the community relationship.

803
00:34:55,913 --> 00:34:57,434
And of course, if you're years into your game

804
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:58,535
like we are at this point,

805
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:02,457
you should definitely do things that were once impossible.

806
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:04,279
So open world Warframe, for example.

807
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:05,900
which has been fun.

808
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:08,843
So, you know, whose game is it anyway?

809
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:10,846
That is the question that we are trying to answer.

810
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:13,869
And the best way I can talk about that

811
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,751
in the context of Warframe is that it's shared.

812
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,754
We've added so much to the game

813
00:35:18,354 --> 00:35:19,836
based on what the community has wanted.

814
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:23,300
And the community has seen that our ability

815
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,141
to add these things.

816
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:27,065
is shaping, working into what it is today.

817
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,687
And we, you know, you try and do it in that

818
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:29,989
the community wants something,

819
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:31,411
the devs are the only ones that can do it,

820
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:33,213
so how do you make, how do you reconcile that?

821
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:34,936
And that's where we stand in the middle

822
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:36,278
with the community team.

823
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:40,724
And after five years, what we've really tried to...

824
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:45,048
view in this relationship we have is that the players really are citizens.

825
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,209
When I was talking about dev streams,

826
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,412
you probably have been watching perhaps or put on dev streams of

827
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:53,755
your own that are a bit political and title something like state of

828
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:57,118
the game or other things that sound just a bit more,

829
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:00,620
this is more than just a game because really you're dealing with a group of people,

830
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:04,223
your player base that have a voice and bring

831
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,386
their loyalty to your game and their interest and their passion,

832
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:10,348
and they should be represented in the same way.

833
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,850
that other governments work.

834
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,750
Not that we're a government, but, you know,

835
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,011
citizens, not government.

836
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:17,011
Totally different words.

837
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:21,812
Also, so we also have tried to have the community team

838
00:36:21,832 --> 00:36:24,833
have a seat at the dev table after these five years,

839
00:36:24,953 --> 00:36:28,214
just making sure that, you know, in 2014,

840
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:29,875
if we had a resource problem,

841
00:36:29,895 --> 00:36:31,776
maybe the next time we're introducing a new resource,

842
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,156
the community team knows about it,

843
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:34,076
and we're looking, and we're,

844
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:38,724
trying not to repeat the issues we had done in the past.

845
00:36:38,744 --> 00:36:40,585
Because really, all it has been about

846
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:42,626
is learning from our mistakes as early as 2012

847
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:44,507
when we weren't doing free to play right.

848
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:46,569
And that's continued year over year.

849
00:36:47,189 --> 00:36:51,252
And with DevStreams and whatever else we do in that capacity

850
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:54,874
we've found that transparency is painful but crucial

851
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:56,955
and it's good to humanize and admit mistakes.

852
00:36:57,436 --> 00:37:00,157
We find sitting down on the DevStream couch or whatever,

853
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,759
setting is appropriate at the time.

854
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,860
To admit a mistake on camera is really humbling,

855
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,881
and it really shows the players that you are

856
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:11,722
capable of making mistakes, because one thing that happens,

857
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:13,563
and you often hear fan language is,

858
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,164
you know, I have faith in this developer.

859
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:18,665
And when you get that sort of faith-based belief

860
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:20,526
in a developer system, it's dangerous,

861
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:22,007
because mistakes are frequent.

862
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:22,567
They are.

863
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,451
We try to make it clear it's not out of malice,

864
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:28,233
because that's the most dangerous part of a relationship

865
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,434
is if they feel the decisions you've made

866
00:37:30,594 --> 00:37:32,915
are out of malice, which we try very regularly

867
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:33,836
to reinforce they're not.

868
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:39,019
But I did that quickly, because it's the last presentation

869
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,280
and GDC perhaps for some of you.

870
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,381
So that is it.

871
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:44,502
So I have 40 minutes of talk for you guys.

872
00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:44,562
So.

873
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:45,723
So.

874
00:37:45,803 --> 00:37:45,943
So.

875
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:46,163
So.

876
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:46,703
So.

877
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:47,103
So.

878
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:47,504
So.

879
00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:47,884
So.

880
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:48,224
So.

881
00:37:48,264 --> 00:37:48,404
So.

882
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,160
I shouldn't have talked over the videos.

883
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,381
They could have just run.

884
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:00,723
But if you do have any questions,

885
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:04,066
now would be a good time to line up at either microphone side.

886
00:38:04,126 --> 00:38:05,708
And if not, that's totally cool, too.

887
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:10,673
Thank you very much.

888
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:13,075
You know, you were talking a lot at the beginning

889
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:14,957
about how the.

890
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:18,596
The players ask for something and so the devs make it so.

891
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:20,517
And I was wondering, how do you...

892
00:38:21,538 --> 00:38:24,779
Sometimes it seems like that might not be good for the game.

893
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:26,601
Like, maybe the players don't know what's best,

894
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:33,004
or maybe there's a vocal minority that isn't really speaking for the larger player base.

895
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:36,586
So I was wondering how you tackle those kind of concerns.

896
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:42,973
Right, so what we try to do is take what the players want and make sure it's actually a scaled want.

897
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,656
So a dev stream for us is a really good example because when we generate questions for it,

898
00:38:46,716 --> 00:38:49,438
we look to see what the actual most used words are.

899
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:53,081
And then if we see a high frequency of the same request, we address it on air.

900
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:56,944
And then we literally on air say yes or no sometimes

901
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:58,986
and try, if we think it's bad for the game,

902
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,209
we'll say no, sometimes we'll say why.

903
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,371
And if we think it's good for the game,

904
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:05,433
we sort of build a wish list of things

905
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:10,217
that are good victories to add to the game

906
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:11,038
for the community.

907
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:13,060
And what's surprising about that

908
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:16,583
in regards to players wanting things is.

909
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:19,491
They typically do want realistic things.

910
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:22,553
Like there are things that you can of course say no to,

911
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,654
you know, like turn Warframe into first person

912
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:26,695
or do something like that, which we do say no to,

913
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:30,738
but generally if a player is at the point in this community

914
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,940
to ask for something, they ask it and they typically,

915
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,081
they explain why they want it, which allows us to,

916
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,983
you know, address it more on the nose

917
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:41,425
in the scheme of Warframe's design and future.

918
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:42,505
Cool, thank you.

919
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:49,150
Hi, have you ever had to tackle pockets of toxicity in your community,

920
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,373
either community to each other or community to dev?

921
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:57,838
Yes, so toxicity in the community is, I think, many games face it,

922
00:39:57,878 --> 00:40:00,280
and we have had to deal with it time over time,

923
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:03,764
and we really look at why it's happening,

924
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:06,966
and a lot of what we've found in dealing with it,

925
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:09,609
you know, basic moderation is really helpful, of course, you can read out.

926
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,351
with all your tools, get someone out of there

927
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,671
that's swearing, doing this, doing that.

928
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,773
But if there's, for example, a clan

929
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:18,334
that's particularly toxic, that's harder to deal with

930
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:21,276
because there's a lot more of the toxic individuals.

931
00:40:21,816 --> 00:40:24,158
And we try to make sure that we're as strict

932
00:40:24,178 --> 00:40:25,638
with our code as conduct as possible.

933
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:28,100
So if we can clearly see, like you violated this,

934
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,701
you're out, there's no disputing it.

935
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,982
But sometimes, pitchforks come out, right?

936
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:34,504
And toxicity can spread, especially if it becomes

937
00:40:34,544 --> 00:40:35,724
an us versus them scenario.

938
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,826
And I always just try and work with that on our team

939
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:39,086
as well.

940
00:40:39,507 --> 00:40:42,729
succinctly as possible and using our guidelines to work with it.

941
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,010
Thank you very much.

942
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:44,851
Hello.

943
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:45,751
Hi.

944
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:50,915
Are there any, you talk a lot about engaging with the community in general.

945
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:57,860
Are there particular platforms or communities that you find easier to use or better for

946
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,642
reaching a large audience or particular audience?

947
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:05,044
I am a really big, so in terms of tools to engage with our community, I do think DevStreams

948
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:10,626
have worked out really well for that because we've just built this sort of five-year familial

949
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:12,967
bond about what we're working on.

950
00:41:13,027 --> 00:41:17,009
You know, Warframe is going to always change and grow, so why not use a tool that's...

951
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:20,050
not super polished in our case,

952
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,571
but really honest about what we're doing.

953
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:24,452
That one, again, has been huge.

954
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:26,393
I would say right now,

955
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:30,315
it's really nice to rely on Discord a bit more.

956
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:33,996
Our official forums are like the library of Alexandria.

957
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,457
They house everything we've ever done,

958
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,718
and they're not the best for conversing.

959
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:40,339
So you have to pick what your goal is for

960
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:41,900
a particular engagement and use

961
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,541
something more accommodating to that,

962
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,822
which Discord is great for conversations, of course.

963
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:47,042
Awesome, thank you.

964
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:47,202
Sweet.

965
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,297
Hi, I'm, oh sorry.

966
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:55,345
Hi, it's, most of the talk was about the early years

967
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:56,126
until, up until 2017.

968
00:41:57,688 --> 00:42:01,534
I'm just curious, what are the challenges so far this year

969
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:04,439
and what's Warframe like in 2018 with the community?

970
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:07,297
So 2018 has been actually really interesting

971
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,238
because we haven't released, actually Tuesday of this week

972
00:42:10,298 --> 00:42:11,939
marked the release of new content.

973
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:14,981
We hadn't added a single weapon or warframe this whole year

974
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:16,381
so far up until Tuesday.

975
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:19,503
So the year has been one of, you know,

976
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:21,664
I was talking about change and nostalgia in 2016.

977
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,386
It's heavily been on that for the first part of the year.

978
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:26,487
We've gone and looked at every weapon

979
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:30,209
we've released in the primary and the secondary capacity

980
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:31,169
and rebalanced them.

981
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:32,690
So the devs have been working hard on.

982
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,011
basically doing spring cleaning, but more winter cleaning,

983
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:39,453
for all the game's content, rather than adding a new gun,

984
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:40,553
or something like that.

985
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:42,714
So it's really been an exercise in revision.

986
00:42:43,254 --> 00:42:45,295
And it's interesting to see how the communities responded,

987
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:46,735
because again, they're used to consistency.

988
00:42:47,396 --> 00:42:49,336
But the consistency this year, the weekly updates,

989
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:53,318
have been cleanups, rather than, here's your brand new XYZ.

990
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:54,558
Thanks.

991
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:56,179
And we told them that.

992
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:57,920
We said, hey, you're not getting new stuff this year.

993
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,480
You might have noticed, and they were okay with it.

994
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:04,585
Hi, so a company I worked at previously,

995
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:06,447
like the community definitely did not have

996
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:07,568
a favorable view of us.

997
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:10,330
So frequently when we released even a positive announcement,

998
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:12,472
it would get twisted around.

999
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:15,195
And so I was just curious,

1000
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:19,699
what sort of like language was most twisted against you

1001
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:21,962
and how did you reframe your wording of it?

1002
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:27,930
The language is, we are, I feel like one,

1003
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,112
it's not a tactic, it's just a thing that's happened

1004
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:31,413
in terms of language we've used.

1005
00:43:31,674 --> 00:43:33,355
We talk so much on DevStreams,

1006
00:43:33,395 --> 00:43:36,318
it's really hard to pinpoint the bad things we've said

1007
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:38,360
because we talk so much and they can't get mad

1008
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,382
about that one, like, oh, we're listening

1009
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:42,704
because we say it in so many different ways all the time.

1010
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,766
But when it comes to the community.

1011
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:49,630
picking a moment to think that DE is doing a bad job of something

1012
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,492
and therefore what is coming should not be celebrated.

1013
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:58,276
It's typically in the growth of the game and the idea of neglect, right?

1014
00:43:58,376 --> 00:44:01,638
So if a player sees we're adding something new,

1015
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:04,921
they'll say, that's great, but what about all the other stuff you've left behind?

1016
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,942
And they often criticize any...

1017
00:44:08,143 --> 00:44:11,607
any new things as bad because other things are being abandoned.

1018
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:13,610
So for example, when we added Lunaro,

1019
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,034
you could imagine that the PVE players that wanted endgame were like,

1020
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:19,477
what? Why are you working on this and not that?

1021
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:22,060
You know there's all the false dichotomy ways to talk about it,

1022
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,243
but we try and address that.

1023
00:44:24,443 --> 00:44:26,505
We see the bubbling.

1024
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,149
discontent and just say, well, that's actually not true

1025
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:33,131
because here's work that's also happening at the same time.

1026
00:44:33,311 --> 00:44:34,792
But sometimes you might not have that luxury

1027
00:44:34,812 --> 00:44:37,554
because you've become the enemy so greatly,

1028
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,336
like we had with the data mining situation.

1029
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:40,857
And you just don't give up.

1030
00:44:40,957 --> 00:44:44,940
We just don't stop trying, is the best way I could say that.

1031
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,661
Thank you.

1032
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:50,724
So I was curious, how early do you guys talk about the things

1033
00:44:50,784 --> 00:44:51,805
you're working on?

1034
00:44:52,301 --> 00:44:55,544
So like for our game, we have a really hard balance

1035
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:57,526
between like we want to talk about stuff early

1036
00:44:58,027 --> 00:44:59,849
and let people know we're thinking about the things

1037
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:02,111
they're concerned about, but if it's too early,

1038
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:03,753
we don't know exactly what we're gonna do yet,

1039
00:45:04,153 --> 00:45:06,035
and then we are taking things away from them,

1040
00:45:06,055 --> 00:45:08,438
we're breaking our promises when we change our mind,

1041
00:45:08,578 --> 00:45:10,900
and if it's too late, then we're just being told

1042
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,562
that we're ignoring them, but we're not.

1043
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:14,244
So how do you find that balance?

1044
00:45:14,871 --> 00:45:18,272
So the issue of showing something and never shipping it

1045
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:20,052
is a very frequent one for us.

1046
00:45:20,273 --> 00:45:22,773
I believe in, I don't want to simplify this,

1047
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:25,734
but if you made a list of stuff we've shown on DevStreams

1048
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:28,695
versus stuff we shipped, they'd probably be even

1049
00:45:29,615 --> 00:45:31,176
because we just show whips all the time

1050
00:45:31,216 --> 00:45:33,476
and we make it clear that that's what's happening.

1051
00:45:33,616 --> 00:45:37,417
So if something's really close to being a shipped item,

1052
00:45:37,758 --> 00:45:38,798
we demo it a bit.

1053
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:41,241
more confidently, I would say.

1054
00:45:41,562 --> 00:45:43,544
Whereas if something's like, here's some concept art

1055
00:45:43,564 --> 00:45:45,607
that could be a new faction in a year,

1056
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:49,513
we kind of say that because we know our own work pace

1057
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:53,498
and we know that no matter what it's gonna happen for us

1058
00:45:53,598 --> 00:45:55,401
if we release something people expect it to come out.

1059
00:45:55,861 --> 00:46:01,169
So we try very hard to emphasize the actual progress of what it is we're showing.

1060
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:03,211
And we just want to show it.

1061
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:06,516
Like even if it is a year away, we typically do show it just because we want to.

1062
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:09,841
So it's at your call of course, and it is a struggle.

1063
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:11,283
And it's whether or not you're...

1064
00:46:12,304 --> 00:46:17,329
prepared to lower expectations about things that you yourself have doubt about.

1065
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:20,552
Like it'll be a time on a stream where someone's really talking optimistically

1066
00:46:20,592 --> 00:46:22,634
about something and I'm like I don't even think I've seen work started on

1067
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,779
that and I'll say that out loud just to make sure players see that this is messy

1068
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:29,021
because things aren't easy all the time.

1069
00:46:29,178 --> 00:46:31,341
So does the community now have an expectation

1070
00:46:31,401 --> 00:46:33,864
that a lot of that stuff could not be that way

1071
00:46:33,905 --> 00:46:34,866
and sort of accept it now?

1072
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:38,010
Yep, it's amazing the power of their own wisdom

1073
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,532
about how we operate at this point

1074
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:42,637
because they are able to set their own expectations

1075
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,499
sort of as a group, which is nice.

1076
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,360
Cool, thank you.

1077
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:45,641
Yes.

1078
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:47,067
Hello.

1079
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:47,908
Yeah, sorry.

1080
00:46:47,988 --> 00:46:50,808
I just wondering, as you have said,

1081
00:46:50,828 --> 00:46:54,450
you release a version later in China, right?

1082
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:54,750
Yes.

1083
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,050
When you're referring to the community,

1084
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:01,752
you're referring to the global community or different country

1085
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:02,312
community.

1086
00:47:02,412 --> 00:47:05,413
As I know, some players in some different countries,

1087
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:09,555
they have different or conflict opinions on these

1088
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,995
to the same released version.

1089
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,496
So do you have any?

1090
00:47:14,716 --> 00:47:17,777
share experience about the conflict opinions?

1091
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:20,838
It is tricky with conflicting regions.

1092
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:24,640
The only true region restrictions are mainland China

1093
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,681
for that build, and the rest of the world

1094
00:47:26,741 --> 00:47:27,641
is considered global.

1095
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,722
And it's been, in that respect,

1096
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:32,903
there have been conflicting opinions

1097
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:33,923
about stuff we've released,

1098
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,684
the way the community responds to it.

1099
00:47:36,684 --> 00:47:38,486
overall, and it's always just a matter of,

1100
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:40,707
luckily we have an in-house team that's able to

1101
00:47:41,268 --> 00:47:42,769
help with region-specific issues.

1102
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,511
They do mainly do support, but they also can help

1103
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,453
with community stuff, and they bring that to our attention,

1104
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:49,514
and if it's a developer issue, we try and resolve it.

1105
00:47:49,554 --> 00:47:51,936
Like, if we accidentally release something that looked

1106
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:55,779
not appropriate for a specific culture,

1107
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,061
we'll remedy that based on the advice

1108
00:47:58,201 --> 00:48:00,143
of those region-specific communities.

1109
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:02,965
Well, okay, thanks.

1110
00:48:04,158 --> 00:48:08,962
Hi. Um, yeah, what the, uh, data mining stuff that you were talking about when you

1111
00:48:10,243 --> 00:48:14,286
release the tool and when you release the planes of Eidolon, um,

1112
00:48:14,466 --> 00:48:19,150
did you see a large reduction in people complaining about not being able to data

1113
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,211
mine or are there still people complaining about that?

1114
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:26,477
It still happens. So we didn't stop it. We just tried to stop it,

1115
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:29,319
which I think is, I think they call that the Streisand effect or something.

1116
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,301
Like if you try to stop something, it actually makes it worse.

1117
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,983
So it's just what we,

1118
00:48:33,363 --> 00:48:36,366
what had happened was Umbra had gotten into the global build and we had to

1119
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:40,850
address that situation. So with the planes of Eidolon launching, we were.

1120
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,911
We made sure that the tool could accommodate the new reward

1121
00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:45,992
structure style, so we needed dev bandwidth

1122
00:48:46,032 --> 00:48:48,834
to update the tool to make it read this new world.

1123
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:51,715
And at the time, players looked to that site,

1124
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:52,856
and they actually now build.

1125
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:56,798
I think one former data miner builds their own tool

1126
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:59,099
based off of our data now just to make it more readable,

1127
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,180
because it's just an HTML table.

1128
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:04,922
But now it actually is the source of a lot of other player

1129
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,923
tools that are just built on it, which has been really

1130
00:49:07,323 --> 00:49:10,564
wonderful to see it being used in still a player-owned way,

1131
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:13,146
because they, of course, make their own websites and

1132
00:49:13,186 --> 00:49:14,206
everything off of it, which is nice.

1133
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:14,786
Thank you.

1134
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:16,287
Hello, sir.

1135
00:49:16,927 --> 00:49:21,189
Do you find that console and PC communities have different

1136
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:25,871
wants, and if so, how do you address priorities of that?

1137
00:49:26,484 --> 00:49:31,707
So we have specific teams for each of the platforms, which is great, but the pipeline is always PC first, then console.

1138
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:37,612
And what's happened on console is, when I said region locked content, that's one thing, because no one can have it,

1139
00:49:37,692 --> 00:49:42,315
but there's also console specific content, which is more, it's received fine.

1140
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:45,117
Like if a console player has their version of skins, players don't mind.

1141
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:48,120
Xbox has their version of skins, it's okay.

1142
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,541
And same with PC.

1143
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:52,823
And the way that they speak of the game and their needs is...

1144
00:49:53,484 --> 00:49:56,748
Typically the most common, it comes down to UI usability

1145
00:49:57,348 --> 00:49:59,932
and working on having an experience that

1146
00:50:00,032 --> 00:50:01,273
is more controller-friendly.

1147
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:04,317
And that's essentially been something

1148
00:50:04,357 --> 00:50:06,240
we've had to work on since the day we launched on consoles.

1149
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,203
And players continue to say it's not quite good enough.

1150
00:50:09,344 --> 00:50:10,805
So we still try.

1151
00:50:14,505 --> 00:50:27,050
So I was just, in regards to players being vocal or less vocal, how do you deal with, I guess, the comfort level of certain players just commenting on their opinions of various builds,

1152
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:35,173
because some players might be a little more vocal and more confident in talking about the content they want or their opinions on updates,

1153
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:42,296
whereas other players might be a little bit more, less vocal about it for a variety of reasons, maybe just accessibility.

1154
00:50:44,197 --> 00:50:47,698
Well, there's different ways you can get broad player

1155
00:50:47,738 --> 00:50:48,838
communication or specific.

1156
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:51,219
Not everyone wants to write a long form forum post.

1157
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:53,079
Some people just want to click a vote on a poll.

1158
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:55,559
Some people just want to, but just by showing up, they're

1159
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:56,440
showing they're interested.

1160
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,920
If we do a dev stream on a certain topic, if the

1161
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,901
viewership is quite large, we know that there's maybe some

1162
00:51:01,921 --> 00:51:03,881
players that aren't talking to us about that that are still

1163
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:04,541
interested in it.

1164
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:06,422
So we just gauge based on traffic.

1165
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:10,002
And you try and use social media with the poll features

1166
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:10,562
and everything.

1167
00:51:10,622 --> 00:51:11,903
That's a good way to get.

1168
00:51:12,543 --> 00:51:15,805
You never want to commit a poll to design gospel,

1169
00:51:15,845 --> 00:51:16,605
but it can happen.

1170
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,767
And you just have to make sure that whatever tools you've

1171
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,769
built and you own are being used frequently,

1172
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:24,931
and be aware that players that may not

1173
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:25,711
want to use those tools.

1174
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:28,373
Like, we don't have an official Discord, but we're on Discord.

1175
00:51:28,773 --> 00:51:30,574
And we found that there's a lot of value there,

1176
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,976
and people behave differently and more themselves there,

1177
00:51:34,036 --> 00:51:35,477
perhaps, than on an official forum.

1178
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:38,659
So just acknowledging that the tool changes,

1179
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:40,600
attracts different types of players.

1180
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:44,584
And I totally forgot to say turn off your phones.

1181
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:47,565
And I just realized that.

1182
00:51:47,665 --> 00:51:49,787
And also that you can create the talk after.

1183
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:50,827
So I just realized now.

1184
00:51:50,847 --> 00:51:51,007
Sorry.

1185
00:51:51,948 --> 00:51:52,268
Hi.

1186
00:51:52,288 --> 00:51:54,790
I was wondering how you guys handled

1187
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:55,950
international communities.

1188
00:51:56,891 --> 00:52:00,033
Our game, for example, I think 60% of our player base

1189
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,253
is Chinese and Russian.

1190
00:52:02,574 --> 00:52:05,016
We're all English speakers on the dev team, primarily.

1191
00:52:05,036 --> 00:52:07,757
So we don't have a great way of communicating with them.

1192
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,153
I was wondering if you guys had a second team in those regions,

1193
00:52:11,533 --> 00:52:14,316
or how you handled smaller regions that you can't really

1194
00:52:14,356 --> 00:52:17,098
communicate with, but have very different and special feedback.

1195
00:52:17,779 --> 00:52:18,780
We're all in-house.

1196
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,642
The community team is a seven-person English-speaking

1197
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:23,304
team at this point in time.

1198
00:52:23,764 --> 00:52:25,706
But we also have an in-house support team,

1199
00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:27,508
which is run by a gentleman sitting here,

1200
00:52:27,828 --> 00:52:29,750
that has all the languages that we support.

1201
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,792
And we're able to use them as a lightning

1202
00:52:31,852 --> 00:52:34,534
rod for really specific issues in that community.

1203
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:37,116
With Warframe's growth as it is today,

1204
00:52:37,216 --> 00:52:40,198
I expect that we will start trying to have dedicated

1205
00:52:40,238 --> 00:52:42,800
community people in our bigger regions, like Russia.

1206
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,341
But we don't have that right now,

1207
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:47,003
and we just try our best with the resources we have

1208
00:52:47,183 --> 00:52:51,426
to make sure the main developer updates get translated.

1209
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:54,208
And ultimately, we could be doing a better job

1210
00:52:54,248 --> 00:52:55,549
of including those communities,

1211
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:57,771
but we still haven't figured it out very well.

1212
00:52:57,891 --> 00:52:58,932
So it sounds like we're in the same boat.

1213
00:52:59,272 --> 00:52:59,752
Okay, thank you.

1214
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:00,353
You're welcome.

1215
00:53:02,134 --> 00:53:03,195
All right, I think that's it.

1216
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:07,033
Hello.

1217
00:53:07,494 --> 00:53:08,595
Hello.

1218
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:14,623
Could you reflect a little bit on the Twitch event that you had in the fall alongside Planes

1219
00:53:14,643 --> 00:53:15,143
of Eidolon?

1220
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:15,704
Yes.

1221
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:20,550
And, because it obviously exploded, it also exploded your servers.

1222
00:53:21,271 --> 00:53:25,376
So the success of that, how you would do it differently, would you do it differently again?

1223
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,768
Right, so the Twitch event we had.

1224
00:53:27,828 --> 00:53:29,831
So Twitch is exploding, as we all know,

1225
00:53:29,871 --> 00:53:31,312
and there's something called Twitch Drops,

1226
00:53:31,352 --> 00:53:34,776
which allows you to have the viewers of your game

1227
00:53:34,816 --> 00:53:37,198
get rewarded with items in game simply for watching.

1228
00:53:37,258 --> 00:53:39,361
So we launched a Twitch Drop campaign

1229
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:41,223
with the launch of our open world update.

1230
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:44,164
to reward people watching Warframe streamers.

1231
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:47,186
And if you get free loot in Warframe, you're gonna show up.

1232
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:49,147
So we launched it at such a scale

1233
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,108
that it did bring our servers down the first day,

1234
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:54,190
and it did expose a vector of exploit

1235
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,131
for people to have six windows open and watch our stream.

1236
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:59,513
And there was a drop table that had 30 items in it,

1237
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,054
and they were getting multiples.

1238
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:03,755
And I wouldn't have done it differently

1239
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,976
because it was so, well, I'm sure everyone on the team

1240
00:54:06,016 --> 00:54:07,157
is like, never again, but.

1241
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,780
And it actually created two levels of issues for us,

1242
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:13,762
obviously technical, but there was also

1243
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:16,444
the court of public opinion that we had paid for view bots,

1244
00:54:16,484 --> 00:54:17,405
which simply wasn't true.

1245
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:19,027
People just didn't understand the draw

1246
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,588
of free Warframe loot, of course.

1247
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:22,309
And the streamers were having fun with it.

1248
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:23,590
They were gamifying it a bit.

1249
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:26,152
And we have refined the tool since then.

1250
00:54:26,853 --> 00:54:28,314
It is no longer exploitable.

1251
00:54:28,394 --> 00:54:29,475
It's a lot less...

1252
00:54:30,836 --> 00:54:33,397
crazy in the campaigns we do, we still use it to this day,

1253
00:54:33,597 --> 00:54:35,198
just at a much more sane level.

1254
00:54:35,738 --> 00:54:39,059
And I think it's worth looking into if you have a game

1255
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:41,140
on Twitch Drops that could utilize this system,

1256
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,040
because it is pretty cool.

1257
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:44,961
Hi, great talk.

1258
00:54:45,822 --> 00:54:47,902
You talked about a seat at the development table

1259
00:54:47,942 --> 00:54:48,883
with the community team.

1260
00:54:49,063 --> 00:54:50,543
Can you talk in a little bit more detail,

1261
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,124
are you just collaborating with leaders

1262
00:54:52,304 --> 00:54:56,025
or individual contributors, small teams, big teams,

1263
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:57,406
and just how that all coordinates?

1264
00:54:57,855 --> 00:55:00,636
So Slack has made it really easy to sort of have a virtual

1265
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:01,517
seat at every table.

1266
00:55:01,637 --> 00:55:04,418
So we always try and include a community team member in the

1267
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:05,399
features channels.

1268
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,201
And the community team at Warframe also works on live

1269
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:12,063
ops, so when deployments go out and when people are

1270
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:13,864
debating whether or not to include something in a

1271
00:55:13,904 --> 00:55:15,625
deployment, we are involved in that.

1272
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:19,587
So in many ways, Slack is sort of the simple answer to that.

1273
00:55:20,747 --> 00:55:23,329
I think the dev team is okay with it,

1274
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:25,670
because it's kind of annoying to be the person in the room

1275
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,451
that's like, well, the players aren't going to like that,

1276
00:55:27,531 --> 00:55:28,211
so don't do it.

1277
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:31,212
But it's just the nature of our relationship

1278
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:32,533
with our community that we need that,

1279
00:55:32,973 --> 00:55:35,715
you need that temperature check of grind tolerance,

1280
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:36,555
for example, or...

1281
00:55:37,075 --> 00:55:41,876
you know, well there's not really a lot of PvP players right now and it goes both ways if we

1282
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:46,798
know that dev is really focused on doing something change wise, we need to prepare the community

1283
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:51,679
materials. So having a seat at the table isn't just about being the fun police, it's about being the

1284
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:56,080
okay this is really good information to start working on. Like we removed a content system from

1285
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,701
the game known as trials because there was a rapid exchange that you know we just couldn't support it

1286
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:05,122
anymore and the devs really knew that it just was not being given the love they wanted. So we

1287
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:06,722
from that moment had like

1288
00:56:07,343 --> 00:56:09,505
to get ready to break that news to the community.

1289
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:09,766
So.

1290
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,728
And just a quick follow up.

1291
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:13,650
Did you find that it was a sort of development

1292
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,933
cultural evolution at your studio

1293
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:17,515
when you were getting involved this way?

1294
00:56:18,937 --> 00:56:21,500
I think the, so the early, early, early Warframe,

1295
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,141
it was.

1296
00:56:23,669 --> 00:56:24,650
I was there on the community team

1297
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:25,731
and there was like eight developers.

1298
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:27,472
So we were all in it together from the start.

1299
00:56:27,572 --> 00:56:28,773
So it was, yeah.

1300
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:30,755
So before all that, we had been doing publisher stuff,

1301
00:56:30,795 --> 00:56:32,916
work for hire, we never had a community team.

1302
00:56:32,996 --> 00:56:34,878
So it was there at the foundation of all this.

1303
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:36,379
So it wasn't added later.

1304
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:37,460
It's been there the whole time,

1305
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,262
which may not be the case for everyone.

1306
00:56:40,742 --> 00:56:41,343
Great, thank you.

1307
00:56:41,483 --> 00:56:41,803
You're welcome.

1308
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:43,985
All right, I think that's it.

1309
00:56:44,606 --> 00:56:45,126
Thanks everyone.

1310
00:56:45,146 --> 00:56:45,606
Thank you so much.
