00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:21,359
Hey guys. Hey y'all. Thank you so much for coming out to hear us talk. I'm Emily, this is Lil, and we're here to talk today about Smash Sisters. It's a series of events that we do for the game that we love, Super Smash Brothers. So Lil, I guess tell us, what is Smash Sisters?

2
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:23,160
Yes, that's a dying question.

3
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,703
So Smash Fisters is a series of side events that we run at different tournaments featuring

4
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:30,363
the Smash Brothers franchise games.

5
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:36,466
And these events are designed to bring both new and veteran women together and also important

6
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:39,608
to feed back into the overall competitive community.

7
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:43,830
So our organization is progressive and we are constantly down to change our format and

8
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,811
adapt to the changing needs of the women within our community.

9
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,113
We have now been up and running for just over a year.

10
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:53,855
Not up here saying we're the pinnacle of success,

11
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,576
but we've learned a lot in that year,

12
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:58,757
and here we're going to kind of delve into our knowledge.

13
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:02,137
So first a little bit more about how we started.

14
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:06,619
About a year and a half ago, you know, some people were talking on Twitter.

15
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,599
Surprisingly, they were shit talking on Twitter.

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,141
And a prominent smasher, Reno, was like, hmm, what about East Coast girls versus West Coast

17
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:17,501
girls?

18
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:18,862
And he was like, whoa, hmm.

19
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:22,123
First of all, I'm from New York, so obviously East Coast had it.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,224
And we started talking a little bit about, you know, let's do a crew battle.

21
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:35,287
And we did this at a Genesis 3, which is one of the biggest grass roots smash tournaments

22
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:36,667
of all time about a year ago.

23
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:43,589
And in this Facebook event page for Genesis, I posted, hey, any girls interested in an

24
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,830
East Coast versus West Coast crew battle?

25
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,192
And it didn't seem to take off quite at first.

26
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,412
There wasn't a ton of interest.

27
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:52,533
And at that time, I talked to Lilz.

28
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:53,174
I reached out.

29
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,615
And she seemed a little trepidatious about it.

30
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:58,436
Yeah, when Emily first pitched the idea to me, I

31
00:01:58,516 --> 00:01:59,677
immediately just shot it down.

32
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:02,938
And was pretty apprehensive about joining, surprisingly.

33
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:06,100
And it was very ironic of me, and I'll explain why.

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,001
Actually, just a few weeks before Emily had pitched this

35
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:13,103
idea to everybody else, I had written a blog post that was

36
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:15,364
titled, Stop Asking About All Female Tournaments.

37
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:20,307
And I'll give you the TLDR which is pretty much can we please stop bickering and hypothesizing

38
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:24,490
about the success or failure of these and just do it and see what the outcome is and

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,111
go from there.

40
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:29,273
And so in that moment when Emily reached out to me I was like, oh, man, I'd be such a hypocrite

41
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,634
if I were to say no.

42
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:32,175
So yeah, let's just do this.

43
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:36,058
And so Emily came in with the strengths of her event organization background.

44
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:37,499
I came in as social media.

45
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:46,513
And branding and together the ventures blew up like tons of women started reaching out to our surprise to engage and participate and we've still been running since.

46
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,262
So for today's talk, we're going to talk you all through a little bit about our adventure

47
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:59,447
from the past year, which includes branding, laying preparation, laying the groundwork,

48
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:04,991
and then part of our community and how complex the women's community is.

49
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:10,215
And then finally, walk you through some of the iterations and feedback that we've had

50
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:10,715
to go through.

51
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:11,996
You know, it's a lot to cover.

52
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:12,436
But...

53
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,718
Yeah, just worth noting, we're going to speed through all these topics, but we will be around

54
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,400
after to answer any questions you may have.

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,060
So hang tight.

56
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:19,974
Cool.

57
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,255
So the first part of it is branding.

58
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:23,955
Blank prep and ground work.

59
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:29,478
And our first piece of advice, I suppose, is that you should be a part of your community

60
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:29,838
first.

61
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,701
This means that, well, first of all, you know, I started competing back in 2007.

62
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:39,203
Both Lil and I have been in the Smash community for over a decade.

63
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:47,110
You know, I started running events in Dallas like five or six years ago, and now I run

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,053
tournaments in New York, and I'm one of the heads of Nebulas Esports there.

65
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:56,618
And one of my focuses has always been to, you know, lower the barrier of entry for newcomers.

66
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:58,640
This is all about community growth.

67
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,642
So one thing is pioneering the amateur bracket that allows players to have additional competitive

68
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:09,963
matches or giving free venue fee or free entry fee for first time newcomers.

69
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:16,065
And this allows, you know, these little things go a long way in terms of retaining members

70
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:17,585
and bringing them in in the first place.

71
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:21,966
So Smash Sisters was kind of like a natural extension of bringing people into our group.

72
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:23,287
Oh.

73
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:24,807
Wow.

74
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:25,367
Rip.

75
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:26,808
Oh, no.

76
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:26,988
Oh, no.

77
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:27,228
Oh, no.

78
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:37,539
All right. Don't know what's going on here but I have a slightly different history from Emily. I

79
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:43,222
started competing back in 2006. Back then I took competing a lot more seriously than I do now. I

80
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:49,285
also traveled nationally several times throughout the course of the year. And unlike Emily, I

81
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:52,667
actually distanced myself from the Smash Brothers community for a while because I felt ‑‑

82
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:57,449
There are a lot of obscure behaviors that I noticed were directed towards me.

83
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,190
May or may not have been due to my gender.

84
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,630
Who knows?

85
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,172
And so I actually came back like a year later after the resent had faded to kind of move

86
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:09,393
towards activism and raising awareness around these topics, which really lent itself to

87
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:10,974
you Smash Sisters, believe it or not.

88
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:14,735
And that segues perfectly into the next section, which is...

89
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,151
Learn the history of your target demographic specific to your scene.

90
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:24,173
All the things that we understand and all the decisions we made were based around our

91
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:26,714
knowledge having been in the community in the first place.

92
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:32,476
So I will lead with the most annoying question a female smasher could ever be asked, which

93
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:34,397
is who is the best female smasher?

94
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:38,298
And to give you some history there, the Super Smash Bros.

95
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,479
Brawl community actually dealt with a lot of this.

96
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,900
I believe they actually tried to run singles bracket format.

97
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:48,843
And what this did was it pitted a lot of the women against each other.

98
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:51,245
So that being friends was a little odd.

99
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:55,288
They were constantly being compared to each other and there was a lot of weird underlying

100
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:55,848
tensions.

101
00:05:55,928 --> 00:06:00,031
And so we, having been there to hear about this, knew that we needed to avoid this at

102
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,173
all costs when we were running Smash Sisters.

103
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:07,416
So we're going to go through a lot of our core philosophies and formats and why we chose

104
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:07,916
what we did.

105
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,262
Yeah, so here are the core philosophies that we're about to go through.

106
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:12,262
We'll go through them one by one.

107
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:14,324
The first part of it is the crew battle.

108
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:17,486
This is our event format.

109
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:21,369
Now in a normal tournament, you have one versus one singles bracket.

110
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,231
In the Smash Sisters event, you have the crew battle series.

111
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:30,176
This allows you to create a team where you pull your stocks or your lives together.

112
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:32,296
And you work together.

113
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:36,698
You have four or five people coming together, strategizing, you know, talking about, like,

114
00:06:36,738 --> 00:06:41,819
who should go in and really working together and building that camaraderie and teamwork

115
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,820
in order to beat your opponent.

116
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,781
And then our next pillar here is...

117
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:49,982
Oh, geez.

118
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:52,382
Okay.

119
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:53,503
Continue.

120
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:53,723
Sure.

121
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:55,984
Imagine there's like a really pretty picture there.

122
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:02,727
So the next piece of it is that we're also always a side event inside a main tournament.

123
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,208
So these aren't standalone events by any means.

124
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:10,691
You can go to your main Smash Brothers tournament and often find Smash Sisters there, which

125
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:14,713
means that the majority of our women enter the singles bracket anyway and then, you know,

126
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:17,014
have fun in the Smash Sisters side event.

127
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:21,496
And it also provides a fully integrated structure.

128
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:28,543
Meaning that you have men and women coming out and participating in so far as like cheering on people, you know

129
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,765
Providing commentary or helping with the stream

130
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:38,093
So it is our you know, it's one of our goals that this side event feeds back into the competitive co-ed scene

131
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,651
You guys can get our slides in the presenter pack, I believe.

132
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:48,773
Cool. So another core pillar that we abide by is we do not have prizes.

133
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:54,536
Because we're not interested in having a separate prize pool where people win based on rank 1, rank 2, rank 3.

134
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:57,277
Our whole point is to promote collaboration and teamwork.

135
00:07:57,537 --> 00:08:04,520
So if the image were there, it would have been a social media graphic that showed you a Temple Storm Maffle that we recently did to give away to participants.

136
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,900
Super cute leggings.

137
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,300
Super cute.

138
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,681
It's in there.

139
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:07,561
Shadows of a Tempest Storm.

140
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:13,604
But we provided incentive that way without the pressure of ranking women arbitrarily

141
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:14,805
in these events.

142
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:19,607
And we deliberately do things in a raffle format for this very purpose.

143
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:25,310
A next pillar that we go by is participant safety first.

144
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,051
So...

145
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,551
Okay.

146
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:27,611
So...

147
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:27,731
So...

148
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:27,791
So...

149
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:27,851
So...

150
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:27,911
So...

151
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:27,971
So...

152
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:34,009
This is an interesting topic because you're probably wondering what is she talking about?

153
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,050
It's about video games.

154
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,091
What do you mean safety?

155
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:40,335
So an interesting point and an example to illustrate this is when Smash Sisters was

156
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,039
first up and running, people reached out asking, hey, do you want this to be streamed?

157
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,720
Let's get the word out.

158
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,080
And if you're a regular tournament, that would make sense.

159
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,661
Let's get ad revenue, let's get viewers, let's spread the word.

160
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:55,862
For us, it's about do we want to introduce the toxic online chat rooms to our participants?

161
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,143
It's about their comfort first.

162
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:00,643
And so we polled them and see what they thought.

163
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:06,405
Another example is that when we run these events, we actually have private Facebook

164
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:11,486
event groups where people can improve to join and then talk there so that there's no trolling

165
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:14,467
or anything whatsoever involved, which we also have seen before.

166
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:20,268
The next tenet that we want to go over is about inclusivity.

167
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:23,849
For one of the Smashers events I asked one of my friends, hey, why don't you come out

168
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:24,129
and play?

169
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:24,809
You're really good.

170
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:26,789
You'd really add to the East Coast team.

171
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,730
She was like, hey, I wasn't really sure about this.

172
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,910
I'm a trans woman.

173
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,030
Can I participate?

174
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,451
I was flabbergasted by this question.

175
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:36,952
Yes, you absolutely can participate.

176
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:40,472
Anyone who identifies as a sister can totally come out to our crew battles.

177
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:41,933
It's a very inclusive event.

178
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:48,113
And then finally, cool, hey, our focus is on gameplay.

179
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:54,895
Which means as a side event, our goal is not to solve harassment issues.

180
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,316
We're not a social justice group either.

181
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:04,999
And just because we talk a lot about women doesn't mean we're there to, I guess, like,

182
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,399
protect them in a way.

183
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't know if that's a weird way to say it.

184
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,921
But, you know, Smash is a competitive community,

185
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:14,602
and we're always here to remember that.

186
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,403
You know, we're not here to baby our players.

187
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,724
We throw them right into a competitive environment

188
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,785
where they have to really work for their team,

189
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:23,846
and we're all out here to win.

190
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:27,907
It's also worth clarifying that it's not that we don't want to help harassment

191
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,428
or, like, help these issues.

192
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:32,449
It's just that they happen to be a byproduct of Smash Sisters as a whole,

193
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,950
and it's not our initial prerogative to do this.

194
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:41,647
So this brings us to our next point.

195
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,492
Prepare your community mentally.

196
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:45,277
So what do we mean by this?

197
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:51,837
Back then, before it started, I think I mentioned earlier that I had written a blog post about,

198
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:55,198
hey, stop asking about women's tournaments, just do it and see how it goes.

199
00:10:55,478 --> 00:11:00,520
And additionally, that year itself, there had been a lot of circulation around the topic of women

200
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,221
within gaming, specific to Super Smash Bros. community.

201
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:09,583
Now, another girl reached out to me once asking, hey, I'm really interested in Smash Sisters,

202
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:12,765
and I want to do this for my scene. I believe she was from the Street Fighter community,

203
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:16,346
and she asked, how can I do it? And I mean, I told her right off the bat, like,

204
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,067
It really depends on the landscape of your community.

205
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:22,528
You can't kind of take what we found to be successful and apply it there.

206
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:26,790
Really understand your community first and understand how they'll probably react to something

207
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,210
like this.

208
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,632
And then thankfully for us, it was okay because we kind of laid down the mental groundwork,

209
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:32,372
if that makes sense.

210
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,785
And part of laying down the mental groundwork is understanding your community and understanding

211
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:45,090
that the event or the people that you see IRL are super different than, like, the entirety

212
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,731
of the Internet.

213
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:50,735
So, you know, when we host events, our participants are people around, hey, that was so great,

214
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,497
it's super fun, that was ultra positive.

215
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:54,899
And then we see what people write online.

216
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:55,480
And it was...

217
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,961
Not the same.

218
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:04,705
People hear these little tidbits or pieces or they get misinformed about what Smash Sisters

219
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,867
is and they might start talking a little bit critically.

220
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,509
So when this happens, we try to...

221
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:16,441
Kind of convey our message a little bit more positively.

222
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:21,586
So when we host a recap ‑‑ post a recap of events, which we often do on Reddit, we'll

223
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:25,470
say oh, we had this many players come out, here are a couple pictures, it was super fun.

224
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,592
We also include an FAQ.

225
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:32,297
In the FAQ, it will often say, well, what is Smash Sisters?

226
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,039
Why do we even do it?

227
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,501
What can you get out of it?

228
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,885
In this way, we can control the message a lot better.

229
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:44,551
And so we're always trying to respond constructively by saying, this is exactly what we're trying

230
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:44,811
to say.

231
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:50,124
Cool. The next aspect that we're going to jump into is branding yourself carefully.

232
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:54,726
So if you look at this photo below, this grid of women are various avatars of people who

233
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:58,929
have participated or supported the first Smash Sisters event a year ago at Genesis 3.

234
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:02,570
If you look, they all have the same color wash, they all have the same Super Smash Brothers

235
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,811
logo in the bottom corner.

236
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:08,374
And this was completely a deliberate decision on our end as a social media campaign.

237
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:12,556
Again, there's a lot of controversy when there's a lot of all-women's events going on, and

238
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:13,996
we knew this going into it.

239
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:16,079
So we wanted again to promote teamwork.

240
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:18,221
And this time we did it with something as simple as giving

241
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:21,125
everyone a very similar looking aesthetic in their

242
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:23,768
avatars, which kind of took over Twitter and Facebook at

243
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:26,050
the time and kind of helped us in a way generate even more

244
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:26,191
hype.

245
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:32,364
Something else that we again try to remind people and this large block of text is our

246
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:36,907
lengthy mission statement but the key point to focus on is the bolded part that says this

247
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:40,329
is a progressive organization and format that is excited to adapt.

248
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,391
This comes and stems from the blog post I mentioned.

249
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,474
We constantly remind people that, hey, while we are both the founders, we don't have our

250
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:48,655
shit completely figured out.

251
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,877
Like, we're not saying we're completely successful.

252
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:53,220
It's an experiment and we're working iteratively.

253
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,544
And this has bought us a lot of leeway to make mistakes,

254
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:58,847
try new things, so people aren't immediately like,

255
00:13:58,947 --> 00:13:59,988
oh, well, that was a failure.

256
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,963
The next point is be careful about media outlets you work with and curate.

257
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:12,486
Recently I believe a really reputable female gamer was interviewed by a really reputable

258
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:17,449
larger platform and they effectively took her story and painted her as purely the victim

259
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:19,250
which she was extremely not happy with.

260
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,572
And we see this happen from time to time.

261
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:25,955
And so for Smash Sisters, we've taken the time to actually ask people who reach out,

262
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:28,017
hey, what are you trying to accomplish here?

263
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:28,577
What's your goal?

264
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,879
And what story are you trying to tell?

265
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,362
We've actually turned down people who have reached out asking if we can purely talk about

266
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:39,045
harassment and being victims because that's not something we're interested in anymore.

267
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:43,208
And then furthermore, we always ask if we can review what they've written before they

268
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:44,649
publish it online.

269
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:49,790
Cool, so that pretty much wraps up the branding and the foundation piece.

270
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,192
And now we're going to talk about the landscape of the female demographic.

271
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:59,575
One of our mission statements kind of talks about addressing the needs of women.

272
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:02,316
What exactly are those needs and who exactly are these women?

273
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:04,497
I mean, I think we all know this.

274
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,099
Not all women are the same.

275
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,420
Not all women are us.

276
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,161
Not all women want the same thing.

277
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:12,263
So it's crazy when we talk about a women's organization

278
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,606
where you have to deal with the preconceived notions

279
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:16,647
that come with that.

280
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,069
You have to deal with all the baggage that comes with

281
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,251
dealing with modern day feminist issues,

282
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,673
which there are a lot of, unfortunately.

283
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:28,236
And of course, we're not saying that feminism is bad

284
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,537
or anything by that means,

285
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:31,618
but there's a lot of baggage that comes with it.

286
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:36,761
We have to deal with the other groups that deal with women.

287
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:42,004
You know, there are women's leagues out there or brackets, and we have to answer to them.

288
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:46,427
We have to be, we're responsible for both the positive and negative parts of that.

289
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:52,330
When, you know, it's not necessarily fair, but it's something that we are a part of.

290
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:59,354
Sometimes people see Smash Sisters as the de facto women's organization or women's leadership

291
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,554
within the Smash community.

292
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:04,196
And we don't necessarily like that because we're a series of side events.

293
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:07,478
But when you talk about women, that's kind of what you automatically become.

294
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,562
So, here are a couple of examples of some, I think they're YouTube and Reddit comments

295
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:16,586
about a recent video that was posted by Yahoo Esports with an interview.

296
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:23,233
And at the very top it says, as long as they don't do stuff with the toxic aspects of feminism,

297
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:25,114
I'm mostly for this.

298
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,675
It's like, alright, thanks dude.

299
00:16:27,516 --> 00:16:30,077
Or like, hey, I was somewhat skeptical

300
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:31,617
when I first heard about Smash Sisters.

301
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:31,858
With a C.

302
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:35,379
Yeah, I was somewhat skeptical about Smash Sisters,

303
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,780
but you know what, they're doing is great

304
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,140
for the community, full support.

305
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,182
Or I think this was my favorite,

306
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:45,004
I didn't like the idea of Smash Sisters

307
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:46,684
because I guess I got all my information

308
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:47,885
from someone who didn't like it.

309
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,967
I'm glad I came to read this.

310
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:54,410
A lot of these comments are like, what the heck?

311
00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:00,536
Lil and I wondered at first, why are all these people so crazy about these ideas?

312
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:03,018
It's because of what it represents.

313
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:04,739
There's a larger picture here.

314
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,863
At the same time, we do understand this is what comes with the territory and we're fully

315
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,504
ready to address it.

316
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:15,690
So this brings us to the next topic. Learn to embrace true diversity as you scale.

317
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,272
And so usually when you hear the word diversity, especially in like context of affirmative action,

318
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:24,573
you're kind of thinking marginalized groups, helping them out, et cetera. When I say this

319
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:29,155
statement, I actually mean the next level deeper. So different types of women is what I'm referring

320
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:34,176
to when I say diversity. If you take a look at the coed Smash Brothers community at large,

321
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,257
oh, man, some of them hate each other.

322
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:41,681
And they like rip each other apart online and they don't agree and that's diversity in a nutshell, correct?

323
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:47,445
So an issue we face with Smash Sisters is because we were small initially and we're still pretty small

324
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:52,188
We banded together kind of as a unit and with a lot of like-minded women

325
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:58,692
And so as we started to scale up we started to see new women participate who didn't necessarily see eye-to-eye with our original

326
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,274
Participants and this is something we want to

327
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:03,436
Fix, we want to make room for them.

328
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,497
We don't want to feel like they need to align

329
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:08,460
to every single other girl who is already in Smash Sisters.

330
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,762
And I'm not saying we have solved the issue yet,

331
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:12,444
but it is something worth noting

332
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,405
because it is something we're gonna inevitably

333
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:15,446
continue to face.

334
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:18,229
And then like, one of the part of why diversity is great

335
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,971
is the more diverse your community is,

336
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,352
the more innovative you can be.

337
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,395
This is what allows us to continually evolve

338
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,336
and make things better when we get new ideas

339
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,097
from different people.

340
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:32,033
The next point is we promote camaraderie but we are not a cult.

341
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:39,219
So because I know it sounds funny but because of all the traction Smash Sisters has gotten

342
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,844
a lot of people have mistook us as the governing body for women in Smash.

343
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:48,947
We've become almost a noun or a group rather than a series of side events.

344
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:52,890
This is yet again another branding issue that needs to be addressed and needs to be fixed

345
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,433
and needs to be reiterated amongst everyone else.

346
00:18:58,841 --> 00:18:59,362
Cool.

347
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:03,626
So our final pillar here is to listen to and filter feedback.

348
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:08,091
We are always getting feedback from, you know, our demographic.

349
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,734
We want to make sure that they know that they're being heard, too.

350
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:14,378
And we've changed our events based on a lot of their feedback.

351
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:18,262
And I also conduct a post-mortem after every single event to say...

352
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,083
Hey, what did we do right?

353
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,064
What did we do wrong?

354
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:22,164
What do we need to change?

355
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:25,305
And how is the next event going to be better?

356
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:32,968
One example of the feedback that we've heard is in how we determine these crew battle rosters,

357
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:33,628
these teams.

358
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:36,469
And we can have a draft pick.

359
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,313
So we'll figure out who exactly you want to be on your team, or you can do it by region.

360
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:45,036
And, you know, at first we did it by draft pick.

361
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:47,818
We said to ‑‑ in order to balance what the teams would be like.

362
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:51,141
We heard there's a little bit of sensitivity there.

363
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:53,863
A lot of girls felt like they didn't make the cut or something like that.

364
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:57,706
Whereas if you have a region‑based crew you have a lot of pride, you have something

365
00:19:57,746 --> 00:20:02,030
that you can fight for, you know, there's a couple of pictures of people waving flags

366
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,492
for Arizona or the East Coast saying like, ah!

367
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:08,014
This is our region and we're super proud of it and they can really fight for their team.

368
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,535
At least AnyKey loaded.

369
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:18,478
So the next part is part of listening to feedback and addressing it is accepting help.

370
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:22,559
And I think this is the perfect time to shout out one of our sponsors, AnyKey, which is

371
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:27,261
an initiative that's partnered with both Intel and ESL that focuses on inclusivity within

372
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:27,761
eSports.

373
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:28,382
How perfect.

374
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,663
And also you'll see in the photo, no you won't, but there was a photo there.

375
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:36,739
That was a bunch of girls and us with Smash Sisters shirts on.

376
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,401
And it's because, like, we've learned that through running Smash Sisters,

377
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:43,923
this is an opportunity to actually empower and help others

378
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,224
and let others kind of get involved.

379
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,305
And you'll see in these photos,

380
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:49,966
we have people come and do the local recording.

381
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:53,048
We also have, we invite people to come do commentary,

382
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:54,889
and some of them have never done it before.

383
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:58,591
Also, a ton of Smash women have emailed us,

384
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,612
being like, hey, I'm really interested in running my own event.

385
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:03,693
And they've never even organized an event before,

386
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:07,395
and we've seen some of them now consistently doing this.

387
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:08,255
And they're better.

388
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,395
On the international level too.

389
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,896
I think there's like a Smash Sisters France group.

390
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:15,038
It's been in Sweden and Norway, even across like the US.

391
00:21:15,678 --> 00:21:16,678
And it's really great too,

392
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,559
because when you empower and enable others,

393
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,460
they also feel emotionally invested in your product,

394
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,421
I guess you can call it.

395
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,742
And then they're there with you as teamwork,

396
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:25,562
working together.

397
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:33,234
Yeah, so finally in conclusion, one of the biggest parts of this is to get to know your

398
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:33,694
community.

399
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:40,178
Once you know your community, you as an individual can understand how you can impact them.

400
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:43,500
We do this through the power of events.

401
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:48,523
When you have a single event, it creates a single rallying point that people can get

402
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:49,144
excited about.

403
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:50,905
you know, we'll talk to our friends and say,

404
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,646
hey, are you going to the next Smash Brothers tournament?

405
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,027
Are you going to like CEO this year?

406
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,708
And people get hype when they're like,

407
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,149
oh, there's a Smash Sisters event there.

408
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:58,290
We're gonna be there.

409
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,292
And that also helps us to like send our,

410
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:04,114
have a single point where we can center

411
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:05,334
our message around too.

412
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:11,373
And again, we're not here to say, hey, we are the pinnacle of success, but more so we've

413
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:15,373
been up and running for a year, and we're still going to run into many more obstacles

414
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:15,914
and hurdles.

415
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:20,615
But what we are going to do is stick by these three pillars that we've delineated for you

416
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,875
guys today to make future decisions.

417
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:25,136
And thank you for coming.

418
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:26,416
Sorry for the slide issues.

419
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:29,616
Give us a follow on our Facebook, Twitter.

420
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:37,846
So it seems like we have seven minutes left.

421
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:42,988
First note to point out is please fill in your evaluations if you get a chance because

422
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,370
we would love to hear constructive criticism as to how we can do such a complex topic more

423
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:47,831
justice.

424
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:51,052
And then secondly, I think we have some time for Q&A.

425
00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:52,013
Correct me if I'm wrong.

426
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:52,853
Yes?

427
00:22:53,093 --> 00:22:53,473
Thumbs up.

428
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:54,214
Okay, cool.

429
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:54,414
Great.

430
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:58,896
And if we don't get to your question, I think there's a wrap-up room around the corner where

431
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:00,897
we will be there ready to answer questions.

432
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,142
Hey guys, I know you're not super focused on women's issues and all that stuff in gaming,

433
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:20,925
but I guess I'm just kind of curious as a semi-outsider how some of the previous efforts

434
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:29,409
at these types of communities, organizations, or teams you feel like has impacted you or

435
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:31,269
just other future efforts.

436
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,891
And for example, I saw the comment about Siren.

437
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,472
You want to take this one?

438
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:39,398
Like is that baggage or?

439
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,121
It's kind of.

440
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,347
Learnings and baggage.

441
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:45,867
I guess baggage is the worst way you could call it.

442
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:48,528
But it's something we knew we would have to deal with,

443
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:51,349
and that's what informed us with why we had to be

444
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:52,889
extra careful with our branding.

445
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:55,070
Because we knew if we tripped any wire,

446
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,630
it would just be like, and then come crashing down.

447
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,770
Does that make sense?

448
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:00,691
Yeah, and then part of that is like,

449
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:04,372
how do you answer certain people online too?

450
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,913
Like you make one wrong tweet, and you're fucked.

451
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,813
Like that's just gonna blow up,

452
00:24:09,873 --> 00:24:11,713
and it's just like, oh wow, okay, this sucks.

453
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,753
So I guess it caused us to be a little bit more cautious.

454
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:25,152
All right. So Nintendo is typically hands off when it comes to events. But over the past ten

455
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:31,177
years we've seen the actual game companies kind of take a hold of events. Do you think that the

456
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:36,682
game companies should actually be supporting things like Smash Six directly or should they

457
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:41,747
just kind of leave it open and allow the community to kind of spring up with things to

458
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:42,868
support female players?

459
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:50,415
I don't think I have a strong opinion on this because grassroots seems to have been doing

460
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:50,956
pretty well.

461
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:54,038
I mean, at least the Smash community has been fine.

462
00:24:54,739 --> 00:25:00,023
I think it would be great if companies did do that, if that aligned with what their interests

463
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:00,263
are.

464
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:07,369
So it's really hard to speak for a corporation and to say something like, oh, Nintendo should

465
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:07,809
do this.

466
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,254
I think the more important question often is, you know, what can you do to impact your

467
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:13,874
community too?

468
00:25:15,503 --> 00:25:22,165
Do you think that the response would be different coming from someone who is like your peer

469
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:26,106
compared to someone who actually does work at the company is kind of what I was going

470
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:26,326
for.

471
00:25:26,346 --> 00:25:32,208
Like do you think the community would reject something if they felt like it was being forced

472
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:34,448
upon them and not like an organic group?

473
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:36,389
I guess we'll have to find out.

474
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:45,871
Has it happened that you've tweeted something incendiary or put up some message that people

475
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,893
have blown up on and then you've had to do damage control on it?

476
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:50,674
And if so, how do you go about doing that?

477
00:25:50,694 --> 00:25:50,954
Have we?

478
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:51,054
Yeah.

479
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:51,254
Ha ha ha.

480
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:51,434
Ha ha ha.

481
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:51,614
Ha ha ha.

482
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:51,794
Ha ha ha.

483
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:51,975
Ha ha ha.

484
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:52,155
Ha ha ha.

485
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:52,355
Ha ha ha.

486
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:52,555
Ha ha ha.

487
00:25:52,575 --> 00:25:52,755
Ha ha ha.

488
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:52,935
Ha ha ha.

489
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:53,115
Ha ha ha.

490
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:53,295
Ha ha ha.

491
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:53,475
Ha ha ha.

492
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:53,656
Ha ha ha.

493
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:53,836
Ha ha ha.

494
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:54,016
Ha ha ha.

495
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:54,196
Ha ha ha.

496
00:25:55,393 --> 00:25:58,894
I must have pushed it out of my memory because I can't remember it.

497
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:00,134
It wasn't too bad.

498
00:26:00,154 --> 00:26:06,715
I was actually having a private conversation with a Smasher and she was asking me some

499
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,036
clarifying questions about what Smash Sisters is.

500
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:09,756
Oh, that one.

501
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:14,397
You know, it's like Facebook Messenger, so we were just talking to each other, I thought,

502
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:15,317
was pretty candidly.

503
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:17,658
I think a month or two later...

504
00:26:18,498 --> 00:26:24,393
I saw screenshots of our conversation tweeted out to all of her followers and she wrote,

505
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:25,416
I think she was like...

506
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:27,334
We don't have to go into it, right?

507
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,056
Yeah, I mean, it was just like,

508
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,518
oh, the Smash Sisters girls wants this.

509
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,380
And it was like a very small snippet of what I had written.

510
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,741
And I was like, what the shit?

511
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:38,382
Like, but we were having a conversation.

512
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:40,424
But every time like this kind of stuff happens,

513
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:41,484
we'd learn something from it.

514
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:42,745
So like in our presentation,

515
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:45,467
we mentioned that our like two things we focus on

516
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:47,249
is bringing one together,

517
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:49,611
but also feeding back in the commentative community.

518
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:52,092
Like that moment definitely helped highlight that.

519
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:52,953
Yeah.

520
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:54,154
Okay, thanks.

521
00:26:57,672 --> 00:27:04,636
Hi, you guys talked a lot about branding and how specifically your branding has sort of been shaped by you know the

522
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,418
Environment that we are in right now

523
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:11,420
How do you balance like staying true to?

524
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:17,504
Your values and integrity as like standing up for women, but also not like you know

525
00:27:17,764 --> 00:27:21,926
Making sure that your branding is still on point and getting the message that you want to cross

526
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,662
I think what we want and then also our branding are just aligned with each other directly.

527
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:32,323
I don't think there's ever a neat point where they disconnect from one another.

528
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:35,985
I think we're just as transparent as we can be and as up front as we can be.

529
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:41,227
And I think as like the founders being like, hey, we're still making mistakes and messing

530
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:41,407
up.

531
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,688
I don't know how much more direct we can be.

532
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:44,328
Does that make sense?

533
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:45,369
Yeah.

534
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:48,130
Do you have anything to add?

535
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,370
No, that's good.

536
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:49,470
Cool.

537
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:49,610
Cool.

538
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,291
Anything else?

539
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:52,111
I think that's it.

540
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:52,211
Cool.

541
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:52,651
Anything else?

542
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:55,316
One person.

543
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:56,858
Oh, one more.

544
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,241
Okay.

545
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:06,631
Do you have any just like numbers or maybe anecdotal, like anecdotal evidence of like

546
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:08,894
increase of participation or anything like that?

547
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:12,133
Yeah, we were asked this before.

548
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:16,974
I guess if we say a number here that's technically going on the record.

549
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:17,574
Crap.

550
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,035
So, off the record.

551
00:28:22,816 --> 00:28:24,796
It's actually quite a low number.

552
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:28,417
I mean, in my opinion, it could be anywhere between like...

553
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:32,495
70 to 150 women.

554
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:34,117
That's a pretty big range.

555
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:39,563
A reminder that the Smash Brothers community is fairly small in the first place.

556
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:47,691
I think the largest tournament that ever happened for Smash was maybe like 1,800 people?

557
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:53,354
I think it might have been around 2,000 people, let's say.

558
00:28:54,194 --> 00:29:01,442
But if you have 100 women out of, let's say, 2,000 people in a group, for us, that's amazing.

559
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,843
But anecdotally, we've heard a lot of feedback,

560
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:06,444
people reaching out saying like,

561
00:29:06,504 --> 00:29:08,787
this is amazing, thank you so much,

562
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:10,348
I probably wouldn't be in the community anymore,

563
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:11,850
or I got involved because I saw this.

564
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,753
But next year we do wanna actually get more data,

565
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:16,294
so we have more stats.

566
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,777
And then one of my favorite stories

567
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:20,899
is about this young girl, she's...

568
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,741
I think she was eight.

569
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:23,702
Oh, Bowser girl.

570
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:28,486
Yeah, she mains Bowser, one of the, you know, grime-iest, like, turtle asshole guys, like,

571
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:29,927
in the Smash Brothers game.

572
00:29:30,287 --> 00:29:33,170
Like, he's pretty gross, but she just, like, she just rocked him.

573
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:38,695
And, you know, she came out to play and her parents would come to tournaments and she

574
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:42,338
doesn't have a Facebook, so I was there, like, texting with her dad, like, okay, you know,

575
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,741
you know, let Jaiden in, you know, she can come in and stuff, and it's, like, her time

576
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:46,121
to play.

577
00:29:46,221 --> 00:29:47,762
And they were really excited for her.

578
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:48,964
Yeah.

579
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:50,125
Fun story.

580
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,488
That's why we consider participant safety.

581
00:29:52,568 --> 00:29:54,991
We didn't want her parents to have to read through the chat.

582
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:56,213
Yeah.

583
00:29:58,175 --> 00:29:58,435
Cool.

584
00:29:58,495 --> 00:29:59,036
Thank you, everyone.

585
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:02,661
I think we'll be at the wrap-up room somewhere on this floor if you guys have any more questions.

586
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:03,101
Back there.

587
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:03,882
Thanks.

588
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:04,363
Thanks, guys.
