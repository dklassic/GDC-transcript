1
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:13,267
Thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:14,988
My name is Morgan Jafford.

3
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:24,874
I'm here to talk today about the rise and fall of defined development and some of the things that kind of go along the way.

4
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:33,396
This is a talk about running indie studios and studio management, but it's not really about that.

5
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,058
I'm going to lie to you a lot about what this talk is about.

6
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:39,779
One thing that

7
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:58,295
is true when we talk about business conversations, and this is a studio management kind of perspective on things, is we often don't talk about the human factors and the human cost and the feelings and emotions that go alongside running studios.

8
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,957
And there's really good reasons for that.

9
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:11,380
particularly if you have staff, nobody wants to hear that their boss is sad and worry whether or not they'll have a job the next week.

10
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:18,344
So, given that defined development is now

11
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:31,199
a little over three years deceased, that gives me the opportunity to speak really frankly and honestly about some of the ins and outs in a way that I wouldn't have spoken publicly while it was running.

12
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:37,441
And this talk is about studio management.

13
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:40,822
It's also about failure and it's about closure.

14
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:45,564
It's about how to hopefully avoid ending up in the situation we did.

15
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,724
But it's also about some of the reasons that we ended up making those decisions.

16
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:57,427
And, you know, I'm not fundamentally a believer that companies need to be eternal entities that run until the end of time.

17
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:06,210
It is a model to understand what you're for and what you're about and to run for that period of time.

18
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,531
But this is also a talk about sadness.

19
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,792
It's a talk about identity.

20
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:26,890
and what it means to be a visible game developer, especially in the indie space, to talk about loss and what you do after things go wrong.

21
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:34,557
But one of the things I want to talk about, to kind of kick things off, some of you know about Defiant Development, some of you may not.

22
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:43,606
It was a studio that was founded post-GFC in Australia, and during the GFC, Australia lost a lot of games jobs.

23
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:47,328
We lost about 75% of the game's jobs in Australia.

24
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,568
Lots of people lost their jobs.

25
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:55,569
Some people lost their jobs multiple times, going from one studio closure to the next studio closure to the next.

26
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:03,751
And it left the Australian landscape, which had been previously dominated by American-owned international studios, in a really grim position.

27
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:11,453
Dan, the co-founder of Define Development, and I started the company in that environment.

28
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:12,733
We started it with a really clear

29
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:13,981
mission.

30
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:27,269
You know, we wanted to build a company that gave people great jobs, working on exciting games, so that those great people that we knew were out there had opportunities.

31
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:36,934
And we started small, but across 10 years we built a studio that honored those goals at every stage along the way.

32
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:41,885
I believe, in any case, and I am biased.

33
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:52,690
And when you're setting up the goals for a studio, I think it's really important, particularly in that sort of environment, it's very easy to talk about the things you're not going to do.

34
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,372
Like, we're going to avoid all of these mistakes that the big studios made.

35
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:01,053
Negative goals, I don't think, help you get to a destination.

36
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:04,195
Positive goals can help you get to where you're going.

37
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:08,278
So we had a studio and we knew what it was for.

38
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:15,383
And one thing I want to stress here, there are two elements that I really want to kind of knuckle down on.

39
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:19,746
One, many of the things I talk about will sound simple.

40
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:21,988
None of them are simple.

41
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,290
They were all very complex situations.

42
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:29,373
But this is a one hour talk and I'm going to go through things fast.

43
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:32,936
So if you happen to listen and go, gosh, that sounds simple.

44
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:33,817
He's an idiot.

45
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:38,687
you could be right, but you might not be.

46
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:41,188
And the other is that this is my story.

47
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:52,312
Across the lifespan of Defiant, and there are some people in this room, over 50 people were involved, either as staff or working on the periphery.

48
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,513
At our peak, we had 30 full-timers.

49
00:04:57,154 --> 00:05:01,636
They all have their own stories, and they are absolutely as important as mine.

50
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:05,858
I got to see quite a lot from my seat, but I sure didn't see everything.

51
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,480
So if you're interested, please ask, and they'll tell you.

52
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:18,104
And the last thing I want to stress, just before we move on, is that I talk to a lot of people who run studios.

53
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,311
both smaller and larger than Defiant.

54
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:33,379
And I talked to a lot of people who find that experience incredibly stressful and who are very unhappy in the role that they're in.

55
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,522
And there were stressful moments at the end, don't get me wrong.

56
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:45,328
But if there's one thing I want you to take away from this is that 10 years of that journey for me was just a great time.

57
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:55,451
I was walking into a room full of creative people doing work that I loved and that they loved, and it made me happy.

58
00:05:56,091 --> 00:06:00,256
So I think it's important to hold that context as we go.

59
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,740
Before we closed down Defiant, we were working on a new project.

60
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,162
We'd delivered HandiFate 1, which was a success and enabled us to grow.

61
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:19,824
We delivered HandiFate 2, which was a success and had quite a lot of post-launch support.

62
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:21,864
And we were looking at new projects.

63
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:28,807
And there is a lens that we apply, that we applied, sorry, my tenses will wobble.

64
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,108
There's a lens that we applied at Defiant.

65
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:34,625
to find a meaningful project.

66
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:46,334
It had to sit somewhere in the Venn diagram of games we wanted to make, games we felt there was an audience for, and games that our team could make as well as anybody else.

67
00:06:47,535 --> 00:07:00,364
And also, we always wanted to make sure every new project was something new and something old, that it combined something we knew how to do and could rely on, along with some things we'd never done before and we knew we'd learn along the way.

68
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,806
That's how Hand of Fate came to be.

69
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:05,727
So the game we were working on was called A World in My Attic.

70
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:09,588
You can go and look at the trailer, it still exists, although the project is no more.

71
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:22,651
And it was taking Hand of Fate, which is a card game that comes to life, and it was taking it to kind of a new level in that it was an open world Zelda-y game with the settlers of Catan set of hexes.

72
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:24,852
You'd build your world and then you'd go out and adventure in it.

73
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:31,915
That project was intentionally bigger than we'd built before.

74
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:33,976
We wanted to grow the team.

75
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:35,517
We wanted to make a bigger game.

76
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:44,142
That was the ambition we'd set for the studio, to bring in more great people, make great games, and give them a great environment to do it in.

77
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:51,627
The thing I will say is a lot of our team were pretty outside their comfort zone at this point in time.

78
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,529
We'd been doing Hand to Fate at that point for five years.

79
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:57,148
We really knew how to make that game.

80
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,270
A lot of the team had joined along the road.

81
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:05,458
They'd never been involved with the messy, confusing start of a project, which is a whole different ball game.

82
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,762
And it is difficult.

83
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:18,810
to express to people who've had a very solid and robust framework to work from, from the last three or four years, that it's okay.

84
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:20,231
It's okay that it's messy.

85
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:24,855
In the start, it is all a mess, but we're gonna put all the parts together and it's gonna come together.

86
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:28,137
So there was a lot of work that needed to be done on that front.

87
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:38,244
And as the studio head, and also creative director and a bit producer, the question of how I was doing is not great.

88
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:44,334
My personal life was a disaster, is the truth, at this point in time.

89
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,595
My wife has a very high power job.

90
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:49,436
I had a very high power job.

91
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:55,798
We had two children who were six and nine, and it was a disaster.

92
00:08:56,618 --> 00:09:02,720
Because they needed us more than we could provide, and we both needed each other more than we could provide.

93
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,653
I was not doing great.

94
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:17,129
The combination of all the personal and professional stress at that point in time meant that where I needed to be patient, I just didn't have the time.

95
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:22,470
there is a lot of deep thinking that's involved with initiating projects.

96
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:26,933
And I was not able to provide the support and structure that was going on.

97
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:29,814
This is not the only issue we had.

98
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:35,037
The team was very independent and capable of playing along very well.

99
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:38,779
I'm not trying to take all of this on my own shoulders.

100
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,401
But I do think it's important because

101
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:52,547
We reached a position where we had a game, it was bigger than any game we'd made before, it was bigger than we could fund to conclusion on our own, and we needed external support.

102
00:09:53,127 --> 00:10:04,310
Now we knew that, and we had great relationships with a range of publishers, we'd had good conversations all the way along, and we had interest from a good half dozen publishers.

103
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,811
The thing about interest from publishers is that it

104
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,879
It's all very well and good until it comes time to sign a check.

105
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:17,620
And everybody will say, show us a little bit more, and show us a little bit more.

106
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:21,362
We'd been on the show us a little bit more road for a while.

107
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:24,543
And truth be told, we'd been on that road for too long.

108
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:30,256
So there came a point where we sat down and went, what are our options and opportunities?

109
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:36,601
And there were some options that we'd intentionally written off because they didn't fit with the reasons that we built the company.

110
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,344
We weren't particularly interested in taking external investment.

111
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:43,027
We weren't particularly interested in, you know, selling the company off wholesale.

112
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:51,975
And that was all fine until we realized that all of the publishing deals had now officially fallen through.

113
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:55,334
and we didn't have the runway to make it to the end.

114
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:02,845
So that leads to a plan with no alternative positions.

115
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:16,431
our burn rate was pretty inflated and the studio was at the point where we had to do something about that, which leads into a bunch of options and opportunities.

116
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:23,678
And when I was speaking earlier about like not having negative goals, like not having the, I will run a studio and I will not do this thing.

117
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:32,165
I'll tell you the one that I've always held because Pandemic Australia is the studio I worked at before Define Development.

118
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:43,899
That studio was bought by EA, and then it was shut down through the most brutal series of iterative cuts over the course of a year that I've ever experienced in my life.

119
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,861
I was the last person there.

120
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,082
I turned the lights off.

121
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:55,508
I laid off a hundred-odd staff on behalf of EA, one piece at a time, in a desperate attempt to save anybody on that light boat.

122
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:58,350
And I will tell you one thing that is on my negative list.

123
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,611
I was not going to do that again.

124
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:02,874
So then there were sell-offs.

125
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:06,847
and they didn't look very attractive either.

126
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:13,889
Every option and opportunity in front of us effectively compromised the reasons that we set the studio up in the first place.

127
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:22,531
So there was a point where Dan sat down and ran the numbers and we looked at what we could do and how long we could go.

128
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:29,813
And we realized that there was no plan that we had that could be executed in that timeframe to a positive outcome.

129
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,814
What we could do is give people

130
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:39,870
good packages, clarity, and an end to their time.

131
00:12:42,351 --> 00:13:01,536
So we ran those numbers, we ran those scenarios, and we basically came down to the point where there was a decision that had to be made between a very high risk, you know, fly close to the sun, lay off three quarters of the team, try and pull something together, or to call it a day.

132
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:06,410
After sleeping on it, we made the decision to call it a day.

133
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,852
We met with the leadership team and we explained it.

134
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:14,156
And then we met with the rest of the team and we explained it.

135
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,658
We gave everybody, as I said, generous packages.

136
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,821
Gave them their hardware so they could work on projects if they wanted to.

137
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:26,385
And it was done.

138
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:33,430
It was one week from the initial decision to the studio being closed.

139
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:41,789
one week from that room that I love to walk into, being full of life and vigor, to empty.

140
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,511
And just me.

141
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:46,352
And Dan.

142
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,756
And for a moment, there was silence.

143
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,782
So one of the things I think is the question of like, how do you avoid ending up in this situation?

144
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:01,243
Which is,

145
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:05,192
hopefully meaningful and useful to some of you.

146
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:14,600
And the truth of the matter is that all the decisions that led to us closing down happened two years before we closed down.

147
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:21,687
The correct time to make change was well before we reached the point where closure was inevitable.

148
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:24,109
There's

149
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:33,472
So this then is going to be a talk about how to avoid some of the pitfalls that we hit.

150
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,675
But it's also not really about that either.

151
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:48,264
When we started Defiant, a friend of ours who ran big studios for EA and Sega gave us some advice.

152
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:55,329
And he said that your job is not to work in the business that you found, but to work on the business that you found.

153
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,691
You shouldn't be giving yourself a job.

154
00:14:57,991 --> 00:15:00,773
You should be working on building a business that supports people.

155
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:07,819
And that seemed great, except for the fact that it seemed really stupid from the indie dev perspective.

156
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,600
Like, why do we build studios?

157
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,061
We build studios because we want to make games.

158
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,603
It's the only way to get games made.

159
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:15,124
That's why I started a studio.

160
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,871
All I ever wanted was to build the business I could work in.

161
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:22,892
Why else do it?

162
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:27,494
And I've had this conversation with a lot of indie studio heads, right?

163
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:34,036
Where they're like, well, often the question comes up, why are you creative directing that project rather than getting somebody else in to do it?

164
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,957
And it's like, because that's the fun bit.

165
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,958
That's why I built the whole thing, right?

166
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:43,880
And that is true, but it is limiting.

167
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:49,560
One thing that I think is important is strategy meetings.

168
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,001
And we had strategy meetings.

169
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:54,343
We had a five-year plan, we had a one-year plan, we had a two-year plan.

170
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,145
But we'd done them all.

171
00:15:58,546 --> 00:15:59,506
And we hadn't updated them.

172
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:04,229
And those values I showed you right at the start about what Defiant was about, that defined us.

173
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,230
Those were post-GFC values.

174
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:11,874
When we closed, jobs for skilled developers were easy to find.

175
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,629
there was no shortage.

176
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,631
And that's one of the essential reasons that we started the studio.

177
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:20,792
And it just wasn't valid anymore.

178
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:30,077
And by putting a big strike through one of the core pillars that had built the studio, we didn't have that reason to continue and press on.

179
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:42,704
It is critical that you know what your company is for, but it's equally critical that you revise it and understand what your company will be for.

180
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:57,391
You need to work backwards from your big goals to what you're actually going to set out and achieve, right?

181
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:05,717
It's all about, you know, everybody knows about smart goals, specific, measurable, attainable, whatever.

182
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:09,299
But specific and measurable is important.

183
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,401
The reason our strategy meetings were nonsense

184
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,160
is because they weren't specific and measurable.

185
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,561
They were big and they were fluffy, and we could always feel like we were doing the big and fluffy thing.

186
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:23,962
No, if you want to be bigger in five years, you say you want to be bigger in five years.

187
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:25,163
We want this many people.

188
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:34,406
If you don't want to be bigger in five years, and I would recommend that, then say that.

189
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:37,407
Talk about how specifically

190
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:48,329
you're going to do these things, because you can only identify the vulnerabilities of your studio when you miss your goals.

191
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,950
That's the start of the process of understanding.

192
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,993
And you always, I mean, the thing is, we're all smart people, right?

193
00:17:55,553 --> 00:18:01,997
And smart people are really, really good at justifying why the step that they've taken is the right step just in front of them.

194
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:04,111
because of course it is.

195
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:06,112
It's the only natural step by the time you get there.

196
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:11,073
Planning is all about structure and it's all about setting up those goalposts so you come back and you can go, actually, you know what?

197
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:12,094
We missed.

198
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:12,914
Actually, you know what?

199
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:15,235
We're not doing the thing we set out to do.

200
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:15,975
Actually, you know what?

201
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:19,136
Maybe this isn't the right game for us at this point in time.

202
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,036
Actually, you know what?

203
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:23,397
We need to sign up for a publisher here or we're going to go off in a different direction.

204
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:35,424
And that, for us, vulnerability, particularly structural vulnerability for a studio, shouldn't come as a shock.

205
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:47,231
And I'm not saying that we completely botched the planning, but we hadn't set our goals clearly enough to know that we were missing them along the way.

206
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:51,874
We hadn't set the road clearly enough to understand that the path had gone awry.

207
00:18:55,356 --> 00:19:03,160
One thing I want to touch on, too, is money is a big part of running a business.

208
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,481
You've got to keep the engine turning.

209
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:10,464
You can't simply follow money, but you also can't operate without it.

210
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:16,547
So you do need to make sure that you have your cash flow sorted out and you know how you're getting from one place to the next.

211
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,711
So this

212
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:39,146
When I think about what would we have done differently, how would we have updated the company goals from simply being a great place for people to work, making great games, there are things that we understood.

213
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:51,794
And one of the big ones for me is that if you put a team of people together and you have them chew on the same sorts of problems for long enough, you get to great

214
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,230
and meaningful and revolutionary games.

215
00:19:56,491 --> 00:20:12,365
Every great game, well they're not universally true, but certainly there are a lot of great games that are examples of people who've been sitting in the background chewing away on the same sorts of problems for game after game after game after game before hitting a moment where it's great.

216
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:21,148
There was a terrible Hulk game back in the day that was followed by the fun Hulk game that was followed by Prototype.

217
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:24,670
And as you look at Prototype, you can see all those steps along the way.

218
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:31,334
It's true of the Infinity Ward team who moved from Medal of Honor to Call of Duty to Call of Duty to Call of Duty to Call of Duty to Call of Duty.

219
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:39,197
Anyway, keeping developers together and chewing on the same sorts of problems is one of the fundamental beliefs I had.

220
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:45,840
It's why at Defiant we had a philosophy about the games we built where we always took something old and combined it with something new.

221
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:56,065
If we had taken that value into one of the founding principles of the studio, we would have found a new reason to exist that could have carried us forward.

222
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,406
The other thing, you know,

223
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:00,452
You've got to have big dreams.

224
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:04,995
And the truth of the matter is, we started the studio with big dreams.

225
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,380
We wanted a game that was out on consoles.

226
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,204
We wanted to self-publish and get out to the masses.

227
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:18,927
And we achieved all that.

228
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:24,251
And if there's one thing that you take away from this talk,

229
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,094
All the planning, all the strategy, all the rest is largely irrelevant.

230
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:31,435
Take this away.

231
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:35,138
When you succeed, celebrate.

232
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:44,005
It's really important to mark the wins along the way, because you don't necessarily get to keep winning all the way.

233
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:55,634
So when you pull it off, make sure you stop, give each other a high five, and then you need a new plan.

234
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:58,823
then you need some new goals, you need some new ambitions.

235
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:02,606
The truth is, we didn't have a big enough dream.

236
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:11,272
And this is... A theme for this talk is advice I give others, but I'm too stupid to take myself.

237
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:22,882
And I've spoken to indie devs often to say, it is important that you forge a big enough dream to act as a lighthouse for your team and your studio.

238
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:31,976
And the other thing is that the transitional phases of game development studios are now well-known and understood.

239
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:36,760
A two-person studio does not run like a 10-person studio.

240
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:45,287
A 10-person studio, and a successful 10-person studio that's doing really well and making great stuff, does not run like a 20-person studio.

241
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:48,109
To go from 20 to 40 or 50

242
00:22:51,283 --> 00:23:00,193
is a whole another ball game and involves a whole new layer of management and every step along this phase transition is a chance for things to go terribly wrong.

243
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,596
And they always do, by the way.

244
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,437
We had planned for them.

245
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:10,264
Every time we changed size, we had a plan that said, you know, we're writing off six months, working out how to make this happen.

246
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:16,456
there is always a discomfort as you go through those transitional periods.

247
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:20,778
But you do have to plan for them if growing bigger is part of your set of goals.

248
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:23,980
And each one of them is about letting go.

249
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:31,646
So when you grow, you find that the many different hats you've worn

250
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:35,353
need to be taken off and put on individual people.

251
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:48,099
So the process of growth and the process of transition is always a place to, what I've said here is put the team in charge of the dream.

252
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:53,401
The fundamental thing that went awry here was

253
00:23:54,468 --> 00:24:03,415
for me looking at Defiant as a place I could work, as opposed to a place where my job was to help others thrive and succeed.

254
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:17,305
We needed a vision that carried forward, that it was a place that we were building continuity, we were building studio, we were building that ongoing value and forward motion.

255
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:24,915
So, you know, the truth of the matter is that, again, in talking with other studio heads, this is really common.

256
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:26,656
Everybody's like, well, I wear a lot of hats.

257
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:36,463
And I think it's important that we understand I wear a lot of hats to be a direct synonym for I'm doing a lot of things badly.

258
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:45,849
And if you would like them to be done well, it's important that you entrust people with the responsibility that goes along with those hats.

259
00:24:48,627 --> 00:25:03,492
Likewise, one of the things that I think is very true universally with games is that games only happen through belief and willpower.

260
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:15,596
Everything in games is taking something that doesn't exist and just forcing it to be birthed into the world in reality through sheer force of will.

261
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,705
Belief is important.

262
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:26,228
And I'm a big believer in the people I work with, a big believer in the people I work with now.

263
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:30,949
I have an enormous amount of belief.

264
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:34,690
Belief needs to turn into trust and faith.

265
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,111
And people will surprise you.

266
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:42,734
What happened next?

267
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,298
What I've said here is energy gets released, and this is true.

268
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:59,030
And this is one of the reasons that, you know, while the closure of Defiant makes me sad, it doesn't, you know, well, I'll talk about the sadness in a minute.

269
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:05,557
But companies tie up people and effort and energy

270
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:13,438
And sometimes they tie up people and effort and energy, as they did at Pandemic for us, for several years with no outcome whatsoever.

271
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:18,863
It's not the worst thing in the world, but it's not great.

272
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:22,105
People have a right to see the creative output of their work.

273
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:25,368
When a studio closes, all that energy is released.

274
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,399
As I said, when we started Defiant, there were not great jobs around.

275
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:37,485
When Defiant closed, there were great jobs around and working for Defiant meant something for the people who'd worked for us.

276
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:42,931
They had options and opportunities to go work on great projects at great studios.

277
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:44,672
I could not be more happy

278
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:49,116
about the successes of the Defiant alumni.

279
00:26:50,297 --> 00:27:00,705
There are so many people along the way who've gone on to do such great things, and the fact that we were able to be a small part of that journey with them makes me happy.

280
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:13,985
We did still have an office and a lease at this point in time, which again was mainly a place that I could go and sit and be alone and feel sad.

281
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:23,508
But it wasn't long after that Dan and I, Dan's my business partner by the way,

282
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:28,066
And Dan and I were effectively the last people standing there.

283
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:31,247
So we still had ongoing support for the old products.

284
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:35,289
We weren't doing development anymore, but our games that we'd self-published were in the market.

285
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:36,549
There were still things to do.

286
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:37,390
There was still support.

287
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,771
And that kept us busy.

288
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:48,634
And it wasn't long after that that James Scott, who was one of the programmers at Defiant, said, look, I don't want a job.

289
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:58,203
But I did pitch, you know, I pitched a superhero game back in the day as a thing that Defiant could work on and wasn't the right thing for the studio at the time.

290
00:27:58,223 --> 00:27:59,764
He's like, can I have that?

291
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:02,365
Of course you can have that.

292
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:05,007
We're not in the business of keeping people's ideas.

293
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:15,212
So James started work on what became Capes, which is now signed to Daedalic and will be out later this year.

294
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:23,365
And then Dan started working on that and Sean, who'd been our art director, started working on that.

295
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:28,468
And the nice thing about having an office is that there was a space in which that could happen.

296
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:38,395
And then, you know, COVID began and it was a big enough office that five people could in fact sit in opposite corners and still be socially distanced.

297
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,016
So that was a positive.

298
00:28:42,297 --> 00:28:44,779
And I got roped into that project as well.

299
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,780
I started doing some writing and doing some design.

300
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,932
For Dan, I think the process of keeping busy was quite healing.

301
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:57,292
And for me, it was not.

302
00:28:58,553 --> 00:28:59,353
It was really bad.

303
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:01,514
I did not need to be busy.

304
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,274
I was very done.

305
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:14,897
So, you know, this is a talk, in some ways, about the very many ways that games can break your heart.

306
00:29:15,397 --> 00:29:17,018
But it's not really about that.

307
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:32,956
There's a thing that comes along with being a developer in public and missing that is very shameful.

308
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:37,418
Failure makes it really hard to want to put yourself out there.

309
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:51,947
The other thing for me, too, is one of the things that really gave me joy was acting as a mentor to other studios and to other developers, offering advice where that advice was useful and practical.

310
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:58,593
And nobody wants advice from a great big failure.

311
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,756
It's certainly how I felt at the time.

312
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,810
and the phone stopped ringing.

313
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:10,672
And I think, you know, in retrospect, having spoken to people, I think people were being compassionate.

314
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:19,534
So I think people didn't call because they felt like, you know, I'd taken myself away from the public eye and that was a fair and reasonable thing to do.

315
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:28,317
But it had stolen from me one of the pieces of joy in my life, which was talking to other developers about the questions of game development.

316
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:32,538
So here I am.

317
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:35,786
Studios closed, some people are working on a game.

318
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,188
I'm sort of working on a game, but not really.

319
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:49,275
And it's impossible to not kind of come to terms with the fact that you may have just done the best thing professionally that you'll do.

320
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:51,597
And from here, it is all downhill.

321
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,444
And I've got to say that running indie studios

322
00:31:03,024 --> 00:31:04,745
is a thing that gave me great joy.

323
00:31:05,726 --> 00:31:14,192
But it's really hard to work out what the role of a failed indie studio head is in the broader context of the industry.

324
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:21,617
Ten years running it successfully, one not so good, it's hard to work out where you fit.

325
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:33,268
To be fair, early in the piece I had some very generous offers from people to come on board and do various roles for them, but I really wasn't ready.

326
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:46,991
I talk here about the fun parts of a nervous breakdown, and I don't mean to use the language of mental health lightly because I was not in a place where my mental health was light.

327
00:31:49,072 --> 00:31:53,533
I was certainly depressed, I was certainly burned out, I was certainly in the midst of a nervous breakdown.

328
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:57,348
I was certainly doing very, very badly.

329
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:01,010
But pretty privately.

330
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:10,115
It is interesting, the contrast between being a very, very public game developer, which I was, something like 50,000 Twitter followers.

331
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:14,477
I turned my Twitter off because I was very keen not to be in public at this point in time.

332
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:16,338
That turned out to be a mistake.

333
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:18,139
I probably should have paused it.

334
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,241
50,000 Twitter followers is useful when you're up to stuff.

335
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:31,390
I definitely drew a line through that moment and said, oh, I am very much never going to make games again.

336
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,052
Both by choice and by circumstance.

337
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:42,674
I could not see myself as a person ever doing that work again.

338
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:47,335
I was happy to help people who were doing stuff, but not for real.

339
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:51,577
So, you know, I took time

340
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,000
to you.

341
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:06,097
really benefited from some full-on parenting, particularly as we went through COVID.

342
00:33:08,718 --> 00:33:11,741
I would not take those two years back under any circumstances.

343
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:27,352
I would like to have been happier during them, but the value of turning my focus, which had been on external matters to the internal health and wellbeing of my family, helped a lot.

344
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:31,896
And as I say, there's also, you know, the fun parts of a nervous breakdown.

345
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:37,059
You get to, you know, tattoos and, you know, focus on your hobbies, do a bunch of gardening.

346
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,581
And at that point I decided it was time to, you know, I'm going to get out of games.

347
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:43,642
I'll go and become a therapist or something.

348
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,143
I'll go and do some study, see how that goes.

349
00:33:48,364 --> 00:33:51,426
There's a reasonably big gap here at the end.

350
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:54,762
to taking responsibility.

351
00:33:54,942 --> 00:34:08,071
And the thing about the way that I've always approached game development and the way that I've always approached the teams I work with and the studios I work with, ever since I've been a junior, is to be responsible.

352
00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:10,433
I do feel responsible for the team.

353
00:34:10,473 --> 00:34:11,673
I feel responsible for the game.

354
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,275
I feel responsible for the people I work with.

355
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:17,437
I carry an enormous amount of responsibility.

356
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,140
But at this point,

357
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:27,730
I also just couldn't help but think that there was a lot that was unfair.

358
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:33,715
You know, it's possible to have a poker hand, play it perfectly, and lose the hand.

359
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:41,861
I'm not saying we played it perfectly, but I didn't think, I mean, I think that game would have been great.

360
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:46,124
I think publishers were wrong and stupid not to sign it.

361
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:49,406
Often wrong and stupid.

362
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:56,971
But there comes a point where you go, well, I did make all those decisions.

363
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:02,655
The road that led me here, I walked down on my own.

364
00:35:05,557 --> 00:35:13,182
And then 10 years of being Morgan Jaffet of Defined Development,

365
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:21,530
And you know, I'm certainly not the biggest named indie dev, but I was pretty well known, particularly in Australia.

366
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:23,512
I was very visible.

367
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:24,673
I was very vocal.

368
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:32,419
When you are a public person, you become one thing in public.

369
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,484
It is hard to have a multidimensional and complex identity in the public sphere.

370
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:41,427
And when you're an indie game developer,

371
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:50,762
It's hard to keep your public personality out of your private personality because there is an enormous amount of bleed backwards and forwards.

372
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:52,702
A lot of my friends are people in the games industry.

373
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:55,243
A lot of my social environment is the games industry.

374
00:35:55,263 --> 00:36:01,725
A lot of the ways that I interact and share and I'm a member of a community is through the games industry.

375
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:07,247
Being Morgan Jaffet of Defiant Development,

376
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:10,255
was exhausting.

377
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:30,679
And, don't get me wrong either, like, I'm not a woman, I'm not a visible minority, but it was equally impossible not to worry that with 50,000 Twitter followers and a visible public presence, that one day that could just all turn into a rabid mob and it would all be over.

378
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,280
Like, the ongoing pressure of the

379
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:39,872
the social media machine is a tough thing.

380
00:36:43,173 --> 00:36:56,318
When you are just one thing, it's very hard to live a complex and fulfilling life.

381
00:36:57,118 --> 00:37:00,979
There's a bunch of things that play in to the way that you may

382
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:10,109
approach other people, the stories you tell, the ways you pull things together.

383
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:17,851
That being crushed down into that singular thing is also part of the kind of myth that keeps companies going, right?

384
00:37:18,131 --> 00:37:21,932
People think people in charge are in charge for some reason.

385
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:25,733
They know more, they're wiser, they're cleverer.

386
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:27,453
We make sort of figureheads

387
00:37:32,938 --> 00:37:35,820
of people so that, you know, we can respect them.

388
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,463
We assume that the person at the top of the pile has a good reason for being there.

389
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:41,444
It's all just people.

390
00:37:42,765 --> 00:37:43,586
It's all just people.

391
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:48,409
They're all strange and weird and, you know, have their own things going on.

392
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:55,534
But a lot of those people have forced themselves into very boring shapes in order to do the job that they do.

393
00:37:58,832 --> 00:38:02,615
You know, it is important to have a public face that represents the company.

394
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:06,859
It is important for a myriad of different reasons.

395
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,466
It's important in business, it's important in hiring, it's important for the overall relationships, but it's all people in the end.

396
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:26,116
And you have real limitations because, as I noted at the start, your public behavior has a really concrete impact on the people you work with and for.

397
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:34,561
the things you say are going to be read, if by nobody else on the internet, they will be read by your team.

398
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:49,172
It's interesting, at one point I realized that whether or not I had a beard was one of the ways in which the team was trying to work out whether we were doing well or in trouble.

399
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:56,378
Because when you lack the big picture information, when you don't actually see the bank statement,

400
00:38:57,847 --> 00:39:02,108
You have to, you know, cut open the animals and scry the auguries, right?

401
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:07,369
You pick whatever the weather is and you go, gosh, does this indicate a bigger picture?

402
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:08,190
Is God angry?

403
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,290
Is that why we're being punished?

404
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:14,131
You have to be careful with your public persona.

405
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:34,381
This was two years of, like, not a great phase for me, where I was sad, and people had gone on to do good things, and I could be happy and proud of the work that had been done.

406
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:38,782
But I was largely sad in private.

407
00:39:39,823 --> 00:39:44,964
And then, you know, we'd been working on Capes in the meantime, and that had reached a place where it was in good shape.

408
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,925
So we decided to take it to Gamescom.

409
00:39:51,628 --> 00:39:53,969
And we were taking it to Gamescom to speak to publishers.

410
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,770
That is the thing that I've done for Define many, many times in my life previously.

411
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,831
I was happy to do it for the new group.

412
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,852
Spitfire Interactive is what that group of ex-Define people were called.

413
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,953
And they had Dan and I's support.

414
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:09,894
And Dan was working very hard on it, and I was working gently on it.

415
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:14,035
And we went to Gamescom.

416
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,677
And in the lead up, I realized I was terrified.

417
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:28,640
absolutely terrified to go and pitch this game, which is a thing I've done many, many times before with complete confidence.

418
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:34,723
And I was terrified of the question of like, or what happened?

419
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:38,425
Why didn't Defiant work out?

420
00:40:38,465 --> 00:40:39,546
Why is this a new studio?

421
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:40,426
What's the relationship?

422
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:41,227
How's that going on?

423
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:52,538
And I did the thing that I hadn't done across the previous two years, which is I reached out to my friends in the industry and I said, I'm fucking terrified.

424
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:54,980
What am I going to do?

425
00:40:56,461 --> 00:41:01,385
And it was a great moment because they were able to talk me down off that ledge, which was not a very high ledge.

426
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:02,305
They said, nobody cares.

427
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:03,426
Show the game.

428
00:41:04,107 --> 00:41:04,767
Is the game good?

429
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:05,528
Nobody cares.

430
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:06,188
You care.

431
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:06,929
Nobody cares.

432
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,131
Um, and

433
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,784
I went to Gamescom, and we successfully signed a publisher for that title.

434
00:41:19,526 --> 00:41:31,175
And as I returned home and sat, for the first time, I had an idea for a game that I passionately wanted to make.

435
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:35,458
And I realized something had changed.

436
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:39,642
And I could see myself

437
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:49,727
making games again, and I could see a way in which there could be a future for me in this industry, and there were ways that I could represent things.

438
00:41:51,488 --> 00:42:03,913
It is hard to say what burnout is and isn't, and where it starts and ends, but for me, it ended when inspiration came back.

439
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:11,041
And there was nothing I could do to force that to happen, but to clear the space to allow it to happen.

440
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:19,966
And God knows the first step on that road was being honest about the fact that I was in a terrible place.

441
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:32,634
But while you're waiting for that kind of inspiration to come back and for new things to flow in, I do think there's a big question of, like, what do you do?

442
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:34,075
I mean, outside

443
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,235
getting tattoos and gardening.

444
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:43,177
And I think the answer that I found was to help other people.

445
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:57,161
And there's a truism in my life that is universal, which is that often I'm helping other people in the way that I'd like to be helped myself.

446
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:01,020
And you hope that people will pick up on those cues.

447
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:07,781
But I'll tell you what's even better than cues, which is just telling people that you'd like a hand.

448
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:17,944
This flies very much in the face of the things I was talking about in terms of public face for a company.

449
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:20,984
And that is the challenge and the bind that I was stuck in.

450
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:27,926
But there are big and wide mentor and peer groups to ask for help.

451
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:35,037
So at this point, things started opening up again.

452
00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:41,264
Options and opportunities were suddenly in front of me that felt interesting and compelling.

453
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:43,968
I had my own projects I was working on.

454
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:46,791
I was able to help in a fundamental way on CAPES.

455
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:57,163
I was able to work with local developers on a game that I'm not sure is announced yet, but doing some narrative support.

456
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:04,066
And I've recently started working with a team in New Zealand.

457
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:12,210
Helping other people doing the thing that I'm good at has been very rewarding and fulfilling.

458
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,391
It's nice because

459
00:44:16,892 --> 00:44:23,053
The message that I'd taken away from the closure of Define is that I was no longer good for anything.

460
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:28,974
But the reason Define ran well for 10 years is because I'm actually quite good at a bunch of things.

461
00:44:29,954 --> 00:44:32,835
And it was nice to be able to start to apply them again.

462
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:44,777
So, at the same time, that was an opportunity for me to engage with those projects as a much more complex and three-dimensional human.

463
00:44:46,136 --> 00:44:51,199
I'm no longer Morgan Jaffet to find development, which is good, which is good.

464
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,481
I've helped different projects in different ways.

465
00:44:54,401 --> 00:45:05,108
I helped a mobile project that's based on narrative therapy and mobile health and rewrote all of their narratives so that it was a narrative therapy game with actual viable narrative design.

466
00:45:05,628 --> 00:45:07,149
And that was good.

467
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:12,613
The thing about all of this, fundamentally,

468
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:18,140
This is a talk about how to mend a broken heart.

469
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:20,823
And that's really what it's about.

470
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:23,505
Games will break your heart if you let it.

471
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:26,908
But it'll heal it, too, if you let it.

472
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,554
Companies, I think, are not the be-all and end-all.

473
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,415
They tie up an enormous amount of energy.

474
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:39,340
And often we have to build studios to make games, which is stupid, by the way.

475
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:44,893
We need other models, and that's part of what I'm working on now.

476
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:54,800
But what a company does is form human potential into a collective shape that can achieve bigger things than we can do alone.

477
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,361
And that is worth doing.

478
00:45:56,982 --> 00:46:05,388
It is worth working with other people to try and make bigger games and achieve bigger things than we can do on our own.

479
00:46:07,189 --> 00:46:11,012
But if it's not going to do that, let it go.

480
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:12,790
Let people free.

481
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,672
Let them go into the world and do other things.

482
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:25,857
But before you do that, maybe make a better plan, because that can really make a difference.

483
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:31,861
You've got to have a plan that's worth your efforts, that's worth the people you bring together.

484
00:46:35,785 --> 00:46:42,306
Another thing that's really important to me, and this is something I did pretty well, but imperfectly.

485
00:46:45,327 --> 00:46:53,789
While the journey is good, tell your business partners, tell the people who work for you, tell them you love them and you're having a good time.

486
00:46:55,189 --> 00:47:00,250
Or at least tell them you love working with them, if you don't want to be too confrontational.

487
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:12,734
It's in, if you don't, life is, and this is the thing that I've realized in talking to so many studio heads, life is what you do every day.

488
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:29,681
And if the things you're doing every day are exhausting you and draining you and running you down, use the power you have to change that, to build structures that renew you and invigorate you every day.

489
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,082
And when it is good, tell people.

490
00:47:32,665 --> 00:47:33,045
Share it.

491
00:47:34,746 --> 00:47:36,566
Let them know what that means to you.

492
00:47:39,828 --> 00:47:47,490
You know, Defiant development was a commercial proposition that we built for a singular moment in time.

493
00:47:48,751 --> 00:47:51,312
And I'm really proud now.

494
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:57,454
I find myself able to be proud of what we achieved over the nearly a decade that we ran that studio.

495
00:47:58,902 --> 00:48:01,623
But we did grow it out of a particular moment and a particular thing.

496
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:06,985
And in that same process, we were able to be part of something bigger.

497
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:10,967
There was an indie game explosion happening around the world.

498
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,088
There was an indie game explosion happening more specifically in Australia.

499
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:20,391
We were able to be a part of that incredibly exciting moment in history.

500
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:27,154
The studio closed and, you know, that left me with literally no idea what to do.

501
00:48:28,618 --> 00:48:29,878
and no idea who I was.

502
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:52,166
And if you find your public self becoming visible and one-dimensional and creeping in at night and sliding in under the sheets, keeping you company, it might be time to think about how to expand yourself, how to be three-dimensional, how to be vulnerable.

503
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:59,967
It's one thing to be popular, but it's another thing to be loved.

504
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:03,729
You can be popular with a lot of people, but you can only be loved by a few.

505
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:06,050
Relationships are everything.

506
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:15,595
But if you're not vulnerable and honest, if you spend your entire time holding other people up, but not letting them hold you up,

507
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,281
You're doing them a great disservice.

508
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:24,444
And this applies not just in the broader scheme of things, but it applies in a studio fashion as well.

509
00:49:25,044 --> 00:49:29,647
If you're a studio founder and you're looking at yourself and you're going, but I'm indispensable.

510
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:32,108
This company cannot run without me.

511
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,409
You do that team a disservice.

512
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,772
You're denying them the opportunity to grow into the roles that you occupy.

513
00:49:39,552 --> 00:49:44,615
You're denying them the opportunity to become the things that have led you along the path.

514
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:58,973
Ultimately, when it comes to making indie games, running indie studios, you can walk that road on your own, and that's a viable way to do it.

515
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:03,334
But I will tell you it is better with company, better with peers, and it's better with friends.

516
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:14,277
And all I can tell you at the end of this is, the answer I found, not easily,

517
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:18,388
What heals a broken heart?

518
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,752
Only people.

519
00:50:24,094 --> 00:50:27,437
People to love, dreams to chase, and doing it together.

520
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:29,860
That's my answer.

521
00:50:32,082 --> 00:50:32,823
Thank you so much.

522
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:51,579
I appreciate you very much bearing with me for this story.

523
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:54,204
This is a different talk to many of the talks I've given.

524
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:59,594
I'm delighted to answer questions if anybody has questions.

525
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:18,245
And I wrote some things down, because people like slides.

526
00:51:18,906 --> 00:51:20,067
But I'm really bad at slides.

527
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:25,572
And it's hard, because I'm asking you to ask me questions, but I've just given you a bunch of stuff to read, which is why I hate slides.

528
00:51:27,514 --> 00:51:28,095
All right.

529
00:51:28,155 --> 00:51:31,218
Thanks, Morgan, for such an honest and vulnerable talk.

530
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:37,264
I'm sure everyone here will agree with me that it was a beautiful, beautiful moment that you've shared with us.

531
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:40,147
I'm curious now, like after

532
00:51:40,816 --> 00:51:51,668
the collapse of Defiant and working now with all these smaller studios, do you have a bit more hesitancy with studios to tell them to expand bigger and getting to that same size?

533
00:51:51,728 --> 00:52:01,079
Even when I was running Defiant, I told people, people would often come with questions about expansion, and expansion is a natural and easy thing to do when things are going well.

534
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:10,442
I mean, there's a problem when you are sitting on a great big pile of money and you're a company and effectively you should be putting that to some use, right?

535
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,243
Because the game's been successful or a publisher deal's signed.

536
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:20,726
But even before this, I would always tell people that the fundamental is to know what your company is for.

537
00:52:21,843 --> 00:52:24,326
and growth can be a part of that or not a part of that.

538
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:33,878
I think the thing that I spend more time than anything else talking to people about is people who have grown and are finding it uncomfortable.

539
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,803
And it's really hard to put the genie back in the bottle at that point in time.

540
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:48,960
So yeah, I would advise everybody, I mean, I know people in this room who have teams of three making games that are commercially successful that they can keep making forever.

541
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:59,188
And look, don't get me wrong, there was a time when I said, if you've made a lot of money making a game, you probably should give some people some jobs.

542
00:53:00,151 --> 00:53:03,954
because Australia was desperately in need of people to provide jobs.

543
00:53:04,674 --> 00:53:06,755
But, yeah, I'm a long way from that now.

544
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:16,082
I think thinking about a game and what it can sustain and how it can support people is the key step.

545
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:22,326
And if people have companies they want to build, they should know what they're for and where they sit.

546
00:53:22,506 --> 00:53:26,969
And I think you should hire with great caution because, yeah, burn rates will kill you.

547
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:30,544
every single time, every single time.

548
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:36,116
So yeah, I would, my short answer to that is yes, grow only with caution.

549
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:37,338
Okay, thanks.

550
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:37,940
Pleasure.

551
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:43,465
Hello.

552
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:47,487
One question I had was in regards to resisting the urge to grow.

553
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:52,008
One thing is that investors always want, you know, continual growth.

554
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:56,470
How do you push back against that without cutting off your source of funding?

555
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,251
Yeah, I mean, this is tricky.

556
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:01,412
This is definitely one of the places that we hit at the end, right?

557
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:07,494
It's like we just didn't have a good story to tell investors because we weren't interested in doing the things that would tell a good story to investors.

558
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:10,195
I think

559
00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:16,673
it's really important to go into investment with eyes open as to what that means.

560
00:54:17,874 --> 00:54:23,898
And I say eyes open to what that means in terms of what is the mechanism of control.

561
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:27,681
How does the board seat work in the example of an investor?

562
00:54:28,482 --> 00:54:30,103
How does the decision making work?

563
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:34,467
How can leaders be replaced under certain circumstances?

564
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:36,328
Who's actually in charge?

565
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:39,691
And I think investment where you lose control

566
00:54:41,889 --> 00:54:53,099
for me defeats a lot of the purpose of being an indie developer, but it's certainly appropriate for people who want to be on that exponential growth road for success or failure.

567
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:59,744
The interesting thing is, I've spent a lot of time beating myself up about running a studio for 10 years and then not.

568
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:05,329
In the investor tech startup space, that's the norm, right?

569
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:06,310
Take the money,

570
00:55:07,935 --> 00:55:09,778
ride it to the moon or fall off.

571
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:11,761
One's fine.

572
00:55:12,622 --> 00:55:13,824
If you miss, you miss.

573
00:55:14,084 --> 00:55:17,269
Everybody took a good shot and you try and fail fast and succeed fast.

574
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:22,397
And if you want to be in that world, then absolutely be in that world, but go in with eyes open.

575
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:28,725
I think we are more and more able to find investors who understand what games are.

576
00:55:29,385 --> 00:55:31,067
I don't know how this is going to shift.

577
00:55:31,087 --> 00:55:39,152
When interest rates were zero, investment models changed a lot and people were now suddenly just interested in getting a better than zero return on their money.

578
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:45,817
So you could find investors for games who had a really different approach and mentality than the ones that had previously been around.

579
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:59,128
But yeah, I'm not 100% sure where we sit now that the interest rates are bouncing back up and people are starting to want to bet on, tell me how this is going to explode and be worth 10 times as much.

580
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:04,029
Yeah, as I say, know what you're for.

581
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:05,610
Know if that's the ride you want to be on.

582
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:16,313
If that's not the ride you want to be on, find compassionate investors who understand that they're investing in a long-term proposition that can be a really great revenue raiser for a long time.

583
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:18,267
Thank you.

584
00:56:18,567 --> 00:56:18,888
Pleasure.

585
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:21,570
Anybody else?

586
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:22,190
Hey.

587
00:56:24,252 --> 00:56:27,255
Morgan, thank you for an amazing heartfelt talk.

588
00:56:27,295 --> 00:56:30,818
That was actually just what I needed to hear right now in this moment.

589
00:56:31,658 --> 00:56:39,045
My question for you is, was there a sweet spot size-wise where you were happiest with

590
00:56:42,726 --> 00:57:07,616
I can tell you my personal sweet spot and I think in a lot of ways this is the story of why my personal sweet spot isn't necessarily the best way to run a business because my personal sweet spot is around that 30 person team that's where I can have the most impact and influence that's where I can get the most done but it really pushes you into making a certain sort of game

591
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:23,877
And to find, you know, I spend a lot of time talking to very wise people who run very successful studios and, you know, Jamie Cheng at Clay always said to me, you are crazy putting all your eggs in one basket.

592
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:26,739
If you have a 30-person studio, you need three games.

593
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:31,981
You need to make much simpler games, you need to make more of them, you need to have the security and the backup of multiple partners.

594
00:57:33,382 --> 00:57:34,103
That's probably right.

595
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:36,786
Jamie's very smart.

596
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:53,446
So yeah, I think that's one of the takeaways for me is that the sweet spot and what I like to do and what I'm finding I'm most useful doing now with other studios is helping them around that transitional point.

597
00:57:53,906 --> 00:57:59,068
as they go from like 15 up to that 30 point because that's the place I'm comfortable.

598
00:57:59,548 --> 00:58:11,491
But I worked at Ubisoft back in the day on 300 person teams and got myself fired because I'm really bad at big company politics in that context.

599
00:58:14,505 --> 00:58:17,428
So yeah, I think it's important.

600
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:23,733
That is one thing I will say, is through all of this, I've learned where I like to be making games.

601
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:27,097
And it's not the same place that everybody I work with.

602
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:28,734
has, right?

603
00:58:28,854 --> 00:58:39,999
Like some people who worked for Defiant were on a journey where they really wanted to go work for a blizzard, for example, and they really wanted to be a part of that big team doing big things that get plastered on the side of buses.

604
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:47,302
And it's great, because those people got to work with us, fabulous contributors, and then move on to do great things.

605
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:51,143
I think everybody has their comfort space and their comfort zone.

606
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:55,345
So I know where mine is, and that's kind of where I try and lean in and be impactful now.

607
00:58:56,806 --> 00:58:57,926
But I also, you know,

608
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:03,125
I wouldn't try and build a 30-person studio just because I like making games for 30 people at the moment.

609
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:10,609
Ah, awesome.

610
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,531
Sorry, just one more.

611
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:13,971
No, excellent.

612
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:23,637
Yeah, so you talked about that transition from 15 to 30, which sounds, from my own experience, quite an interesting one.

613
00:59:23,877 --> 00:59:24,718
Yeah.

614
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,539
And I wondered if you had any kind of like

615
00:59:29,201 --> 00:59:33,883
specific bits of advice from your experiences about how to make that transition as smooth as possible.

616
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:38,085
Yeah, I mean, that's probably another full talk.

617
00:59:39,266 --> 00:59:43,928
So that's probably another full talk and I will say, hit me up anytime, I'm very happy to talk.

618
00:59:45,688 --> 00:59:55,373
But it's all about structures and frameworks with individual leadership in there versus people who know everybody and can get things done.

619
00:59:56,053 --> 00:59:57,794
So when you're a 15-person studio,

620
00:59:58,985 --> 01:00:07,087
you know everybody in the room, you know everybody's speciality, you know who's working on what, and you don't need a lot of structure to get results.

621
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:11,648
You just, somebody goes, oh, I'm gonna add this.

622
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,768
I know you're working on that, what's your take on that?

623
01:00:15,308 --> 01:00:17,329
And those things all happen very organically.

624
01:00:18,629 --> 01:00:27,971
As you get above that and hit the 30-40 kind of person team, you actually need to make sure that you've put formal structures in place that work horizontally and vertically.

625
01:00:28,669 --> 01:00:32,151
So when I say horizontally and vertically, I mean you might have a department that works together.

626
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:39,815
At Defiant, we used to have a writer's room of designers to break new content, talk about what we were doing.

627
01:00:40,856 --> 01:00:44,498
We would solve that problem collectively, but then one person would own it.

628
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:52,522
And that meant that not only did one person own it, but the whole design team could answer a question if somebody was like, hey, what the hell are you thinking with that one?

629
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,424
And we'd be like, oh, that's important because it ties into this thing.

630
01:00:56,195 --> 01:01:07,383
So we had that kind of horizontal knowledge across the design team, but then you make sure you have vertical knowledge as well by putting a designer, an artist, a programmer together on implementing this part and implementing this part.

631
01:01:07,883 --> 01:01:19,752
So by building that network, you build a really robust studio that can deal with the fact that no longer is it easy to just stand up and say, I know this bit is John's bit.

632
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:21,493
John, what's the deal with that?

633
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:25,176
So yeah, that's one of the elements.

634
01:01:25,216 --> 01:01:30,060
More structure, more structure, and people whose job it is just to make sure that people have meaningful work to do.

635
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:31,421
Like, that's the other thing.

636
01:01:32,392 --> 01:01:35,814
Again, this is where that talk of hats comes in.

637
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:41,457
Lots of people are really good individual contributors, and therefore they become leads.

638
01:01:42,418 --> 01:01:49,441
And then you have a lead who's like, oh yes, I'm also the best level designer, so I'm going to do this level because it's really important, so I'm going to get that done.

639
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:52,583
That is a guaranteed way to make sure they do a terrible job.

640
01:01:53,203 --> 01:02:00,808
So Dan and I were always famous for saying, you know, if you want something done badly and late,

641
01:02:01,704 --> 01:02:02,645
you can put it on our slate.

642
01:02:03,827 --> 01:02:05,830
Otherwise, somebody who knows what they're doing shouldn't.

643
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:07,893
We can do things.

644
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:13,841
We used to be great individual contributors, but yeah, bad and late is how we do it now.

645
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:14,762
Brilliant.

646
01:02:14,822 --> 01:02:15,363
Thank you very much.

647
01:02:17,921 --> 01:02:21,624
Hello, thank you so much for your talk, it was great.

648
01:02:23,705 --> 01:02:31,890
My question is, when the size of the studio grows, the administrative overhead grows.

649
01:02:36,774 --> 01:02:56,947
and usually the founders are creative directors, they are game designers and it's like you feel that you need to stop doing what you like the most, that is do game design, then stop doing creative direction and then you're on a business and you don't develop games anymore.

650
01:02:57,387 --> 01:03:02,010
It's people under you that will develop video games but not you.

651
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:05,253
I think that is extremely true and

652
01:03:06,373 --> 01:03:28,625
My answer to this now is different to my answer then My answer to this now is that that is what you should do you should stop being a creative director or a designer and you should be a person who grows creative directors and designers and That that actually is a terribly rewarding thing to do to help other people

653
01:03:29,386 --> 01:03:30,106
become great.

654
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:35,027
And trust me, a lot of them will become greater than you ever were.

655
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:38,128
But to do that, you need to let go.

656
01:03:39,088 --> 01:03:44,289
So it is so hard for us, particularly when we've built something from scratch, to let go.

657
01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:48,550
But I am freer now than I have ever been.

658
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:54,091
And that freedom came at the cost of the studio, but it didn't need to.

659
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:55,971
I could have just let go.

660
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:02,176
And if I had just let go, I could have been free a lot earlier.

661
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:17,147
It's amazing when you stop viewing yourself as indispensable and start viewing yourself as responsible for helping everybody else become indispensable.

662
01:04:19,595 --> 01:04:20,835
it's a really valuable shift.

663
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:26,178
So that's the best I can offer from the experience I've had, but God, I know it's hard.

664
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:31,400
So it's all I ever wanted to do, was be creative director on games.

665
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,621
Yeah, sorry.

666
01:04:35,682 --> 01:04:39,164
And I've had the chance to do it, and I had a great time.

667
01:04:39,724 --> 01:04:40,864
But I actually have other things I want to do.

668
01:04:42,165 --> 01:04:46,187
When I talk about becoming one-dimensional, don't let yourself become one-dimensional.

669
01:04:47,145 --> 01:04:49,366
We're big, complex, strange things.

670
01:04:49,726 --> 01:04:56,608
You have other projects in you that you will be free to do when you empower people to do those roles and take those jobs.

671
01:04:56,988 --> 01:04:59,248
And then your company runs like a real one.

672
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:03,550
But like I say, that was a hard pill for me to swallow.

673
01:05:05,438 --> 01:05:05,738
Thank you.

674
01:05:06,478 --> 01:05:14,340
I was thinking the same because in our case, we cannot afford not to grow because it's the only way to survive.

675
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:21,021
Because we had to offer work-for-care services, a lot of things just to keep the company running and don't crash down.

676
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:25,521
And we went from three people to 62 people in two years.

677
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:27,482
So it was very fast.

678
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:28,242
Very fast.

679
01:05:28,482 --> 01:05:34,603
And I felt that there were no people with the capabilities to take

680
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:36,184
responsibilities?

681
01:05:37,764 --> 01:05:42,507
The answer I have to that is that they will only ever be able to when you let them.

682
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:49,030
So you have to let go and you have to let go and they will drop some things and they won't do them as well as you.

683
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:55,273
And that's where you apply your creative direction skills to helping them and being a great mentor to them.

684
01:05:56,474 --> 01:05:59,355
I certainly, you know, I'm really sympathetic to that tale of growth.

685
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:03,277
We started as a work-for-hire studio so I understand where you're coming from.

686
01:06:04,437 --> 01:06:08,558
And yeah, as I say, I think it is important.

687
01:06:09,018 --> 01:06:12,019
It's also important for corporate resilience.

688
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:19,321
It's important to have multiple people who can sit in those roles and do those things in order to build a company that is strong and robust, as I didn't.

689
01:06:20,161 --> 01:06:32,804
So, you know, I definitely, as I say, a theme for the talk is advice, giving advice that I'm very poor at taking myself, but there is a great road on the other side.

690
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:34,379
Thank you.

691
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:34,980
Pleasure.

692
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:39,062
I think we are done.

693
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:40,443
We have to end there.

694
01:06:40,923 --> 01:06:42,884
Thank you so much for coming along.

695
01:06:43,184 --> 01:06:44,345
I really appreciate it.
