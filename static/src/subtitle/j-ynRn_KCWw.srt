1
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,172
Thank you all very much for coming out on Monday,

2
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:13,635
or Wednesday morning, sorry, to see my talk.

3
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:16,777
I'm super, super excited to share this with you.

4
00:00:16,837 --> 00:00:20,100
This is a project that I'm very, very passionate about.

5
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:25,544
And in particular, the journey that we've taken to get here

6
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:29,887
has been something that has had great successes

7
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,669
and great lessons learned along the way.

8
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:35,471
And I can't wait to share both with all of you.

9
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:41,440
Now the first thing I need to clarify is I only had so many words to fit the title of

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,064
the talk in, and the length of our, the name of our game is pretty long, and that took

11
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,765
up a lot of the words.

12
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:53,869
So the first thing I need to clarify is that there wasn't no specific game jam, you know,

13
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:56,632
this wasn't something that like we all went to TOjam and...

14
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:01,867
You know, spent the 48 hours and came up with a thing and then pitched it to Ubisoft and turned it into a game or something.

15
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:09,733
Rather, what we were trying to do was take inspiration from Game Jam techniques and Game Jam culture

16
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:17,859
and find a path to adapt that and scale that to AAA game development and the conception of a new AAA IP.

17
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:24,728
And a few months ago, I had the honor and privilege of announcing this IP to the world

18
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:30,012
at E3, where I got to go up and share the fruits of our labor with everyone.

19
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:35,436
And I couldn't be more proud of the work that the team has done to create this.

20
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:40,420
And I can't wait for, you know, we only gave a little snippet of what we're doing, and

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,621
I can't wait for everyone to see more.

22
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:50,528
This is an IP that has a lot of innovation throughout, and at the core of that is this

23
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:58,911
completely modular peripheral where you're able to add on wings and weapons and parts

24
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,913
and everything, and everything you add on is instantly recreated in the game, and it

25
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,393
totally changes the way that you play.

26
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:11,615
And so today I want to tell you about our journey and our story for how we got there.

27
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:19,798
How we tried to reinvent brainstorming and a typical conception process to come up with

28
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:20,799
the IP in the first place.

29
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,823
How we had some stumbles along the way as we tried to grow and expand that process.

30
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:37,650
And then how we had to regain our footing and re-find our balance to close out production and really bring everything back together.

31
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:45,236
But first I want to start with the fun and terrifying part of starting a new IP, which is the conception phase.

32
00:02:46,548 --> 00:02:50,256
And in order to tell this story, I've got to go way, way, way back to the beginning of the story,

33
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,989
which is the ending of another story of Splinter Cell Blacklist.

34
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,913
Splinter Cell Blacklist was the first project from the Ubisoft Toronto studio, and at the

35
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,296
time everyone at the studio had been working together to ship it.

36
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:11,721
And I had joined Ubisoft Toronto during the production of Blacklist, and we worked through

37
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,403
that and brought that to a close.

38
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:20,067
And at the end of that project, as with many studios, people start splitting up and going

39
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:21,609
on to separate things.

40
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:26,593
And particularly at Toronto, we went from one project to lots of projects really quick.

41
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:40,341
And since then, Toronto has been, has done many very successful collaborations on Far Cry Primal, Far Cry 4, Far Cry 5, Watch Dogs 2, Assassin's Creed Unity, you know, many of Ubisoft's biggest brands.

42
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:46,605
But at the time, we also were given a chance to try something new and crazy.

43
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:54,570
And I'm still not sure exactly how I lucked out and got this opportunity, but I was given the opportunity to take a very small group of people.

44
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:59,505
And we were given this mandate, it looked like this,

45
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:04,587
to basically come up with something new.

46
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:09,868
And as far as mandates go, this one was really wide open.

47
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:15,130
You know, explore innovative gameplay and next-gen hardware,

48
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,651
which at the time meant Xbox One and PS4,

49
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,432
with the goal of creating a mainstream concept for development.

50
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:22,633
So...

51
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:32,457
This is really a blank slate, and this kind of freedom is incredibly liberating and incredibly

52
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:39,239
terrifying because it is super, super challenging to know where to go, especially with very

53
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:43,540
limited resources when you have just this wide open space ahead of you.

54
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,661
So we formed a little...

55
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,053
prototyping group that we called Tomcat, I don't know why.

56
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:55,255
And it was eight people to start.

57
00:04:56,436 --> 00:05:02,861
Two artists, two programmers, two game designers, one animator, and a manager.

58
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,161
At this point I need to give a huge shout out. At the time we had two leads.

59
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:14,844
So it was myself, I was the manager, and we had a lead designer named James Everett. And he and I

60
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:20,206
really worked very closely together to come up with this process. So a huge shout out to him. He can't be here today, but

61
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,408
we worked really closely together on this process.

62
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,373
So we had this group of people, and these were a wonderful group of people who I thoroughly

63
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:36,096
enjoyed working with, but to be fair, we were kind of the island of misfit toys.

64
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,438
This was a group of people that...

65
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,394
You know, when all of the project selection and things came up,

66
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:47,315
and they were like, okay, do you want to work on, you know, the next big Far Cry thing,

67
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:49,916
or, you know, the next Assassin's Creed, or whatever it was.

68
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:53,997
These were the group of people that, you know, went dashing into the unknown,

69
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:58,038
and said, I want to do the thing that's called Tomcat, but otherwise we know nothing about.

70
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:04,343
And so, you know, it's a group of people that participated in a lot of game jams.

71
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:09,547
You know, we're really attracted by coming up with brand new things and iterating on that.

72
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:14,291
But it was also a group of people that really, you know, in many ways wanted to rebel

73
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:18,135
against the standard structure and process and way that we do things,

74
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,816
and way that things happen.

75
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:24,300
And so, you know, we wanted to just reinvent everything, tear up all the rules and do something crazy.

76
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:28,718
So we looked at how we would traditionally

77
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:31,819
go about coming up with a new IP as a starting point.

78
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,319
So we'd say, OK, well, we've got a bunch of people,

79
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,040
any people, so we'll all get in a room.

80
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,260
We'll brainstorm tons of ideas.

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,441
We'll put stuff up on the wall.

82
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:46,743
And then we'll all try to pick, or the leads will try to pick.

83
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,444
And we'll say, this is the best idea.

84
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:49,184
Let's do that.

85
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:51,084
We build a demo out of it.

86
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,665
And we polish that up and bring that to Paris and pitch it.

87
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:54,365
It'll be amazing.

88
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:55,706
It'll be awesome.

89
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:56,566
High five.

90
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,734
But when we looked at this process and the initial expectation,

91
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:07,180
we had four big problems that we saw,

92
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,984
that we didn't like about how this typical process works.

93
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:17,492
The first, we all kind of hated brainstorming.

94
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:19,795
In a traditional sense.

95
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:22,698
And one of the big problems that we have with brainstorming

96
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,543
is this effect of the loudest people in the room

97
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:29,865
and the loudest ideas resonating.

98
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:31,467
Not necessarily the best ideas.

99
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,130
Typically if you throw ten people in a room,

100
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,771
you say, okay, we're going to brainstorm this new thing.

101
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:39,415
Everyone gets talking and, you know,

102
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:44,277
You immediately start filtering down to three or four voices that are dominating this conversation,

103
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:46,338
and the ideas are mostly coming from them.

104
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:52,421
And there's a lot of people that have wonderful ideas that are going unheard because they're

105
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:58,444
being spoken over or they can't get the word in, or they're not comfortable jumping into

106
00:07:58,484 --> 00:07:59,004
that fray.

107
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,005
The second problem...

108
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,941
It's biased selection.

109
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,822
I've got two young kids right now.

110
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:10,846
And with two young kids, there's always these events

111
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:12,627
and holidays and things that roll around.

112
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:18,030
And you get a lot of these best dad in the world things.

113
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,412
And I think I'm a pretty good dad.

114
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:25,395
But statistically, best dad in the world

115
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:26,296
is probably a stretch.

116
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,639
And we had similar worries with

117
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:41,584
Our, James and I, you know, in a leadership role, with our biases affecting this process,

118
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:45,607
where if we were going in and ideas are cropping up and people are throwing stuff on the wall,

119
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:55,152
you know, we come from a very, you know, James and I both had kind of similar perspectives

120
00:08:55,233 --> 00:09:02,257
and similar interests, similar enough, you know, we came from similar backgrounds, and

121
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:11,858
You know, looking at that, we were really worried that this wasn't necessarily going to be the idea that resonated with a wider audience.

122
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:21,584
You know, the ideas that resonated to kind of two 30-something white guys who grew up in Canada would give us a fairly limited perspective and a limited selection.

123
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:23,565
The third problem.

124
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:25,779
Sounded good on paper.

125
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:31,387
Okay, big caveat, I do not want to insult any game designers out there.

126
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,689
I love game designers.

127
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:38,377
But I think the best game designers...

128
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:42,310
are kind of like the best batters in baseball, right?

129
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,632
And when you write a pitch on paper, you write a design down,

130
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,473
and you're like, okay, this is how this feature's gonna work,

131
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:49,273
it's gonna be amazing,

132
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:54,356
the best designers are probably batting at, you know,

133
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:57,437
a 40% success rate of that idea actually translating

134
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:59,559
into something that's really compelling and fun when you make it.

135
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,000
And more often than not, you know, once you take that design

136
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,081
that sounded great on paper and make it into...

137
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:09,025
A game, and you spend, you know, the months developing that feature,

138
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:12,489
you come back to it and you say, oh yeah, actually, we have to change that,

139
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,872
it was kind of flawed, or didn't work exactly as we expected.

140
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:18,696
And the fourth problem, which takes a little bit of explanation,

141
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:20,358
something called the secretary problem.

142
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:21,700
Quick show of hands, does anyone know what this...

143
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,528
Means, does anyone know what this is?

144
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:25,429
Navi knows.

145
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:30,255
So the secretary problem is a mathematical problem

146
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,678
with a kind of dated name.

147
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,544
And the secretary problem speaks to the challenge of

148
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:42,066
How to select the best sample from a data set

149
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:44,126
when you have to go through them linearly.

150
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:47,187
So the idea is, this kind of fictional scenario is,

151
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,887
you're trying to hire a secretary.

152
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,468
Secretaries are all different quality.

153
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:51,728
Some of them are great, some of them are bad.

154
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:54,688
And when you interview them,

155
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,629
you can assess the quality of that person.

156
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,229
But for whatever reason in this fictional scenario,

157
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:02,250
once you say no and reject that applicant,

158
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,450
they're gone forever and you can never call them back.

159
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:11,819
And so the challenge is, how many people do you interview before you take the next best one?

160
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,143
Right, if you interview two, three people, someone great comes along,

161
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,647
and you're like, oh, they seem good, let's just hire them.

162
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:22,232
How do you know that three people down the line, you wouldn't have someone much better?

163
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:27,876
And so we were really worried about this with our brainstorming and conception process.

164
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:30,477
We were brainstorming some ideas, some of them sounded cool,

165
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,119
you know, maybe we'd even make a prototype and that would be cool,

166
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,480
but how did we know that if we hadn't gone a couple more rounds,

167
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,561
we wouldn't have come up with something much more compelling?

168
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:45,624
So we had these four problems, and, you know, we looked at them and we said,

169
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,825
okay, let's, you know, how are we going to address these?

170
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:51,686
How are we going to change our process to try to mitigate this as best as we could?

171
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:57,731
So what we decided to do, one, we wanted to rethink the typical brainstorming process,

172
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,431
and I'll go through that in more detail in a second.

173
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,813
Second, we wanted to make it completely democratic and fair.

174
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:11,156
In order to use our tiny team, both as the idea generation and development,

175
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:16,598
but also as our smallest and easiest validation of the ideas,

176
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,280
we would have people vote on the best ideas,

177
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,161
and make it a completely fair and democratic process.

178
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,541
Third, we'd prototype as many things as possible.

179
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:30,784
In order to validate that what sounded fun on paper

180
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:33,786
actually was a compelling idea,

181
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:37,628
we would rapidly prototype as many things as possible

182
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,929
to validate their success.

183
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,111
And fourth, once we had those prototypes,

184
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:46,493
once we had that, no matter how compelling they were,

185
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:52,264
We would put it aside, success or failure, and completely restart from scratch with a

186
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:53,125
new batch of ideas.

187
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:57,728
And we would do that for a period of time that we kind of figured out based on our schedule.

188
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:02,891
And at the end of that, we'd look back over everything and say, OK, out of all this time,

189
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:06,533
what were the ideas, what were the best ideas that we came up with during that period?

190
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:11,877
So once we had those solutions, we split this into a plan.

191
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:15,718
We had a two-week schedule where we would brainstorm,

192
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,679
pitch, vote, plan, and then the second week we'd prototype.

193
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,800
And then rinse, repeat, go right back to the beginning.

194
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:25,421
And the first chunk of that is brainstorming.

195
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:27,242
So for us, we had this challenge.

196
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:30,503
Okay, how do we reinvent?

197
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,403
How do we do a better job with brainstorming?

198
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:37,345
The first problem we had was this wide-open mandate.

199
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,702
You know, how the heck are we going to ask people to brainstorm?

200
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:42,403
We're like, okay, group of people, go away.

201
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:43,785
Just come up with anything.

202
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:44,886
I don't know, like what are you into?

203
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:47,169
Are you into RPGs, MMOs?

204
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,471
You know, just throw some ideas out there,

205
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,833
because our mandate could be anything.

206
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,516
So, you know, we had to give some focus to that.

207
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:58,080
We had to get some clarity as to where people should focus their brainstorming.

208
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,521
What problem were they trying to solve?

209
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:03,984
And so, you know, we worked on this idea of a guiding question.

210
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,187
It had to be an open-ended question, we didn't want to force people into a corner,

211
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,289
but we wanted this kind of open-ended guiding question

212
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,592
that could help clarify and give them a direction to go in.

213
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,133
So some examples of these questions.

214
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:19,396
What game would you create where the primary mechanic is collaboration?

215
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,262
What E for Everyone game would you create with 10,000 simultaneous AI or human characters?

216
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:33,027
What exploration-based game could only be accomplished on a living room console with

217
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:33,527
a peripheral?

218
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:37,530
And there was a number of these different ideas and different questions that we put

219
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:37,870
out there.

220
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:44,715
One of my personal favorites that I didn't put up here was, what's a game that could

221
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,937
evoke a sense of discovery and wonder?

222
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:51,240
What would be a primary mechanic that could evoke a sense of discovery and wonder in players?

223
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:59,970
So, once we had these questions, we had to set about brainstorming those.

224
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:04,054
And the first thing that we did to combat this problem of the loudest person in the

225
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:09,880
room was we scaled the brainstorming way down to the smallest it could be with one person.

226
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,274
We'd start the first day of the week, this is Monday,

227
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:15,516
we've got the question out, first thing,

228
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:19,379
and everyone goes off alone to think about that question

229
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:21,520
and to brainstorm on their own.

230
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:24,142
And they could do a little bit of research, check things out,

231
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,184
but they had the whole morning of the first day,

232
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:30,987
and we tasked everyone with writing down 25

233
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:36,291
compelling game ideas based on that question.

234
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,321
And this doesn't sound too difficult, right?

235
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:40,521
25 is not that big of a number.

236
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:43,943
I assure you if you try to go through the exercise,

237
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,764
it's much more challenging than you would think.

238
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:49,206
You tend to get through 10, 15 ideas.

239
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:50,426
You're like, yeah, this is easy.

240
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:51,527
I am laughing.

241
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:52,827
This is awesome.

242
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:54,568
And then you get up to like 16, 17.

243
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:57,210
You're like, OK, these are a bit of a stretch.

244
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,831
And by the time you're at like 21, 22, 23, you hit 25,

245
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,012
and you are like, that is it.

246
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:10,156
This is the sum total of all possible human creativity about this subject.

247
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:14,359
There are no other ideas imaginable that could answer this question.

248
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,100
I've got them all.

249
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,861
I am tapped out.

250
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:20,844
And when people hit that point, we pair them up.

251
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:26,507
And all of a sudden, you meet someone else from your team who's also done the same exercise,

252
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,008
coming up with 25 ideas.

253
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,350
And lo and behold, somehow...

254
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,946
They've come up with a completely different set of 25 than you have.

255
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:37,333
Oh, they saw this problem from a totally different perspective.

256
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:38,797
They were coming at this from a different angle.

257
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:41,062
I didn't even think of interpreting it like that.

258
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,181
And so these two people would meet up, they'd share their ideas, they'd discuss their ideas,

259
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:50,282
and the remarkable thing is that now both people are invigorated,

260
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:54,083
they are suddenly seeing a different perspective that they never even thought of approaching this problem from.

261
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:58,684
And together as a pair, they're tasked with coming up with an additional 25 ideas,

262
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,284
riffing off inspiration from each other,

263
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:05,845
you know, suddenly opening up entire new avenues of thought that neither of them considered,

264
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:08,486
but, you know, once they saw the angle that each of them came from,

265
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:09,966
it would open up this possibility.

266
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:16,487
So by the end of the first day, each pair would have 75 ideas.

267
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,471
Day two, we do it again.

268
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:21,852
We take the pairs.

269
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:22,753
We pair them up.

270
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:24,614
So now we have groups of four.

271
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,558
They share the 150 ideas that they came up

272
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:29,799
with the previous day.

273
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,041
And they start riffing.

274
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,822
And as a group, now they're coming up with another 25.

275
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,209
Afternoon, now we bring everyone in.

276
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,111
And we literally have hundreds of ideas.

277
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:44,653
When any individual couldn't possibly think

278
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:47,575
of more than 25, now the whole team is empowered

279
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,577
with a set of hundreds of ideas

280
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:51,258
answering this open-ended question

281
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,719
from which they can draw from.

282
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:58,203
And then the last step is to scale all the way back down.

283
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:03,327
Right back down to single, solo work.

284
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:08,723
Where each individual had two full days to take those hundreds of ideas,

285
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:12,185
to take all of that huge possibility space,

286
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:15,147
and condense that down into three pitches.

287
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:18,289
Three slides each, five minutes each,

288
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:22,731
that were, you know, fleshing some of those ideas out

289
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:27,113
into something that they thought was a compelling and cohesive game pitch.

290
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,128
So they distill all of that info down.

291
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:33,051
And at the end of day Thursday, we'd get everyone

292
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,533
together in a room.

293
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:36,214
And it was very fun.

294
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:37,295
We had kind of a pitch day.

295
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:41,660
And everyone had their five minutes to go up, or five

296
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,603
minutes per, to go up and present their pitches, present

297
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:46,084
their ideas.

298
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:49,467
And it was amazing seeing even the ideas that you had seen in

299
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,049
very early stages.

300
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:57,628
At a brainstorming level, you know, once people had really put thought in and attached images

301
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:04,353
and kind of put some work in to put that into a cohesive and fleshed out pitch, it was absolutely

302
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,715
incredible seeing these just dozens and dozens of

303
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:13,201
Amazing game pitches come together and I still think there are a treasure trove, you know,

304
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:17,666
going back through our old files of so many games that I would love to make at some point in the

305
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:23,993
future. Incredibly creative and diverse ideas that, you know, we would never have gotten

306
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,074
through a traditional process.

307
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:28,036
Once we had these pitches, everyone voted.

308
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:30,157
We did this very simply.

309
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:34,519
We just gave everyone three little circle sticky things.

310
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:36,380
And everyone went up and voted.

311
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,561
As people were pitching, we'd write them down on the board.

312
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:43,103
And people could go up and vote on the ones that they wanted.

313
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:52,389
Now one improvement to this, this process is actually being taken and replicated over at Magic Leap in New Zealand,

314
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,252
where James Everett, who was the original designer, has gone to, the lead designer.

315
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:57,333
And...

316
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:03,196
One of the improvements that they made, one of the iterations that they made on this process

317
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:11,660
was to make the votes silent because you know you get some pattern of people looking at what

318
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,323
other people are voting on and and steering that. We didn't do that when we did it originally and

319
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:20,064
I think it worked well but you know it may have just been the way that our

320
00:20:20,904 --> 00:20:27,367
that our group was structured and that we were going up. So everyone would vote and

321
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:33,276
After we'd voted, we'd have three top voted pitches.

322
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:35,537
Now, many times these three top voted pitches

323
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:38,418
actually came from four or five pitches.

324
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:41,019
It's really strange the way that kind of zeitgeist works.

325
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,601
People have the same set of raw ideas that they're drawing from

326
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,582
and sometimes you get pitches that, you know,

327
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:48,902
were going in a similar direction.

328
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,603
So rather than say like, oh, this one got slightly more votes,

329
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:53,664
we'd say those two pitches were pretty much along the same lines.

330
00:20:53,704 --> 00:20:54,405
Let's merge them.

331
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:57,206
You know, let's combine the cool elements of both

332
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:58,506
and turn that into one thing.

333
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:03,370
But essentially we'd boil it down to three winning pitches each time.

334
00:21:04,591 --> 00:21:07,473
And from there, everyone would submit their preferences of like,

335
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:09,054
hey, I'd love to work on prototyping.

336
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:12,039
This pitch or that pitch in order.

337
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,500
And we'd look and it was a very small team,

338
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,202
so we had to just make some decisions and break it up.

339
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:22,225
And each person would end up joining a small group

340
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:26,027
of two, three people, as we grew maybe three, four,

341
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:28,909
five people to work on a prototype.

342
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:32,791
And we made three prototypes in a week, every two weeks.

343
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:41,414
So we'd have one day, the Friday of that week, to break into those groups, sit down, start

344
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:49,117
talking, start talking about how the heck in a week can we possibly prototype.

345
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:50,358
These were big game ideas.

346
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:50,818
These were like...

347
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:56,619
Not a mini-game, these were pitches for something that could be a AAA game.

348
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,061
And so, you know, in a week, how do you get down, how do you boil down to the essence of that idea?

349
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:05,082
And how do you validate that in the most efficient manner possible?

350
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:07,483
And there is never any extra time.

351
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:09,344
Literally, there is only a week, that's it.

352
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:10,204
That's what you have to do.

353
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:18,769
So people would kind of come up with a plan, and then in the afternoon we'd run those plans by the other groups, get some feedback, get some validation.

354
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:27,215
Often you'd have suggestions for, hey, maybe you could use this technology, maybe there's this tool you could use, did you know that this was out there, that would be helpful.

355
00:22:28,396 --> 00:22:32,339
And then we had a week to validate by any means necessary.

356
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:36,633
We used different engines.

357
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:39,114
We used different tech that was available.

358
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:43,676
We made paper prototypes or acted things out

359
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:46,858
or did anything we possibly could to prove this out.

360
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:52,461
And again, this was a wonderful process.

361
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:54,102
It was a mad dash.

362
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:55,522
It was very, uh...

363
00:22:56,443 --> 00:23:02,429
Intense for a week making all of these games and this resulted in all sorts of wild and wacky

364
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:06,653
prototypes across all sorts of different technologies and genres and things and

365
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,155
lots of crazy stuff

366
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:17,883
AR and and mobile things and whatever. I don't even know what was going on here. This is

367
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,591
I'm sure it was a ton of fun.

368
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:26,679
And these photos were from something, I mostly put them in just to embarrass these people

369
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:28,401
that they were in my GDC presentation.

370
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:34,068
Yeah, these games were amazing, I'm sure.

371
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:37,644
Anyways, we came up with all sorts of crazy prototypes.

372
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:43,190
One of those prototypes was actually really cool, and I'll show you a quick video of it.

373
00:23:45,272 --> 00:23:49,176
It was a game where you could, it was used to connect and you could kind of make these

374
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:51,558
silhouette paintings with your body.

375
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,480
and capture them, and it was kind of a Pictionary kind of thing, right, people would guess.

376
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:58,642
And, you know, this was something that we didn't think,

377
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:01,383
okay, maybe this isn't something we're going to turn into a big AAA game.

378
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:04,004
But we actually had a chance to show it to the world.

379
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:08,306
There's an all-night festival called Nuit Blanche in Toronto.

380
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:12,467
And so we went and projected it up on the side of a seven-story building

381
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:14,588
and had everyone come out and play it. It was super cool.

382
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,463
After we did all this prototyping, we'd all get together, big group, play all these games,

383
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:28,526
have a ton of fun, and give this really open and honest feedback on what worked, what didn't.

384
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,145
The power of this feeling of fairness, because it was this democratic process, you know,

385
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:42,351
everyone had been voting, there wasn't one idea selected because, you know, the lead

386
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:45,174
said this is the one we're going to go, this is the direction I want to go in.

387
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:50,479
Everyone felt like it was a fair playing field where each of them had contributed to that.

388
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:54,903
And that had an incredible effect on people's willingness to step up.

389
00:24:56,425 --> 00:25:01,850
You know, give their honest thoughts on what was working, what they were excited about, what fell through.

390
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:05,714
And I think this is something that you actually see a lot in game jam culture as well.

391
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:11,700
You know, this incredibly open and transparent and honest feedback and assessment.

392
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:22,330
I think it's a really positive part of that community that oftentimes we miss out and we get a little bit wrapped up in politics and, you know, power politics in larger development.

393
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:29,938
After all that, we went for a while, we had dozens of prototypes,

394
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,460
and we reached that point where we were like,

395
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,141
okay, we really need to decide what we're going to do.

396
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,822
And so we took a step back and we looked through.

397
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:41,865
Keeping in mind that secretary problem, we had really given it a good run.

398
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,846
We had a bunch of stuff that we could select from.

399
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:48,889
And we looked back, and out of everything, one prototype really stood out.

400
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,171
It looked like this.

401
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:54,193
It had humble origins.

402
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:58,935
It was a Wiimote, kind of taped to a consumer electronics

403
00:25:58,995 --> 00:26:02,177
board with building blocks and copper wire stuck to it.

404
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:04,198
But it worked.

405
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:05,759
And we made a demo.

406
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,441
You could fly around in space and grab asteroids and do neat things.

407
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:15,302
And it was a very rudimentary prototype.

408
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:18,143
You had to be careful not to make it fall apart as you were playing with it.

409
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:21,824
But we started to show it to some people.

410
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,345
And it was really, really cool.

411
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:25,185
They'd come and play it.

412
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:28,746
And people started filling in all of the missing parts.

413
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:30,627
I didn't play that video with audio.

414
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:31,587
But people started coming.

415
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:36,230
You know, adding in, they'd make their own sound effects and they'd come and, you know,

416
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,992
pshew, whoosh.

417
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:43,134
And, you know, everything that wasn't there from this prototype that we had built in a week,

418
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,836
people could imagine it and they could see the potential.

419
00:26:47,477 --> 00:26:52,240
And we also started to meet a bunch of people from the studio who came up and said,

420
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:52,481
hey.

421
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,607
I could help make this a reality.

422
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:59,270
You know, I don't know if you know, but I have a background in X.

423
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,132
You know, people that had worked in industrial design.

424
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,455
There's one guy in particular that we met named Vlad.

425
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:10,299
And Vlad came up to me at the company barbecue.

426
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,385
And he has a very kind of blunt way of speaking many times.

427
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,487
And Vlad came up and basically said,

428
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:21,388
You're doing this all wrong.

429
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:23,892
This is horrible.

430
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:25,673
I can fix it.

431
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:29,615
And he said, I have to show you something.

432
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:31,316
And so we went to see.

433
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:39,141
And Vlad had scratch built this custom drone with head

434
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:41,943
tracked cameras and a crazy thing.

435
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:45,665
And this is scratch built down to his own chemically etched

436
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:46,685
circuit boards and things.

437
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:49,947
And he was like, I know how to do this.

438
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:51,128
I know how to do this stuff.

439
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:56,474
It's a shame the video that I had cut off there, this drone had like vertical take-off

440
00:27:56,514 --> 00:28:00,218
and then would rotate and turn into an aerofoil and fly like a jet and it was just really cool.

441
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,003
So Vlad came on board and, you know, started...

442
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:10,406
redoing everything that we had stumbled our way through for this prototype.

443
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:15,328
And other people on the team started, you know, all of these skill sets started coming out.

444
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:17,769
People that worked with industrial design and...

445
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:23,232
And at the time we had this idea of building a custom game controller for the thing.

446
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:28,774
That's how we would interface with the toys and, you know, kind of a flight stick idea.

447
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:33,817
And so we started working and this was the next prototype that we had built.

448
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:36,378
So, you know, still pretty rudimentary.

449
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:38,318
It was heavy, it was big, it was clunky.

450
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:44,701
But it was a major step up from our kind of building block and copper wire thing.

451
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,062
It was much sturdier.

452
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:47,843
It used a...

453
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:54,449
micro USB connectors to connect everything, which, you know, USB-C just can't come fast

454
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:54,709
enough.

455
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,611
I absolutely despise those connectors.

456
00:28:58,331 --> 00:29:02,854
But they worked, and they got the data across, the thing, you know, you could play it, and,

457
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:10,198
you know, we knew who we were making this game for, and I'll never forget the moment

458
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:13,360
that we brought in the first group of kids, and we gave them this thing.

459
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:18,946
to play with, and just, you know, the looks on their faces,

460
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:23,347
their eyes lit up, their jaws dropped.

461
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:25,687
And this was a rough, you know,

462
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:27,788
this was a very rudimentary prototype.

463
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:29,508
It was heavy, it was clunky,

464
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:32,629
but you could just see this magic

465
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:37,130
that it was something that they absolutely fell in love with.

466
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,231
And so we knew we were onto something special,

467
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:41,271
and we took this game.

468
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:46,157
And we brought it to Ubisoft's HQ in Paris

469
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:46,977
and we presented it.

470
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:49,879
And it went super well.

471
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,019
They were really happy, the pitch went well,

472
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:52,780
they were excited.

473
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,881
And we showed a little bit of all these crazy

474
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:57,701
prototypes and things we'd built.

475
00:30:01,003 --> 00:30:03,864
We got a green light, and so that moves us

476
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:05,184
into the next phase of our story,

477
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:06,865
which is pre-production.

478
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:10,766
So coming back from our successful pitch,

479
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:11,906
we were feeling great.

480
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:15,503
We started to grow the team, expand the team, bring people on.

481
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:20,424
And we were feeling amazing, on top of the world.

482
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:22,665
We were like, this is it, we're kicking ass.

483
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,805
We threw out all of the old process.

484
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:27,466
We did this crazy new experiment.

485
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,826
It was super successful.

486
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:33,448
So we felt vindicated for trying to do things differently.

487
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:38,109
And we were incredibly overambitious, super audacious.

488
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:39,869
We were like, we're gonna do everything at this point,

489
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:41,250
just, you know.

490
00:30:42,616 --> 00:30:44,437
Who thought we could do anything to do with hardware?

491
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:48,780
This'll be awesome, just throw more crazy stuff on the pile.

492
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,043
And, you know, but we still knew that we were a new team,

493
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:55,305
we were a small team, and we needed to prove ourselves.

494
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:58,267
So we set about making a vertical slice.

495
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:00,488
You know, we fully recognized that the little demo

496
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:02,730
that we showed to kids, you know,

497
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,051
that was never something that could have shipped.

498
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,913
It was, you know, a hacky kind of little demo

499
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:07,673
that made something work.

500
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:10,858
So we set out to prove that we could do this for real.

501
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:15,592
We could make a game and make a toy that looked and felt like something that could go to market.

502
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:21,442
And so, you know, filled with energy, filled with enthusiasm, we charged into this,

503
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:24,704
and it started going pretty well.

504
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:27,466
This is our next iteration.

505
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:28,666
Those are the connectors.

506
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:31,008
So we got rid of those horrible micro USB connectors,

507
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:34,570
and we made these really neat connectors that we'd click together and they'd work,

508
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:38,053
and, you know, have this really instantaneous connection to the game.

509
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,655
And, you know, we made our first real toys.

510
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:44,877
These are some of the early...

511
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,163
You know, the first version of real-looking toys that we made.

512
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,907
We started to bring on some people from the toy industry that knew what they were doing.

513
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:58,874
We started working with model shops and people that could, you know, really make...

514
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:01,819
Proper professional toy prototypes.

515
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,741
And we made these toys, they looked really cool.

516
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,784
You know, they had problems, there's certainly usability things.

517
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:13,069
I have gained an immense amount of respect for toy designers and toy industry and everything that they do.

518
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:21,136
And so, you know, you'd move these toys and the wings, you know, would kind of fall off because these connectors were great, but didn't really have anything that would latch or connect.

519
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:23,938
And we built a demo.

520
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:27,851
This was our first vertical slice demo.

521
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,693
And, you know, it was really coming together.

522
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,815
It was something that was a big step forward

523
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:36,438
from, you know, the little prototypes that we had made.

524
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,600
It was pretty neat.

525
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,640
You'd start out in space,

526
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:42,324
kind of take off from this mothership,

527
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:44,626
and, uh...

528
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:46,803
Eventually launch.

529
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:49,446
And then you'd arrive out in space,

530
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:51,488
and there was kind of these different levels

531
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:53,951
that you could select down on the planet's surface,

532
00:32:54,191 --> 00:32:55,192
these different linear levels.

533
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:56,453
And you could look at one of these gates

534
00:32:56,513 --> 00:32:57,815
and say, oh, I want to do that.

535
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,698
And then you transition down to the surface.

536
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:01,759
There was a loading sequence.

537
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,602
And you'd engage on whatever mission it was.

538
00:33:04,662 --> 00:33:06,904
So in this example, it was a race.

539
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,366
And you'd go and start engaging that.

540
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:13,232
It was pretty cool, and everything you do on the toy would be instantly recreated,

541
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:18,557
and you could add all these weapons or boosters or things that could change the gameplay.

542
00:33:20,219 --> 00:33:24,383
And so we made this demo, we're feeling great, we're like on top of the world, kicking ass.

543
00:33:25,224 --> 00:33:28,348
We bring it back and we're like, okay, here's where we're at, this is our vertical slice, it's awesome.

544
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:32,763
And that's when we realized, OK, this is starting to get real.

545
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:34,484
We're playing in a bit of a different league.

546
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:36,864
There's real money on the table.

547
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:38,245
We're building a bigger team here.

548
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:41,926
The stakes are a lot higher, and the expectations

549
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:42,546
are a lot higher.

550
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:45,647
It's no longer good enough just to have something

551
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,287
that's a cool idea, a compelling demo.

552
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,888
And we start hearing all of this feedback of, really?

553
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:53,229
You guys making a custom controller?

554
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:56,330
Do you know how long Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo

555
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,750
spend on making a controller?

556
00:33:59,064 --> 00:33:59,724
A pretty big endeavor.

557
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:02,726
And you know, the engine that you're working with,

558
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,647
I'm not sure you're going to ship with that.

559
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:07,728
And the game structure, and player engagement,

560
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:11,450
and play time, and world logic, and all these things

561
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,431
that you need to figure out for building a new IP.

562
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:17,813
You know, really real, valid things

563
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:22,316
that we were just kind of rushing through with vim

564
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,636
and vigor.

565
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:26,248
But in addition to all of these external things,

566
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:29,611
we started having these voices cropping up within our team,

567
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:35,115
saying, hey guys, I think maybe we should take a step back

568
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:37,757
and kind of plan this out properly

569
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:39,819
and figure out what our scope is.

570
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:45,304
This process is cool, but it's a bit chaotic.

571
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:47,386
This is a bit seat of our pants, right?

572
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,988
We should really document this, do all of this.

573
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:52,730
And at this point, we had two paths ahead of us.

574
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,299
We had a big choice.

575
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,561
We could thoroughly document, you know, scope it out,

576
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,282
rigorous process, analyze requests.

577
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,643
This is how, you know, Ubisoft has proven

578
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:06,283
these processes out.

579
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:07,543
This is how we make games.

580
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:10,264
You know, people have figured this out.

581
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:13,265
We've got Jira and Confluence,

582
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,566
and yeah, we can like really button this down.

583
00:35:16,606 --> 00:35:19,547
You have to remember that this group of people

584
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:20,528
making this thing,

585
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,802
Kind of all pulled together specifically to rebel against this kind of process, right?

586
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:28,203
It was kind of a group of people that were specifically like,

587
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:33,966
ah, you know, to us this was the boring and slow, but you know, maybe sensible,

588
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:38,988
but boring and slow path that, you know, that we wanted to go away from.

589
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:41,730
And so to us, we saw another choice.

590
00:35:43,551 --> 00:35:44,191
More innovation.

591
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:50,274
No matter what challenge came up, we could always solve it with more innovation.

592
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:57,712
And there's two guys that I wished I had paid more attention to, in retrospect.

593
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:00,955
Their names are Abraham Maslow and Vilfredo Pareto.

594
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:04,378
Does anyone know what Maslow is, what I'm referring to in this case?

595
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,241
Hierarchy of Needs.

596
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:13,185
No, not the Hierarchy of Needs. He is very famous for the Hierarchy of Needs.

597
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,088
But not that, thank you for playing into my GDC presentation thing.

598
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:22,669
Specifically, I am talking about Maslow's hammer,

599
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:25,330
or the expression that when you have a hammer,

600
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:27,372
everything looks like a nail.

601
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:33,215
And Vilfredo Pareto is famous for the Pareto Principle,

602
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,456
or the 80-20 rule.

603
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:38,019
The principle that 20% of the effort

604
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,620
will yield 80% of the results,

605
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,441
and that final 20% of the results that you need

606
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,002
actually comes from 80% of the effort.

607
00:36:47,056 --> 00:36:47,916
Because we had a hammer.

608
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,977
And that hammer was more innovation.

609
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:54,518
The whole process that we had created

610
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,379
was effectively an innovation machine.

611
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,540
And so no matter what feedback came up,

612
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,040
no matter what challenge came up,

613
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,061
we could innovate our way out of that problem.

614
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,162
So too expensive and difficult to create a custom game

615
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:09,622
controller.

616
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:15,187
No problem. We'll make a controller mount that interfaces directly with the extension port

617
00:37:15,848 --> 00:37:21,593
of all of the first-party controllers, allowing you to communicate instantly through their

618
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:25,897
hardware and leveraging all of that work in a way that no one's done before.

619
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:31,533
More powerful tech? No problem. We'll take Ubisoft's latest and greatest engine, Snowdrop,

620
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:39,560
and port everything over and leverage that work with an engine that is amazingly powerful,

621
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:45,586
but at the time hadn't really been fully proven out and was still being used on the Division.

622
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:49,369
More freedom and autonomy? No problem.

623
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:54,120
We'll create tech to allow you to seamlessly travel from space to planets, planets to space,

624
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,682
circumnavigate around worlds in a completely open and seamless manner.

625
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:05,966
More meaningful choices? No problem.

626
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:10,628
We'll simulate every single AI on every single planet simultaneously,

627
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:15,810
allowing the players to have real impact on the planets.

628
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:22,496
and allowing the enemy to fight back so that no two players will have the same story

629
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:24,338
and everyone's game will go in a different direction.

630
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:29,784
And, you know, we didn't stop there.

631
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:33,908
No matter what came up, there was something new.

632
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:38,152
We had crazy three-dimensional elemental propagation throughout the game.

633
00:38:38,252 --> 00:38:43,898
We had second screen experiences and planet creation at some point, ill advise.

634
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,843
We wanted to build laser tag into the toy.

635
00:38:47,983 --> 00:38:49,805
I still kind of miss this idea, it would have been really cool.

636
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:58,322
But we were really going out there, and we made all of this stuff, and we took a step

637
00:38:58,362 --> 00:39:00,303
back, and we were like, OK, where are we at?

638
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:02,205
It worked.

639
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:03,986
These were cool prototypes.

640
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,327
They were amazing ideas.

641
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:06,808
And they worked.

642
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:12,372
We had this team that could make these crazy innovations functional and prove them out

643
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:13,313
quickly and...

644
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:16,455
Except for the other 80% of the work.

645
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:20,107
that it would have taken to actually make those features.

646
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,591
We had quickly gotten them to these 80% states of like,

647
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,333
yeah, yeah, yeah, that's cool, that works.

648
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:29,218
And when we started to take a step back and look at it,

649
00:39:30,379 --> 00:39:33,583
we were like, oh no, we made a huge mistake.

650
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:40,270
And I'm not quite sure how all of these separate pieces were supposed to fit together.

651
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:47,112
You know, individually they were all really neat innovations, but they weren't adding up to create a sum that was greater than the...

652
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:49,073
a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts.

653
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:57,055
And so, you know, we started to realize, okay, you know, this process that was amazing for conception,

654
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:02,777
that was incredibly effective during the conception phase, I don't know if this is scaling in the way that we hoped it would.

655
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:12,570
And while there were some of these features that were really groundbreaking and revolutionary

656
00:40:12,991 --> 00:40:18,957
and are still huge components of the game today, you know, this controller mount right

657
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:23,321
at your fingertips instantly swapping out and the seamless travel and this incredible

658
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,002
living world.

659
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:30,345
So many more of the features ended up having to be cut and cast aside,

660
00:40:30,946 --> 00:40:36,729
and we wasted a lot of time and effort trying to innovate our way out of every problem,

661
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:39,450
which we could have solved in a much better manner.

662
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:45,422
And for me, this was really a moment, stepping back,

663
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,765
and it was kind of this shattering of the reality distortion field.

664
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:51,508
Engineers at Apple used to speak about

665
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:54,610
something they called the reality distortion field,

666
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:57,393
where the charisma of Steve Jobs

667
00:40:58,134 --> 00:41:04,002
I could convince people that the impossible was possible and that no matter what problem

668
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:09,931
they faced, even when you couldn't push the silicon to do that, he could will it to happen

669
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:12,535
and they would pull a group of people together and make it so.

670
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:17,338
And, you know, honestly in the early phases of this project we felt like that.

671
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:21,939
We felt like, okay, you know, no matter what happens, we've got this process, it's working.

672
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,141
We will just will it to make it so, make it happen.

673
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:30,103
And, you know, it was when we stood back and looked at this and said,

674
00:41:31,063 --> 00:41:34,624
okay, we're never going to ship this. It's not going to come together.

675
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:39,586
You know, for me this was really this kind of low point of reflection.

676
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:41,287
And that

677
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:43,839
Brought us right into the beginning of production.

678
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,463
With this question, how in the hell are we gonna ship this?

679
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:51,785
How are we gonna make this,

680
00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:54,747
how are we gonna fix this process?

681
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:57,049
We had all of these incredibly powerful

682
00:41:57,129 --> 00:41:58,650
and compelling parts.

683
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:01,452
How are we gonna pull them together into a whole?

684
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:06,896
A little voice.

685
00:42:09,598 --> 00:42:11,180
We can solve it with more innovation.

686
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,470
We kind of realized, you know, maybe, maybe not.

687
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:19,612
Maybe that was, in fact, part of the problem

688
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:22,253
that had gotten us into this situation.

689
00:42:23,553 --> 00:42:25,634
In Ed Catmull's excellent book, Creativity Inc.,

690
00:42:26,354 --> 00:42:28,595
he talks about the importance of balance

691
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:30,516
and the importance of conflict

692
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:33,217
between all of the departments in a creative enterprise

693
00:42:33,777 --> 00:42:35,078
to maintain that balance.

694
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:37,398
And when we took a step back and looked,

695
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:42,120
we realized that our development was horribly unbalanced.

696
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:50,759
And I want to clarify that this was not specific disciplines fighting against each other.

697
00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:57,024
This was not game designers wanting innovation and programmers saying no.

698
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:03,793
You know, this was really guiding philosophies, and we had game designers pushing for, you

699
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:08,835
know, more scope control and bringing things down to a more elegant solution.

700
00:43:09,115 --> 00:43:10,956
We had programmers pushing for more innovation.

701
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:15,858
You know, these were these kind of competing philosophies, but what we realized was that

702
00:43:15,898 --> 00:43:20,560
the philosophy of innovation as solution was massively...

703
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,781
Unbalanced and overweighted.

704
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:28,102
And we had to take a step back and some of those voices that had been there within our team earlier,

705
00:43:29,502 --> 00:43:34,963
we had to put things in place to empower those voices and listen to those voices.

706
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:40,324
You know, people in tech saying, OK, hey, it's great that we have these wonderful innovations,

707
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:44,625
but we need to balance that out with safer solutions, with proven solutions,

708
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:47,585
in order to protect the innovations and make them really sing.

709
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:50,046
People in production saying, hey, we can help.

710
00:43:50,786 --> 00:43:55,150
make this scope more manageable, we can help address the timeline and adjust the timeline

711
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,371
to make this a realistic endeavor.

712
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:02,315
In business, saying, you know, we can help validate this offer, we can help validate

713
00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:07,820
which parts of this are really resonating, really pinpoint the audience and their expectations.

714
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:12,804
Every GDC talk has to have some sort of cheesy analogy, so this is mine.

715
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:15,086
I think of this as...

716
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:23,283
trying to protect a spark, protect a flame, and grow it into a fire.

717
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:30,109
And early on, too much process and too much innovation and too much structure can snuff

718
00:44:30,149 --> 00:44:32,090
that out, can, you know, really...

719
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:38,591
squander and kill ideas way too early.

720
00:44:39,431 --> 00:44:41,692
And again, in Creativity Inc.,

721
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:45,114
he talks about protecting ugly babies.

722
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:47,235
That often these early prototypes

723
00:44:47,255 --> 00:44:49,075
that you're making with a couple people in a couple days,

724
00:44:49,716 --> 00:44:51,056
they're rough, they're rough around the edges.

725
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:52,057
And if people looked at them,

726
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:55,698
they'd be easy to dissect and they'd be easy to pick apart.

727
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:58,220
And you need to give that time and space

728
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,661
and freedom to survive.

729
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:07,280
But what we realized is as you grow, without the structure,

730
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,545
without the protection of that structure starting to come on board,

731
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,792
you're actually doing an immense disservice to these sparks.

732
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,922
New flames will spark up and consume all the oxygen.

733
00:45:20,022 --> 00:45:24,704
Winds of change will come as things change in the industry

734
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,225
or things change with people's behavior

735
00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:30,128
and start to snuff out things that were promising.

736
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:32,029
And you have to start putting these walls,

737
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:33,449
starting to put this structure in place,

738
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,912
bit by bit, leading up to protect the innovations that you have.

739
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:41,934
And that equilibrium point, that point of balance,

740
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:43,274
is not always the same.

741
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:46,155
It is not always that you want an even balance

742
00:45:46,556 --> 00:45:48,076
between all of these different departments.

743
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:50,577
But that balance and that equilibrium point shifts

744
00:45:51,137 --> 00:45:52,158
over the course of production.

745
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:55,219
And you need to carefully maintain that and nurture that

746
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,081
to help that spark grow into the kind of roaring flame

747
00:45:59,101 --> 00:45:59,701
that you want it to be.

748
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:04,523
And really for me, looking back, that's my key takeaway.

749
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:12,862
In conception, we had a very unbalanced process massively weighted towards, you know, innovation

750
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:19,008
and protecting innovation and making that innovation as rapid and as effective as it

751
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:23,672
could be. And it was incredibly effective. And I can't stress that enough. This is a process I

752
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:30,618
would love to see other companies and other groups replicate because it was some of the most fulfilling.

753
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,591
game development experience I've ever had in my career,

754
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:37,952
and many people on the team, I think, would attest to that.

755
00:46:38,752 --> 00:46:40,953
And we've already started to see some experiments

756
00:46:41,373 --> 00:46:42,414
replicating that elsewhere,

757
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:43,794
and it's been incredibly effective.

758
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:46,635
But moving into pre-production,

759
00:46:46,995 --> 00:46:49,416
we made the mistake of just trying to keep going,

760
00:46:49,496 --> 00:46:50,697
trying to scale that process up.

761
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:53,157
And we should have still kept...

762
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:58,435
That balance on the side of innovation, it's still important to add that depth,

763
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,376
but we had to start to tip the scales.

764
00:47:00,396 --> 00:47:04,739
We had to start to add some of that structure to make it work.

765
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,680
And then, you know, moving into production,

766
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:12,803
we had to find our new equilibrium point, our new balance point.

767
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,162
And that's going to look different for everyone, you know, the path to get there,

768
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:24,465
the path to adjust that new equilibrium. For us, it meant really creating the structure

769
00:47:24,906 --> 00:47:28,448
of having regular venues for healthy conflict,

770
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:32,070
for...

771
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,011
You know, venues where people could challenge.

772
00:47:35,191 --> 00:47:38,914
So, you know, we had creative briefs with a feature at an early level.

773
00:47:38,934 --> 00:47:41,235
So kind of a high level presentation overview of the feature,

774
00:47:41,595 --> 00:47:44,957
bringing in all the stakeholders who could say, OK, you know,

775
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:47,939
I want to raise a flag about this. This is a warning.

776
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,461
You know, then taking that into FSOs.

777
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:52,422
This is very Ubisoft specific thing, but essentially a much,

778
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,364
much more specific description of that feature.

779
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:58,626
Again, with a forum for challenge and debate discussion.

780
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:05,453
Our meetings became very much about making sure that anyone could add points for discussion.

781
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:09,458
They weren't just top-down, me saying, here's the agenda.

782
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:13,924
We built the agenda collaboratively, and we made sure that there were venues for everyone

783
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:15,466
to discuss and argue.

784
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:17,548
And we encouraged that healthy conflict.

785
00:48:19,534 --> 00:48:21,896
On the production side, we really shifted focus to velocity

786
00:48:22,216 --> 00:48:24,758
to better understand how we were tracking towards our scope.

787
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:27,480
We used playtest and external validation

788
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,102
to understand our audience and what's resonating.

789
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:33,605
And we really refocused in on our game pillars

790
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:37,068
in order to use those as the razor to help prioritize

791
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:38,349
and focus on what's important.

792
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:42,572
And we realized that only through focusing on these things

793
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,955
could we protect these things and actually make them

794
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:53,801
flourish in the game. For us, those pillars were of course this modular toy, you know,

795
00:48:53,821 --> 00:48:59,625
this instant connection, this magical moment that makes kids' eyes light up and their jaws drop.

796
00:49:01,887 --> 00:49:06,991
The creative combat that this instant swapping and connection empowers you to do in game,

797
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:12,755
this creative problem solving where you get into a challenge and there's no right or wrong

798
00:49:12,855 --> 00:49:16,658
answer but you have to experiment and figure out how to adapt to take on that challenge.

799
00:49:18,276 --> 00:49:24,641
And this incredible, living, dynamic world that makes it for no two players having the

800
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:27,343
same story, no two players having the same journey.

801
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:34,588
Now we're still active in development, and I need to give a huge shout out to our team

802
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:40,573
back in Toronto, who are still working very, very hard to bring everything to life.

803
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:46,052
completely together and wrap it up. I'm super, super excited about the game. I'm super excited

804
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:51,695
for you all to see more about it over the coming months. I can't wait. So far we've

805
00:49:51,715 --> 00:49:55,636
only given a little glimpse at E3, and I can't wait for people to see what we've been up

806
00:49:55,676 --> 00:50:04,600
to. And, you know, I'd really stress two things. One, I would love to see other people

807
00:50:05,806 --> 00:50:11,047
Take advantage of the lessons that we learned in that incredibly effective conception process,

808
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:16,768
and you know, process that was inspired from game jam culture,

809
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,629
from game jam processes that we adapted,

810
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:25,710
and to keep an eye on that balance between structure and innovation

811
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,031
in order to help get through all of those phases of production.

812
00:50:32,231 --> 00:50:32,771
Thank you very much.

813
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,172
That's the end of my presentation.

814
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,166
Now, I think we've got time for a couple questions.

815
00:50:45,427 --> 00:50:47,388
First, I want to stress, please, please, please,

816
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:49,750
this is my first GDC presentation.

817
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,612
And I would really, really love it and appreciate it

818
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:56,514
if you would go, once you get the email,

819
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,816
if you'd go and fill in the feedback form,

820
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:00,817
because I would love the feedback.

821
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:01,938
Love your thoughts.

822
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:03,639
Any questions?

823
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,401
There are two microphones there and there.

824
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:12,499
Hi, so in the conception phase you had this two week period that ended with three pitches.

825
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,961
How many pitches did you actually end up making?

826
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:20,384
So the conception phase, you're asking me to do math.

827
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:26,287
Okay, so first of all, the first week ended in three pitches per person.

828
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,309
So that changed as our team scaled up.

829
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:32,611
So pitch wise, you know, initially I guess we were doing 24 pitches.

830
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:39,486
Every two weeks, but our team started growing as we were expanding.

831
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:45,213
So by the time we got to our actual green light pitch,

832
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:54,118
Many, over 100 fleshed out, more than that, I don't know, 150, tons and tons and tons

833
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,679
of game pitches.

834
00:51:56,859 --> 00:51:58,880
There's really like a treasure trove there, I'd love to go back to that.

835
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,041
We built three prototypes every two weeks.

836
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:09,845
So that math should be a little bit easier, so again, doing math.

837
00:52:11,245 --> 00:52:14,566
I think all in all, we probably had...

838
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:20,064
I don't know, 15, 16 different prototypes.

839
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:23,828
That's not divisible by three, so it's almost not the real number, but somewhere in that

840
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:24,208
ballpark.

841
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,051
Hi, thanks for the presentation.

842
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:28,232
You're welcome.

843
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:34,779
So I'm wondering if during the process where you were pairing people up or putting them

844
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:39,083
into the groups of four, did it really matter what disciplines you paired together or did

845
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:39,964
you mix that up every time?

846
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:45,973
So this is one of the areas where we actually, James and I actually put some design and thought into that.

847
00:52:47,174 --> 00:52:50,397
We would make sure to rotate so that people weren't paired up with the same people.

848
00:52:50,857 --> 00:52:52,739
Obviously we'd have a chance to go through.

849
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:57,202
But we would try to pair people up where...

850
00:52:58,427 --> 00:53:03,370
One of the things we were most conscious of was one person steering or dominating that conversation too much.

851
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:08,913
So we would try to pair more introverted or quieter people together in some cases,

852
00:53:10,134 --> 00:53:17,178
especially early on in the project, and, you know, more extroverted, loud people together who could play off each other's energies.

853
00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:24,463
That changed over the course of our production because as everyone started prototyping together,

854
00:53:24,843 --> 00:53:30,587
working very close in these intense things, building, pitching, everyone became much more

855
00:53:30,647 --> 00:53:34,930
comfortable working with each other and you know towards the end we had to be far less concerned

856
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,973
about that and you know we were able to just rotate through people that hadn't worked together yet.

857
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:40,872
Thanks.

858
00:53:41,533 --> 00:53:44,595
And also I noticed you had some AR pitches during the process.

859
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:44,715
Sure.

860
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:46,697
Was there ever an AR version of this game?

861
00:53:46,717 --> 00:53:48,779
You know, you see the keyboard placement stuff.

862
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:49,799
That would be awesome.

863
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,382
No, but it would be awesome.

864
00:53:54,803 --> 00:53:57,145
Just a small logistical question,

865
00:53:57,165 --> 00:53:59,808
because I also make games that are designed for kids.

866
00:54:00,968 --> 00:54:03,771
How did you find the kids for play testing?

867
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:05,312
I've Googled this repeatedly, and I

868
00:54:05,352 --> 00:54:08,394
think the only result is I'm probably on some watch lists.

869
00:54:11,899 --> 00:54:17,545
We work with a wonderful user research team at Ubisoft and at Ubisoft Toronto,

870
00:54:17,906 --> 00:54:20,849
so I feel quite lucky to have a bunch of experts that can help guide us through that.

871
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:26,696
We've done a lot of playtesting with kids and we continue to do regular playtesting with kids.

872
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:33,851
I think it is wonderful to see really raw, unfiltered thoughts and reactions.

873
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:38,853
Sometimes we ask people for scores on playtests of like, what do you think of the game?

874
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:39,354
One to five.

875
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:43,656
And we found kids are useless at giving scores.

876
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:46,817
They are wonderful to learn usability lessons.

877
00:54:46,857 --> 00:54:50,099
They're wonderful to, you know, actually watch their reactions and see.

878
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:52,260
But you know, we've had some...

879
00:54:53,201 --> 00:54:56,125
Playtests where, you know, the build is broken and there's some horrible glitch

880
00:54:56,165 --> 00:54:59,130
and you just see this kid banging their head against a problem and not understanding it.

881
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:01,855
And, like, they look like they're going to start crying.

882
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:05,421
And then we're like, what did you think of the game? And they're like, 5 out of 5! It was amazing!

883
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:06,563
And we're like, okay.

884
00:55:07,535 --> 00:55:09,417
You're just excited because you're coming to test a video game.

885
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:15,024
So you have to be a little skeptical and take any scores with a grain of salt.

886
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:16,626
But I think there's immense value.

887
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,868
There's always immense value in watching people

888
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:23,454
from whatever target demo your game is targeting really play your game.

889
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,056
It's a very, very humbling experience.

890
00:55:26,077 --> 00:55:26,217
Cool.

891
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:26,878
Thanks.

892
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:33,333
With the amount of ideas that you were asking your team to come up with during the brainstorming

893
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:35,895
phase, did you run into a lot of creative burnout?

894
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:37,796
And if so, how did you manage that?

895
00:55:38,777 --> 00:55:39,457
It's a great question.

896
00:55:40,278 --> 00:55:42,619
It is a really intense process.

897
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,461
You know, the mental drain...

898
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:51,936
that you get from, you know, you are really pushing yourself to go to the end of like

899
00:55:52,117 --> 00:55:55,679
whatever the heck, you know, after a week of doing this and generating these pitches

900
00:55:55,719 --> 00:56:00,662
and giving these pitches, you know, many people on our team, you know, was cross-disciplined,

901
00:56:00,682 --> 00:56:06,166
many people weren't that comfortable going up and presenting and that was a draining process.

902
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,868
The key for us was that weekend.

903
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,768
You know, the key for us, and that's a big part of why we split it up like that,

904
00:56:13,249 --> 00:56:17,961
was having that first week super intense, all these ideas are coming out.

905
00:56:19,522 --> 00:56:23,665
You'd pitch on Thursday, which was good, because that gave you a bit more time.

906
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:27,408
You'd pitch on Thursday, come in on Friday, okay, pressure's off a little bit.

907
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:29,830
You're not generating ideas. Now you're sitting with a team,

908
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,732
and you're trying to figure out, how the heck can we prototype this?

909
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:35,655
But that's more about people leveraging their experience, their skill set,

910
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:37,877
saying, oh, I know how to do this, I could do that, I could, you know.

911
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:40,078
It's very fun, it's very engaging.

912
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:44,902
But then having that weekend to just go, let things simmer in your head for a bit.

913
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:49,867
Calm down, and then be ready to go the next week with intense brainstorming.

914
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:52,869
You know, it's kind of like participating in a game jam,

915
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,892
but you need those gaps, you need those breaks in between.

916
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:56,913
Thanks.

917
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:57,634
You're welcome.

918
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:01,437
Knowing how well your small prototyping group worked,

919
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:04,720
would you say there's still value in doing studio-wide game jams?

920
00:57:07,326 --> 00:57:09,667
So we've also experimented with studio-wide game gems

921
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:13,809
at both at UbiToronto and other studios that I've been at.

922
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:17,090
I think they are very, very fun.

923
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,451
I think they're a great retention tool.

924
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:20,972
I think they're something very motivating for employees.

925
00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:22,873
I think one of the challenges is

926
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:30,252
They don't necessarily have the right venue

927
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:32,274
to turn into something real,

928
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:34,476
to turn into something that you can really leverage.

929
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:36,598
There's companies that have done that really well.

930
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:39,400
I know Bethesda, you know, they tend to do game jams

931
00:57:39,681 --> 00:57:41,943
of how could you add a feature onto our existing game?

932
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:45,266
But typically, the constraints of a game jam,

933
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:46,827
you know, where you're doing everything in a week

934
00:57:46,847 --> 00:57:48,088
or you're doing everything in two days,

935
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:51,111
limits you to creating kind of little arcade-y mini games,

936
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:53,553
which are super fun, but isn't necessarily something

937
00:57:53,593 --> 00:57:54,694
that Ubisoft is gonna be like.

938
00:57:55,174 --> 00:57:55,934
Or big companies can be like,

939
00:57:55,954 --> 00:57:57,875
yes, we're gonna take that and publish it.

940
00:57:58,636 --> 00:58:01,617
So what we were attempting to do was scale that up

941
00:58:01,657 --> 00:58:03,237
to something that it could be used really

942
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:05,959
in a major conception of a game.

943
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:08,040
I think that was really effective.

944
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,761
And personally, I love the idea of maybe,

945
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:14,262
often you have downtime as people are ramping down

946
00:58:14,302 --> 00:58:15,763
from one project before they start another.

947
00:58:16,023 --> 00:58:18,064
That's a wonderful time to try something like this

948
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:19,885
with the hope that it can actually turn

949
00:58:19,925 --> 00:58:23,246
into a commercial product that the company could do.

950
00:58:23,746 --> 00:58:24,026
Thank you.

951
00:58:24,506 --> 00:58:24,707
Welcome.

952
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:27,606
So two questions.

953
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:30,550
The first one is about the 25 ideas.

954
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:34,014
How deep are always the ideas?

955
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:38,199
Is it just simple game play mechanics, or how do you

956
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:38,839
really define?

957
00:58:39,117 --> 00:58:43,217
So typically people were trying to make ideas that a game could be built around,

958
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:44,318
so a little bit bigger.

959
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:47,558
You know, not just like, oh you could press A to do this,

960
00:58:47,618 --> 00:58:49,699
but more like, oh you could build a game around this mechanic.

961
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:52,339
That having been said, the ideas themselves were just, you know,

962
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:57,500
a sentence or two short descriptions at that level and you're going through.

963
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,701
So the description was very, very short,

964
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:03,701
but the ideas were designed to be something that you could actually build a AAA game about.

965
00:59:04,201 --> 00:59:04,421
Okay.

966
00:59:05,035 --> 00:59:12,362
And just the second one was, who decided the idea of the brainstorm of the two weeks?

967
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:20,328
When you said, like, we will think about the game, I don't remember the example.

968
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:23,651
Yes, yes, the guided questions. Who decided?

969
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,473
Who decided on those questions?

970
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:30,275
So that's one of the areas where we were less democratic,

971
00:59:30,315 --> 00:59:30,655
as well.

972
00:59:31,396 --> 00:59:34,857
That was really just James and I, two leads on the project.

973
00:59:34,897 --> 00:59:38,959
We'd sit together and try to come up with some ideas

974
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:39,880
and put that out to the group.

975
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,202
Thank you all so, so much for coming and listening to my talk.

976
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:47,043
Please rate it or give me the feedback

977
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,824
or whatever the email asks you to do.

978
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:50,685
Thank you.
