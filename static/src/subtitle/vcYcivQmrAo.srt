1
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:06,929
This is gonna be brilliant for all of us.

2
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,130
My name is Mike, and this is my incredibly long titled,

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,950
it's, yeah, it's not very good.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,791
It's a very search engine optimized title.

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,071
So I'm here today to talk to you

6
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:19,012
about something a bit weird.

7
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,492
I know it's a level design track.

8
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:23,193
I'm gonna be talking about dialog systems.

9
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:26,814
But I hope that it's kind of an interesting take

10
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:29,375
on dialog systems using level design lenses.

11
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,755
Maybe there's some stuff in here as well

12
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,956
that might help with communication with writers.

13
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:35,360
or taking your level design skill set

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,862
and applying it in different places in the game.

15
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:39,386
It's an interesting case study, hopefully.

16
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,830
So, obligatory who am I slide.

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,894
I'm Mike Bithell, I think I already said that.

18
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,937
I might do it a couple more times.

19
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:46,879
I'm an indie developer.

20
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:51,087
If you've heard of me, it's probably because of

21
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:52,648
Thomas Was Alone, which is a pretentious

22
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,950
rectangle platforming game.

23
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,672
Overrated in my opinion, but thankfully

24
00:00:57,672 --> 00:00:59,533
I don't write the reviews.

25
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:02,275
Volume was the follow up, which was a stealth game,

26
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,336
and then Subsurface Circular is the one that just came out.

27
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:06,378
Out of interest in the room, anyone in there

28
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:07,939
actually played Subsurface Circular?

29
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,521
Oh cool, a couple of you, awesome, excellent, okay.

30
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:12,542
If you could just explain to the people around you

31
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,304
what the hell it is throughout the course of the talk,

32
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:14,864
that'd be great.

33
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,734
But even though I'm known for these games,

34
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:23,057
I am a level designer.

35
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:24,439
That's kind of my background.

36
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,282
That's where I'm from.

37
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:30,548
I worked as a level designer on a bunch of games,

38
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,270
3D platformers, 2D brawlers.

39
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,653
I worked as a graphic designer, a concept designer.

40
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:37,635
I've done most jobs at some point.

41
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:39,396
If there was someone who was willing to pay my bills,

42
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,977
I'd make a video game for them.

43
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,479
I did the full level design on Thomas Was Alone.

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,959
I oversaw the level design on Volume.

45
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,601
I had a really talented team of guys on that.

46
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,361
And then Subsurface Circular,

47
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,222
which is the game we're going to be talking about today,

48
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:53,803
I was the sole level designer on,

49
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:55,904
which was kind of cool, but also practical,

50
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:56,885
because it's a very small game.

51
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:58,505
So, the game Subsurface Circular.

52
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:05,962
This game, it exists because we had a gap.

53
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:12,052
The polite, politically good version of this is we found ourselves with an exciting six

54
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:15,819
month gap in our schedule, thanks to our colleagues in the publishing world.

55
00:02:17,744 --> 00:02:20,345
That's one way of putting it.

56
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:21,305
And we have this gap.

57
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:23,886
And we had to use it for something.

58
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:26,527
So R&D made sense as something to do.

59
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:27,367
I've just realized, by the way,

60
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,508
I didn't tell any of you to turn off your phones,

61
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:31,748
to fill in your evaluation forms,

62
00:02:31,748 --> 00:02:33,229
or to sit in the middle of the room,

63
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,249
which is a thing, apparently.

64
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:35,489
I don't know if that's to make it look like

65
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,590
there's more of you in the audience.

66
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,850
Don't know, but it's there.

67
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,591
Let's move along.

68
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:43,072
So yeah, it was a bit of time we had

69
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,932
and we wanted to do some R&D.

70
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:48,306
There was a real problem that I saw in our games,

71
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,447
which was that they were very story-led.

72
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:52,088
They were known for being story-led.

73
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,430
People liked the characters and the worlds we built.

74
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,671
But the story was just kind of something

75
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,352
that happened to you while you played the game.

76
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,053
You know, you did a platformer,

77
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:02,515
or you did a bit of stealth exploration,

78
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:07,218
and Andy Serkis told you story over the VO.

79
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:09,639
And I figured that would work for maybe two games,

80
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,022
maybe three games, and then people were gonna realize,

81
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:13,742
I'm kind of a hack.

82
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:15,203
and I kind of wanted to move beyond that

83
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,744
and do something more interactive and more interesting.

84
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:21,026
The trick, of course, would be to keep it small.

85
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,188
We had, well, we've wasted a month

86
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:24,669
just thinking of all the stuff I just said,

87
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:27,390
so we're now down to about five months,

88
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,991
and we need to make something

89
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,433
that can be made in that time with the money we have,

90
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,793
which isn't an infinite resource.

91
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:34,995
We have quite a small budget we can put into this.

92
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,576
I managed to convince the people I work with

93
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,958
to go for this, so we have to get this game made.

94
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:44,255
We decided on Subsurface Circular, which we stealth-launched.

95
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:47,417
It's a narrative game, it's a text adventure game

96
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,718
about a detective who's a robot.

97
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:52,081
And I'm not going to tell you anything else, I'm going to show you the trailer,

98
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:55,524
because we literally stealth-launched it, so the audience didn't know anything more

99
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:58,546
about this game than the trailer, so this is a good way of introducing it.

100
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:01,849
I might talk a little bit while it's going on, but please pay attention

101
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,311
to how the gameplay works. It's kind of a dialogue system,

102
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,253
that's what we're going to be talking about throughout the whole of this talk,

103
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:10,255
so keep an eye on that. But let me play this trailer for you quickly.

104
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,364
A bass

105
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,058
And that's the game.

106
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:24,879
With amazing bass apparently.

107
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,420
That was a great experience.

108
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,222
So you didn't see any level design there.

109
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:29,163
We're off to a great start.

110
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:33,286
So first of all, please do bear with me.

111
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,227
We'll get to it, I promise.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,103
The key thing here is that I have used some level design approaches

113
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,664
in the way that we've approached dialogue systems.

114
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:45,526
So we've got a lot of things that you saw kind of being played with there.

115
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:48,968
The core gameplay is built around these lists of options that come up,

116
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:52,269
your standard kind of everything from Mass Effect to Horizon

117
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,031
to any kind of Western RPG you've played.

118
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,212
Dialogue options you can throw into conversation

119
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:58,533
in order to move things forward.

120
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:02,396
to make choices.

121
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:07,140
We designed dialogue around linear paths,

122
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,962
so that standard thing of branching you off,

123
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,984
giving you some options, coming back to a hub

124
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:13,745
that you've seen in a lot of games

125
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:15,827
where you'll kind of be able to investigate a subject

126
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:16,787
or whatever.

127
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:18,048
We tried not to do that though,

128
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:20,891
because we had something that was far more interesting

129
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,293
and actually opened up our opportunity to do level design.

130
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,341
which was these focus points.

131
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,662
So in the bottom there you can see

132
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:28,543
I've actually unlocked one on that screenshot

133
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:31,506
and I've got a bank of them in an inventory down here.

134
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,768
Focus points are topics or subjects

135
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,849
that you can interject into conversation

136
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:39,052
either to answer a question, to ask a question.

137
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:44,496
You can use themes and subjects you've picked up on

138
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,738
to have a conversation.

139
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:48,539
You can carry them with you, you can lose them,

140
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,940
you can gain them.

141
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,702
And once we added that to the game,

142
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:55,023
we had something interesting going on.

143
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,985
But we had a problem.

144
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,727
We wanted to make a two-hour dialogue tree game.

145
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:00,528
And you just saw it.

146
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,690
It's pretty straightforward.

147
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,012
You know, it's mainly just clicking on these options.

148
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:06,473
And we knew we didn't have an art budget,

149
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:07,354
we didn't have much time or money,

150
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:10,637
and we knew that the writing would hopefully be quite good

151
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:14,240
because that's something that we're known for.

152
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,003
But we also were a little bit worried that it would be boring.

153
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:22,940
there would be something that didn't really attach with an audience that would be kind of just a long slog.

154
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,082
There was a real concern there.

155
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,863
And how did we fix that using existing skills?

156
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:31,905
Because it kind of relied on the skills we already had on the team

157
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:34,787
to actually solve that problem.

158
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,187
Like I said, we couldn't spend much money,

159
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:39,249
we couldn't bring in too many other people.

160
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:39,809
And finally...

161
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:43,690
With interactive fiction, there's a niche audience.

162
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,411
There's a specific audience who plays a lot

163
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,473
of interactive fiction, who have a good time

164
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:50,175
with those games, but we wanted to reach beyond that.

165
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:52,157
Our previous games had found kind of,

166
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:55,199
not mainstream audiences, but broader audiences.

167
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,781
So we knew it was important that we went back

168
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,582
to those players and gave them something

169
00:07:58,582 --> 00:07:59,643
that they would hopefully enjoy

170
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,865
and that they wouldn't be put off by

171
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:05,288
because they'd not played a game like this before.

172
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:06,109
What would we do?

173
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:06,969
Well, we came to a solution.

174
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:07,950
This isn't my level design.

175
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,668
This is from Half-Life, it's very good.

176
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:11,110
Just looks cool.

177
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,412
And it's a great level as well.

178
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:14,514
I realized I was a level designer.

179
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:17,959
So I realized that actually there were these kind of skills

180
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,761
that I already had in me.

181
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:22,484
This is a key turning point in the movie adaptation

182
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:24,627
of this slideshow that we'll be using.

183
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,349
I realized the power was within me all along.

184
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:32,596
Slightly arrogant thing to say in front of a room full of people.

185
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,319
I realized that actually a lot of the kind of the instincts I had as a level designer

186
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,800
would apply to storytelling.

187
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,583
I realized, first of all, that if I came up with a story that explained why the protagonist

188
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,105
was asking a lot of questions, I'd be onto something.

189
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:49,427
Detective fiction immediately jumped out.

190
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,929
And there's a reason that so much detective fiction

191
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,250
is about world building.

192
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,311
Your protagonist is looking for answers,

193
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:56,652
looking for information.

194
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:59,254
There's very few professions where you can walk into a room

195
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:01,997
and just start asking people how their day's going

196
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:03,418
and not get kicked out.

197
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,739
Detectives are a great way of doing that.

198
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:08,281
Realizing that kind of thing would help,

199
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,143
realizing I could have puzzles and challenges

200
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,464
as a result of that,

201
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,026
immediately I started seeing gameplay

202
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:16,168
rather than just a chat in a video game.

203
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:20,100
And I realized that there were so many links

204
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,801
between good writing and good design,

205
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:25,543
causality, predictability of outcomes, goal setting,

206
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,124
the kind of things that make good levels,

207
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:29,765
that make us feel as players

208
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,726
that a game is treating us fairly,

209
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:33,307
are also sort of rules of writing.

210
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,168
They're in all the writing books as well.

211
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:38,370
There's a lot of storytelling level design overlap.

212
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,171
And this was an, I'm gonna actually hold on this slide

213
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,472
while you take a photo.

214
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:42,032
You got it?

215
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:42,972
Awesome.

216
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:43,473
Let's carry on.

217
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,845
If I have to rush later because of you,

218
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:50,486
I'm going to hold you responsible.

219
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:51,267
So that's all very nice.

220
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,728
That's a nice thing to say and to kind of point out.

221
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:55,948
But how do we actually practically do that?

222
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:58,109
How do we apply level design to conversation?

223
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:00,970
Well, first of all is those focus points,

224
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,511
which remain the coolest idea that we came up

225
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,851
with for the game.

226
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:07,092
Focus points are an inventory.

227
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,732
They're an object you can collect.

228
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,873
And with that single choice.

229
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:13,444
suddenly you have level design.

230
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:17,027
You can collect them, you can lose them,

231
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:18,909
and that can be jarring, that can be kind of a moment

232
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,291
of fear of what, you've had some stuff

233
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,612
and then the game's taken it away.

234
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:25,114
That's something to use very carefully.

235
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:27,756
You can combine them in that classic adventure game sense

236
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:29,397
where you take object A and object B,

237
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:31,339
put them together and get something else.

238
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,480
That feels like deduction,

239
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,242
that feels like working something out.

240
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,223
That's a cool thing that a detective would do

241
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:37,925
and can give us some gameplay opportunities.

242
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,974
You can open conversation doors with them.

243
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,395
We do this a lot in subsurface,

244
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:44,277
arguably a little bit too much.

245
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,779
But the idea of a character who needs direction

246
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,460
to a specific building,

247
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,222
you can go get that information, bring it back,

248
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:53,584
and give it, that's a door.

249
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:54,545
That's a key and a door.

250
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:55,726
The information is the key,

251
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,407
the person who needs it is a door.

252
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,468
Suddenly you've got quest design,

253
00:10:58,468 --> 00:10:59,569
you can do stuff with that.

254
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:03,549
And of course we can do exploration and world building.

255
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,891
We can have focus points that unlock

256
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,892
interesting doors over here to a bit of exposition.

257
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,293
We can have focus points that are in themselves

258
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:13,094
a rewarding outcome of exploration

259
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:15,496
that you can kind of find a weird conversation track

260
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:17,116
and get some value from that.

261
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,717
Again, all level design stuff,

262
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:21,579
all stuff that you would use and think about

263
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,220
if you were trying to build compelling levels.

264
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,741
But there's more.

265
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:27,861
Objectives.

266
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,242
As I said, we've got quest giving.

267
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:30,063
That's easy.

268
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:31,524
We can also do aesthetic objectives.

269
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,346
So we can say, hey, you should go over,

270
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,268
or it would be cool if you worked out this.

271
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:37,529
And then 10 minutes later,

272
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,670
just give you a click on that objective

273
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,952
saying you worked out this.

274
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,794
No game design involved there, but it feels nice.

275
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:46,295
We can also do cleverer stuff

276
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:48,016
where we're actually tracking your actions.

277
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:49,838
and how many interactions you've had,

278
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:52,800
that kind of thing, locking in your progress

279
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,002
towards a task, which again,

280
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:57,605
it builds up that sense of progress,

281
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:58,685
sorry, progression and level.

282
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,508
Multiple characters, you saw there,

283
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:04,651
two characters just talking in a one-on-one conversation.

284
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:06,192
That's how subsurface is,

285
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,533
but because every train carriage

286
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:08,514
has multiple characters in it.

287
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,714
you're constantly moving between different

288
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:14,056
one-on-one conversations, which become rooms,

289
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:16,217
and become separate spaces that give the player

290
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:18,359
a sense of traversal, because you might be talking

291
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,360
to this character, and then you might realize

292
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,341
you need to go over there to talk to that character,

293
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,042
and then you come back with that information

294
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,603
to that character.

295
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,984
Players talk about this in verbs like go over there,

296
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:30,065
come back, they are a robot sat on a train.

297
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:33,747
There is no movement or traversal taking place,

298
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:35,588
but by having just different characters

299
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,109
you can have one-on-one conversations with,

300
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:40,491
we create the sense of traversal, of movement,

301
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:43,273
and that's incredibly powerful and useful.

302
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:45,314
Signposting we didn't really do.

303
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:47,676
Our dialogue flows in a way that kind of makes it hard

304
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,757
for you to get lost as a player,

305
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:52,139
but we did, again, find an opportunity there

306
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,460
to use that in storytelling.

307
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,721
We have a literal Chekhov's gun in the game,

308
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:58,043
a gun that is introduced at the start,

309
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,504
and in a good story, if you introduce a gun

310
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:00,945
in the first scene, you need to make sure

311
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,646
someone shot it by the end.

312
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:06,528
We absolutely hold true to that storytelling analogy.

313
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:10,759
And we also allow for experimental play.

314
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,039
We have characters in the world

315
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,600
who serve no story purpose whatsoever,

316
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
but that you can have fun conversations with.

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,881
My favorite is the robot who's into Hamilton,

318
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,281
and you can kind of sing songs with.

319
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:20,962
That's quite fun.

320
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:23,162
He's right, Hamilton, but you want him to be,

321
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:25,203
so you sing at him and he ignores you.

322
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:25,743
And it's a great moment,

323
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:26,803
which has absolutely no bearing

324
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:27,943
on the game's story whatsoever.

325
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:30,851
but it's still something I guess sent screenshots of

326
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,593
almost every day because people find it and enjoy it.

327
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:35,194
And again, that's the sort of stuff

328
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:38,156
that regular dialogue systems don't do

329
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,578
because they're not thinking it through as a level design.

330
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:42,319
And that's exciting to me.

331
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,420
Mu, you're gonna recognize this slide.

332
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,062
Applying level design to conversation.

333
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:49,564
So technically, what are some interesting parts

334
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:50,445
of that process?

335
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,281
Well, first of all, making the full cast robotic

336
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,281
was super useful.

337
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,661
Realizing that we could kind of cover up any flaws

338
00:13:57,661 --> 00:14:01,402
in our writing by having characters who are robots

339
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:02,402
was so useful.

340
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:04,903
Characters can talk a bit stilted,

341
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:07,203
they can have sudden emotional shifts.

342
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:09,143
We don't have too much of that in Subsurface,

343
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:11,324
except for one big puzzle which I'm gonna talk about

344
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:12,604
in a minute.

345
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:16,325
But anywhere where our robots behave in a non-human-like way

346
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,985
we have a canonical reason why that's the case.

347
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:23,450
It's super useful, and there's no shame in having those kind of narrative and world-based

348
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,553
excuses for the shortcomings of the experience you're creating.

349
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:29,276
And of course, crucially, we have this, and I didn't know you were going to be in the

350
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:29,857
audience, Moo.

351
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:30,437
It's embarrassing.

352
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:30,958
I do name-drop you here.

353
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:31,178
Hey, Moo.

354
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:31,558
Thank you.

355
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:31,739
Thank you.

356
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:31,959
Thank you.

357
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:32,219
Thank you.

358
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:32,439
Thank you.

359
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:32,740
Thank you.

360
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:32,980
Thank you.

361
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,360
Thank you.

362
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,761
Thank you.

363
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:34,141
Thank you.

364
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:34,482
Thank you.

365
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:34,962
Thank you.

366
00:14:34,962 --> 00:14:35,543
Thank you.

367
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:40,217
very talented coder who came in and built this really nice,

368
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:41,498
fast, node-based system.

369
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:44,440
So this is how we build a level for Subsurface Circular,

370
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,524
is with these really cool, very, very zoomed out

371
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:50,926
dialogue node systems.

372
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:53,888
Way more visibility than the tools most people use

373
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,830
for this kind of work.

374
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,131
We have a lot less features than they do,

375
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,473
but we basically stripped out,

376
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:01,955
or just didn't bother to put in in the first place,

377
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:04,537
features that weren't useful in getting us writing quickly.

378
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,747
So let's talk about that process.

379
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:08,847
How do you do this?

380
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,228
How do you design dialogue in this way?

381
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:13,510
Well, first of all, you do what a writer does.

382
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,651
You pull out some Post-it notes or a record board

383
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:16,952
and you work out your act structure

384
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,553
and all of that kind of story stuff

385
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,635
that you do for any kind of writing,

386
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:23,036
where you work out the big beats of the narrative,

387
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:25,117
how that game world is gonna flow.

388
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,399
But ultimately, you're not thinking about interaction,

389
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,720
you're thinking about story progression.

390
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:33,715
The next step is where you come into the interactive points.

391
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,276
So we would go to a flow chart.

392
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:37,338
That flow chart then ends up similar to this

393
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:38,720
on the right here.

394
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,162
It's kind of cropped off, but you can see

395
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:45,126
blue is focus points, red is objectives.

396
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,723
And you can see there that we're kind of thinking

397
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,584
through the process of different conversations.

398
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,766
Each conversation is numbered.

399
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:54,148
That's how I'm breaking it up and thinking it through.

400
00:15:54,148 --> 00:15:56,690
But this is the trajectory in just one level,

401
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,411
how we're moving between different characters

402
00:15:58,411 --> 00:16:00,512
and talking to them about different subjects.

403
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,454
It's all very structured.

404
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:05,416
It needed to be because we have so much writing

405
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,117
on the next step.

406
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:09,879
So the next step was an initial draft of the script.

407
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,241
So we'd write it like a movie.

408
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:15,123
So just a very linear, two characters get talking.

409
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:20,680
super useful. We can work out tone, voice, characterization. We can do all of the good

410
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,969
writer stuff where you really arrive at a character that the audience is going to care about

411
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:29,776
without having to worry too much about the logic and the game design-y bits.

412
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,688
which we then did next in the node editor

413
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:36,812
where we would then copy and paste that linear draft in.

414
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:39,155
You remember from the previous slide, the branching.

415
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:40,797
I would then add all of that branching

416
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,999
and add all that variety to it.

417
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,161
It's interesting in kind of future experiments

418
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,022
we're taking with this tech.

419
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:49,464
we actually cut out the linear script stage altogether

420
00:16:49,464 --> 00:16:54,607
because I actually think that forces me or pushes me towards writing very linearly

421
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:56,888
when I should be thinking in that branching way from day one.

422
00:16:56,888 --> 00:16:59,870
That was a confidence thing and kind of a learning process for me.

423
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,292
So the initial draft step is now not how we do this.

424
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:06,893
It makes it harder, but it comes out better.

425
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:09,846
The other thing to point out that's really interesting

426
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:11,067
from a level design point of view,

427
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,327
there's no blocking stage involved

428
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:14,769
in anything I just described.

429
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:15,549
It's, you just write.

430
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,872
And you've got logical gameplay from day one.

431
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,114
There's no white boxing because there's no art pass.

432
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:24,415
It's just writing.

433
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:25,576
So you're just trying to,

434
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:27,597
you're redrafting essentially in the same way

435
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:29,738
as you would with any kind of piece of writing,

436
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:30,559
10, maybe 15 times,

437
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,961
but you're just working into the same script,

438
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,482
which means it's fast

439
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:37,003
and it means there's no dependencies.

440
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:40,785
our art in the game, you saw in the trailer we got really nice art, but it's kind of devoid

441
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:45,068
in our production pipeline from the level design. It's something that kind of exists

442
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:49,452
separately and that's really useful. That means we don't, we're not held up by it, they're not

443
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:52,454
held up by us, we can just kind of, I can just be writing essentially from day one and I'm producing

444
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:55,296
work that goes into the final game. I wanted to give a quick example of how this works.

445
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:04,504
So, Sequence 5, spoilers, but yeah.

446
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:08,747
Sequence 5 is the most popular level in the game.

447
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:10,888
I think it's a useful one to use to kind of showcase

448
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,950
how this thinking works, because it's very hard.

449
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,436
when you're just looking at the stream of text

450
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:18,057
to see what the level design is.

451
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,297
So I did this quick little diagram.

452
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:22,318
I literally did it yesterday

453
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,478
because I didn't like this slide

454
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,679
and the last diagram was bad.

455
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,760
So the sequence starts with you entering the room

456
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,281
at the top there by that red key.

457
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:33,542
You have a very simple conversation with a side character.

458
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:38,123
The red key represents a specific piece of information

459
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:39,924
about the situation that's going on in the game.

460
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:41,264
I'm gonna try and keep it spoiler-free.

461
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:47,590
You then have two other characters get into the train carriage, those two rooms underneath the room with the key in.

462
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:53,355
Those two characters you have a bit of flavor time with, you can kind of lie to them, you can be honest.

463
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:59,941
Doesn't really have a massive impact on the story going forward from that point, but it's there and it's a nice bit of framing for what's about to come next.

464
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:07,696
Then we get into the meat and potatoes of this, which is those two characters are emotionally linked.

465
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:15,105
So making one of those characters happy or sad or angry also makes the other character happy or sad or angry,

466
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:18,569
which opens up different conversational paths with that second character.

467
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,721
And as I put it up there,

468
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:22,341
and because everyone always reads the bullet point

469
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:24,242
the second it goes up on the screen,

470
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:27,263
you're ahead of me, which is, that's every 90s FPS,

471
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:30,063
water level raising and lowering puzzle.

472
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:31,664
That was a really great opportunity

473
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:36,325
to use something very specific from these old games I liked

474
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:39,406
in a dialogue situation and make it feel fresh.

475
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:43,007
So you're manipulating the emotions, that's opening doors.

476
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,468
You can see on the right kind of a clumsy depiction of that

477
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:47,588
of different rooms with different keys in.

478
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:47,968
You're kind of.

479
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,370
finding new focus points and new information

480
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,491
by going down different channels,

481
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,991
and then right at the end,

482
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,153
that long one pointing off to the right there,

483
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,834
you use that little piece of information

484
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,435
you learned from the first side character

485
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,317
right at the start of the scene,

486
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:02,697
which feels very detective-y

487
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:05,379
to kind of remember that there was a brick

488
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:07,520
by the entrance as you came in,

489
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,421
and that breaks the case,

490
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,842
and you realize what's going on.

491
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,323
That unlocks the end of the level,

492
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:13,184
which you then move into.

493
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:13,484
So it's...

494
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:19,639
a progression through a dungeon, but it's also good detective fiction writing, hopefully.

495
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:25,365
It's all of that logic I'm talking about, all of those shared principles in the worlds

496
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:29,669
of writing good genre fiction and hopefully designing good levels tied together.

497
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:32,392
And then you die.

498
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:33,132
Right.

499
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,875
Spoilers.

500
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:36,395
You don't die.

501
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:37,356
You sort of die.

502
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:39,372
So where did it not fit?

503
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,733
Because this is sounding very clever so far.

504
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,174
It's got to have gone wrong some ways, right?

505
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:43,835
And it absolutely did.

506
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:48,418
First of all, conversation flows.

507
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:51,901
Making a cul-de-sac or a blockage or a wall

508
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:55,263
or a dead end in a conversation doesn't really work for us.

509
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:56,784
Or we had trouble with it.

510
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,105
It didn't feel fun.

511
00:20:58,105 --> 00:20:59,446
It didn't feel rewarding.

512
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,728
It felt like the game had broken.

513
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,329
You know, you didn't want to hear the same line

514
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,890
of dialogue repeating over and over again

515
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,371
because the character wouldn't let you past.

516
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:10,093
that means that the game is a bit more on rails

517
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,838
than you would normally do with a traditional level design.

518
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,642
It feels a little bit more structured.

519
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:17,207
It's forcing you in the right direction at all times.

520
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:18,911
That's a limitation of this model.

521
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:21,788
Similarly, as a result of that,

522
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:26,492
I relied a little bit too much on arbitrary puzzles.

523
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:27,513
Anyone who's played the game through,

524
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:29,215
you're gonna know immediately what I'm talking about.

525
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:31,697
There's a couple of puzzles in there that are riddles

526
00:21:31,697 --> 00:21:34,079
where you'll be on a really interesting detective case

527
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,201
and then a character will go, well, there are two knights

528
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,123
and one of them can only tell the truth

529
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,044
and one of them can only lie.

530
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:42,826
It's not that one, but it's that kind of stuff.

531
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,327
and it trips people up and it irritates people

532
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:47,308
and I'm forever reading forum posts

533
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:48,788
about how awful that particular puzzle is.

534
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:52,409
And they're right, they're all absolutely right.

535
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:55,289
It's a limitation because making something

536
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:58,370
as linear as we did, the detective metaphor

537
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,511
sometimes didn't work in every situation

538
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:02,551
and that definitely kind of locked us

539
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:03,852
into some different paths.

540
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:07,347
And finally, because, speaking of different paths,

541
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:09,669
because we were focusing so much on making good gameplay

542
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:12,311
and good design that felt good to work through,

543
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:15,454
we did let down the audience on a genre expectation,

544
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:17,035
which is branching narratives.

545
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,177
A lot of interactive fiction, you can be kind of,

546
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:20,398
you can choose different paths,

547
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:21,358
you can choose different actions

548
00:22:21,358 --> 00:22:22,399
which take you in different directions.

549
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:24,681
Our game's actually pretty linear.

550
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:27,143
You know, the story doesn't, there are different endings,

551
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:29,565
but it's all very, very straightforward

552
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,587
because we were focusing on making the design

553
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:32,628
and the dungeons fun.

554
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:36,582
because dungeons tend to only have one exit.

555
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:38,642
So we kind of, that was another limitation

556
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,343
of the design approach that kind of,

557
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:43,904
it wasn't terrible, but it was definitely something

558
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,645
that kind of disappointed people about the game.

559
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:48,925
And also it's worth pointing out,

560
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:51,546
with any talk, how specific this is.

561
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:56,527
This worked because we're text-based,

562
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,528
so we lean very heavily on the ambiguities

563
00:22:58,528 --> 00:22:59,348
of the written word.

564
00:22:59,802 --> 00:23:01,764
We absolutely don't have to record VO.

565
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,846
That would have been a nightmare.

566
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:06,207
And to get all the different VO in

567
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:08,189
that would track different choices you've made

568
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:10,991
and still sound appropriate would have been terrible.

569
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:14,053
We lean very heavily on the limitations of our presentation.

570
00:23:14,053 --> 00:23:16,975
There's lots of reasons this wouldn't necessarily

571
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:17,696
work in everything.

572
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,378
This is the boring slide, reception.

573
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:22,960
It reviewed really well.

574
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,721
Couple of people thought that there was no game design.

575
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:25,021
Right.

576
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,113
It's not a very interesting slide.

577
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:31,575
But yeah, it went down really well.

578
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:34,218
It was well-received, which is great.

579
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:35,820
So where can we take this next?

580
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,404
We've said publicly we're playing with this idea

581
00:23:38,404 --> 00:23:40,326
because it did resonate and we think

582
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:42,409
there's more opportunities there.

583
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:43,551
So a few of those ideas.

584
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,622
multiple characters in conversation at once.

585
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:48,382
Our game is about one-on-one conversation,

586
00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:49,323
subsurface circular.

587
00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:53,505
What happens if that's a kind of an Aaron Sorkin style,

588
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:56,527
five people in a corridor talking over each other?

589
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:58,988
Is that really annoying to the player?

590
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:01,829
Or does that feel kinetic and energetic?

591
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:04,571
And can we play with those, blur those lines

592
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:07,512
of like where conversation ends with one character

593
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,152
and starts with another?

594
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:08,973
That could be interesting.

595
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:13,508
Pairing decision making with more audiovisual output.

596
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:15,129
As I said, we kept the art and the design

597
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,510
kind of separate throughout the process.

598
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,390
Can we do more?

599
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,050
Can we have music that reacts to what you're doing?

600
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,731
Can we have visuals that react to what you're doing?

601
00:24:21,731 --> 00:24:23,211
Can we get more animation in there?

602
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,332
There's lots of interesting places we can hook stuff

603
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,152
audiovisually onto these outcomes.

604
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:31,373
Visualization narrative space.

605
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:35,079
making that diagram, I realized how interesting

606
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,720
it might be to a player to have that kind of awareness

607
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,561
of the conversation they're having.

608
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,081
It's an interesting one to play with

609
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,702
because it might be that that's too much information

610
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:45,743
and actually makes the game feel kind of arbitrary

611
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:48,165
or overly mechanical, but there's also a possibility

612
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:50,306
that tracking that information, giving it to the player

613
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:52,627
and saying to the player, this is how you're moving

614
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:55,108
through this dialogue possibility space,

615
00:24:55,108 --> 00:24:56,668
even if we show it to them after they've completed

616
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:59,190
the level, say, could be interesting.

617
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,430
That one's weird, I don't know.

618
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,851
We'll get to that maybe sometime.

619
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:06,378
and allowing for more traditional branching around puzzles,

620
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:08,720
making it that we actually give the IF players

621
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,083
what they want and let them have big story outcomes

622
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:12,684
of their actions.

623
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:15,867
That's really just down to focus and time on my part,

624
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:19,370
writing more stuff, not coming to GDC,

625
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,613
and just staying in my room, writing stuff.

626
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:29,561
And then finally, of course, because this is a GDC talk,

627
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,364
procedural generation, randomization, spawning.

628
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,107
We had some randomization that was really interesting.

629
00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:38,009
I think the only thing that survived into Subsurface

630
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,433
is that the listener characters have different names

631
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:42,734
each time you play it.

632
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:47,699
The original version was much more randomized and varied

633
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:49,140
and as a result, terrible.

634
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:52,962
which is why we went much more linear down the road.

635
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:53,963
But I do think there is stuff.

636
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:56,504
There is quote unquote filler dialogue.

637
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:59,225
There are conversations that could happen

638
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,767
that don't need to be the core dialogue of the game.

639
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,828
The equivalent of getting, we were talking about extras

640
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,889
earlier, the equivalent of getting extras

641
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:08,190
to throw in a line of dialogue to establish a scene.

642
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,831
Why couldn't that be handled by something

643
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:11,752
that's just throwing in some random options

644
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:13,773
or built systemically so it's reacting

645
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,014
to what the player's doing or what the world's doing?

646
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:18,776
There are opportunities there which we can explore.

647
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,934
And the final slide, so if anyone has any questions,

648
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:24,875
get up, I think I'm gonna have time for one.

649
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,495
Potential for level design in other fields.

650
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:27,856
I wanna broaden this out,

651
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:30,357
because I do think there's an opportunity here,

652
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:32,117
I hope, to take level design principles

653
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,458
like the ones I've talked about,

654
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,999
and apply them in other areas of game development.

655
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:37,319
Because you're probably not all working

656
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,280
on dialogue-based pretentious robot detective novels.

657
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,161
So we can probably broaden it a bit more.

658
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:46,818
We already see navigation and exploration

659
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:50,422
built into progressive system, into progression systems.

660
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:51,663
I like that in Shadow of War,

661
00:26:51,663 --> 00:26:54,126
there's some interesting branching that's starting to go on.

662
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,309
Feels like a level, feels like moving through a space,

663
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:57,991
which is interesting.

664
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,372
Of course, quest and mission systems,

665
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:02,435
we're already seeing great innovation in this area.

666
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:03,797
Probably there's room for more.

667
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,281
I really don't like, I'm a big AAA fan.

668
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:09,382
That's most of what I play

669
00:27:09,382 --> 00:27:11,063
because I spend all day making indie games.

670
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:14,805
I kind of want to relax with a great open world AAA game.

671
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:17,246
And it's weird to me that the map isn't used more,

672
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:19,788
that we don't find more opportunities to do level design

673
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,829
and game design at the map screen level

674
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:24,330
because those games are about these massive worlds.

675
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,271
Surely there's some stuff, I keep hitting the mic, sorry.

676
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,013
Surely there's some stuff that we can kind of do

677
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:31,414
with that screen as well and kind of.

678
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:33,976
either tell interesting stories on that screen

679
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:36,358
or allow progression or movement on that screen

680
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:37,279
that's interesting.

681
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,581
And I wanted to point out specifically Horizon.

682
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,503
I loved Horizon for a lot of reasons,

683
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:45,986
but I would put the enemy design in Horizon

684
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:48,348
up with a lot of the stuff I'm talking about here.

685
00:27:48,348 --> 00:27:49,929
Those bosses all feel like levels.

686
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:51,530
They're just levels that happen to be trying to kill me.

687
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:53,816
over and over again.

688
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:55,918
And that's cool.

689
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:58,299
As I'm playing those levels, it's not just finding the

690
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:00,300
sensitive spots. There's a causality

691
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,802
and a progression to those attacks

692
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:04,222
which feels really good as a player.

693
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:06,163
It feels like something I can learn and get better at

694
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:07,724
and that I can master.

695
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:09,525
And that feels like that's a great opportunity

696
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:10,406
that that game takes advantage of.

697
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:11,447
Cool. I've managed to do this

698
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:12,307
with, I think, two minutes to spare.

699
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,702
Is that right?

700
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:20,045
Yes, I'm getting a thumbs up.

701
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:21,427
So probably time for one question.

702
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:22,690
Thank you very much for your time.

703
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,315
I really appreciate it.

704
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:25,636
Awesome.

705
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:29,644
One question.

706
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,282
Yes, hello. Oh, remember to do your evaluation things as well. Hello.

707
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:39,625
Hey, in the middle of Subcircus Circular there's one conversation with a character that brings up,

708
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:43,648
it's half joke, half lore, where they start reciting the dialogue from Thomas Was Alone.

709
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,268
Yes.

710
00:28:44,268 --> 00:28:48,792
Where does that, I mean like the quickest level design lens is that it's like putting an old

711
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:52,874
version of a game into a new version like Wolfenstein does. How do you think something

712
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:56,697
like that could be built on using the philosophies you just talked about in the last 30 minutes?

713
00:28:56,989 --> 00:29:00,230
That's really interesting. Yeah, it's a joke. I mean, that's the main reason it's there.

714
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,611
It's kind of a... So, yeah, in the world, there's a priest,

715
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:07,472
and during the writing process, when I was thinking, okay, well, what's this priest?

716
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,612
Do I want to, like, give him a specific human religion?

717
00:29:09,612 --> 00:29:12,993
He's like, oh, well, Thomas was alone. He's about the emergence of gods.

718
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:15,393
Let's make him a believer in Thomas was alone.

719
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:18,994
And then he recites Thomas was alone to you. If you ask him to, and he will stop.

720
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:22,595
If you tell him to, and he'll eventually stop, because I got bored of copying and pasting

721
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,676
all of the Thomas was alone dialogue. He eventually goes, that's enough.

722
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:28,398
Yeah, I think it's an Easter egg right now.

723
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:29,959
It literally is the Wolfenstein thing

724
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:33,302
of just hiding a Wolfenstein level in Wolfenstein.

725
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:36,204
But yeah, I think the idea of returning to stuff,

726
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:38,766
of having impact, using players' knowledge

727
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:41,188
of previous games in that circumstance,

728
00:29:41,188 --> 00:29:44,871
having a situation where you have a more meaningful thing.

729
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,592
So there's one of the things that's in there

730
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:48,434
for the hardcore Thomas Was Alone fans

731
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:49,995
is one of the names you can give your character

732
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:51,857
at the start of the game is Claire,

733
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:52,957
who's a very important character

734
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,599
to the Thomas Was Alone fan base.

735
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,101
And if you play that character as Claire,

736
00:29:58,101 --> 00:29:59,842
then there's kind of this soft implication

737
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:02,424
that maybe you're related to that character from Thomas,

738
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:06,527
and that kind of fits and tracks narratively.

739
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:08,848
So I think there is that kind of deeper way of doing it.

740
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,229
In terms of like level design.

741
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:11,741
That's interesting.

742
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,863
There's probably other more exciting ways

743
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:14,363
of doing that as well.

744
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:15,724
And also bringing data across

745
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:17,625
and having that kind of Mass Effect style

746
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,427
game to game continuity would be interesting.

747
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:22,289
I think I'm probably out of time.

748
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:25,030
This says I am.

749
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,511
I'm very excited to tell you about,

750
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:27,432
in 20 minutes from now.

751
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:30,215
a brilliant talk that I've made a mental note of

752
00:30:30,215 --> 00:30:32,577
called An Architectural Approach to Level Design

753
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:35,800
Creating an Art Theory for Game Worlds.

754
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,380
And so can you.

755
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,362
I'm pretty sure I read that wrong.

756
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,224
But it genuinely, I was chatting to him last night

757
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:41,104
about it, it's really cool.

758
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:42,526
So do stick around and watch that.

759
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,307
That'll be really neat.

760
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:45,368
I think there's a 20 minute break now.

761
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:46,830
If anyone wants to chat, I'm going to be around here

762
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,752
and I'd love to talk to you about video games and stuff.

763
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:50,713
Thanks a lot for your time.
