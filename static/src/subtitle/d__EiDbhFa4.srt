1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,181
Alright then, welcome to GDC 2016.

2
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:13,962
I'm happy that I can open very early for all of us.

3
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:17,423
And thank you for attending this session, despite the timing.

4
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:20,824
I'm going to talk about how we experienced Hitman,

5
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:23,044
a game I hope many of you have heard about,

6
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,805
and the first season where we're currently in the middle of that.

7
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:29,662
I would like to open with one short slide about myself,

8
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:31,042
that you know who's talking.

9
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:33,903
And I like defining myself actually more with my games

10
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:35,443
than with anything else.

11
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:39,664
I started rather early in 1987 on the Commodore 64.

12
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:43,925
So yes, I've been making games for 29 years now.

13
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:46,066
I was freelancer for six years.

14
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:49,606
13 years I was at a company called Neo Software, which

15
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:50,627
became Rockstar Vienna.

16
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:53,767
After that, I started Gims That Matter,

17
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:54,807
which became Deep Silver.

18
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:56,208
I was there for four years.

19
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:59,987
And now I'm, for six and a half years, I'm with Square Enix,

20
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:03,589
and I'm now a studio head at Iron Interactive in Copenhagen,

21
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,990
and we are known for many games like Minion Ninjas,

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,031
Freedom Fighters, the Kane and Lynch series,

23
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:11,512
but most of all for Hitman,

24
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:13,773
and that's what I want to talk about today.

25
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:18,454
So the main points, I will try to keep it concise

26
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,575
because it is a lot to take in.

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,352
and I want you to get something out of this presentation.

28
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:27,634
So I will give you a short overview of Hitman,

29
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:29,655
what the brand is, what the game is,

30
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:31,536
because that is the foundation,

31
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:33,037
the baseline that we started with,

32
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,138
and that's why that is relevant to understand.

33
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:38,079
The majority of this talk today will be about

34
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,081
what we call internally Hitman 2016,

35
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:43,682
because it's the sixth game in the series,

36
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:48,165
but it's the first game that we just called plain Hitman.

37
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,640
and lacking a subtitle, we dubbed it 2016.

38
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,001
And I will take you through our initial vision

39
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,522
that we had for the project, what happened over the years,

40
00:01:59,082 --> 00:01:59,822
how we launched it.

41
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:02,083
And now it's been running for a few months,

42
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:04,183
and I will go through the ups and downs of that.

43
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:07,264
I will have a core focus on takeaway points

44
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:08,144
and lessons learned.

45
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:11,045
I know that you cannot apply all of these

46
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:12,525
to your personal situations.

47
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,966
I hope you'll find some interesting

48
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,226
and some very applicable.

49
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:17,958
Others perhaps not so.

50
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,902
I also want to encourage you if you have any questions after the presentation, please come

51
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:23,202
to me.

52
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:27,665
I will try to spend another 15 minutes or so after this is over if you want to have

53
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:28,786
individual questions.

54
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:32,569
So this is the main thing I want to give you, the key lessons.

55
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:38,233
And then at the end, if there is some time left, then we'll have some Q&A publicly here

56
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:43,497
where I think we'll go through with the microphone as far as I know and do some public questions.

57
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:44,578
All right?

58
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:46,772
Let's right get into it.

59
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,374
And let me give you a short overview of Hitman.

60
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:57,555
The game has been around as a franchise for 16 years now on the marketplace.

61
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:00,256
And that was our starting point.

62
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:04,056
It was after the fifth game, which was Hitman Absolution.

63
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:07,437
We had shipped five up to that point in time in the 12 years.

64
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:08,998
Hitman Absolution shipped 2012.

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,829
And by that point in time, it was the best-selling Hitman game in the franchise.

66
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:17,209
So we saw a good uptake over the years.

67
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:19,590
It won 41 best game awards and so on.

68
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,190
But not enough self-promotion.

69
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,871
Let's look at the interesting things that happened with Hitman Absolution.

70
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:29,212
It was the first game where we had a major online component.

71
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:36,794
And we tracked 11.3 million unique online players in a game that, as a series, was predominantly

72
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:40,195
experienced as a single-player third-person stealth game.

73
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:46,966
We had a multiplayer mode that is an asynchronous multiplayer mode.

74
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,728
Let me ask, has anyone of you played Hitman Absolution in here?

75
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:51,309
Quite a few.

76
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,751
Contracts mode?

77
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:54,972
Okay, good.

78
00:03:54,992 --> 00:04:01,137
So, contracts mode was our asynchronous multiplayer mode where you created a hit on any NPC, more

79
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,479
or less, any NPC in the game.

80
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,382
And then you could send it out to the community, or you could send it to a friend, you could

81
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:07,563
challenge each other and become better.

82
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:13,918
It was something that got inspired by what people already did with Blood Money and older games on YouTube,

83
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:16,920
where they created playthroughs and they shared videos and stuff like that.

84
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,302
But the online mode was so successful that the amount of hours played in it,

85
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:25,665
it made the single-player campaign pale in comparison completely.

86
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,606
And that was very inspiring for us.

87
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:31,928
1.4 million users in total created these contracts.

88
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:35,251
which is, I don't remember the hands exactly,

89
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:37,214
but I think it's good representation.

90
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:40,678
People playing, about 10% of them playing contracts

91
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,860
and creating stuff as well.

92
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,583
And 30 million contracts,

93
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,066
these are the missions that users created,

94
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:48,608
were played up to today.

95
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,971
And that is a huge number for us.

96
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:54,016
and they were also ranked and so on.

97
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,398
At the top contract, that means a player-created mission,

98
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,321
was played 1.4 million times.

99
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:03,425
And that was, actually this is platform-dependent

100
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,347
because you cannot share them across platforms.

101
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:06,989
So that was a big number.

102
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,372
And interestingly enough, this number is from June 2016.

103
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:13,295
We still have 300,000 unique monthly active players.

104
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:23,726
in a game that runs on Xbox 360 and PS3, and of course also on PC, and it shipped in November

105
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:30,849
2012, and in a game where we did nothing to sustain a proper community.

106
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,290
So that was the starting point for us.

107
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,092
The brand itself is also pretty well known.

108
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:41,914
If you just Google the English word Hitman and look at the images, this is what the first

109
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:42,334
page is.

110
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:47,136
So we kind of own the word Hitman, it's associated with Agent 47.

111
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,977
And it also makes it, I'd say, a love brand.

112
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,858
It's more than just a game series.

113
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:56,839
You know, they are like two movies, they're novels, they're figurines,

114
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,360
they're clothing lines, and all that kind of stuff.

115
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:04,442
And some fans make it a big part of their personal life.

116
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:08,343
And I'm telling you that because when you want to change something

117
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,184
as fundamental as how people consume a game,

118
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,428
how people might consume your game or your brains you're working on,

119
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:18,249
you have to deal with that. You have very dedicated people that will have a very

120
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:19,729
strong opinion on what you're creating.

121
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:24,190
So we took the success that we had with the online service

122
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,350
and what the community did with it,

123
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:28,971
and that was the foundation for the vision.

124
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:32,632
And now I want to explain to you why, after

125
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:36,353
the game has been around for such a while and was actually pretty successful,

126
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:38,093
why change anything at all.

127
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,413
It's because times are changing as well.

128
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:47,179
So in a very, very high bullet list, high level bullet list, let's talk about Hitman 2016, what we wanted to achieve.

129
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,524
We wanted to focus on the player freedom and the creative sandbox gameplay that made the series great.

130
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:56,225
That's the bedrock of the series.

131
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,707
That so far is nothing new.

132
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:05,832
But we wanted to go into the current generation and make it like the biggest and most complex Hitman sandbox ever built.

133
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:07,853
So we had to ramp up our technology for that.

134
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,394
But most of all, we wanted with the first game, build a foundation for a life and ever-expanding

135
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,176
world that we called our world of assassination.

136
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:23,060
A first game of more to come, a platform more or less where people can play with each other,

137
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,682
share stuff, and continue playing over the years to come.

138
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:33,127
Let me take you through some of the opportunities that you have and that we saw and back then

139
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,688
already were pretty convinced of.

140
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:39,788
when you go into this live, episodic AAA approach.

141
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:43,430
Where, at the end of the day, we were the first ones to do it.

142
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,273
Over the years we worked on it, we weren't sure about that, because I know others are

143
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,434
also thinking and trying and moving in this direction.

144
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:54,317
But at the end, we were the first ones, and that meant a lot of resistance, and it also

145
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:55,738
meant a lot of successes.

146
00:07:56,358 --> 00:08:01,302
The opportunities we saw is, we started with this 2013, so after we launched it in AppSolution

147
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:02,963
and seeing how the online mode takes off.

148
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:11,549
But over the years, already mid-development, we saw that the overall market started to transition to digital.

149
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,291
Also on consoles. I mean, PC is very digital, right?

150
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:17,572
PC sales are mostly online anyways nowadays.

151
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,113
But also on the consoles.

152
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,694
Let me show you from Activision.

153
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:24,555
That is deliberately November 2014.

154
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:31,018
It was the Q3 result, and they had 67% of their Q3 revenue.

155
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,800
All of Activision Blizzard was digital.

156
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:38,385
That included, of course, World of Warcraft and other games from Blizzard,

157
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,406
but it also included all the other offline games they did.

158
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:45,227
And mine, that was before Overwatch or Hearthstone.

159
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,067
So that is really remarkable.

160
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:50,968
And then we saw this overall market trend.

161
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:54,249
This is either a market research institute that published that,

162
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:59,650
that went from 2008 to 2014 just looking at the consoles.

163
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,651
And this is the share of physical only.

164
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:08,121
physical only, digital only, and digital and physical mixed within 90 days.

165
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:16,809
You can see that physical only is marginalized, and that digital only has been the majority

166
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:17,330
already since 2012.

167
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,474
Admittedly, if you look at releases, you have a lot of small games that come on Xbox Live

168
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:27,779
Arcade and platforms like that, so the amount of titles is not totally representative, but

169
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,502
the trend was undeniable already at that point in time.

170
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:37,687
When you are online, when you are live, when you have a service running, you can be way

171
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,568
more open and inclusive towards your fans.

172
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:44,670
And that was very important to us, because we are not necessarily the most mainstream

173
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,310
game out there.

174
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,652
We are a game that is perceived as hard, as difficult, as a thinking man's game.

175
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:52,873
And we wanted to be close to the fans and be able to react.

176
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:57,094
Between Blood Money and Absolution, it took us six years to make a game.

177
00:09:57,174 --> 00:10:00,155
And that is a very long time to react to any feedback that you get.

178
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:08,089
Also mind that your margin when you sell a game digitally is over two times bigger than when you sell a disc.

179
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,832
And what that does to you is that you can tailor your game to your fans,

180
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,655
instead of actually looking for the lowest common denominator.

181
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:22,420
Because you do not have to sell the same amount of units to reach the same amount of profitability.

182
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,841
And that gives you creative freedom.

183
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:31,183
That was a key point for us. We wanted to go back to the formula of blood money that made the game great and successful,

184
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,984
but it also made it difficult for some people to play.

185
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:37,145
And in order to do that, digital was a great opportunity for us.

186
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:44,508
It also helps to make games that are a bit different than, you know, many of the big AAA blockbuster games on disc.

187
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:50,290
They have a tendency to kind of become alike, and we didn't want to be like that.

188
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,491
And that's an opportunity you have for that.

189
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,542
You can also innovate faster, as I said, faster than six years for sure.

190
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:00,305
You can innovate within weeks, sometimes within days.

191
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:02,667
You can balance something within days.

192
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,129
You can add a feature perhaps within months.

193
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,310
You can add content within a few months.

194
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,671
You don't have to wait years for that.

195
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:13,275
That is much more often, much better, that ultimately leads to better games.

196
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:19,841
You can also, on the marketing side and on the community and social media side, see more

197
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:23,043
coverage because you have events, you have content coming, and so on.

198
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,216
For me, given a recent example, let's say Uncharted 4 was a huge hype, right?

199
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:31,118
Fantastic game, huge hype.

200
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,623
After the launch, people stopped talking about it.

201
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:39,859
Because it is this kind of game that is a great weekend experience, it's linear, you

202
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,000
don't replay it that often.

203
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,321
If you have a live game, people are still talking about Destiny, or not to mention World

204
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:50,763
of Warcraft and Overwatch and League of Legends and so on.

205
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:54,464
Some of them are very different to Hitman, but these are games that people engage with

206
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:59,185
continuously, and that also gives you coverage.

207
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:02,446
I personally perhaps overestimated that.

208
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:07,321
because we experienced most people buying the full pack, the full price,

209
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:11,182
but it still opens the opportunity for more flexible pricing models.

210
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:15,084
In our case, we had a so-called intro pack that we sold for $15.

211
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:18,725
And that helps people to get on board without spending $60.

212
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,406
Perhaps they can't even spend that much.

213
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:22,827
Perhaps they don't want to spend that much,

214
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:25,287
because they just want to try it out and see whether it's a game for them.

215
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:27,268
So that's an opportunity as well.

216
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,790
And last, but absolutely not least,

217
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:35,627
You are very close to your players, and your players are very close to you.

218
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:36,788
Trust me, very close.

219
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:41,251
You hear all of their opinions, all of their views, and that's a very positive thing, in my opinion.

220
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:47,996
I personally went into games to entertain people, if I may say so, to make people happy.

221
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:53,260
And seeing people play our games also gives me job satisfaction.

222
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,703
And when you're live and online, and when you have a game that evolves and changes over time,

223
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,264
this is where you can be closer than ever before.

224
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,462
We had a huge distance when I began, like 30 years back.

225
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,863
The distance was gigantic.

226
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:08,505
It became a bit smaller and smaller over the years,

227
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:10,627
and now we're as close as I can imagine to be.

228
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,008
And that is really great.

229
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,089
In order to pull it off, though,

230
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,372
you need to change a lot of minds.

231
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,655
You need to make people come on board with you.

232
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,617
And I'm gonna take you through a short list of things

233
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,798
that we had to do over the time,

234
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,540
and I would like you to be mindful of as well.

235
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,987
So first of all, your shareholders need to be on board with what you're doing there,

236
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:36,228
because you have a completely new sales and development strategy.

237
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:41,190
And that can be scary, so you need someone to back that vision and understand why you're doing it.

238
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:44,411
You need your development team to be on board with you.

239
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:50,246
because it's fine if a studio head or an executive producer or a lead programmer, they have the

240
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:54,008
vision and believe in it. But everybody working on the game should have trust in what you're

241
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:59,271
doing. The uncertainty of facing something that unknown after having had a success formula

242
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:04,874
is something you shouldn't underestimate. You need to take it seriously. It's also legit.

243
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:10,557
It changes risk, right? You need to take your dev team on board. You need to have your publisher

244
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,598
on board, of course.

245
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:16,710
because many publishers, it's been changing, but when we started with that in 2013,

246
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:23,117
you know, there was not that much experience in selling a big amount of units at a high price digitally.

247
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,943
That was the world of free-to-play and browser games and stuff like that back then, right?

248
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:30,786
And that's also a big change of mind.

249
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:37,331
Then you have your sales teams, the people that actually are in the territories trying to put boxes somewhere.

250
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,033
Obviously and naturally, they're afraid of their jobs if they hear digital,

251
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:43,414
because they see their workers pushing discs.

252
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:46,195
But you need them, because you're still selling.

253
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,256
You need to sell in the territories.

254
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:49,516
You even need retail.

255
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:53,518
I mean, we do things like ESD cards and then other opportunities

256
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:58,120
that bring the game to people who don't see it online, but still can buy it digitally.

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,881
So sales is important, but you need to have these people support you as well.

258
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:03,886
Then there are the first parties.

259
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:07,187
Who is developing for consoles here?

260
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:09,908
Not many. No console developers here?

261
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,888
All right. Okay, a few.

262
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,169
With first parties, obviously, you have a very close relationship

263
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:18,130
because a console is an encapsulated environment,

264
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,071
and you need to have them on board and they have their policies.

265
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:25,472
At that time, most of the policies we needed didn't even exist.

266
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:29,513
There wasn't a model for that for a full-price game.

267
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:31,793
Now there's more and more.

268
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:37,757
And I'm happy we were able to pioneer for ourselves, also for you and for other developers.

269
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,101
But trust me, even after so many months and so many years working,

270
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:42,984
there is always something new that comes up.

271
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,545
It's, oh, okay, that's a new policy.

272
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:45,947
We need to change something here.

273
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,629
Otherwise, we can't do this or that or that or that.

274
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,972
That is a continuous effort as well.

275
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:52,314
You have distribution partners.

276
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:57,567
So you might not sell everywhere yourself, you might not have publishing units in, I

277
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,649
don't know, Arabia or New Zealand or so.

278
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,453
So you need to find partnerships with them because naturally they ask, where's our margin

279
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:06,014
if we don't move boxes around?

280
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:10,078
So you need to find incentives and business models how you can work with these partners

281
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:11,359
to make that a success.

282
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,043
And last but not least, you need to have the players on board, the people that consume

283
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:16,343
your game.

284
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,661
Because, let's be honest, especially at the time when we started, there were too many

285
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:27,142
games out there that did something like early access or half-finished game, indie games

286
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:29,422
that never got finished, and people paid money for that.

287
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,023
Obviously, there was this, hey, you're selling us an unfinished game if it's episodic.

288
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:38,264
That is a very, very long way to get people to understand that.

289
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,505
You always get some on board.

290
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:44,766
You might get many on board, but it takes a long time to convince the majority of your

291
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:45,066
players.

292
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:50,913
And then of course you have our friends at the press that also want to talk about what

293
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:51,633
you're doing there.

294
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:54,474
And you know, press loves innovation.

295
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,116
When you do something new, they're really supportive and eager, but they also need to

296
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,156
find words to talk about it.

297
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:04,598
And that's tricky, because we needed to find words how to talk about it.

298
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,699
So often it was understood, but then how does it work again?

299
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:08,400
What's the detail?

300
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,140
And especially, what can I call it?

301
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,161
What can I compare it to?

302
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:16,945
Now people can compare it to Hitman, but it took a while to actually get there, and that's

303
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:17,605
understandable.

304
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:21,987
If you do something new, and I assume you're also here not only thinking about copying

305
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:27,829
exactly what we did, if you try to move something into this space, you need to think about that.

306
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:34,332
What we actually did in the first years before we went out, on top of our partners we worked

307
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:39,174
with internally, we also had external partners and tools, and we established structures,

308
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:41,275
how we could actually run and develop a service.

309
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:47,007
We did continuous market research with two main partners.

310
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:52,449
One is the Big Solutions Group, which is a company that takes the journalistic angle

311
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,250
on what you're doing.

312
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,051
They do mock reviews, so they give you like meta-critic predictions and stuff like that.

313
00:17:57,471 --> 00:18:02,072
But most of all, they also help you to get feedback from different angles, like the consumer

314
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,593
magazine, the technical magazine's point of view.

315
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:08,515
That helped us to shape what we are doing and how we are doing it.

316
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:12,444
We worked with a company called Eder, which is an analyst service.

317
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:17,347
It's a real market research institute, statistically data-based.

318
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,868
They helped us to look at the trends of the digital market.

319
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:25,531
Is there even enough digital market to justify the development and publishing budget of a

320
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,471
game like Hitman?

321
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:32,774
Because it's a different thing whether you ship 50 small games or one big game and hope

322
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:36,997
that this one big game is actually able to recover and recoup your costs.

323
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:52,921
We did continuous user research. That's our internal team. We have a team in Montreal, we have a team in San Francisco, we have a team in Copenhagen, and that helps us to have a look at what players actually do.

324
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:59,923
So we get players in, show them stuff, let them play the build, just ask them about that. That helped us as well because it's very close to the players.

325
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:05,184
We also established two steering groups. One was the internal steering group.

326
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:10,453
So, looking at what happened in the game to decide what to do with development.

327
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:16,675
As of now, we meet daily, not that the platform is running, but in the beginning it was every

328
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:18,916
few months, every month, and so on.

329
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:23,357
Then we established a war room group, we call it, which is our international publishing

330
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:24,917
and marketing teams, our partners.

331
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:29,298
We meet weekly, and that does more or less the same on the sales and marketing side.

332
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:34,796
And what we use there is we use what we call the hard facts and the soft facts.

333
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:36,177
And we collect this data.

334
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:39,739
And the hard facts is what people do in the game.

335
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,002
What features do they use, what levels do they play, how many hours do they clock in,

336
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:45,562
stuff like that.

337
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:48,104
The soft facts is what people tell you.

338
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:51,826
What emails do they send you, but most of all, what do they tweet, what do they put

339
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:55,107
on Facebook, what's in the Hitman forum, what's on Reddit, and that kind of stuff.

340
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:58,069
And they tell you what people do and what people say.

341
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:00,150
That's not necessarily always the same.

342
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:04,686
So you need to be careful that when you collect this data, how you base your decisions, because

343
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:09,747
you don't want to alienate 95 people based on the feedback of a vocal 1%.

344
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:14,668
So that is what we're doing, and that's what we use to steer the project.

345
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,810
All right, now let's see how that went in reality.

346
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,470
Because now let's take you through how we executed that.

347
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,652
I will give you a short overview of the timeline.

348
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:31,194
So let's start from the announcement of the game

349
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:31,634
in June 2015.

350
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:35,356
And let's talk, look, up to almost today.

351
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:37,517
Actually, tomorrow.

352
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,059
So we announced the game at E3 2015.

353
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,161
And there was actually a really successful announce for us.

354
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,063
We had a lot of good reactions.

355
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:54,295
But then a lot of freshening began, so we had event after event after event where we

356
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:57,196
explained what we did, we explained what we did, we explained what we did.

357
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,859
We tried to find our language, how to talk about it, and to show people what we're doing.

358
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:10,384
All that time, in the background, we had a closed alpha with a bit over 1,000 hand-selected

359
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:15,727
players that were already running the game, running the service, and playing with us.

360
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:19,179
That was very important for us, also, for a change of minds.

361
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,981
Then we had a beta that started a few weeks before we launched the game.

362
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:30,005
It ran for a few weeks, and that was the final change in tweaking with the actual public.

363
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:34,887
And then, we didn't launch the game, we premiered a season.

364
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:36,948
So this is when we started with it.

365
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:42,291
And then we tried to keep a major extension of our role of assassination every month.

366
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,993
We had Italian level, American level, the most recent was summer bonus episode.

367
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:53,056
And actually tomorrow, we're going to launch Bangkok in Thailand.

368
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:54,717
So that's the most recent extension.

369
00:21:55,477 --> 00:22:01,360
And while this season is running with a major content coming, we also have what we call

370
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,221
the weekly pulse.

371
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,924
So we have live features that are like events.

372
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:09,007
We call them elusive targets, or we have so-called escalation contract and challenges.

373
00:22:09,347 --> 00:22:10,388
These are things that happen.

374
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:13,370
And actually, I'm very proud of our development team.

375
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,873
So far, we have really managed that we can extend the content of the game every single

376
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:19,273
week.

377
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:23,016
I think that's important because you want to keep people engaged.

378
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,657
I'll get a little bit into more detail very soon.

379
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:30,961
But now let's have a look at this early announcement phase because that was interesting.

380
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,326
First of all, when we announced the game, there was a lot of surprise.

381
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:41,398
I was surprised that people were surprised that IO announces doing another Hitman game.

382
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,219
I think that wasn't the biggest surprise.

383
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:46,180
But people were also surprised about what we did with the game.

384
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,142
And we had headlines like, we're changing the way games are played.

385
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:51,223
It's awesome.

386
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:53,264
We might change games with Hitman.

387
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,564
Scrinix will change everything.

388
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:56,725
It's a fantastic assassination game.

389
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:58,086
It's a great game.

390
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,267
We completely get it.

391
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:01,047
And we thought, fantastic.

392
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:02,088
Score.

393
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:04,149
What we are doing, everybody understands.

394
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,612
Within less than 24 hours, this surprise changed into utter confusion.

395
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:11,893
It was really surprising.

396
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:14,134
Okay, this is Hitman, but wait, it's not on a disc?

397
00:23:14,474 --> 00:23:15,715
Yeah, but we told you it's not a disc.

398
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:16,596
Yeah, no, but really?

399
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:17,336
Why?

400
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:17,756
What?

401
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:18,056
How?

402
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:20,138
So then we had headlines like these.

403
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:25,741
So, that Ion Interactive explains Hitman's confusing digital release plan.

404
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,283
Hitman confusion hints at gamers' mistrust.

405
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,705
That is the player part I mentioned before.

406
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:36,051
Hitman demands publisher trust we don't have.

407
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:41,574
And then we even coined a term that we internally used for a while that was in the headline

408
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,415
called the Hitman situation.

409
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:45,696
That was really interesting.

410
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:48,498
We had also more confusion in the actual community.

411
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:52,120
People were arguing back and forth about it already.

412
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,621
They were saying, hey, I really want this to be good.

413
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:57,523
I don't want it to be so great that others might do the same.

414
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:00,765
That was something weird to take in.

415
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:04,489
Then, of course, the other thing, why not? It's flexible. Isn't that a good thing to do?

416
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:11,491
The whole design is terrible because if it tanks at launch, we'll not get content anymore.

417
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,511
We'll rip us off. That was a fear that players had.

418
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:20,073
I understand that when you come from an early access marketplace, for instance.

419
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:24,874
Obviously, as a public company, you can't promise one thing and then not deliver it.

420
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:26,434
But players don't understand that.

421
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:29,715
They don't understand the legal or financial background of a big publisher.

422
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,007
And they don't have to, right?

423
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:33,968
But that's something we had to deal with.

424
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:40,273
And then, that was a key recurring theme here, just the end is important.

425
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:45,497
So I have a feeling that a lot of people are going to feel ripped off come launch day.

426
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:49,660
Because obviously when you buy the whole game, the whole season, like a season pass, so to

427
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:55,185
speak, you pay your $60, you get the game, but they want the content is, of course, not

428
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:55,565
everything.

429
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:57,487
And that was a recurring theme.

430
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,782
And I need to tell you, we did not find a perfect way to answer these concerns.

431
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,783
We had to find the right voice for that.

432
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:10,025
So we decided to go with something rather straightforward, with the Q&A.

433
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:15,968
We had a video blog done, and we thought about AMAs on Reddit, and we had all kinds of ideas,

434
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:17,168
community events and so on.

435
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:21,990
But then we just decided, you know what, let's go for a Q&A, be straightforward with it.

436
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,031
We were at it for a long time.

437
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:30,773
And that explained quite a bit to the players, but after that we made what I think, looking

438
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:32,674
back, was our biggest mistake.

439
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:39,999
We became very concrete and we launched an infographics, actually two of them.

440
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:43,641
And these infographics were very specific.

441
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:47,984
And although they explained ambition and direction, obviously it makes it very tangible.

442
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:51,636
So, that's something going back I would not do anymore.

443
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:53,676
I think for us it was the wrong thing to do.

444
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:58,077
We had to keep adding more details at Gamescom or after Gamescom,

445
00:25:58,097 --> 00:26:02,599
which exactly a year ago we showed our first build to press.

446
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,259
We got good feedback there.

447
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,680
It's like, okay, this is Hitman coming home.

448
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,020
This is the blood money you've been looking for.

449
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:09,901
That's the Hitman game.

450
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:11,681
So we actually really achieved these goals.

451
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:12,321
But...

452
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:19,182
It stayed also in press and with the players, is yes, more content coming, coming, coming,

453
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:20,963
but how much is it going to be?

454
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:28,125
So let's look at the first three most important lessons we learned out of that, and let's

455
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:29,805
see what you can take out of that for yourself.

456
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:34,727
One is that being transparent can hurt you, and it can hurt you a lot.

457
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:39,068
We made the decision that from an ivory tower developer.

458
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:44,109
It makes this game, the publisher sells it, and we never talk to the fans, which we did

459
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,310
for the better half of 15 years.

460
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:50,012
It was a very, very long time we were closed, then we opened up.

461
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:56,236
January 2014, actually, we opened up with a letter to the fans where we explained that.

462
00:26:57,036 --> 00:27:02,619
But when you are open, you sometimes expect people to understand too much, because many

463
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:06,581
of you, you know the details and the problems and daily struggles of development.

464
00:27:07,415 --> 00:27:10,096
Taking people through that is a hard thing to do.

465
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:13,377
People don't trust the publisher.

466
00:27:13,577 --> 00:27:15,257
We are obviously an evil corporate company.

467
00:27:15,997 --> 00:27:19,918
No matter what you try to do, no matter how open you are, these things we also have to

468
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:20,738
take into account.

469
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,299
So what I would recommend to you, if you decide to change something on a franchise or a game

470
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:30,501
that people like and you have been working on for a long time, choose what fits your

471
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:30,841
vision.

472
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:34,682
Be open, be closed, show them everything, show them nothing.

473
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:40,556
but take it through. I think our main mistake was being very open, getting scared by some

474
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:46,041
of the reactions, then becoming overly corrective, and then going back and forth over too long

475
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:53,046
a time. I would recommend to take it through, the light will come, and it helps you to actually

476
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:59,371
keep your voice. Finding the right language, so how you talk about the change, is a huge

477
00:27:59,431 --> 00:27:59,791
challenge.

478
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:05,109
I would recommend using existing terms wherever possible.

479
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:10,911
We tried to avoid things like episodic or MMO in the beginning.

480
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:16,033
Episodic games were like telltale games, very different from our game experience.

481
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,233
We were not an MMO either.

482
00:28:17,253 --> 00:28:19,974
I mean, you're never really simultaneous multiplayer.

483
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:22,715
We're not like Destiny, but somehow we are.

484
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:27,068
We tried to avoid these comparisons, but that was not good either.

485
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:31,833
It's okay, we changed the voice to episodic, we explained what it is, why it is, how it works,

486
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:34,376
and that was a huge change for us.

487
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:36,898
It helped us to explain things better.

488
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:43,745
I do understand that you might not find the perfect word for every single thing that you're innovating,

489
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:45,687
but whenever you can, try to.

490
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:49,351
And these things together, also, when you look at other companies that are trying to

491
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:52,674
do that, there's a reason why, for instance, Valve doesn't talk to anybody.

492
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:56,958
They are not very public about what they do development-wise, or Niantic, or Riot, and

493
00:28:56,978 --> 00:28:58,319
so on.

494
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,601
And I think this comes from these two things.

495
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:04,524
It's hard to talk about some of the things you do, and most of all, being very transparent

496
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:06,966
can be very painful.

497
00:29:07,387 --> 00:29:10,610
And then, the third important point is a life game.

498
00:29:11,697 --> 00:29:14,559
in my humble opinion, must not be static.

499
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:20,042
If you set out with a game that you want to have live, and it runs for two, three years

500
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:24,145
in the future, and today you know what you're going to ship in 24 months, what features,

501
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:25,706
what level, then don't go live.

502
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:26,927
What's the point?

503
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:31,190
You cannot react to player feedback, you cannot make the game better, you just have a production

504
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,091
schedule that you then ship in a staggered release.

505
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:35,973
But that also means, when you talk about it...

506
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:43,042
Don't promise deliverables, promise ambition, and be as careful as possible not to make

507
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,465
this vague or interchangeable.

508
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:48,588
People might perceive everything as a promise that you make.

509
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:51,571
Work with partners that are also able to think that way.

510
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:56,356
Looking back at the distribution partners, the first parties, your publishing teams,

511
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,439
there is a certain...

512
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:03,682
ease, if I may say, to a static huge release at a given point in time.

513
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:07,563
You might shift dates, there are always some problems with development and submission and

514
00:30:07,584 --> 00:30:11,585
manufacturing, but it's very different from something that's running and constantly changing

515
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:12,085
and evolving.

516
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:14,906
So finding partners that understand that is very important.

517
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:21,468
All right, let's look at the next part, which is the time around our beta.

518
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:24,389
It was the time when people actually started playing the game.

519
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,230
The big change for us at that time...

520
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:34,455
that we faced, the clarity we gave, and the skepticism we received.

521
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:37,578
That was an effect of changing our tone.

522
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:40,560
And don't mistake skepticism with confusion.

523
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:45,244
So people were much clearer what we wanted, why we wanted it, and how we did it.

524
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:48,627
And some were rightfully skeptic about it.

525
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:53,111
But that's a good thing, because then people ask the right questions, you can think about

526
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:53,191
it.

527
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:56,353
They can make up their own decision how they want to consume the game.

528
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:03,900
We started actually with a cover story on Edge, but then we also had the first playable

529
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,660
for many people.

530
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:10,525
What we did is when we changed the way we talked about the game, and we changed also

531
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:15,449
the release model in a way to completely episodic, because it was easier to talk about, it was

532
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:17,250
the right thing, the game also felt better that way.

533
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:22,014
As an effect, we had to cancel the pre-orders on one of the platforms.

534
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:27,700
That, of course, was also an important message to get out because it was just another part

535
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,041
of this, how Ayo talks about Hitman.

536
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:37,004
People could reorder it instantly afterwards again, and actually most did, almost all did.

537
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:39,945
But it was another trip in this.

538
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:44,487
And then we got the headlines with, hey, it's fully episodic.

539
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:45,547
It's clear.

540
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,808
Hitman ditches confusing release model entirely.

541
00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:48,788
Now, fully episodic.

542
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,642
A short quote from this article I want to draw your attention to is that this change

543
00:31:55,943 --> 00:32:00,406
in the episodic game translates the intent into a language gamers understand.

544
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:07,571
The editor appreciates how flexible the publisher has become in the face of the feedback.

545
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,673
Both things are very important.

546
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:16,676
We found a way to talk about what we were doing, and we had our shareholder.

547
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:21,861
who trusted us and gave us the flexibility and was flexible enough themselves.

548
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,124
the perception was changed. The beta was the first consumer hands-on. Also, press, when

549
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:44,447
they got the preview built, the hand-on, that really helped us a lot. We got great, great

550
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:50,892
previews with that. Even the episodic model was understood. It was seen as the game that

551
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:57,077
we focused on and so on. Also, our online features, like the elusive targets and so

552
00:32:57,218 --> 00:33:02,922
on, were already understood. The community was very, very happy about that, too. That

553
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,864
happened in a relatively short amount of time.

554
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:09,075
It was a change of tone and actually proving, of course.

555
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:18,217
The lessons I would like to give you there is that if your message is complicated, and

556
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:20,878
unavoidably sometimes your message might be complicated.

557
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:23,199
Look at No Man's Sky, for instance.

558
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:26,579
They had a long time for people to understand what they were doing.

559
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,821
Games that innovate in what area, whatever, have complicated messages.

560
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:34,181
But don't deliver too many of them at once.

561
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:39,391
We actually made a very deliberate decision how we talked about changing the release model,

562
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:44,533
cancelling the pre-orders, and then how we're actually going to ship it and what the features

563
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:44,733
are.

564
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:50,974
So think like in messaging, one headline at a time, because otherwise you convoluted,

565
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:52,395
and that creates more confusion.

566
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:59,237
Then if I may say, if you're groundbreaking or trying to be groundbreaking in one area,

567
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:02,098
then be conservative in others.

568
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:05,999
Look at what are the bedrocks of what we have been doing successfully.

569
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:09,281
For us, it was our open-world sandbox gameplay.

570
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:10,702
People really loved that.

571
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:16,886
We were, I would say, surprisingly conservative about the core gameplay experience.

572
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:20,208
We just brought it to the new generation of hardware and times.

573
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:26,032
But choose what to innovate and what to keep steady.

574
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:29,414
That will help you, in my opinion.

575
00:34:29,953 --> 00:34:33,556
because then you have at least a certain bedrock that you can count on.

576
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:38,861
If you do a beta, and more and more companies do that, make a beta a beta.

577
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:43,045
I don't believe in betas that are just glorified demos, or less glorified demos.

578
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:48,710
But a beta also shouldn't be too broken if you're trying to be a more mainstream product

579
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,131
or have a bigger target audience.

580
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:55,096
You cannot take people through a complete alpha and expect them to understand the game.

581
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,942
But a beta can be a huge help for your development, obviously, but also for your marketing if

582
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:00,803
you time it right.

583
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:03,204
We did a lot with our beta, actually.

584
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:08,388
And because of the digital release, we could afford a five-week time span between beta

585
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:12,511
or the betas and releasing, and still change a lot in the game.

586
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,133
So we changed our opportunity system.

587
00:35:15,153 --> 00:35:20,176
That was actually one of the key things that gave us great scores in reviews.

588
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:22,298
That was a new feature in the game.

589
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:24,640
We changed our difficulty balancing, AI reactions.

590
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:30,036
We also even changed the complete setup of the second tutorial mission to make it more sandboxy.

591
00:35:30,616 --> 00:35:35,481
And we fixed a lot of stuff, a lot of problems we had, because the beta was actually very successful.

592
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:38,123
We fixed a lot of problems in the server connection.

593
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:41,586
And given how many problems we had at launch with the server connection,

594
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:45,410
I would say I don't want to imagine what it would have been like without the beta.

595
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,566
So that is something I want to give you.

596
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:54,687
If you can plan, if you have the luxury to plan, do a beta that can help you sell your

597
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:59,428
game but also gives you just about enough time to do the final most important tweaks.

598
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:01,469
All right.

599
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:08,330
Let's have a quick look at the actual launch.

600
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:11,451
Oh, it gets really interesting and hot.

601
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:15,792
So premiere to season.

602
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:22,492
And we came in really, really well when people played that one level.

603
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:25,192
It was the size that was recognized.

604
00:36:26,513 --> 00:36:29,193
It was the actual quality of the gameplay.

605
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:38,396
But also at launch, there was a certain group, a certain percentage that found it too short,

606
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:44,057
knowing there was more to come, knowing it was huge, but also knowing, hey, it's about

607
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:44,877
the sixth of the game.

608
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:52,951
and that affected us. So, very top line, we were praised for the best of Blood Money and

609
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:57,972
Absolution, hugely playable, non-linear sandbox, level design and gameplay quality. Nothing

610
00:36:58,012 --> 00:37:03,613
of this is new. Everything of these things we were praised for, the game had been praised

611
00:37:03,673 --> 00:37:10,374
for, for 15 years before. And we were criticized for the episodic release model, that it requires

612
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:14,915
live connectivity and we had on top of that launch serrations that we shouldn't have had.

613
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:18,501
And that combination was something that we got criticized for a lot.

614
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:20,903
I think also, to a certain extent, rightfully.

615
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,984
But we had to make a tough decision.

616
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:24,546
Do we want to avoid cheating?

617
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:29,489
Or do we want to have an easiest possible single player experience?

618
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:34,033
And we chose to avoid cheating because our vision is a life service.

619
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:37,675
Our vision is a platform where people can share and play with each other for years to

620
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:37,916
come.

621
00:37:38,316 --> 00:37:40,818
Life is important for us, not cheating is important for us.

622
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:46,586
When I look at some games from the Division team, for instance, they are also fighting

623
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:46,907
cheating.

624
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:49,128
It's a difficult thing to choose.

625
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:50,430
What do you prefer?

626
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,993
Obviously, Hitman, having been a single-player game, was more criticized for being online

627
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:58,276
than, let's say, an MMO or a first-person shooter.

628
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:06,023
The load times on some consoles, which was our problem, and we overlooked that, but because

629
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:10,646
it was a live game, we were able to fix it in two, three weeks or something like that.

630
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:15,133
So we were pretty fast with having the first fixes and made it better over the time of

631
00:38:15,153 --> 00:38:15,574
the service.

632
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:17,074
So these are the highlights.

633
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:24,078
But what it did is also polarize our community to an extent we hadn't seen before.

634
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:26,019
Every game polarizes in a way, right?

635
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:30,181
But for us, these two extreme ends were really, really big.

636
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:32,822
We had extreme strong voices, pro and con.

637
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:38,265
Interestingly, a lot of the negativity came from people who haven't played the game.

638
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:43,198
That's because people have strong opinions how things should be.

639
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:48,323
I think that's okay to a certain extent, but we are in an industry where things are changing.

640
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:52,968
If you look back at the 70s, we all come from acades, and the acades are like microtransactions

641
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:55,070
where you play a quarter to continue.

642
00:38:56,011 --> 00:38:57,533
That's kind of where we come from.

643
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:01,497
Things change, but some people think they shouldn't change.

644
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:07,304
There was what I call the I'll wait for the disc meme. It was a recurring thing. No matter

645
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:12,685
how good the review was, no matter what assets we put out and what people liked about trailers

646
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:17,426
and stuff like that, there was always scroll down, 10, 20 comments down, you'll find the

647
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:20,647
first, hey, I'll wait for the disc. Cool, I'll wait for the disc. I don't like the model,

648
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:25,968
I'll wait for the disc. That clashed with feedback and articles of people that, hey,

649
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:30,549
that's perfect. Hitman is the right game to do that. I really have the time to play that

650
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:32,329
level before I go to the next and the next.

651
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,540
That was an active player.

652
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,162
So what we actually had, what we saw,

653
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:40,486
is we were really happy with the start of the review scores.

654
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:44,690
And we had very, very bad user metacritic points.

655
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:47,393
This is actually from last week at launch.

656
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:48,614
That looked way worse.

657
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:53,018
And then we still have a comparably bad user metacritic.

658
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:57,260
That also led to an article on the Jingquisition that was called,

659
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,621
Hitman Got a Meta-Bombed.

660
00:39:58,942 --> 00:40:01,544
And I would actually, if you find the time and have the interest and courage,

661
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,886
you could try to find it and read through that,

662
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,208
because there are some good points in there.

663
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:10,492
And that went, at the same time, out like these things,

664
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:12,914
where people were writing articles about why you should buy it,

665
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,435
why it is good, why it is right.

666
00:40:15,736 --> 00:40:20,501
So now, let's have a quick look at what happens when you're out, because now...

667
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:23,380
Oh, you're the showrunner, I have in the title.

668
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:29,746
Showrunner is a term from television, which seemingly became popular when episodic and

669
00:40:29,946 --> 00:40:33,710
fragmented content became more and more popular and is running quite a lot now, just so you

670
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,050
know that.

671
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:40,616
But when you're running a season, you have submission after submission after submission,

672
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:41,396
and that follows.

673
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:45,880
You're heavily dependent on your whole infrastructure, on the third parties.

674
00:40:47,317 --> 00:40:50,437
on the internet service providers, on the cloud service providers.

675
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:54,698
So we work with Microsoft Azure, for instance, and obviously we need all these systems to

676
00:40:54,738 --> 00:40:54,938
run.

677
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,839
They do compute for us and they run part of the games.

678
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:00,260
You need first-party authentication.

679
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,560
You release globally, right?

680
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,261
You have partners everywhere, and it can happen so easily that one of the partners forgets

681
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:12,102
to switch one hour, like too early, too late, whatever.

682
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:12,682
That happens.

683
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:16,983
You always have to pitchforks in front of your doors because it's your game.

684
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:24,246
A little bit, to me, it felt like running a television network in the 70s.

685
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:27,568
There was always something that stopped something.

686
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:31,951
There was always something out of our controls, and it felt like, I can't get it right.

687
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:37,516
So that is something when you go live, I guess many of you have live experience, but also

688
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,098
when you go live for something that is bigger and you want to be close to the fans, you

689
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,200
will have to work with.

690
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:49,803
Key lesson from that part is that if you change something as fundamental, as a release model

691
00:41:49,963 --> 00:41:56,810
could be also something else, but it will affect your score negatively.

692
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,253
I recommend that you focus on the roots of your franchise in your game series.

693
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:05,138
Don't neglect what made your franchise great because that will help you to counterbalance

694
00:42:05,178 --> 00:42:05,218
it.

695
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:10,981
Everything that happens is your fault. It's no matter where the issue lies.

696
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:14,342
And I think that's okay, because you're close to the fans now.

697
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:15,643
Where else should they go?

698
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:18,804
They have a problem with their modem.

699
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,825
Of course they think, the connectivity is fucked up again.

700
00:42:23,746 --> 00:42:27,068
So tightly integrate your community team into the development team.

701
00:42:28,368 --> 00:42:29,249
Don't make them separate.

702
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:33,270
I think that is a really, really good thing to do.

703
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:37,172
It's not someone else's problem. It's your problem. You're running a live game.

704
00:42:38,538 --> 00:42:44,741
When you develop, avoid what I call death march style crunch, so wearing out your team

705
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:45,341
completely.

706
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:51,744
Don't do that, because it becomes mission critical that you can sustain a certain pace

707
00:42:52,284 --> 00:42:53,124
throughout the whole season.

708
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:59,107
It's unrealistic to think that nobody ever has to work a weekend, but aim for it.

709
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,028
Something goes wrong anyways.

710
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:06,410
You need to actually work with your release schedule accordingly, that you don't wear

711
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,910
people out.

712
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,591
and don't create a separate life team.

713
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:12,433
It's like, okay, this is the crunch team or the ship, and then there's the life team.

714
00:43:14,234 --> 00:43:16,735
I have not seen this really succeed yet.

715
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:20,137
I've heard some stories, but myself, I haven't seen it yet.

716
00:43:20,237 --> 00:43:23,879
Most people that run successful bigger services see this one team.

717
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,642
Everyone is in the life team because you're running a live game.

718
00:43:29,363 --> 00:43:30,503
So everybody's in the game team.

719
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:33,485
And they also avoid the second-class citizenship, right?

720
00:43:33,505 --> 00:43:35,947
So some people feel like, oh, they're just in the life team.

721
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:43,093
As the last part, let's have a look at how it has been going over the season.

722
00:43:44,734 --> 00:43:50,897
And I think that's interesting because we had this ups and downs and ups and downs and

723
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:51,557
ups and downs.

724
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:57,501
And when the season is running, we saw that the appreciation for what we were doing, what

725
00:43:57,581 --> 00:44:00,142
our vision was and what the game is, has actually increased.

726
00:44:00,242 --> 00:44:06,025
There was what I'd call a mid-season sentiment change that happened about two months, one

727
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:06,726
to two months back.

728
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:12,032
It was also our second drop that helped to explain what we were doing.

729
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:13,973
The level was received very, very well.

730
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:19,274
But it also brought people in to continue playing and seeing how it is fun to play for

731
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:20,375
a long amount of time.

732
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:26,176
And this was a funny article that actually still talked about what we had to prove.

733
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:29,095
We have to prove something with the episodic release.

734
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:33,637
Judging by the amount of people saying they will wait and see how it goes, or just pick

735
00:44:33,677 --> 00:44:37,119
up the disk version sometime in 2031, it definitely does.

736
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,841
We continuously have to prove something.

737
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:44,664
That's also a good thing, because you need to prove we're a service worth being in.

738
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:52,789
So we had very good headlines on it, and that was a sentiment that also came up.

739
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:56,251
This is the third episode we released.

740
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,441
Three episodes in, I'm now confident that Hitman is a bloodline successor wallet.

741
00:45:00,982 --> 00:45:02,862
Also something community starts to say.

742
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:10,266
Let me emphasize that I'm convinced the quality of Subyancer, which is our second level, would

743
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:15,928
not have been possible to that level without being a live game, without people playing

744
00:45:15,948 --> 00:45:20,150
the game, and without us looking at what they do and what they say.

745
00:45:21,031 --> 00:45:24,532
We really used that to make that better, and that worked very, very well for us.

746
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:31,955
Now let's go to charted territory, a few charts.

747
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:37,783
And I'm sorry I cannot show you the absolute numbers because we're a public company and

748
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:41,669
that information is unfortunately not public, but I can show you relative numbers.

749
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:47,689
So on this chart what you see is the red line is who enters the game as a new player each

750
00:45:47,729 --> 00:45:49,350
day and the total amount.

751
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:57,417
And this spike at the very beginning is months, so from June 2015 to March 11th, it's all

752
00:45:57,457 --> 00:45:59,719
the pre-orders that accumulated and got executed, right?

753
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:01,340
So this is your day one spike.

754
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,162
But the curve, let's zoom into this area here.

755
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:06,454
Let's look at that.

756
00:46:06,494 --> 00:46:10,897
That is interesting because it is very different to at least anything I have ever seen when

757
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,959
you have a AAA game release.

758
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,623
Because normally when you release a game, you have your day one spike, your week one

759
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:22,345
spike, perhaps a second week spike, and depending on your window, perhaps a Christmas spike,

760
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,167
but it becomes completely flat afterwards.

761
00:46:25,428 --> 00:46:28,049
We get new players every day.

762
00:46:30,351 --> 00:46:32,793
It's extremely steady, which is surprising.

763
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:33,573
This is months.

764
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:41,900
of more or less unchanged sales and new player behavior. That is without any discount. So

765
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,963
it's not that we did anything with the price drops and so on. That is very different. If

766
00:46:46,983 --> 00:46:51,506
that goes on for a long time, that's going to be great for us. Right now, at the beginning

767
00:46:51,526 --> 00:46:58,211
it was, okay, the start was not bad, could have been better. But after two weeks, it's

768
00:46:58,231 --> 00:46:59,912
like, okay, it's not really dropping off that bad.

769
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:06,179
we've become pretty steady. We're running really well. And 64% of these people still

770
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,284
buy, actually an increasing number, buy the $60 package. Because now they don't have to

771
00:47:12,324 --> 00:47:18,648
wait for the content to come, I assume. So we have, when we look at the daily active

772
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:23,993
players, a big impact with the monthly beats, so when we added levels to the game. And you

773
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,854
see that here pretty well.

774
00:47:26,556 --> 00:47:32,522
So when we launched the game and Sabienzer, Marrakesh, the bonus episodes, there is of

775
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:34,784
course a summer hall.

776
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:39,989
We of course, like all of us, I guess, felt the soccer European championship and stuff.

777
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:46,275
But what's interesting is that we also acquired a lot of new players when we launched our

778
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:51,160
main hardcore online feature, the Elusive Targets, which is actually...

779
00:47:51,964 --> 00:47:56,307
played by a smaller percentage than the other less hardcore features that are online, but

780
00:47:56,347 --> 00:48:01,151
I was very successful in driving the game forward and created spikes whenever we released

781
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:05,775
that. On top of that, we had these weekly pulses, where we have them still. Every week

782
00:48:05,815 --> 00:48:10,238
we have content that comes, the escalation contracts, featured contracts, and so on,

783
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:14,422
and the elusive targets. The elusive targets is a hardcore feature where you have a mission.

784
00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:21,027
This mission is there for like two to four days, and you can only play it once. You kill

785
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:21,508
the target.

786
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:26,705
you're done. That's how you did it. It escapes, it's over, and if you don't play it in a time

787
00:48:26,745 --> 00:48:30,546
window, the target is gone as well. It will never come back. So that is something that

788
00:48:30,606 --> 00:48:36,147
is very successful in the core audience. And the red ones are the times when you had elusive

789
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:40,468
targets. So we played around with frequency, looking what that does, and they changed the

790
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:41,748
activity remarkably.

791
00:48:42,845 --> 00:48:46,067
They bring people back. Actually, this big junk here brought a lot of people back, and

792
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:50,109
it was killing Gary Busey. Obviously, it seems to be everybody likes to kill Gary Busey.

793
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,812
We thought it was just a marketing stunt, but it was actually very much liked by the

794
00:48:54,832 --> 00:49:00,756
community. Then, a short overview on the actual player

795
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:06,099
activity and what players play. I found it interesting to see that as long as there was

796
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:10,342
only one piece of content, that's a tutorial, available, people played that.

797
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:13,708
And then when the next one came out, they still played it.

798
00:49:14,348 --> 00:49:18,489
The new one, that's the green one, but they kept playing the other as well, and that went

799
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:23,590
on and on and on, up to the level where we have now six missions out, and people almost

800
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,630
play them at equal amounts.

801
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:30,471
Because of the new features, because of the live activities, and so on.

802
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:34,492
So this is when it really started to work for us.

803
00:49:37,902 --> 00:49:41,985
It was the episodic success, it was the elusive targets that people liked.

804
00:49:42,025 --> 00:49:42,826
We are now in lists of...

805
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,907
And that was a huge sea change for us.

806
00:49:45,668 --> 00:49:50,071
Hey, this could be game of the year, elusive targets are great, and stuff like that.

807
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:54,175
And even community started to really like it.

808
00:49:55,936 --> 00:50:00,219
An observation I want to give you in the final minutes of this is when you look at episodic

809
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:03,982
games, and let me here take Life is Strange, but please take the time to look at other

810
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:05,063
episodic games as well.

811
00:50:05,637 --> 00:50:14,224
take the time to look at television shows, all of them follow this pattern.

812
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:20,710
When Life is Strange was launched, the Metacritic, I think an interesting indicator, was 75 when

813
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,292
the episodes changed, 78, 81, 81, 81.

814
00:50:25,494 --> 00:50:29,457
And then they shipped the whole season at once, which is exactly all of that.

815
00:50:30,258 --> 00:50:31,019
And that scored 85.

816
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:38,633
And that is because people start understanding the whole thing.

817
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:41,176
How it connects, what it does, how it clicks.

818
00:50:41,776 --> 00:50:42,797
It's like television shows.

819
00:50:42,857 --> 00:50:45,599
People appreciate the trim peaks afterwards.

820
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,341
And that's fine.

821
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:49,963
But that's something that you need to take into account

822
00:50:50,023 --> 00:50:51,104
if you do episodic games.

823
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:53,826
We are, in a way, on a similar trajectory.

824
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:55,448
But obviously, we can still fuck it up.

825
00:50:56,073 --> 00:51:01,016
we can still make mistakes. Every single release we do needs to be good because people can

826
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:06,299
get out at any time. People that bought episodically can get out by just not paying us more money.

827
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,503
You know what? I like that because it makes us, as a developer, responsible to deliver

828
00:51:12,563 --> 00:51:14,384
quality to the people who like playing the game.

829
00:51:16,726 --> 00:51:21,789
Let's go through the lessons. Episodic games tend to score higher once they're fully understood.

830
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:25,111
What that means is be mindful with your pricing policy.

831
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:31,170
We try to keep our price point as steady as we can, even if it doesn't deliver the assault-after-sales spikes.

832
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:38,972
But it helps you to sell while your quality is increasing, or the perception of your quality is increasing.

833
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:46,035
Talking about improvements and new features is better after the fact, because it reduces cynicism and makes things clearer.

834
00:51:46,615 --> 00:51:49,596
For us, concretely, that means we don't promise features anymore.

835
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:54,298
What we do is we use our release notes to talk to players and to press.

836
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:59,816
And that makes us very genuine because we can talk about the things we've actually delivered,

837
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:03,298
and our ambition is to deliver the things that people are really asking for first.

838
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:07,861
So that works really well.

839
00:52:08,362 --> 00:52:12,004
On the charts I showed you before, there are two key things.

840
00:52:12,044 --> 00:52:17,207
These content extensions helped us to bring players back that might have stopped playing,

841
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:19,328
and the weekly events.

842
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,763
kept players playing the stadium. I think that was really interesting. You see people

843
00:52:23,803 --> 00:52:27,906
come back every week, and then there are some people that just come back when there's new

844
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:32,470
content coming. So the combination of that is useful, and it doesn't have to be as big

845
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:36,814
as a Hitman level. I know that's huge content, but you can do it with other things as well.

846
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:40,377
So plan for activities in your game and for regular additions.

847
00:52:41,618 --> 00:52:44,040
All right, a few concluding recommendations.

848
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:51,592
There was an impact on the development team that this being a developer conference I think

849
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:58,095
might be interesting to hear. We started when we developed the game with

850
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:03,038
what we internally called the first life, which was our first playable, more or less,

851
00:53:03,538 --> 00:53:08,820
that we published to all of Square Enix. And Square Enix being like 3,000 people, we had

852
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:09,401
a good base.

853
00:53:10,202 --> 00:53:12,962
Quite a few signed up and we had people playing that.

854
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:20,524
And that was a huge change because we had to overcome this fear of showing our dirty underwear,

855
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:24,905
the first things we've done with this new game, to the people we appreciate most,

856
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:28,745
our colleagues that are also developers and also make awesome games.

857
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,746
And although we are friends, we also compete a little bit with each other, right?

858
00:53:32,786 --> 00:53:35,687
That was a very important step for us to learn what it means to be alive.

859
00:53:35,807 --> 00:53:37,527
And then we started updating this build.

860
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:41,440
And we practiced customer relations management, right?

861
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,441
We ran the service for the first time.

862
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:48,906
We applied updates to the game while it was being played, which we ultimately updated

863
00:53:48,946 --> 00:53:52,909
to the vertical slice, which as you might know is the part where you prove your final

864
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:54,991
quality and gameplay in a small part of the game.

865
00:53:56,192 --> 00:54:01,036
And we got into this monthly release mindset and backwards compatibility, you know, with

866
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,258
player profiles, safe games, and stuff like that.

867
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:10,427
That was then upgraded to the closed alpha. That was the same build, based on the same

868
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:16,330
build, which became the first touchpoint with real consumers. That was when actual players

869
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:20,992
played it, what I mentioned before in the time overview. That had an effect. It put

870
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:27,975
the game first, and that means that if you're someone who's only into technology and

871
00:54:29,153 --> 00:54:30,394
I come from a programming background.

872
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:34,477
I've been a programmer half of my career, and actually I'm happy to see some of our

873
00:54:34,517 --> 00:54:37,139
programmers here as well, so they went through that as well.

874
00:54:37,699 --> 00:54:40,762
The technology focus has to come second.

875
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:46,286
It has to serve the game, and you need to love the game also when you love doing technology

876
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:46,586
first.

877
00:54:47,987 --> 00:54:51,429
Your deployment and runtime stability becomes highly important.

878
00:54:51,629 --> 00:54:56,373
The technical QA becomes even more important because you cannot afford three weeks without

879
00:54:56,433 --> 00:54:56,973
a working build.

880
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:02,706
You also need to advance your engine. We had to do that because we needed to introduce

881
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:08,151
more flexibility for doing that, for live updating content and stuff, and more deterministic

882
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:14,396
deployments and so on. We distributed our builds differently, especially

883
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:19,160
the people that played it. All our builds came via Steam and platforms,

884
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,243
more or less, which helps people to just log in and they get a new build, and that helped

885
00:55:23,283 --> 00:55:24,284
us to practice that stuff.

886
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:37,191
So to conclude from my point of view, the digital distribution change has fully reached

887
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:38,011
the console market.

888
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:42,073
If you took the time to read the news in the last two, three weeks, look at Activision's

889
00:55:42,093 --> 00:55:42,853
this year's numbers.

890
00:55:44,995 --> 00:55:50,137
It's amazing how much goes digitally in the mainstream AAA console market.

891
00:55:51,378 --> 00:55:55,700
So think about how your brand can utilize these opportunities.

892
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:58,883
It's not every game can.

893
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:01,363
You need to have something where it fits, but just think about it.

894
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:03,304
Perhaps it doesn't work, perhaps it does work.

895
00:56:06,045 --> 00:56:10,046
The transition, and that's why you should start thinking, will take a long time.

896
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:13,166
You need to take a lot of people and stakeholders on board with it.

897
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:18,028
That is something that needs to go through the entire organization.

898
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:23,209
And be mindful that whether it's live or episodic.

899
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:28,647
It's not a concept that will work on absolutely every type of game.

900
00:56:29,288 --> 00:56:33,209
It worked in Hitman because the nature of the fantasy is you get a mission, you travel

901
00:56:33,249 --> 00:56:37,271
somewhere, it can be time-limited, it can come at any point in time.

902
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,912
It's a non-linear game experience.

903
00:56:40,352 --> 00:56:41,952
There are games that would not apply that.

904
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:44,774
But think about it, perhaps it works.

905
00:56:44,814 --> 00:56:45,914
Just don't force it, right?

906
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:53,404
And I think, last but not least, that if you expose yourself to the players with all these

907
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:58,048
things, with being open, being inclusive, listening, looking, and also taking the blame,

908
00:56:58,068 --> 00:57:00,770
then ultimately you make better games.

909
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:06,934
I'm convinced it's going to be the best Hitman game that we've ever done because of that.

910
00:57:08,035 --> 00:57:10,757
And in my opinion, that alone makes it worth doing.

911
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:16,101
Thank you very much for your attention, and now we have a little bit of time left for

912
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:16,762
questions and answers.

913
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,072
Any questions?

914
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:30,765
Microphone's coming?

915
00:57:33,503 --> 00:57:36,364
Hi, thanks, very, very great presentation.

916
00:57:36,664 --> 00:57:39,665
Could you iterate on the War Room you talked about before,

917
00:57:39,725 --> 00:57:40,625
the marketing War Room?

918
00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:43,505
Because I find it's an interesting transition

919
00:57:43,565 --> 00:57:47,286
that the big games are turning more

920
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:50,647
into the commercial world, more of the online marketing.

921
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,647
You mentioned CRM yourself as well.

922
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:55,928
You're using the analytics and the tools in the right way.

923
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:59,969
And how do you monitor the brand and so forth, right?

924
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:02,209
So the way we are structured.

925
00:58:02,622 --> 00:58:07,104
is that we have an on-brand marketing department at each studio, and their job is to collect

926
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:11,626
all the data from the brand perspective. The development team looks at the development

927
00:58:11,646 --> 00:58:17,469
perspective, things like connectivity, player behavior, and so on. We use Azure to collect

928
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:22,211
the data, and we use a system called Tableau, which you might have heard about, to analyze

929
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:27,374
the data and visualize it. I need to say there that actually even with the hard facts, and

930
00:58:27,614 --> 00:58:29,395
I talked to a few others as well, I think

931
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:31,674
It's not only us doing it like that.

932
00:58:31,714 --> 00:58:35,699
You can look at data, but it is a bit of an art form as well.

933
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:36,661
It's not only science.

934
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:39,264
An art form to actually make your decisions on data as well.

935
00:58:39,765 --> 00:58:40,506
But it helps you.

936
00:58:40,526 --> 00:58:44,391
It helped us, for instance, to see things like where do people play a lot?

937
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:50,934
So, what level areas are visited, which areas are unvisited practically in the main mission,

938
00:58:51,234 --> 00:58:55,595
and that's a really cool area, and it's perfect to place an elusive target there, or to do

939
00:58:55,635 --> 00:58:57,655
a contract there, or some live features and so on.

940
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:03,177
And that helps us to make better use of what we have created and enhance the player fun

941
00:59:03,217 --> 00:59:03,877
at the same time.

942
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:09,138
The same is true for difficulty or for items they use, or disguises, or that kind of thing.

943
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:12,358
That's more the steering of the project.

944
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:18,920
In the war room, we meet with all the territories, which is like a conference call with the

945
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,620
global territories, and everybody has some local requirements.

946
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,741
Germany is a different market than France, UK, US, and so on.

947
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:31,222
Then we try to square the circle and say, okay, this is the direction we take it, this

948
00:59:31,282 --> 00:59:32,902
is the advantage for this or that market.

949
00:59:33,162 --> 00:59:36,983
There can be things like pricing, but there are also things like, how do we talk about

950
00:59:37,023 --> 00:59:37,063
it.

951
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,986
Some of the live things, in Germany, people got that comparably easily.

952
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,487
Other markets, they were more confused by it.

953
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:49,289
And then there are markets that still have a problem with being live and online because

954
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:54,632
they pay for traffic or they live in a country where it's only the coastlines or the major

955
00:59:54,652 --> 00:59:56,413
cities that have any internet connection at all.

956
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:57,473
That's worth mentioning.

957
00:59:58,154 --> 00:59:59,654
So that's what the War Room does for us.

958
01:00:00,995 --> 01:00:03,737
It's driving the commercial success or sustainability.

959
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,350
The question was, what about brand monitor?

960
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:13,773
We work with a company called BrandWatch, which is giving us statistical data on how

961
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:16,615
positive and negative people are about us and the game.

962
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:21,918
That helps us to see how we train with the things we talk.

963
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:27,482
That's also where we can verify one headline at a time, and we know, hey, the game is cancelling

964
01:00:27,522 --> 01:00:28,122
pre-orders.

965
01:00:28,603 --> 01:00:31,524
You cannot expect a lot of positivity about that, right?

966
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:35,647
You know what you get, and then you can verify whether these things are actually working.

967
01:00:36,468 --> 01:00:42,410
I think we don't have much time left. Two more questions, is that possible? Two more

968
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:48,291
questions? Okay, let's see. Yes? Shout out, I repeat.

969
01:00:48,311 --> 01:01:00,354
The question is, why do many AAA games, despite having betas, still have troubles with the

970
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:03,115
servers at launch? My honest answer is,

971
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:05,405
I really can't tell 100%.

972
01:01:05,886 --> 01:01:11,170
I think that when you try to push boundaries, if you do games that are not the same and

973
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:17,535
the same, then you are always trying to push the edge and you do very complex stuff.

974
01:01:18,096 --> 01:01:23,380
And that complexity sometimes only completely manifests itself when it's out in the consumer

975
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:23,760
market.

976
01:01:24,641 --> 01:01:29,305
I also do think in our concrete case that despite really, really many people playing

977
01:01:29,325 --> 01:01:29,665
the beta,

978
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,865
I do think they were more tolerant towards these problems and they were reported a bit

979
01:01:34,905 --> 01:01:40,170
less and our tracking at the time was less sophisticated than it was over the course

980
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:40,691
of the season.

981
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,063
I think that's true for others as well, even for companies that have a lot of experience

982
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:47,284
with running live games already.

983
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,727
For us, that was the first time in that magnitude.

984
01:01:51,027 --> 01:01:55,450
But even companies that ship more than one of these games have these problems.

985
01:01:55,470 --> 01:02:02,735
I think it's a combination of the complexities that just come from a vastly spread out network

986
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:07,858
because you can connect in so many different ways, from LTE to Glassfire to dial-ups and

987
01:02:07,878 --> 01:02:08,038
so on.

988
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:10,060
and you can be all over the world.

989
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,762
And sometimes even if you use distributed systems,

990
01:02:13,702 --> 01:02:15,224
you underestimate it.

991
01:02:16,284 --> 01:02:18,286
And I think that is one of the reasons.

992
01:02:18,966 --> 01:02:20,688
And it also depends on the type of game,

993
01:02:20,728 --> 01:02:23,910
how you even use online connectivity, right?

994
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:27,173
Because an MMO is different than Hitman or an FPS.

995
01:02:28,113 --> 01:02:30,115
Okay, last question, and I will stay here,

996
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:32,257
or actually outside, for more questions.

997
01:02:46,322 --> 01:02:50,163
So, can I talk more about the publisher reaction when we proposed and when we released?

998
01:02:51,243 --> 01:02:56,925
That is of course a very subjective thing, because I only have the experience with one

999
01:02:56,966 --> 01:02:58,586
title and I work for Square Enix.

1000
01:02:59,546 --> 01:03:00,987
Square Enix was extremely supportive.

1001
01:03:01,307 --> 01:03:02,868
The vision was completely understood.

1002
01:03:03,928 --> 01:03:07,609
We have a bit of this dogma of, you know, it's like our company model to make players

1003
01:03:07,649 --> 01:03:09,150
happy with unforgettable experiences.

1004
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:13,332
Being live and close is actually very close to that vision.

1005
01:03:13,983 --> 01:03:17,500
because we want to be close to the people to deliver the experiences.

1006
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:23,566
There is a long-term future in that for us, because as publishers, it's our players that

1007
01:03:23,606 --> 01:03:23,846
matter.

1008
01:03:23,886 --> 01:03:25,788
It's the people that spend time in our games.

1009
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:30,992
I'm happy to see people clocking 200, 300 hours in our game already, and it's not even

1010
01:03:31,012 --> 01:03:31,933
half out.

1011
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:35,856
That is something where I see a lot of potential also in the future.

1012
01:03:36,377 --> 01:03:39,720
And the reaction from the publisher was, yes, that's what we want to do.

1013
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,423
Mind that we are also the home of Final Fantasy and MMOs and so on, so we know how to engage

1014
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:44,924
with players.

1015
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:46,725
And that was really, really positive.

1016
01:03:47,086 --> 01:03:47,926
When we released...

1017
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:53,032
It's, you know, I think the same feeling I had, we had on the group level as well.

1018
01:03:53,755 --> 01:03:54,918
It was like, hmm, the start.

1019
01:03:55,843 --> 01:03:57,664
Yeah, when we do this, we can sell more.

1020
01:03:57,704 --> 01:03:59,644
Of course we can sell more, because we sell all of that,

1021
01:03:59,664 --> 01:04:01,765
more or less, day one, and then it's on the shelf

1022
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:04,265
for a few months before you hope that they don't return,

1023
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:06,766
or you argue or do down pricing and stuff like that, right?

1024
01:04:07,266 --> 01:04:08,927
Digital means every single sale

1025
01:04:09,187 --> 01:04:11,207
is in the hand of a consumer instantly.

1026
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:12,687
That was a big difference,

1027
01:04:12,907 --> 01:04:14,768
and also a learning experience for all of us.

1028
01:04:15,368 --> 01:04:18,389
So I think I'm really happy at being at a company

1029
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:20,809
that is able to allow that freedom,

1030
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:24,130
willing to take risks, and able to use those opportunities

1031
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:24,490
without...

1032
01:04:25,422 --> 01:04:28,065
panicking or going back and forth too fast.

1033
01:04:28,345 --> 01:04:30,567
Because as we see, it's the long game that matters.

1034
01:04:30,788 --> 01:04:34,471
The digital market is something that needs to run long, and it keeps players playing

1035
01:04:34,511 --> 01:04:35,532
and it keeps players buying.

1036
01:04:35,933 --> 01:04:38,235
Very different to the experience I have with selling discs.

1037
01:04:40,237 --> 01:04:40,477
All right.

1038
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:41,318
Thank you very much.

1039
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:43,560
If you have more questions, 15 more minutes or so.

1040
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,283
I think there is space outside the room.

1041
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:47,384
Thank you.
