1
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:13,177
Today's talk is data-driven or data-blinded, the uses and abuses of analytics in games.

2
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:18,521
And I'm very excited to see this many people here, very tired on a Friday, to hear me rant

3
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,142
about statistical significance.

4
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:23,044
We're going to get to that eventually.

5
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:27,246
But just to start with, I want to say that data is awesome.

6
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:32,288
It is the backbone of science and progress and most of the

7
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:40,092
large companies, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and most

8
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:41,253
scientific undertaking.

9
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:44,875
But the thing that I want to focus on today is that data is

10
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,315
also a hot mess.

11
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:54,271
Data is a tool, and like any tool, it has uses and abuses.

12
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:57,036
And it also is something just.

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,272
that where it's very easy to make straight up errors.

14
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:04,014
How many conflicting health studies have you seen

15
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:06,155
in the last 20 years?

16
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:08,377
I mean, I'm at the point where if I see,

17
00:01:08,537 --> 00:01:14,801
whatever I see from a nutrition test study in a journal,

18
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,204
I'm like, whatever, I'm just gonna eat green vegetables

19
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:20,645
and whole grains, and I'm sure that's the right answer.

20
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:23,807
And that's because of some of the problems with data.

21
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:28,763
Congregate is a company that uses a lot of data,

22
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:30,744
and we have from our start.

23
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:33,626
But I never am completely sure whether we

24
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:37,548
are this ship that is using data to chart a course off

25
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:41,170
to success and treasure, or we're this ship

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,192
and we're steering into a pile of rocks and disaster.

27
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:48,494
And the reason is because both have happened,

28
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,254
and both have happened a lot.

29
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:52,449
So who am I to talk?

30
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,872
I'm Emily Greer, and I am the co-founder and

31
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:57,433
CEO of Kongregate.

32
00:01:57,753 --> 00:01:59,395
And I am a shameless data geek.

33
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:01,717
I even put it on my Twitter profile.

34
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:06,241
I spend four, five, six hours a day in meetings, but I

35
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:11,025
always reserve some time to go into dashboards and read PM

36
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:15,129
reports, and the data analysts at Kongregate know that they

37
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,791
are always going to get questions from me on anything

38
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,852
interesting that they write.

39
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:24,094
So I want to talk a little bit about the sources of our data,

40
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:26,754
because that's going to be relevant to this talk as I'm

41
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,635
using examples throughout.

42
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:33,476
Kongregate started as an open platform for browser games,

43
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,596
kongregate.com.

44
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:38,137
And we have averaged more than 1,000 games uploaded to

45
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:42,098
Kongregate per month for the last decade plus.

46
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:43,838
So we are closing in on 120,000 games, and that is a

47
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:44,139
lot of data.

48
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:54,446
Starting back in 2013, we launched a program where we do

49
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:56,627
third-party publishing on mobile.

50
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,508
You may be familiar with some of our titles, particularly

51
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:01,629
Adventure Capitalist or Animation Throwdown.

52
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:05,684
But we've published more than 40 titles on mobile,

53
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:09,785
and in the last year started publishing on Steam consoles

54
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,565
and doing premium titles as well.

55
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:16,266
And you may have seen the announcement that two weeks ago,

56
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,227
that coming this summer we are going to be launching

57
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:20,427
a new PC platform called Cartridge,

58
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:24,548
but that's not really the source of data or focus of this talk.

59
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,271
So I want to talk a little bit about how I got here.

60
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:32,816
And it's not because I studied econ and math and other things

61
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:33,517
like that in school.

62
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:36,300
I actually studied Russian and Eastern European studies.

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,663
So if you want to know about medieval Transylvania

64
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:43,127
or the Ottoman invasion of Hungary, I'm your woman.

65
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,589
But as you might imagine, this was maybe

66
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,132
the most useless knowledge that I could have on the job market.

67
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:50,603
And so I immediately did something else.

68
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:53,265
I went into book publishing, but I didn't

69
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:54,105
like that very much.

70
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:59,027
And eventually I stumbled into data in the catalog business.

71
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,549
Now, what I was doing was called direct marketing, but

72
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,691
really it was data science by the way that we know it.

73
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,793
And I just fell in love with being able to test things and

74
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,814
look at numbers and find the story in it.

75
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,929
At that point, because I love data so much, I taught myself SQL because I hated waiting

76
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,891
for IT to get me data.

77
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:29,157
And then I started taking classes at community college and at UC Berkeley here on probability

78
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:33,040
and statistics and a little extra math so that I would understand the theory of what

79
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,743
I was doing a little more than just doing it in practice.

80
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:40,152
After a while, I got a little bored,

81
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:42,334
and I almost went to grad school in econ,

82
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:45,215
but then ended up co-founding Congregate instead,

83
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:46,716
thinking that I was gonna be doing

84
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,617
something completely different, but then.

85
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,274
wow, we have all the data.

86
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:53,736
And I actually do more data and data science.

87
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,558
And what I did before became really, really, really

88
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:57,018
relevant.

89
00:04:57,678 --> 00:05:00,120
And the reason why I wanted to talk about that is because I

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,622
wanted to make my first point, which is don't be intimidated.

91
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:07,625
You don't need an advanced degree in statistics

92
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:08,386
to get data right.

93
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:11,368
And just because you have one doesn't mean

94
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:12,489
that you won't get it wrong.

95
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:14,430
I'm not saying that it doesn't help.

96
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,431
It does help.

97
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:20,297
For an organization to do data right,

98
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:23,099
it can't be just something that's thrown over the wall

99
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,920
from quants.

100
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,601
It's something that needs to be,

101
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:29,183
that you need to have an intimate knowledge of the game

102
00:05:29,724 --> 00:05:30,964
and how games are developed.

103
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:33,626
And it needs to be something that everybody works on

104
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:36,448
and everybody looks at and everybody participates in

105
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,229
for a company to do it right.

106
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,252
The other first point I wanna make,

107
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,452
or I guess second point I wanna make,

108
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:44,893
is that you should get paranoid.

109
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,555
And that is because under an apparently solid surface,

110
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:51,239
data is usually a pile of shit.

111
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:54,725
Sometimes the issues are obvious.

112
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:57,950
When we first started launching games on mobile, we

113
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,492
had an endless runner that

114
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:03,807
wasn't verifying receipts from Apple.

115
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,810
And so all sorts of fraudulent purchases were coming through.

116
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,491
And so the average purchase was looking like $500.

117
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:13,234
And that was immediately obvious, like this is wrong.

118
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:17,397
And we were able to isolate it and get rid of it.

119
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,139
But a lot of times, data issues are much more subtle.

120
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,577
different things not firing in the tutorial sequence, or

121
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:31,059
weird client timestamps that are changing dates, and other

122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,420
little subtle things.

123
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,622
So one of the things that I think is really important is

124
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:37,744
that you should never rely on a single analytic system, and

125
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,246
you should never rely on an analytic system where you

126
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:42,827
can't get in and inspect the individual records.

127
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:45,709
Because oftentimes, you need to see the individual little

128
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,232
items to find problems and figure out what they are.

129
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:54,443
Even when your data is good and when the data is correct,

130
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:55,564
it can be misleading.

131
00:06:57,424 --> 00:07:00,465
This looks like four separate pictures

132
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:03,567
photoshopped together to create an appealing color grid, right?

133
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:06,628
Wrong.

134
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,828
And data is like this.

135
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,270
A lot of times, something appears one way,

136
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,591
very straightforward when you look at it in one direction.

137
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,771
But if you change the angle, you can

138
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:19,752
see that it's really something completely different.

139
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:24,510
Here's an example of that happening from congregate.com

140
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:24,810
data.

141
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,531
So these are two games in the same genre.

142
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:31,593
They have similar day one and day seven retention.

143
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:33,374
Game one, slightly better.

144
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,815
They have similar lifetime buyer percentage.

145
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:37,696
Game two, it's slightly higher.

146
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,837
You can see from this chart that their daily ARPU,

147
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:44,039
average revenue per paying user, is also very similar.

148
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,481
Since ARPU, average revenue per user, is just.

149
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:53,264
Buyer conversion times ARPU, they should have the same

150
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:54,024
numbers, right?

151
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,245
But of course you know that I'm setting you up.

152
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:05,150
So game one has an ARPU of $2.27, and game two has an

153
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,411
ARPU of only $0.84, even though those other numbers

154
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:09,232
looked really similar.

155
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,733
And the reason is because people are playing game one

156
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,154
much longer than game two.

157
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,857
and it has many more transactions per buyer.

158
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:20,281
So D30 is higher, transactions per buyer,

159
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,624
and its lifetime ARPAPU is much higher.

160
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:26,128
And if you only looked at daily statistics,

161
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:29,011
you wouldn't realize quite how different these games are.

162
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:33,887
So one way to think of yourself is as a detective.

163
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:37,128
The witnesses may be lying or confused.

164
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:38,969
The crime scene may have been tampered with.

165
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,549
You can't trust any one piece of evidence

166
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,490
and you need to constantly cross-check them

167
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,471
against each other to validate what you're finding out.

168
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,854
So we do a lot of triangulating in truth,

169
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:54,296
and we do it by taking every source of data that we have

170
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:57,357
and comparing against each other almost all the time.

171
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:00,218
So we've got client data from the Congregate SDK.

172
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:04,679
We compare it to Adjust, which is our mobile attribution

173
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,940
provider that's also firing in our client.

174
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,541
We compare it to our server data.

175
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:13,723
We compare it to data from the platforms, and then we compare it to benchmarks that

176
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:15,083
we've built up over the years.

177
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:18,505
Because there's always some variance between sources of data.

178
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:24,828
Sometimes it's 1%, some things could be as much as 5%, and that could be normal and tolerable.

179
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:26,909
But you need to understand what that is.

180
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:29,750
So we track everything all the time.

181
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,632
This is from some dashboards that we have where we're comparing four different pieces

182
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:36,213
of data next to each other and tracking that.

183
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:39,145
And then we track the variance over time

184
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,047
so that we have a ceiling and a floor that's acceptable.

185
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:44,728
And anything beyond that, we look beyond.

186
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,349
We check into it and make sure that it's correct.

187
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,251
And you're not just a detective.

188
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,871
You're a CSI.

189
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:55,613
Your goal should be to create a three-dimensional view

190
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,895
of your players and how they're moving through your game.

191
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,997
Games are very complex and time-based systems.

192
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:06,018
And a flat view is never going to be enough.

193
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:10,785
Another way to think about this, and this comes from,

194
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:13,886
I should really not press against my chest.

195
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,088
My favorite, while I majored in

196
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:18,849
Russian Eastern European Studies,

197
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:21,230
my favorite class in college was actually

198
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,071
astrophysics for non-science majors.

199
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,352
And I think there's a lot to learn from astrophysics

200
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:27,893
to help us think about how we should be

201
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,574
building up data for games.

202
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,495
So if you think about the universe,

203
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,792
We're sitting in one spot on planet Earth.

204
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,953
And that's a really limited view.

205
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,615
And we have really limited tools to understand what this

206
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,876
enormous thing is doing.

207
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:46,398
And for years, millennia, we didn't really understand it.

208
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:50,520
But gradually, through first our visual observations with

209
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,082
our eyes, and then by building more and more tools, and

210
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:56,363
taking more and more observations from different

211
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:59,905
places, and then comparing those observations against

212
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:00,365
each other.

213
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:04,165
we've been able to build up a really beautiful and impressive

214
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,808
model of the universe, a 3D model,

215
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:08,209
and how everything works together.

216
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,951
Is everything accurate yet?

217
00:11:10,832 --> 00:11:11,172
It isn't.

218
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:12,594
It absolutely isn't.

219
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,757
But when you think about 2,000 years ago when

220
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:19,621
we thought that the sun revolved around the Earth,

221
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,083
it's really amazing how far we've been able to come.

222
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,314
I want to talk about a lot of mistakes.

223
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:29,456
There's a series of classic data mistakes

224
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:30,656
that almost everybody makes.

225
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,018
I make them, even though I fight against them.

226
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,180
So I wanted to take everybody through some examples

227
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,763
of how they happen and what to watch out for.

228
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,390
And the first one and the first thing that you should

229
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,430
always be thinking about whenever you look at numbers

230
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,870
is audience mix.

231
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:55,592
So we tend to think of our player bases as monolithic,

232
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,812
one individual millions of times.

233
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:01,573
But that's not really the way to think about it.

234
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:05,314
It's really an aggregation of all kinds of subgroups of

235
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,534
people from different demographics, who've been in

236
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:10,735
the game different amount of times, who came from different

237
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:12,835
sources, who are playing on different devices.

238
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:18,362
And how those subgroups mingle and how they mix

239
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,005
have a huge effect on our KPIs.

240
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:24,029
Usually when KPIs for a game change,

241
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:27,193
it's more often because the mix of the audience has changed

242
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,836
than that the game itself has actually changed.

243
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:33,714
Here's an example from one of our games.

244
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:39,376
It's the last 90 days, or 180 days, 180 days of retention

245
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:40,236
for the same game.

246
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,317
You notice that it's mostly pretty steady.

247
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:48,279
But at the beginning, there's a spike pretty high on D1

248
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:48,879
retention.

249
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,801
This is because we were experimenting with how chart

250
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:54,541
position affects organics.

251
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:59,023
So we did, just for a couple of days, a really intense user

252
00:12:59,043 --> 00:12:59,823
acquisition burst.

253
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:02,254
only on US, only on iOS.

254
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:05,855
And these are the highest value customers and the highest

255
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,155
value players that we could bring in.

256
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:10,156
And so it really spiked D1 retention.

257
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:13,577
And if you look over time, you can see that really valuable

258
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:16,177
cohort move through the system.

259
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:22,379
So D7, D30, D90, it's immediately obvious where that

260
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:23,799
one cohort is.

261
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:28,808
On the other hand, you can see down here, there's a really

262
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:29,288
big dip.

263
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:32,410
And that's because we got a very nice feature from Google

264
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,132
Play that included a lot of countries where the game

265
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:37,274
wasn't localized, where the game wasn't culturally

266
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,856
appropriate, and the retention for those

267
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,077
players was really bad.

268
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:45,760
And again, you can see them progress through the game, D7,

269
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,103
D30, D90, affecting the metrics.

270
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:53,986
Now this is a really dramatic example of high quality players

271
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:55,526
versus low quality players.

272
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:58,567
And most audience mix issues are much more subtle.

273
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:01,268
But they're there, and they're happening all the time.

274
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,129
Another example of this happening

275
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,109
has to do with audience age.

276
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,530
This is an ARPDAU chart from another game of ours,

277
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:17,632
Pocket Politics, where you can see this hugely dramatic ARPDAU

278
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:18,292
decline.

279
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:20,286
since Christmas.

280
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:24,609
It was 75% decline from around Christmas through the end of

281
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:27,711
January, and then a slight recovery thereafter.

282
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:30,733
And it would be very easy to look at this chart and think,

283
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:33,115
oh my god, something disastrous has happened in

284
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:33,655
the game.

285
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:36,397
Why aren't people buying anymore?

286
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,138
But that's not really what's happening.

287
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:39,699
And you can see it from this chart.

288
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:42,009
This game has been out for two years,

289
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:45,511
and we've been doing a very low level of user acquisition

290
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,532
for the last year or so,

291
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:50,513
because of fatigue related to the election.

292
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,534
But we were testing new creatives,

293
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,596
and we got a particularly awesome video creative

294
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,197
that has a Trump-like character

295
00:14:58,757 --> 00:15:01,098
pressing a nuclear button again and again and again.

296
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,459
And apparently, people found that really funny,

297
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,661
and it drastically reduced the CPI that we needed to spend.

298
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:11,304
to bring users in, and we were able to scale up our user

299
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,885
acquisition really high.

300
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:17,367
So given the last slide, you're going to think, OK, so

301
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:20,409
all of these new players are lower quality than the ones

302
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,970
that were coming into the game before, right?

303
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:30,693
But if you break the ARPDAU chart out by D0, D1, and look

304
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,875
at it over the same time period, you don't see that

305
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:33,796
drastic decline.

306
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:37,479
There's some ups and downs, but it's relatively flat and

307
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,360
in the same range.

308
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:43,044
Similarly, if you look at D2 to D7, there's a small decline,

309
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:44,626
but it's not huge, much less than 75%.

310
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,501
D8 through D30, it's a little more dramatic.

311
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,103
You can kind of see what's going on.

312
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:54,765
But D30, again, there's not much of a dramatic change.

313
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:58,307
So why was there this 75% drop in ARPDAU?

314
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:00,829
And that was a player mix issue.

315
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:04,712
So you can see that the D30 plus ARPDAU is $0.20 to $0.25,

316
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:05,572
$0.30 at any given time.

317
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,834
But the new player ARPDAU, anybody younger, it tends to

318
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:08,234
be around $0.10.

319
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:08,554
So when

320
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:20,939
The elder players were the majority of the game.

321
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,520
The ARPDAU was much higher.

322
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,942
As we brought a lot of good quality new players in, even

323
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:28,303
though they were equally as good as the ones coming in

324
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,585
before, the overall average for the game changed.

325
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:33,526
And overall, we're making more money, and it's great.

326
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:36,428
But that's something that you should look for a lot.

327
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:39,270
It's very common to see these kinds of patterns with any

328
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,851
game where the average revenue per daily active user

329
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:43,572
increases over time.

330
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,763
And that's most games that have a lot of depth and monetization.

331
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:50,904
Usually the way you experience it is you have a big rush of players coming in

332
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:53,804
when you launch the game from features, from user acquisition,

333
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,826
and then gradually they churn out and only a small core base is left.

334
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:02,006
And over that time, you'll see your ARPDAU rising,

335
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:04,987
and people will think, oh, we're killing it on live operations.

336
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:05,847
We're doing really good.

337
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:09,168
But actually, you may not have made any improvements.

338
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:11,808
The player base for your game has changed.

339
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:17,123
Another point I want to make is that averages are average.

340
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:22,266
When dominant subgroups, good numbers, bad numbers,

341
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:24,127
for a dominant subgroup can mask what's

342
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,388
happening with smaller groups.

343
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:28,510
Here's a breakout of tutorial completion for a game

344
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,692
that had a really bad, I think it was an iPod crash.

345
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:35,514
And when we looked at the top line numbers,

346
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:37,855
everything looked fine because it was only 5% of the total.

347
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:41,898
But when we broke it out by device, you could see that

348
00:17:41,918 --> 00:17:44,860
there was something really dramatic going on with the

349
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,503
iPod, and then we were able to identify it, fix it, and

350
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:51,746
everything went back to the range of everything else.

351
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,590
Another thing to keep in mind, though, is that players are

352
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,391
not averaged.

353
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:03,369
As you saw, that very different art out between older

354
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:06,230
players in pocket politics and newer players.

355
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,511
And there's a lot of things that you can do that have a

356
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:12,693
very different impact on older players versus new players.

357
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:19,657
So this data is the PVP win rates in a collectible card

358
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:24,039
game that we have where there's a very dramatic

359
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,481
advantage for being the aggressor, for being the

360
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:28,642
person who plays first.

361
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:30,443
You see that little bump there?

362
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:34,465
That's when we made a change to try and mitigate

363
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:36,967
how much of an advantage that you got

364
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,528
from playing your cards first.

365
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:40,649
And it looks like it didn't change win rates much.

366
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,245
But if you break it out where you look at the max level

367
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:49,528
players, in this case that's 35, versus everybody else, you

368
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:52,370
can see that the change that we made was really advantageous

369
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,393
to the highest level players and much less advantageous to

370
00:18:56,413 --> 00:18:57,494
the lower level players.

371
00:18:57,795 --> 00:19:00,797
So even though the average looked fine, what was actually

372
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,959
happening beneath that was not what we

373
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:03,819
wanted to happen at all.

374
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:11,352
I've just spent 10 minutes talking about how important looking at subgroups and looking

375
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:14,776
at different player bases are, but there are problems with that too.

376
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:19,604
Specifically, the more that you slice and dice your base,

377
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:22,366
especially if you have a smaller game, you can get into

378
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:24,607
situations where you're looking at data where the

379
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:28,209
sample size is small, and that data might

380
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:28,989
as well be garbage.

381
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:32,131
It's so erratic and misleading.

382
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,993
So looking at Android Australia, or just your Linux

383
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:39,615
users, or some other combination may not make

384
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,896
sense, so there's always this balancing act between.

385
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:46,475
slicing and dicing your players enough so that you're really

386
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:49,557
seeing all the subgroups and you're seeing what's happening

387
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:53,739
underneath the surface versus getting down to sample sizes

388
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,160
where what you're looking at is useless.

389
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,502
So you just need to keep an eye on it.

390
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:02,985
The folks at Kongregate know that I am always going to ask

391
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:05,986
them, if they don't put sample size on a cohort chart or

392
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,807
something else, then it just means that I'm going to ask

393
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:09,368
them as soon as I see it.

394
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:14,972
Another thing I want to talk about is the normal curve,

395
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:19,037
because this, from my perspective, is a lie.

396
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:21,139
Nothing is normal.

397
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,442
It's not quite true.

398
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:27,046
There are some things that fall to a normal curve.

399
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,869
But almost everything that's important in games

400
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:33,929
revenue, sessions, battles, anything else,

401
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,330
is a power curve distribution.

402
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,451
Especially in free-to-play games, but really all games,

403
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:43,112
are driven by intense activity from outliers.

404
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:46,113
And their presence or absence in any piece of data

405
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:50,134
that you look at has dramatic impacts on what you're doing.

406
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:54,376
So here's an example from one of our games, which

407
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:57,217
is the lifetime spend of everybody who's

408
00:20:57,277 --> 00:20:58,557
spent within the last 28 days.

409
00:20:58,577 --> 00:20:58,617
So.

410
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,792
It's happened over a year, but it's people who spent recently.

411
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:06,836
And you can see that the top spenders for this game

412
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:09,999
have spent $40,000, $45,000, $30,000.

413
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,744
And you can imagine, especially in smaller sample sizes,

414
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:16,246
if somebody is present or somebody is absent,

415
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:18,209
that has a huge, huge impact.

416
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:25,601
And one of the things to take from this is that any metric that you look at that includes

417
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:32,045
something where one side of it is a power curve like revenue, like sessions, that the

418
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:38,208
averages from those kinds of metrics are going to be much less stable and much more up and

419
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:38,548
down.

420
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:42,851
than something like retention or tutorial completion, which

421
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:45,654
are based on binary yes-no metrics.

422
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,636
And you can look at those with smaller samples.

423
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:52,100
So in test markets, where we nearly always have small

424
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,363
sample sizes, I always look first at early retention and

425
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:59,186
buyer conversion, because those are more reliable than

426
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:00,667
things like ARPAPOO.

427
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:04,071
Sorry.

428
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:07,372
Another thing I wanna talk about is cherry picking.

429
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:11,453
This is something that sometimes we do consciously

430
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,113
because we wanna make a point with a boss or someone else,

431
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:16,474
but we also tend to do it unconsciously.

432
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:19,355
Whenever I look at a group of cohorts

433
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:22,395
or I look at a data, the extreme positive values

434
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,496
and the extreme negative values

435
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:27,336
always make a bigger impression on me than anything else.

436
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,177
So I'm always sort of fighting to make myself like,

437
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:32,398
check the average, check the median, check the mean

438
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:33,618
to keep that in check.

439
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:40,965
Another example of where this could bite you is say you've set a personal goal or an individual goal of

440
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:47,852
I want this thing to hit this metric so say you think the retention of a game should be at least 50%.

441
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:52,519
If you're looking at the data and it hits 50% once,

442
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,641
you may remember, oh, that 50% and then ignore the 48

443
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,643
and the 47 and the 46 that come after that

444
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:02,564
and think of your game as having 50% D1 retention.

445
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:06,666
And that's just a human bias that you have to fight

446
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,007
and have to mentally fight.

447
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:11,789
And along with that is, in a similar vein,

448
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,189
is confirmation bias.

449
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,191
Part of doing analytics, building worlds,

450
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,291
thinking through your games,

451
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:21,793
is having theories about how your players are behaving,

452
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:22,934
how things are working.

453
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:25,955
A lot of times you'll go into data and analytics

454
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:29,056
looking to confirm a particular theory.

455
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:31,317
If you're looking to confirm a particular theory,

456
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,498
you're probably gonna find the data that confirms it,

457
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:36,479
and you may ignore the data that contradicts it

458
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:40,121
or muddies it, especially if you only look at data

459
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:42,502
when you have a theory or a particular type of data

460
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,663
when you have a theory, you're likely to...

461
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:48,686
Intentionally, unintentionally, buy it to yourself when you're

462
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:49,206
looking at it.

463
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:54,827
Another thing to keep an eye on is the visualization of data.

464
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:58,228
Because the visualization of data has a huge impact on how

465
00:23:58,308 --> 00:23:59,168
we perceive it.

466
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:04,510
Here's an example of a couple of charts that our marketing

467
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,491
team did for a partner that we were working with.

468
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,452
This is a game where ad revenue is very important, and

469
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:13,772
we keep very careful track of.

470
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:18,175
what percentage of the daily active users are engaging with ads.

471
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:24,858
So you can see here that there was a decline in the percentage of users who were engaging

472
00:24:24,878 --> 00:24:26,980
with ads and the team was concerned about it.

473
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:32,653
and put big red arrows on the analysis to show what the rate of decline was.

474
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:40,260
But notice that these charts start at like 40 and 52 and are really, really zoomed in

475
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,161
on that data.

476
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:46,926
If you look at the exact same data but start at zero, you can see that the amount of change

477
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:49,589
in the engagement was actually pretty small.

478
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:52,210
it probably wasn't that big a deal,

479
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,450
and it may have been just from audience mix.

480
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,571
I don't actually know what the answer is here,

481
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:59,332
but this shows you how you zoom in,

482
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:01,492
how you create your access,

483
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:04,393
how you perceive the data, sorry,

484
00:25:04,513 --> 00:25:07,094
how you present the data is gonna have a big impact

485
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:09,135
on how you react to it.

486
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:17,629
The other thing I want to talk about is correlation and causation.

487
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:23,172
Now we've all heard a thousand times that correlation and causation are not the same

488
00:25:23,212 --> 00:25:23,453
thing.

489
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:26,574
We keep hearing it because we keep needing to hear it.

490
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:28,295
It should be like a personal mantra.

491
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:29,957
every single day.

492
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:35,482
You know, an example of correlation and causation not being the same would be,

493
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:37,504
you know, ice cream and drowning deaths.

494
00:25:37,984 --> 00:25:39,346
They both go up in hot weather,

495
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:42,188
but it's because both happen more in hot weather,

496
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:43,510
and they're not correlated.

497
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,173
The ice cream kills headline would be a really stupid headline,

498
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:50,636
but you could look at the data and come to that conclusion.

499
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,992
And the other thing, the reason why it's so hard for us

500
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:59,413
is because as humans, we are wired to look for meaning

501
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:02,274
and we're wired to look for cause

502
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,635
and that's why we didn't eat the poison berries

503
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:05,535
the second time.

504
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,736
It's a superpower, but the thing to keep in mind

505
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:10,556
is that it's also a curse.

506
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:14,418
In particular, in games, the curse that we need

507
00:26:14,438 --> 00:26:16,598
to watch out for is that absolutely everything

508
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,819
correlates with engagement.

509
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:20,739
And sometimes that's meaningful, but usually,

510
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:22,161
It isn't.

511
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:26,264
A classic example that I've seen is people saying,

512
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:29,245
players who connect to Facebook are twice as valuable

513
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:33,708
as everybody else, so we should incentivize

514
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:35,969
Facebook connections because then they'll be better.

515
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:39,131
Maybe that's true, but more likely it's that

516
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:42,693
engaged players were the ones who were willing

517
00:26:42,713 --> 00:26:44,574
to take the risk that they're gonna spam their friends

518
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,395
and make the connection.

519
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:53,380
So the true way to separate causation and correlation,

520
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,183
or correlation causation, figure out what's really happening

521
00:26:57,864 --> 00:27:01,747
is A-B tests, and those are really powerful.

522
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:08,041
It's not a magic bullet because nothing in data is that easy.

523
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:09,902
Testing has real costs.

524
00:27:10,723 --> 00:27:16,929
Engineering time, overhead, complexity, confusing players,

525
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,151
divisions between your players.

526
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:22,414
And the more tests that you're running, the worse that gets.

527
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:28,635
In general, the test traps within A-B tests are a lot of

528
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,556
the things that I've been talking about, like sample

529
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:34,318
sizes, audience mix, cherry picking, confirmation bias,

530
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:35,519
power distributions.

531
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,721
But there are a few additional test traps that you need to

532
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:42,263
watch out for, mostly having to do with assignment.

533
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,866
So one thing when you're doing test assignments to keep in

534
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,887
mind is that it's important to make sure.

535
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,040
that you split your test on what you're actually testing on.

536
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,681
So example here is a test in the store.

537
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:58,942
One way to assign people to the test is whenever they show up

538
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:04,103
in the app, they go in group A or group B. And then later,

539
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:07,264
maybe, they will engage with the store,

540
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:08,805
and you'll see the results.

541
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:12,446
The problem with that is that you could very easily end up

542
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:15,327
with a unequal distribution of people

543
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:16,507
who interact with the store.

544
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:21,475
And therefore, your test is biased by something that has

545
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:24,377
nothing to do with the thing you're actually testing.

546
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:26,899
The other thing is that if you're looking at multiple

547
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,721
metrics, like retention or anything like that, then the

548
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:32,943
noise from the people involved in the test may be drowned out

549
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,064
by the larger sample.

550
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:38,768
So always split once people have engaged with whatever

551
00:28:38,788 --> 00:28:39,288
you're testing.

552
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:48,193
The even bigger assignment problem in tests has to do with time and anything we do to

553
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:51,975
adjust when people are assigned to tests.

554
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:56,477
So revenue is a power distribution, so is engagement.

555
00:28:56,757 --> 00:29:01,818
your best players always show up first, they always show up earliest, they show up oftenest.

556
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:05,799
And so if you only run a test for one day,

557
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,201
then your sample is going to be heavily biased towards your best players.

558
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:14,782
If you run it for longer, then you'll get a lot of less engaged players who come back,

559
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:16,343
and you'll get a more normal sample.

560
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,110
in terms of what your player base looks like.

561
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,711
Similarly, if you have heard of people doing, you know,

562
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:25,673
tests, assigning people based on one day, next day,

563
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:28,774
one day, next day, again, you're going to get

564
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:30,855
a very biased sample that way.

565
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,517
Now, there's cases where you may want,

566
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:36,018
you may be forced into it from,

567
00:29:36,198 --> 00:29:38,379
like if you want to test a store on Steam

568
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:40,260
or some other place that doesn't give you tools,

569
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,361
but even there you want to be very careful.

570
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,462
because people who show up on Tuesday may not be the same

571
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:46,863
people who show up on Saturday.

572
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:50,066
So you want to do things that create an equal sample and an

573
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:58,292
equal type of person interacting with the test.

574
00:29:58,852 --> 00:30:01,454
Another thing to keep in mind is downstream impacts.

575
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:05,877
A lot of commercial A-B test products will make you pick

576
00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:06,498
just one.

577
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:12,420
one KPI that you're testing and that they're gonna,

578
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,363
you're supposed to just judge the test

579
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:18,028
on that particular metric and decide which is the winner.

580
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:22,730
They do that because they want to stop you from fishing for a

581
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,073
particular result and cherry picking, oh, this was good, so

582
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:33,295
A, and I wanted B to win, and this is good on B, so B is the

583
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:33,576
winner.

584
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:38,418
And that kind of fishing is bad, but what we've seen is

585
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:41,099
that there's so many unintended consequences to

586
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:41,720
different tests.

587
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:44,376
that it's always better to look at the full picture

588
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,080
and look at everything that happened

589
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:50,626
and then make a decision based on the full picture

590
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:53,069
as to whether the test was a success or not.

591
00:30:54,198 --> 00:30:57,540
So an example, the screenshots you saw earlier of the store

592
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,581
test were a test that we ran recently on one of our games

593
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,381
that is a very complicated store with a lot of items.

594
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:07,523
And we had a theory that the number of items and how

595
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:11,224
complicated it was was confusing players and reducing

596
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,485
a number of people who were actually buying items.

597
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:18,566
So we did a simpler version of the store that focused on just

598
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:19,247
a few items.

599
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,766
and tested them against each other.

600
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:24,448
So the main thing that we were looking for

601
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:26,209
was to see an increase in conversion.

602
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,332
And great, we increased it.

603
00:31:30,712 --> 00:31:33,374
We increased the conversion with the simplified store by 9%.

604
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:37,757
The problem is that by removing some of the items,

605
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:43,662
we removed some of the items that the most engaged players

606
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:44,442
were spending on.

607
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:47,405
So even though we increased conversion,

608
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:51,573
The average revenue per paying user dropped drastically, and

609
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:53,816
overall revenue was down 11%.

610
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:59,824
So conversion up, revenue down, oops, that was maybe not

611
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:01,085
the greatest thing to have done.

612
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:03,749
So we reverted to the control and are

613
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:04,950
continuing to experiment.

614
00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:13,063
Along with not looking, another flaw that you can get into with A-B tests is looking

615
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,604
at results too early.

616
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:19,829
So here's another example from our game Office Space where we did some, this is from a little

617
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:24,713
while back where we did, we were testing kind of a flash sale for individual items.

618
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:33,621
They popped in, and certain players, they would pop in, great deal, short-term discount.

619
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:37,285
And you would expect it to increase conversion and reduce

620
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:39,566
the ARPAPU and hopefully increase revenue.

621
00:32:39,886 --> 00:32:42,428
And when we looked at the test after running it for 10 days,

622
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,149
that was exactly what we saw.

623
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:47,511
Big increase in conversion, small decrease in ARPAPU, 8%

624
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:51,914
increase in average revenue per user.

625
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:51,994
Yay.

626
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:58,218
But since these are all the bad cases, when we let the test

627
00:32:58,258 --> 00:33:00,880
run for 30 days and looked at the data again.

628
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,263
The basic pattern of increased conversion and lower ARPAPU

629
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:09,165
was still there, but everything had moved downwards to the

630
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:12,368
point where we were now at a negative on revenue.

631
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:15,990
Revenue had decreased by 2% because the long-term effect

632
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,352
on average revenue per paying user was so much larger than

633
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:20,153
on conversion.

634
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:27,808
And part of the reason why that's important is because of

635
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:30,849
statistical significance and the question of what's a big

636
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:32,090
enough sample size?

637
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,931
I have a particular point of view on this, which is that

638
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:40,172
you don't want just the minimum number of players in a

639
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:41,073
particular test.

640
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:44,154
You don't want just enough to pass the statistical

641
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:44,914
significance test.

642
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:46,935
You want really big sample sizes.

643
00:33:47,455 --> 00:33:50,276
And this comes from, I think, from

644
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:55,764
a misinterpretation that I think most people have on how statistical significance works.

645
00:33:56,325 --> 00:34:00,047
And I'm going to stumble over statistical significance a bunch of times because it's

646
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:00,728
really hard to say.

647
00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:03,510
And it's really hard to say fast.

648
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,893
So you'll hear things, people will say things like, we had a statistically significant 5%

649
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:10,935
lift from this test.

650
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:15,478
But that's not how statistical significance works.

651
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,160
So the way statistical significance works is it

652
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,121
assumes that there's a true underlying lift between the

653
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:27,002
two populations.

654
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:30,583
And that if you run the test again and again and again, the

655
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:37,325
results will come back in a normal curve of results where

656
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:40,506
the true mean is the underlying lift.

657
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:43,547
So if you run a test, it passes the statistical

658
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:44,567
significance, it's 5%.

659
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,890
It could be from around the mean.

660
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,691
It's probably a 40, 45% chance that it's in that range.

661
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:56,132
But it also could come from the other part of the curve.

662
00:34:56,432 --> 00:34:59,332
In this case, 5%, the underlying lift

663
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:00,333
would be something like 10%.

664
00:35:01,453 --> 00:35:04,273
Or it could come from the far upper end of the curve,

665
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:07,514
in which case there might only be a 1% or 2% lift.

666
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:09,514
And that's important in terms of how

667
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,595
you think about what statistical significance means when

668
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:13,695
you're looking at results.

669
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:17,924
And this is why I really like large sample sizes,

670
00:35:18,044 --> 00:35:21,666
because if you have sort of double the sample size

671
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,468
that you need, then it's like you've run the test twice

672
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:25,669
and averaged the results.

673
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:28,891
And over time, the results there are

674
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,313
going to come closer and closer to that mean.

675
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:34,215
So big test sizes whenever possible.

676
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:37,438
But there are costs to that, so there's always trade-offs.

677
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:40,256
Now, you know that I think this is a lie.

678
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:45,178
So I want to talk about abnormal testing, because a

679
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,859
lot of what we're looking at are engagement-related metrics

680
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:52,400
or revenue-related metrics that are power distributions,

681
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,341
and those need to be looked at differently.

682
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:59,662
So this is our old friend, the power curve of revenue with

683
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:00,583
buyers who spent $45,000, $50,000.

684
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:06,773
If you think about what that means, here's a sample of a

685
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:08,354
potential distribution in a game.

686
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:11,476
It's not uncommon in free-to-play games to have 70

687
00:36:12,577 --> 00:36:15,279
or even 80% of revenue come from a very small percent of

688
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,440
buyers who spent more than $500.

689
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,824
These two A-B tests have exactly the same distribution,

690
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:24,905
except for one has a $1,000 buyer and one has a $500 buyer.

691
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:37,375
And the net impact of that is, in this small sample, a negative 40% on the average revenue per user,

692
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,758
even though the distribution isn't very significant.

693
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,203
That still happens when you have a larger test, and that's something that you need to...

694
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:49,029
really need to look out for and watch out for,

695
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:52,250
because a few big spenders can have a very big impact.

696
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,810
How do you deal with that?

697
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:56,451
It's really important to look at medians

698
00:36:56,611 --> 00:37:00,632
and any kind of distribution of how revenue

699
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:01,873
and other things are coming in.

700
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,553
So that previous example,

701
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:08,674
the average was drastically different,

702
00:37:08,955 --> 00:37:10,475
but if you look at the medians, they're both 15.

703
00:37:11,335 --> 00:37:13,796
And that helps show you as an analyst that,

704
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:19,638
the differences are happening just way at the top and not through the whole distribution.

705
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:25,861
Another made-up example is this one where there's actually a big difference in the distribution.

706
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:32,464
Everything is doubled on the second one, but has a slightly lower top buyer,

707
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:34,825
and so the averages are very similar.

708
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:38,387
But if you look at the median, it's double the other one,

709
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:42,809
and that shows that probably that's the better outcome of the test.

710
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:43,989
versus the other.

711
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,590
So that simple store test that I talked about before, where

712
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,331
we were looking at revenue, and that was what we were

713
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:55,553
judging on, this chart helped us figure out what was going

714
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:59,055
on, so this chart breaks out all the different purchase

715
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:00,855
sizes and does it by day.

716
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:04,017
And when we looked at the same chart for the simple store

717
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:05,297
version versus the control.

718
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:09,430
there was much less of that bright pink $100 purchases.

719
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,532
So we were able to sort of confirm by looking at the

720
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:14,753
distribution what had really happened.

721
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:17,996
The other thing is that when you're looking at something

722
00:38:18,016 --> 00:38:22,999
like revenue or some kind of economy sink, instead of using

723
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,082
a normal P or Z test, you should use something called a

724
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:32,746
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, which compares the medians rather

725
00:38:32,806 --> 00:38:33,346
than the means.

726
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,961
This isn't something that's easy to run by hand,

727
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:38,282
but most statistical packages like R

728
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:41,023
include it as an option, and that's what we use.

729
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:44,885
Now I want to talk about testing's dirty secret,

730
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:49,347
which is that most tests don't show a significant change.

731
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:51,668
And this can be really frustrating for a team,

732
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,468
because you've put a lot of work into creating

733
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,549
two different versions of the game,

734
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,411
and you want to have the work that you're doing have meaning.

735
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,292
You want to have...

736
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,881
You want to be improving things.

737
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,242
You want to have numbers go up.

738
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:06,304
But one of the things to remember

739
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:10,788
is that a test that doesn't show a result

740
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:12,889
is still meaningful and still interesting.

741
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:18,534
Here's an example from Butterscotch Shenanigans,

742
00:39:18,574 --> 00:39:19,775
who made the game Crashlands.

743
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:22,937
They were kind enough to share this particular example.

744
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:28,121
They wrote for the game a huge, long, very detailed description.

745
00:39:29,982 --> 00:39:31,443
were wondering how much of an impact

746
00:39:31,483 --> 00:39:32,684
is that having on conversion?

747
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:36,466
So they decided using Google's A-B testing tools

748
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:39,828
and Android to test the most extreme possible version of that,

749
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:41,708
which was no description at all,

750
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:45,070
just their four or five accolades

751
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,471
that were talking about how awesome a game it is.

752
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:50,173
So they ran it for four months,

753
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:53,435
and it shows absolutely zero difference

754
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:55,836
between having this, like, thousand-word description.

755
00:39:56,413 --> 00:39:56,994
and zero.

756
00:39:57,654 --> 00:39:59,636
Now, on the one hand, that could be frustrating,

757
00:39:59,736 --> 00:40:02,379
all that work wasted on writing description,

758
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:06,123
but in all game companies, in all companies really,

759
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:08,845
a time and effort is really valuable.

760
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:12,609
So anything that shows you what is not worth doing

761
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:14,351
and what is not making a big difference

762
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:16,493
is something that you can reduce your focus on.

763
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,054
This result, where description has very little impact,

764
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:23,337
is exactly what we've seen in terms of our testing using

765
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:28,482
the A-B tool set that Google gives us, which is really nice.

766
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:31,344
At the high end, icon has a big impact.

767
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:32,905
Video has some impact.

768
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,987
Screenshots, a little less.

769
00:40:35,027 --> 00:40:36,408
And then description, not too much.

770
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:38,550
And overall, this kind of testing

771
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,831
has been really useful for us.

772
00:40:40,212 --> 00:40:43,454
We used to spend a lot of time arguing about game names,

773
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:46,416
but then we did a lot of A-B testing of game names

774
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:48,758
against each other, never saw a difference in result,

775
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:52,241
and now we're much, much chiller about choosing a game name.

776
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:56,083
And yeah, so we can let some of those arguments

777
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:58,505
die a little faster because we've had data that tells us

778
00:40:58,785 --> 00:40:59,806
this isn't that important.

779
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:01,768
But.

780
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:05,724
When you're testing, it's also very important not

781
00:41:05,784 --> 00:41:07,668
to extrapolate too much from the result.

782
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:11,895
As you've heard, we're big fans of Google's A-B testing store

783
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,817
tools on Android.

784
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:16,487
were such big fans, they actually did a case study on

785
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:21,532
our use of it and came to our offices and took a video of

786
00:41:21,672 --> 00:41:25,356
all of our bunch of employees talking about particular tests.

787
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:28,980
Here's our senior producer, Peter Eichmann, talking about

788
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,143
an A-B icon test we did for a game called Global Assault.

789
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:39,029
And we had been using this girl with a gun icon as our main one

790
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,873
and tested a helicopter against it

791
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:42,878
and got a 92% increase in conversions.

792
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:50,159
92% is a really big amount and had an impact of hundreds of thousands,

793
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:53,301
probably millions of installs on the game.

794
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:56,624
So really exciting, great, yay testing.

795
00:41:57,505 --> 00:41:58,506
Except for there's a funny thing.

796
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:02,930
The reason that we were using that girl with a gun icon testing

797
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:08,415
is because we had tested various different potential icons on Kongregate.com

798
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,297
and that's the one that won.

799
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:12,678
So the helicopter...

800
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:18,003
So the girl with the gun had a 0.28% conversion rate on congregate and a 0.19%.

801
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:20,085
The helicopter had a 0.19%.

802
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:23,489
So the results were almost exactly flipped.

803
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:28,654
And that's why you need to be really careful when you're testing to think about context

804
00:42:29,094 --> 00:42:34,860
and make sure that you repeat any test and that not everything is going to work the same

805
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,523
way in the same place, in different places.

806
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:42,317
Another thing to keep in mind is that not everything is testable.

807
00:42:43,158 --> 00:42:47,842
Specifically late game stuff, late game and late game players.

808
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:49,623
It can be very difficult to test.

809
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:55,228
This is a really nice quote from Daniel Cook of Spryfox and Lost Garden

810
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:56,589
that I saw on Twitter recently.

811
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:02,874
He was talking about YouTube and how the algorithm changes the audience.

812
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:06,017
But I think that it's a really good way of thinking.

813
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:10,548
of thinking about things, particularly that the game also changes the audience.

814
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,430
The longer somebody is in the game, you're setting their expectations.

815
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,311
You're training them to behave in a certain way.

816
00:43:17,651 --> 00:43:22,032
And the later you get in a game, they're not going to react to something the same way they

817
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:24,893
might have on day one or day four and day eight.

818
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:27,174
Players talk to each other.

819
00:43:27,554 --> 00:43:29,174
That makes it harder to test as well.

820
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:33,256
So there's a lot of things happening at the end of a game that make it difficult to test.

821
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:38,103
So I've created, because I like frameworks, my hierarchy

822
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:40,326
of testing from critical to difficult.

823
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:43,971
And it basically follows the funnel of players into a game.

824
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:48,968
So starting with advertising, there it's really critical.

825
00:43:49,048 --> 00:43:52,409
And there's tons and tons of tools.

826
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:56,010
Almost any ad network that you use is going to expect you to

827
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,151
do A-B testing.

828
00:43:57,431 --> 00:44:00,112
And this is important because the same creatives that work

829
00:44:00,332 --> 00:44:03,773
on congregate.com versus Facebook versus a video ad

830
00:44:03,813 --> 00:44:05,834
network, people are not going to respond to

831
00:44:05,874 --> 00:44:06,534
them the same way.

832
00:44:06,574 --> 00:44:09,075
So you want to have a ton of creatives that are constantly

833
00:44:09,115 --> 00:44:11,316
testing, and this is very important to get

834
00:44:11,956 --> 00:44:12,737
advertising to work.

835
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:17,951
It's also really important wherever players are converting

836
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:21,113
to actually play your game, whether it's a landing page

837
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:23,375
or a store page on a platform.

838
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:27,897
The problem with this is that outside of Android,

839
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,878
there's not really great test tools.

840
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,399
But you can use things like StoreMaven

841
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:36,002
and other types of services to sort of fake test those.

842
00:44:36,082 --> 00:44:38,964
And whenever you have a platform that does allow you to test,

843
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,284
make sure that you do it.

844
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:44,680
It's still pretty easy to test on the initial experience of a player,

845
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:48,208
you know, getting through tutorials, getting through the first day.

846
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:54,256
There's no real big gotchas in that.

847
00:44:54,576 --> 00:44:57,238
But there is one thing that's important, which is that

848
00:44:57,418 --> 00:45:00,740
testing on the first day generally doesn't have huge,

849
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:03,302
show very strong results.

850
00:45:03,862 --> 00:45:06,744
Usually what you're looking for there is how long do

851
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:07,585
players retain?

852
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,066
How deep do they get into the game?

853
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,306
How much do they play?

854
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:14,489
And in the end, how fun your core loop is, is going to

855
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:15,630
determine those things.

856
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,352
And when you're testing the initial experience, you're

857
00:45:18,372 --> 00:45:19,152
really just testing.

858
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:23,441
that presentation. And the presentation of something has some impact, but doesn't usually

859
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:30,987
have as much impact as the game itself. Where we've seen more meaningful testing on our

860
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:34,070
side is in the first few weeks that somebody is in the game.

861
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:37,019
This is where we've seen good luck with tests, where we're

862
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,343
testing out how we unlock features and good results on

863
00:45:42,023 --> 00:45:43,565
store testing and other things.

864
00:45:43,865 --> 00:45:46,987
This is a sort of a sweet spot for testing in a way that's

865
00:45:47,028 --> 00:45:49,450
meaningful in a game, because players are still new enough

866
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:53,673
to a game that you haven't kind of wired them into a

867
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:55,435
particular type of behavior.

868
00:45:56,396 --> 00:45:59,699
But it's deep enough that it can be meaningful, and you can

869
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:01,600
test really substantial features.

870
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:07,117
But then once you get to late game, it's pretty difficult.

871
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:10,078
It's not impossible, but you should tread carefully.

872
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:12,719
There's a lot of problems with payers talking to each other.

873
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:16,320
There's a lot of problems with sample sizes,

874
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,341
audience mix, et cetera.

875
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:21,562
So it's not impossible, but given how much effort testing

876
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:24,683
is, I wouldn't recommend focusing on that.

877
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,148
So besides that there's a hierarchy of testing, I also

878
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:33,989
like to think that there's a lifecycle for data in games.

879
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:42,391
And it kind of follows the stages of the game creation and

880
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:44,072
the lifecycle of creation of the game.

881
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:46,913
And that can be loosely split into two sides.

882
00:46:47,153 --> 00:46:50,134
One is the creation, concepting, pre-production,

883
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:50,694
production.

884
00:46:51,264 --> 00:46:52,446
versus optimization.

885
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:56,450
And in my view, the optimization phase,

886
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:00,215
where you're trying to answer the questions of what's

887
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,337
working, what's not working, what's breaking,

888
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:05,381
it's really crucial for all games, free to play, premium,

889
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:06,362
whatever you're doing.

890
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,727
Every game can be made better by looking at data.

891
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,553
For any game as a service, that LiveOps looking at data,

892
00:47:15,953 --> 00:47:17,054
it's absolutely critical.

893
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:21,658
We'll only make games better as long as you don't fall into a

894
00:47:21,698 --> 00:47:22,739
lot of the classic blunders.

895
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,322
Where things get more interesting, from my

896
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:25,822
perspective, is the game.

897
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:30,647
perspective and where I don't think I have it figured out at all is on the creation side.

898
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:34,328
Now, production, I don't think there's really a role for data in it.

899
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:36,729
You just need to make the game. You're not really answering questions.

900
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:38,510
You're just trying to get to the fun.

901
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:43,852
But there's a really big, when you're in concepting and pre-production,

902
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:47,434
you're asking a really big question, which is, what should we make?

903
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:51,836
And this is the question always for game companies.

904
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:55,057
This is deciding the fate of your company again and again.

905
00:47:55,117 --> 00:47:55,698
You're committing.

906
00:47:56,378 --> 00:47:59,660
enormous amounts of resources, you're potentially committing years to a project,

907
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,342
it's what's defining your brand, it's setting you up for both success and

908
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:09,945
failure, and this is the most important question that you can ask. We've done a

909
00:48:10,005 --> 00:48:14,468
lot of, you know, being a data-driven company, we've tried to pull data into

910
00:48:14,608 --> 00:48:17,389
some of that creation process, and we've had luck with

911
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:21,061
a particular series of games of collectible card games

912
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:23,822
that we've made, starting with Tyrant Unleashed, which

913
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:29,864
is a very hardcore, gritty, sci-fi themed collectible card

914
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:32,326
game that had really great monetization

915
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:34,887
and long-term retention, but very high CPIs.

916
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:36,147
It was very hard to market.

917
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:37,468
So we looked at that game and said,

918
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:38,728
we want to make it more marketable.

919
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:41,750
So we reworked the game.

920
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:45,672
The team Synapse in Chicago is the one who makes it.

921
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:49,694
And they did a brightly colored fantasy,

922
00:48:49,814 --> 00:48:53,236
cartoony themed version of it to make it more accessible.

923
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:54,856
And that did lower the CPIs.

924
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:56,477
It didn't really make the game more successful,

925
00:48:56,757 --> 00:49:00,680
but it did make progress along those lines.

926
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,302
Then we were able to license from Fox

927
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,642
a bunch of animated IPs,

928
00:49:05,962 --> 00:49:07,743
and were able to create Animation Throwdown,

929
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:09,644
fundamentally the same game,

930
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,586
but we worked a lot on the accessibility of the early part,

931
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,727
and these characters made the same gameplay.

932
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:16,669
very, very accessible.

933
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:18,330
So that was a big success for us.

934
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:21,833
So then we went to, we were like,

935
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:25,095
okay, let's test art before we even start making the game.

936
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,738
So again, with Synapse, they were making a game

937
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:29,798
that was gonna be an idle game,

938
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:31,800
so we tested a bunch of different creatives

939
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,560
against each other.

940
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:37,684
Eon Heroes, Relic Raiders, and Castaway Cove.

941
00:49:38,124 --> 00:49:40,666
And the most casual one, Castaway Cove,

942
00:49:40,766 --> 00:49:42,447
had a really good click-through rate,

943
00:49:42,727 --> 00:49:43,908
and we decided to go with that.

944
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:51,162
But the funny thing happened is that as we got to test

945
00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:54,644
markets, that data didn't hold up particularly well.

946
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:59,286
We went through three rounds of testing of Castaway Cove,

947
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,707
in each case, really good click-through rates, as you

948
00:50:01,747 --> 00:50:02,307
can see here.

949
00:50:02,788 --> 00:50:05,969
But once we got to test markets and a broader sample,

950
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:07,490
they really took a nosedive.

951
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:12,712
And then on top of that, we finally were able to see the

952
00:50:12,752 --> 00:50:14,293
conversion on the store page.

953
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:16,724
We usually target 30% or higher.

954
00:50:17,105 --> 00:50:18,846
And this one, it was really disappointing.

955
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:19,787
It was 22%.

956
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:24,570
And overall, it's not that the CPIs for this game are bad,

957
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:25,531
but they're pretty average.

958
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:27,052
And we're really trying to make something

959
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:28,013
better than average.

960
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:32,156
Part of it, I think, is that the gameplay and the creative

961
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:33,917
didn't really work together.

962
00:50:34,038 --> 00:50:36,299
And that conversion piece, which we weren't able to test

963
00:50:36,419 --> 00:50:36,700
earlier,

964
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:41,268
was important. I also think it's just some of the limitations of testing.

965
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:44,554
There's probably another five or ten things that we did wrong,

966
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,920
but it shows that you can't just necessarily use science

967
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,282
to figure out what you should make.

968
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:54,662
The other thing to keep in mind when using data to figure out

969
00:50:54,682 --> 00:50:57,265
what to make is that data maps the known world.

970
00:50:57,706 --> 00:51:03,393
This is a map from 1457 made by a Genoese map maker.

971
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:07,337
And at the time, it was the best map that had been made in

972
00:51:07,518 --> 00:51:09,560
several thousand years.

973
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,082
It was the first map in a long time that had the relative

974
00:51:13,142 --> 00:51:15,304
proportions of the continents correct.

975
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:20,388
And if you look at the Mediterranean and anything near

976
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:22,209
Genoa, it's actually a pretty good map.

977
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:25,592
But the farther you get out into Africa, into Asia, into

978
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:28,334
the Baltic, it gets more and more crappy.

979
00:51:28,734 --> 00:51:31,156
And our view of the world is a little bit like that.

980
00:51:31,836 --> 00:51:35,019
And even more, there was a huge amount of the world that

981
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,861
was completely unknown to that Genoese map maker.

982
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,361
And that's really important.

983
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:41,322
And games and data are like that.

984
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:45,744
If you're using data to decide what you're going to make, that

985
00:51:45,764 --> 00:51:47,765
data is always going to tell you to make a slightly better

986
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:49,706
version of something that was already a success.

987
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:54,108
So Madden every year for 20 or 30 years.

988
00:51:54,508 --> 00:51:56,489
But it's not going to tell you to make something like Journey,

989
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:58,790
which is very different from anything that's been made

990
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,251
before and is a wonderful experience.

991
00:52:03,223 --> 00:52:05,244
I don't think there's a particularly right answer.

992
00:52:05,264 --> 00:52:07,605
Again, I like framework.

993
00:52:07,705 --> 00:52:11,647
So what I've put together is kind of from the left side,

994
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:16,329
familiarity, to the right side, you have innovation.

995
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:19,650
And from the bottom, you have unknown newcomer.

996
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,191
to at the top, established incumbent.

997
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:27,473
Most game developer, oh sorry, EA Sports is a good example

998
00:52:27,493 --> 00:52:29,594
of what you would find in the top left

999
00:52:30,655 --> 00:52:34,436
because it's a huge company making a familiar game

1000
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:36,997
of a familiar game again and again and again.

1001
00:52:37,898 --> 00:52:40,979
The other end would be IndieCade where it's, you know,

1002
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,900
unknown teams making tremendously innovative work.

1003
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:48,151
Most game developers are going to fall into this yellow band.

1004
00:52:48,811 --> 00:52:51,633
And that's because the bigger you are,

1005
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:54,414
the more established you are, your problem,

1006
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,075
there's more at risk.

1007
00:52:56,295 --> 00:52:57,816
Usually your budgets are huge.

1008
00:52:57,956 --> 00:53:00,658
You've got big expectations from your investors,

1009
00:53:00,718 --> 00:53:03,619
from your shareholders, even from your existing player base.

1010
00:53:03,979 --> 00:53:06,701
So every decision that you make is high risk.

1011
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:08,562
So you're probably going to put your investments

1012
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:10,583
towards something that's more familiar and safe.

1013
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:13,925
and stay around your familiar territory.

1014
00:53:14,426 --> 00:53:15,987
When you're an unknown developer,

1015
00:53:16,307 --> 00:53:18,609
your biggest risk is standing out in the crowd.

1016
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:23,153
So innovation becomes less risky to you.

1017
00:53:23,173 --> 00:53:24,734
And in fact, it can be an advantage

1018
00:53:24,774 --> 00:53:27,036
because it'll help you stand out.

1019
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,639
But that doesn't mean that successful games

1020
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:32,660
are necessarily going to come from this yellow band.

1021
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:39,383
Example would be Stardew Valley, which is a very

1022
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:43,286
polished new version of Harvest Moon from a totally

1023
00:53:43,326 --> 00:53:44,107
unknown developer.

1024
00:53:44,527 --> 00:53:46,689
And that's been a huge success.

1025
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:52,074
And certain incumbents, with the right process, are more

1026
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:52,654
risk tolerant.

1027
00:53:52,694 --> 00:53:55,416
So Supercell has a process where

1028
00:53:55,837 --> 00:53:59,158
they're very comfortable with larger risks and going farther.

1029
00:53:59,518 --> 00:54:01,379
And because they have a lot of profits, they can do it.

1030
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:04,520
And so they were able to release something like Kasha Royale,

1031
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,260
which is truly an innovative game,

1032
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:08,701
even though it came from a very established incumbent.

1033
00:54:10,302 --> 00:54:15,784
So, final words is that whether, you know, you're a detective,

1034
00:54:15,924 --> 00:54:22,686
a CSI, an astronomer, a cartographer, or explorer,

1035
00:54:23,387 --> 00:54:25,187
keep your eyes and minds open.

1036
00:54:26,025 --> 00:54:30,331
stay a little paranoid, and try and find your world to recreate.

1037
00:54:31,472 --> 00:54:32,233
So, thank you.

1038
00:54:32,714 --> 00:54:35,638
I don't know that there's very much time left, but in the five minutes,

1039
00:54:35,658 --> 00:54:37,020
hopefully I can take some questions.

1040
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:40,725
Special thanks to a bunch of people who helped me with data in the talk,

1041
00:54:41,265 --> 00:54:42,427
and also for hiring.

1042
00:54:56,673 --> 00:54:57,154
Any questions?

1043
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:01,175
Nope.

1044
00:55:01,775 --> 00:55:02,335
Oh, okay.

1045
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:08,537
Hi, so I was particularly interested in your list

1046
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:11,298
of things where you found that the testing was useful,

1047
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:13,218
because when we were running a bunch of A-B tests,

1048
00:55:13,258 --> 00:55:15,599
we often found, as you found that, you know.

1049
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:19,928
eight or nine times out of ten, it wouldn't make a difference at all or be a difference

1050
00:55:19,948 --> 00:55:20,769
in the subpopulation.

1051
00:55:21,189 --> 00:55:25,834
And so, could you go into a little bit more detail about the tests that you found did

1052
00:55:25,914 --> 00:55:26,134
work?

1053
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:34,362
So you mentioned store, feature unlocking, were there any common features between things

1054
00:55:34,402 --> 00:55:37,085
that tended to get statistically significant results?

1055
00:55:40,028 --> 00:55:43,672
I think they were features that were large enough to have an impact.

1056
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:48,058
A lot of testing, a lot of times people will test things that are really too small to have

1057
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:48,659
an impact.

1058
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:55,307
So the kinds of things that have worked are significant testing on major features.

1059
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,411
something that significantly changes the experience.

1060
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:00,512
There's a pretty broad range of things

1061
00:56:00,552 --> 00:56:02,112
that have been significant for us.

1062
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:04,593
On Animation Throwdown, for example,

1063
00:56:04,633 --> 00:56:07,214
we did a test on how long research timers should be.

1064
00:56:07,294 --> 00:56:09,915
So how long you wait until you get

1065
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:13,256
to unlock the combo that you're discovering.

1066
00:56:13,596 --> 00:56:15,117
That was a very significant test

1067
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,998
and had a big impact on retention.

1068
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,062
So does that answer the question?

1069
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:23,864
I think a lot of things can have an impact on your game,

1070
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:25,345
and it's hard to say exactly what.

1071
00:56:25,665 --> 00:56:30,408
I think testing the color of two buttons is not a very big

1072
00:56:30,448 --> 00:56:32,449
question, and you're not going to get a very big answer.

1073
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:36,111
So you have to have a very substantial question before

1074
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:37,372
you're going to get a significant answer.

1075
00:56:37,512 --> 00:56:37,732
Right.

1076
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:40,914
So the timer, especially economy-based timers that can

1077
00:56:41,035 --> 00:56:44,197
really dig into your economy in that game.

1078
00:56:44,277 --> 00:56:45,577
So that's a perfect example.

1079
00:56:45,677 --> 00:56:45,737
OK.

1080
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,381
I had a question.

1081
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:49,821
Sure.

1082
00:56:50,622 --> 00:56:53,064
A lot of the industry is changing with more and more

1083
00:56:53,124 --> 00:56:55,706
games depending on ad revenue, which is something

1084
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,089
Congregate really sets the bar on.

1085
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:01,191
And you were showing us how the map of the known world

1086
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:02,252
has changed a lot.

1087
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,095
And something that perhaps AppVanity and SensorTower

1088
00:57:05,115 --> 00:57:08,297
don't cover yet is the ad revenue market.

1089
00:57:08,317 --> 00:57:12,221
I was wondering how Congregate analyzes and views

1090
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:13,562
the market within that context.

1091
00:57:14,483 --> 00:57:14,863
So.

1092
00:57:17,721 --> 00:57:23,527
One thing that's tricky and that is trickier about ad revenue versus other revenue is that

1093
00:57:24,047 --> 00:57:28,211
it's much harder to pull into game an attribute at a player level.

1094
00:57:28,752 --> 00:57:34,517
So what we tend to do is look at proxies like percent engagement with ads.

1095
00:57:34,837 --> 00:57:38,380
That we can fire on our side, and then we can make a good

1096
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,842
guess at what kind of revenue we're going to get by

1097
00:57:40,942 --> 00:57:43,504
Geo based on that.

1098
00:57:44,265 --> 00:57:47,888
One thing to understand with ads is that there is our old

1099
00:57:47,908 --> 00:57:49,509
friend the power curve in terms of revenue.

1100
00:57:49,749 --> 00:57:52,572
The first ad that somebody's shown is much more valuable

1101
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:54,593
than the ninth or tenth.

1102
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:59,537
So ad engagement is a good proxy for ad revenue, even

1103
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:01,179
though you don't have it there exactly.

1104
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:02,660
Does that answer your question?

1105
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:03,701
Sure, thank you.

1106
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:15,214
Hi, so if say you're a data analyst at a large company,

1107
00:58:16,235 --> 00:58:19,098
and you're saying that it's hard to convince people

1108
00:58:19,178 --> 00:58:20,900
to make new games using data

1109
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,802
because data only maps a known world,

1110
00:58:23,383 --> 00:58:26,886
what tips might you give to data analysts at large companies

1111
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:30,050
who might want to encourage executives

1112
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,171
to make those new games?

1113
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:37,067
Example, I think fake things, oh, this is apparently my last,

1114
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:38,808
the last question I can answer.

1115
00:58:40,428 --> 00:58:44,390
If they want data, think about what their motivation is

1116
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:52,653
and think about and use that to try and find things

1117
00:58:52,713 --> 00:58:56,274
that will satisfy their motivation.

1118
00:58:57,615 --> 00:59:01,136
So it might be comps of different types of things

1119
00:59:01,536 --> 00:59:01,597
or...

1120
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,800
looking at something that's radically different or

1121
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,401
yes. Something like that. The other thing I would say is that

1122
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:13,562
the culture of a company and the culture of risk in their

1123
00:59:13,622 --> 00:59:18,763
executives is something that's extremely hard to change. And

1124
00:59:19,284 --> 00:59:22,964
so if you really want to do something innovative and

1125
00:59:22,984 --> 00:59:25,285
different then you may need to go to a different company.

1126
00:59:27,013 --> 00:59:27,695
Fair enough.

1127
00:59:27,715 --> 00:59:29,800
I can see you're representing the same show.

1128
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:29,900
Yeah.

1129
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,085
The larger the company, the harder it is to influence.

1130
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:33,088
Thank you.

1131
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,170
Okay.

1132
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:34,551
Cool.

1133
00:59:34,591 --> 00:59:35,072
Thank you, everybody.
