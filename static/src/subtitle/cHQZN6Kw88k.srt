1
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:08,653
So I last spoke here in 2014.

2
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:20,914
My PhD was in AI for Games, and many of you may remember me as the shouty guy talking

3
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,355
about how we could do things a slightly different way.

4
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:29,557
And I disappeared into corporate America at the end of 2014, and I actually moved here,

5
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:34,138
which was strange, and joined Zynga, and I've worked my way through the ranks and become

6
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:37,140
director of central and strategic analytics, as Steve mentioned.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,722
And that's a big lofty title that doesn't really mean much.

8
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,705
But what it sort of means is that I provide

9
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,466
kind of technical oversight over a majority

10
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:49,328
of our kind of AI and machine learning

11
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:50,568
and data science across Zynga,

12
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,651
as well as leading a team of practitioners

13
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:54,871
that are a centralized resource.

14
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:57,742
So you might have heard of Zynga.

15
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:02,864
Back in the old days, we were very well-known for Farmville.

16
00:01:02,885 --> 00:01:03,345
That was kind of 2009.

17
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:06,446
That's the thing that kind of kicked everything off for us.

18
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,167
And since then, we've diversified our portfolio.

19
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:11,969
We're now running games like Zynga Poker.

20
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:14,150
That's now celebrated its 10-year anniversary.

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,891
And then we acquired studios like Natural Motion,

22
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:20,232
and we now have CSR2, Dawn of Titans,

23
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:22,173
games like that in the mid-course space

24
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:22,814
running out the UK.

25
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:26,716
Words With Friends obviously remains our staple title.

26
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:32,118
Everybody's played Words With Friends on the planet,

27
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:32,719
I believe.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,961
And more recently, we've been doing some acquisitions,

29
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:40,503
picking up studios like Gram Games in Istanbul

30
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:44,104
with Merge Dragons and the Small Giant Crew in Helsinki

31
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:45,645
for Empires and Puzzles.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,641
So that's the kind of games that we make and where we are.

33
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:51,202
But let me give you some numbers on that.

34
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:56,043
After over 10 years, we've got actually 50-plus games live

35
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,604
today across our entire portfolio.

36
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,784
And that's across mobile.

37
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:01,145
We're mobile first these days.

38
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:05,206
But we've still got our presence on Facebook,

39
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:10,648
on Facebook's instant messenger platform, and iMessage as well.

40
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:19,066
We have across our whole portfolio, we have about 85 million players per month, and that's

41
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:23,107
driving in 2018, 907 million dollars in revenue.

42
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:27,169
So I've pulled those numbers from our most recent financial report, so I don't think

43
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:31,871
anybody can dispute them, and certainly corporate didn't when they reviewed these slides, so

44
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:32,571
it's probably right.

45
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:39,365
So let's talk a little bit more about what central and strategic actually means.

46
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:44,829
So like I say, it's a small group of data scientists and data analysts who sit centrally,

47
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,930
not embedded with our stakeholders.

48
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,554
We have a game analytics crew who is all embedded, really supporting in a service kind of role

49
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:56,276
the actual day-to-day of our game.

50
00:02:56,336 --> 00:03:00,179
So these are the people who are giving the insights to the product managers, actually

51
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,882
kind of delivering a lot of insight and knowledge into what's going on inside that game.

52
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:06,484
We don't do that.

53
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:10,187
We sit centrally, and as a central team,

54
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:13,830
we provide support to the people that don't have coverage.

55
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,733
And that means like, corp dev, for example.

56
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,574
Like, when we go on one of these acquisition sprees,

57
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:21,936
well, there's no point having a team dedicated to that

58
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:24,338
because it's kind of infrequent work.

59
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:25,639
So it falls on my team.

60
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:31,116
And then on the strategic side, we're kind of focused on things that cross division or

61
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:36,141
cross company, things that are going to touch multiple teams across the entire kind of global

62
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,122
operations of Zynga.

63
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:41,446
And one of the core things that we're kind of centered on, mostly because of my personal

64
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:46,571
biases and kind of that's how I'm steering the team, is a focus on kind of novel uses

65
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:47,992
of AI and machine learning techniques.

66
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,187
So what do we mean when we say AI?

67
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:54,447
This is gonna get defined repeatedly and repeatedly,

68
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,008
but in the context of kind of big corporate business,

69
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,010
in general, we would like our AI systems

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,171
to be one or more, ideally more, of three things.

71
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,312
Assistive to humans, better than humans,

72
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,872
or faster than humans.

73
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:10,953
And if you can tick at least one of those boxes,

74
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:13,734
it's probably a good candidate for some cool AI shit.

75
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:17,395
And the idea is that we can drive operational efficiency.

76
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,701
We want to move humans up the value chain.

77
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,422
There's not really a whole lot of value

78
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:27,283
to humans doing mundane tasks that an algorithm could do.

79
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:30,424
What we want to do is put the humans in the driving seat,

80
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:33,405
kind of driving the algorithm, and actually kind of providing

81
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:39,686
more impact than doing grudge, drudge kind of work.

82
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:44,048
So who here knows anything about mobile advertising?

83
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,309
Cool, then you're going to enjoy the next slide.

84
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:51,849
Because I got dropped onto a project

85
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:52,910
around mobile advertising.

86
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,492
And it was the first thing that I kind of took on

87
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,894
as part of this new responsibility.

88
00:04:57,934 --> 00:04:59,295
And I said, cool.

89
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:03,118
At that time, I knew that our games were supported by ads.

90
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:07,241
And there was some magic that made ads appear in games.

91
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:08,722
And that was all I knew.

92
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:12,345
So let me give you a crash course in mobile advertising,

93
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:13,326
because you will need it later.

94
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:18,644
So imagine you have a game, and you want to show some advertising in that game.

95
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:21,285
We use what's called mediation.

96
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:27,527
And the reason that we do that is that we're going to try to find a good price to sell

97
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:28,588
this piece of advertising at.

98
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:31,589
And we use what's called a waterfall strategy.

99
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,970
There are other strategies out there like unified auction.

100
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,614
But our waterfall strategy means that we contact a mediator, and we say, OK, well, can you

101
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:46,538
talk to AdNetwork1, and can you try to sell this piece of advertising for $20?

102
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:52,662
And they will contact their advertisers, and kind of all of this is happening in real time.

103
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:57,166
So the price here is in cost per thousand, so CPM.

104
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:01,369
So it sounds like a big number for one piece of advertising, but divide it by a thousand.

105
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:05,729
And maybe they say yes, in which case we're done

106
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:06,910
and we can move on and it's all good.

107
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,433
Maybe they say no, in which case we go, OK, cool.

108
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:14,797
What if we went to AdNetwork2 and got $20 there?

109
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:17,339
And maybe they say yes, and maybe they say no.

110
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,101
So then we might go to AdNetwork3 and $15,

111
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,143
and now we're getting not desperate yet,

112
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:25,585
but we're going to get desperate as we go further down here.

113
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,488
AdNetwork1, maybe we drop the price and we say, OK, well,

114
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:30,969
you couldn't do $20, but can you do $13?

115
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:35,367
So each one of every time we reach out to the ad network,

116
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,909
they're running an auction on their side.

117
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:40,991
And the dollar value that we're giving here

118
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:41,951
is the reserve price.

119
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,073
So imagine that they are running an eBay auction

120
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:45,994
with a reserve price at that point.

121
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:49,296
That's kind of giving you a sense of what's happening here

122
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,457
and why it's this cascading waterfall.

123
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:58,577
So, at the end of it, we maybe dropped down to $5 at network 2.

124
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:04,583
So 18 months ago, we asked the question, okay, cool, how do these configurations get generated?

125
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:08,154
And the answer we got back was that there

126
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,795
are people who sit down and figure out

127
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,776
what they think the price point should be,

128
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,537
and which order the ad network should appear in,

129
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:16,737
and what goes where.

130
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:18,878
And they do that all manually.

131
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,178
And we said, well, fuck that.

132
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,080
So 18 months ago, we said, OK, we can optimize this process.

133
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,281
So let's actually start a project around optimizing this.

134
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:32,583
And we created this thing called Zoe, the Zynga Ads

135
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:33,963
Optimization Engine.

136
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:40,535
It turns out that if you work at a big company that has a Z at the front of the name, most

137
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:46,199
of your acronyms end up starting with Z. The other one is VIL, something VIL, contract

138
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,960
VIL, manager VIL, just an insight into corporate America there.

139
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,944
This is a really interesting problem, though, because at the end of the day, we actually

140
00:07:54,984 --> 00:08:00,687
partner with 40 different ad networks. In fact, it might even be closer to 50. Each

141
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,649
network can appear multiple times at multiple different price points.

142
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:09,319
This is one of the gnarliest optimization problems and the most fun optimization problems I've ever had to sit down with.

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,808
Um, because you've effectively got this kind of indefinitely long list of knobs that you can kind of put on the thing.

144
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:21,513
You've got a box full of different knobs and different settings and like you can just play around with it. It's fantastic.

145
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:22,414
Um...

146
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,630
In an ideal world, you would start out at the highest price point that you think you

147
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,897
can get to, and you would go, okay, down the list, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar,

148
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,481
99 cents, 99, and you would just brute force it, right?

149
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:38,428
That's kind of the optimal strategy to maximize revenue.

150
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,619
The problem with that, and I kind of mentioned it earlier,

151
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,523
is that people are waiting for their ad.

152
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:46,225
This is all happening in real time.

153
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:48,968
So the more times that we actually go out,

154
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,632
and the more we get it wrong, the worse the user experience

155
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:54,594
is, because they're sat and they're waiting,

156
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,658
and you've just got a blank screen there.

157
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:58,960
And that's not good.

158
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,021
And it turns out that if people are given a blank screen

159
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:03,222
when you're supposed to give them an ad,

160
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:05,123
they will eventually just piss off

161
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:06,223
and never open your game again.

162
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:08,684
And that's not what we're going for,

163
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:09,725
for our user experience.

164
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:14,947
So, let me introduce you to how Zoe works

165
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,088
from a block kind of point of view.

166
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:21,134
So imagine that you have data to ingest

167
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:22,515
because you're tracking everything

168
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,536
and you have a whole bunch of sales information

169
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,317
about what's actually being done.

170
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,519
That reporting is generally on a 24 hour aggregate basis.

171
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,821
So we get performance for the last 24 hours.

172
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:34,002
We ingest it.

173
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,084
It's data, so we have to clean it

174
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,386
because it's trashy in places.

175
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:43,708
And then we do a whole bunch of aggregation type stuff.

176
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,770
I'm going to gloss over the next box.

177
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,631
We do clever stuff.

178
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:51,312
And then there's a post-processing phase.

179
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:55,434
And then what happens next is it gets shipped out

180
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,494
to the ad networks.

181
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:58,755
Now, that sounds easy, right?

182
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:02,876
Turns out that the state of ad tech

183
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:06,998
is woefully behind the times on the publisher side.

184
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,439
I joined this project, and I thought, OK, cool.

185
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,360
We just fire off some API calls, right?

186
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,340
No.

187
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:19,245
Turns out that most of the ad networks have got to a point now where they have web portals.

188
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:23,329
So you open up a web browser and you log into their portal and you set things up and you've

189
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:26,972
got to set it up in two different places because you've got to set it up on the mediator side

190
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:28,213
and on the network side.

191
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:35,559
That's not great, particularly when you're doing that at like 30 plus networks and you're

192
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,782
reliant on these vendors not changing their website because you're trying to do it using

193
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,423
like Selenium or something like that.

194
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,961
So that's suboptimal.

195
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:48,063
It turns out that there's a whole bunch of ad networks

196
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,264
that are even further behind the times.

197
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:51,185
And you actually email a human being,

198
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:54,226
and they will make the change in their system for you.

199
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,267
That's actually easier for us,

200
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,629
because we can generate an email automatically.

201
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:00,470
We can't figure out how to,

202
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,531
well, we could figure out how to log into these websites,

203
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:04,632
but we decided not to.

204
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:09,576
So we introduced some drudge work for some humans,

205
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,258
and we actually spit out a text file and say,

206
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,140
okay, cool, go put this into a website, please.

207
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:17,002
And they do that.

208
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:22,046
And then we go and we go and do some sales for the day,

209
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,708
and we show some ads, and it's all good.

210
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:27,311
And then we get reporting for the last 24 hours,

211
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:28,612
and close the loop there.

212
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:34,187
All right, so that's how Zoe works at a very kind of 30,000 foot view.

213
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,370
I kind of arm-waved the clever stuff and I'm not going to get away with that in this room,

214
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,212
so let's talk about what clever stuff means.

215
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:46,796
The reason that I like that block level diagram is that it really highlights the extent to

216
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,257
which this is a modular approach.

217
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:51,119
It means that we can sub different strategies in,

218
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,180
and we've actually developed three or four different solvers

219
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,741
to try and approach this problem.

220
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:58,362
We've been doing a whole bunch of experimentation

221
00:11:58,422 --> 00:12:01,904
with algorithms, with update cadences.

222
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:07,647
Our initial kind of view was that the frequency of update

223
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:08,667
actually made a difference.

224
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,929
We kind of, we took a parallel to the stock market

225
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:13,409
and said, okay, well if we can get to a place

226
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:15,190
where we're doing effectively high frequency trading,

227
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,531
that feels like a win.

228
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,253
Turns out it doesn't work like that.

229
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:23,076
We also played around with ordering.

230
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:25,159
So in that example that I gave you, everything was in

231
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,721
strictly decreasing CPM order.

232
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,624
We played around with trying to do it in fill rate order,

233
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,406
trying to do it in a whole bunch of other strategies.

234
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,927
And it turns out we've been just too clever.

235
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,531
So the algorithms that we tried.

236
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:41,274
was predicting the price point based on market trends.

237
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:44,255
So we called that system the gradient surf.

238
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:47,157
And as the kind of stock prices,

239
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:50,920
so the parallel that I draw is stock price.

240
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,121
So imagine that each line in the waterfall

241
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:54,882
is a single stock ticker,

242
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:57,544
and it's kind of trading at different prices

243
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:58,444
over different times.

244
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:00,746
If you can predict where it's going to go,

245
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,327
the theory was that you can set your price point

246
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,469
appropriately and off to the races.

247
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,217
that didn't seem to work well.

248
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,261
And here is a piece of advice for you.

249
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,746
If you've got something that's fairly experimental,

250
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:16,011
don't put it on your biggest game.

251
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,410
So I got a lot of angry emails from Words With Friends.

252
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:24,772
And we turned that one off,

253
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:25,632
because it wasn't doing well,

254
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:26,633
and we tested it somewhere else,

255
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,814
and actually it turns out it's actually not great.

256
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:32,357
We tried linear programming with binpacking.

257
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:34,738
In fact, I think it's binary programming

258
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:35,699
rather than linear programming.

259
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,341
But the idea is that you can kind of put out the,

260
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:38,721
all the...

261
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:41,363
waterfall lines and the potential prices,

262
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,564
and do a whole bunch of linear programming

263
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:46,005
around that for which one should be turned on and off.

264
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:47,506
And that gets you in a world where

265
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,667
you can bin pack around how many requests you're

266
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,609
going to get in the next day.

267
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,950
And it turns out that because requests is softly connected

268
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:57,332
to DAU, it's not directly correlated.

269
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:59,993
But if you've got a good sense of how many people are going

270
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,015
to play your game on a Thursday, you've

271
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,796
got a good sense of how many ads you're going

272
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:04,976
to need to serve on a Thursday.

273
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:07,097
And at that point, that puts you in a world

274
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:08,057
where you can say, okay, well,

275
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:12,099
if I'm trying to fill a backpack that's this big,

276
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,479
how do I do that?

277
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,720
And then we tried some simulation-based approaches

278
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,561
and a whole bunch of stuff around kind of

279
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,382
doing things that are a little bit more

280
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:21,522
kind of roller-oriented.

281
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,723
And one of the reasons that I'm not going to get deep

282
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,604
into which one of these is great,

283
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,644
the first one definitely is not great,

284
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,926
is that I don't think we've solved this to optimality yet.

285
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:34,366
And I don't wanna say, hey, do it this way.

286
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:37,148
Also, legal don't want me to say,

287
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,250
hey, do it this way in case we're onto something.

288
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,854
But the point is that this is a really good opportunity

289
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:45,355
to use some cool machine learning

290
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:48,418
to actually optimize something that's around your business

291
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:50,619
that's not actually inside of the game,

292
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,321
but actually drives outcomes.

293
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:54,651
So let's talk about those outcomes.

294
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:57,992
First thing that I have to kind of caveat

295
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:02,074
is that this is so hard to figure out what's going on.

296
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,115
Every one of these line items in the waterfall,

297
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:09,056
like I say, it acts independently.

298
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:11,377
They kind of are treated as their own commodity

299
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,417
within this stock market.

300
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:15,838
And it turns out that there's no real strong way

301
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:16,698
to A-B test that.

302
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,799
Because as soon as you try and A-B test it,

303
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,860
A and B start doing different things, and that...

304
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:24,126
is really awful.

305
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:29,029
So, we've spent a lot of time

306
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,851
kind of just staring at charts,

307
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:33,432
trying to understand what the hell is going on,

308
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:36,955
trying to find apples to apples comparisons

309
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,396
in terms of historical performance.

310
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,592
So what we know is that we know that we can mess it up.

311
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,634
That algorithm I mentioned earlier really

312
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,617
proved that we were actually connected to revenue, which

313
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:50,879
is intuitively it has to be true,

314
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,081
but it's good to get the validation when you just

315
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:55,082
torpedo everything.

316
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,185
you have to find a silver lining somewhere.

317
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:01,570
But what we found is that you can't actually

318
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,474
really tell a difference between the operation

319
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:07,258
of the humans and the algorithm.

320
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:09,140
Like, we're getting comparable results.

321
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,422
You can't kind of look at them and go,

322
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:12,544
well, this is obviously the one that's underperforming.

323
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,522
And what we think is that we think we're driving upside.

324
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,643
And the reason that we say that is

325
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:21,424
that when we do find something that looks historically

326
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,064
like it's an apples to apples comparison,

327
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:27,226
and we drop Zoe on one of the apples, it starts to diverge.

328
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,187
And that's really kind of a good indicator.

329
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,928
It's not conclusive, but it's a pretty good leading indicator

330
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:33,769
that we're onto something.

331
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:36,050
And like I say, this frequency thing.

332
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:40,118
Intuitively, you should be able to make the changes faster,

333
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:42,279
react to the market faster, and get there.

334
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:45,860
Turns out, we think we're causing so much turbulence

335
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,101
in the market every time we change around our waterfall

336
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:52,583
that it actually is worse than just kind of holding back.

337
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:56,596
So we've not rolled this out to the entire portfolio yet,

338
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,797
but we're starting to really strategize

339
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:01,237
about what that's going to look like and how we can do that.

340
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:02,558
So some of the things that we're looking at

341
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:04,498
are kind of like predicting upside.

342
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,700
So if we can say that there's an opportunity on words today,

343
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,581
then we can actually direct the ad operations people

344
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,001
to kind of focus their attention there,

345
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,521
take the guidance from Zoe.

346
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:17,142
Whereas if we see tomorrow that it's somewhere else,

347
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:19,083
we can actually be reactive to that.

348
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:23,779
So cool, you all now are smarter about mobile advertising

349
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,400
a little bit, I hope, and benefited from about 18 months

350
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,361
of me staring at stuff going, what?

351
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,321
So let's talk about something else.

352
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:36,543
It's kind of a related problem, but user acquisition.

353
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:42,645
People show up in mobile games because of reasons.

354
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,145
And some of those reasons are that we've

355
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:46,986
paid for advertising on various channels.

356
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:52,851
How would you go about optimizing your budget allocation?

357
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:57,653
At a meta level, the way that you do it is that you focus on this idea of return on ad

358
00:17:57,673 --> 00:17:57,974
spend.

359
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:03,757
Basically, this is a kind of measure of how quickly you are going to get the money that

360
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:05,738
you spend on the ad back.

361
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:08,357
And that varies on different channels,

362
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:11,618
and that's kind of because the different channels have

363
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,678
obviously different audiences, different types of people

364
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:13,998
around.

365
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:16,039
So maybe you might decide that you're

366
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,679
going to spend a whole bunch of money in Facebook

367
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:20,320
and very little money on Google AdWords today.

368
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,441
The trick to all of this is maximizing the aggregate return

369
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:26,961
on ad spend.

370
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,081
If you can do that, if you can do

371
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:30,542
a whole bunch of optimization at a meta level,

372
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,703
then you can get to a world where you can actually

373
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:33,403
start to do that.

374
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,762
But then we can go a step further and a step deeper

375
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,964
and say, OK, well, what about targeted acquisition?

376
00:18:39,004 --> 00:18:41,966
What about specifically for this person?

377
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:43,768
How much would you bid for this player?

378
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:46,330
Two things going on there.

379
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,271
One is the real-time nature of that,

380
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:50,173
because you have to be real quick.

381
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:53,476
You have to have a system that runs in sort

382
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,337
of millisecond order of speed.

383
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:57,839
But you also need to know.

384
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,987
how much you value somebody who looks like that.

385
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,328
You know, and in order to get to that,

386
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:07,449
you need to have a good sense of whether, you know,

387
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,411
as somebody who meets these kind of criteria

388
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:13,132
that the advertiser is kind of presenting to us,

389
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,292
have they enjoyed the game?

390
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:15,733
Have they paid for the game?

391
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:18,114
Have they like churned out immediately?

392
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:20,035
In which case, maybe we're not gonna spend that much on them.

393
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:28,346
So this is why analytics and AI is completely intertwined,

394
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:33,188
particularly at companies that have established data groups.

395
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:35,449
This is always going to be true, I think.

396
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,551
But the insights that we drive based on the data

397
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:40,172
that we're gathering.

398
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,154
So at the base level, you are gathering that telemetry.

399
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:45,894
You're figuring out what's going on in the game.

400
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:48,680
Then at the next level, you're driving the insights,

401
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,862
and you're driving that kind of understanding

402
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:52,523
of how people are interacting with the game,

403
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:53,244
what's going on.

404
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:55,306
So this is kind of the very service-oriented view

405
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:57,588
that I mentioned earlier in the game analytics group.

406
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:00,311
But then you can take those insights

407
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:02,072
and start building decision systems around them.

408
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,635
And those decision systems can actually be driving

409
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:06,216
some really cool shit for your business.

410
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:11,141
So.

411
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:14,592
One of the things that often comes up

412
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:16,153
when we start talking about data science

413
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:18,695
and kind of this kind of idea is the propensity modeling.

414
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:22,037
So propensity modeling is basically this idea

415
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:25,560
of given historical data and what happened next,

416
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,723
I'm gonna drive a model to kind of tell me,

417
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:31,944
okay, based on this, I understand

418
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,326
what the kind of causative factors in this were,

419
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:37,208
and then we can start rolling it forwards

420
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:38,068
and predicting the future.

421
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:43,454
So you have to, so let's give a concrete example of that.

422
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:44,615
So like likely to lapse,

423
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:46,356
likely to not come back to the game.

424
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:50,058
Well, I'm gonna look at a snapshot of time in the past,

425
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:52,179
and I'm gonna label all that data

426
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,680
based on whether people came back or not.

427
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,423
And then I'm gonna feed it into some sort of analysis

428
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,204
or modeling system, could be a random forest,

429
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:04,026
it could be a regression system.

430
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,799
But the trick is training a classifier on that labeled data set,

431
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:09,901
and then run it against the recent data.

432
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:11,762
And that's going to allow you to understand

433
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,423
who's coming back, who's not coming back.

434
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:17,287
Then you can take that kind of idea forwards

435
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:19,148
and start doing some interesting things with that.

436
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,412
You can start surfacing offers to people

437
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:24,873
who are not having a great time.

438
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,615
Give them the opportunity to kind of, you know,

439
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:30,577
get more out of the game at a cheaper price point.

440
00:21:31,078 --> 00:21:34,260
Now this, frankly, is very low-hanging fruit.

441
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:41,004
It's a very obvious way, it's a very product management centric way of approaching the

442
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:41,365
problem.

443
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:43,425
But it's effective.

444
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:47,507
You know, you are kind of customizing the game experience and kind of giving people

445
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:48,947
an incentive to hang around a little bit.

446
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:56,890
One of the dirty secrets about that, though, is that if people were likely to lapse already,

447
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,631
it's because they kind of weren't enjoying the game.

448
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,052
And giving them a sale...

449
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:03,935
okay, maybe you get them to hang around a little bit,

450
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:06,255
maybe they, but it's still the same game, right?

451
00:22:07,656 --> 00:22:09,236
What if you could go a step further?

452
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:14,357
So take those kind of understandings

453
00:22:14,397 --> 00:22:15,458
of our propensity scoring,

454
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:18,779
and use them to build out some pretty deep,

455
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:20,539
holistic models,

456
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
and start to actually manage the experience of the player,

457
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,361
to match likes and dislikes.

458
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:34,816
My fundamental theory is that people who enjoy a game are motivated to support the developer.

459
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:42,539
And if you're not enjoying the game, it doesn't really matter. You know, sales are great,

460
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,362
everything's great, but fundamentally, that person isn't a good match to that game. So

461
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,283
incentivize people to and optimize for fun experiences.

462
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,760
We can do that by modulating our live operations.

463
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,323
We can actually tweak things in real time and say,

464
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:01,265
okay, well, you want this kind of experience,

465
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:03,507
therefore, maybe we're gonna alter the difficulty

466
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:06,349
because we know that in an evening, when you're going home,

467
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,491
you've just been sat at work all day

468
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,573
and you actually just wanna grind through a few levels

469
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:12,234
and not actually have a challenge.

470
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:14,897
Whereas in the morning, we know that you as a player

471
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:16,618
want more difficulty.

472
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:18,780
You want to actually experience something

473
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,202
that challenges you because you're getting psyched up

474
00:23:21,242 --> 00:23:21,682
for your day.

475
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:26,108
If you can take everything from the data science side

476
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:29,531
and match it with this kind of idea of matching people's,

477
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:33,394
matching people's desires, ultimately,

478
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:35,776
personalizing the game to be what they're looking for,

479
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:37,978
it's not actually that much harder

480
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:39,079
than showing them the sale.

481
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:41,341
You need the same indicators, right?

482
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,543
You need to know what's going on with them.

483
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,608
So, we've said a whole bunch of stuff.

484
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:50,089
I'm starting to run out of time.

485
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,997
So I will throw you a final disclaimer.

486
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,884
Zynga's scale makes some of this easier to justify.

487
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:04,653
1% lift on our ad revenue means millions of dollars.

488
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:08,458
That makes it a real no-brainer to chase some of this stuff.

489
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,763
But if you start thinking about things in this way,

490
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:16,225
you're going to find the opportunities for your business.

491
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,647
And your mileage is going to vary.

492
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,529
This is why I'm really loathe to tell you

493
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:23,011
exactly how our ad stuff works, because I think

494
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:23,972
yours is probably different.

495
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:28,336
And it's probably not going to work exactly the same way,

496
00:24:28,376 --> 00:24:31,659
because it's so related to the relationship

497
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:34,281
between the networks and the vendor and blah, blah, blah.

498
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,663
The point being, your mileage will vary.

499
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:38,564
But start thinking about this stuff,

500
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:38,865
because

501
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:44,208
AI is a lot more than what we've historically talked about in this room, and I'm going to

502
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:49,010
be yelling and swearing about that at 5.30, so please come along to the Cheering Tantrums

503
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:49,771
session.

504
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:56,334
But I want to encourage everybody in this room to think strategically about how AI can

505
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,374
support your businesses.

506
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:01,340
Those opportunities really do exist everywhere.

507
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,442
I've talked about advertising, I've talked about user acquisition, I've talked about

508
00:25:04,482 --> 00:25:08,885
personalization, but what does AI for community management look like?

509
00:25:08,945 --> 00:25:10,767
Well, think about it.

510
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:13,289
There are people in this room who have opinions about that.

511
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,371
What does it look like for even like...

512
00:25:17,072 --> 00:25:18,093
Stationary cupboards.

513
00:25:18,493 --> 00:25:21,275
How many pads of paper have you got through today,

514
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:23,237
versus, or in the last six months,

515
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:24,659
and versus how many are you gonna order?

516
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,121
Like, there's probably a model in there

517
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:28,702
that will optimize stuff and actually help you

518
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:30,424
kind of use your budgets.

519
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:31,665
That's a really daft example.

520
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:32,425
Don't do that one.

521
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,202
We've really only scratched the surface of what we can do.

522
00:25:38,822 --> 00:25:41,204
So I want to challenge everybody in this room to go forth,

523
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:44,226
open your eyes, and actually use your skills,

524
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:46,988
your AI skills, everywhere you possibly can.

525
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:49,830
And if you would like to do so at Zynga,

526
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,171
analytics.zynga.com.

527
00:25:52,232 --> 00:25:55,154
You can reach out to me, Eldick, at zynga.com.

528
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:57,336
You can find me on Twitter, I'm at Luke D.

529
00:25:58,136 --> 00:26:00,618
Please reach out, tell me just how wrong I am

530
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:01,439
about all this stuff.

531
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,261
But this is a fundamental philosophy for me.

532
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,322
You know, at the end of the day,

533
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:09,883
the obsession with NPCs is cool,

534
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:14,185
it's kind of nice, it generates really interesting things,

535
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,746
but it doesn't generate business results.

536
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:20,108
And that's kind of what I want to see us do more,

537
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:20,828
because we can.

538
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:22,909
That's it.

539
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:37,959
Any questions from anyone?

540
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,641
Everybody's piecing out really fast, so I'd.

541
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:41,162
Hello.

542
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:42,483
Thank you for your talk.

543
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:47,647
I have one question about this personalizing player's

544
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:48,467
experience, right?

545
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:49,328
Sounds really great.

546
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:52,150
So I was wondering, does it?

547
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:57,618
Like if you make the game more fun for the player, it means

548
00:26:57,738 --> 00:27:02,059
like maybe you're giving him or her more rewards or

549
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:02,659
something like that.

550
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,061
And it doesn't mean that it will basically decrease

551
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:10,221
chances that the player will buy something.

552
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,762
I mean, do you have anything on that?

553
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:16,707
OK, so the question is, I guess it came through the mic,

554
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:18,368
so it's probably OK, but I'll repeat it anyway

555
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,068
because I was told to.

556
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:22,971
The question is, if you personalize the experience,

557
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,912
do you end up in a situation where you end up

558
00:27:24,952 --> 00:27:27,113
giving people more things, and as a result,

559
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:28,334
kind of cannibalize your sales?

560
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,196
The answer is, maybe.

561
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:34,918
It's definitely something to keep an eye out for, right?

562
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:39,521
But at the same time, if you're doing your personalization

563
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:42,182
in a smart way, probably not.

564
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:42,723
You know.

565
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:45,485
I don't want to say yes or no to that question.

566
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,365
It's definitely a factor.

567
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,267
It's definitely something to be aware of.

568
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,148
But I think there's ways you can mitigate it.

569
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:52,350
And part of that is like,

570
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,351
you're providing a fun experience for people.

571
00:27:55,512 --> 00:27:59,455
And okay, people, it's changing the value proposition maybe.

572
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,097
In which case, maybe change your monetization strategy.

573
00:28:02,777 --> 00:28:05,799
Maybe that person to you is more valuable watching ads.

574
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:10,526
And they're going to stay in the game longer because you've given them something to keep

575
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:11,047
them around.

576
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,170
So they've got more opportunity to be incentivized a different way.

577
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:15,451
Okay.

578
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:16,332
Thank you.

579
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:21,637
Does your scale give you the ability to drive back into the marketplace and say, give us

580
00:28:21,697 --> 00:28:26,162
a better interface and we'll give you preferential treatment so that we can actually do this

581
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:29,465
more the way we want to, or are you not allowed to comment on that exact thing?

582
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:30,546
You know what?

583
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,463
I am... so the question, to repeat the question, is does Zynga get to push back on vendors?

584
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:44,126
I would say we have good relationships with a lot of vendors.

585
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:49,728
In fact, you know, we're in a position where I wouldn't frame it as pushing back.

586
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:53,370
We are able to contribute to people's roadmaps.

587
00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:59,777
But also, without legal in the room,

588
00:28:59,817 --> 00:29:01,618
I don't really want to give a definitive answer.

589
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:04,378
So we have good relationships with various vendors

590
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:05,438
and different.

591
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:08,099
Our scale does give us some opportunities.

592
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:11,100
But we're not, you know, if you're

593
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,980
talking about us talking to Google as a business,

594
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,461
like Google's significantly larger than we are.

595
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:17,861
So it depends.

596
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:20,402
In other words, you may see improvement in the future.

597
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:27,602
Yeah, can I ask one?

598
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:29,085
OK, no, we're out of time.

599
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:31,450
So let's give Luke a final round of applause.
