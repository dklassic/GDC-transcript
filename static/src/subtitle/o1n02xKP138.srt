1
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:08,685
carefully and take to heart all of your suggestions.

2
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:11,545
And the ratings very much matter for whether we're

3
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,586
invited back next year. So please do that. And

4
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:15,846
please make sure you check your junk mail folders

5
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:20,767
for those things. They often end up in there.

6
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:22,288
So I'm gonna end on what I'm hoping is

7
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:26,368
a light note. This was a last minute swap

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,289
in for a different talk that we had planned.

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,970
But I wanted to talk about homogeneous coordinates and

10
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:39,988
So my goal here is to kind of plant some seeds, intuitive seeds about this.

11
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:43,250
I'm going to be very informal about this.

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:49,734
And my goal is to hopefully give you a little better gut-level comfort

13
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:53,496
with homogeneous coordinates and what they are and how they work.

14
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:56,638
So I'm going to be a lot less formal.

15
00:00:57,415 --> 00:01:00,296
So, let's start with some questions and motivations.

16
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:05,338
What we're trying to do here is understand how is the illusion exactly

17
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:07,159
of 3D perspective achieved?

18
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,160
How does perspective projection matrix work exactly?

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,701
Or what's the essence of it, rather?

20
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,502
Why do we keep ending up in Vec4s all the time?

21
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:18,283
And exactly what does W mean anyway?

22
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:21,165
We sort of kind of know what it means sometimes.

23
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:26,870
So I'm going to pick a very specific and strong bias,

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,052
mostly just focusing on 3D and 2D games.

25
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:32,753
And we mostly primarily use matrices

26
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:37,036
for transforming positions, directions, and other matrices.

27
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:40,298
And we use the 5% of matrix math that mathematicians use.

28
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:41,359
But I'm focusing on that 5%.

29
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,340
So for this talk, I'm talking about Vec4.

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,062
I'm talking about Matrix4 and trying

31
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:48,303
to get to the bottom of those.

32
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:54,564
So, I want to start, and this is kind of chronological through my own understanding,

33
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:57,946
wrestling with like what the hell this stuff means.

34
00:01:57,946 --> 00:02:05,029
And so, I was like probably most game programmers that I know, my initial theory was the W

35
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:09,851
is for witchcraft, which was working fine for a while.

36
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:17,734
So let's look at a couple of things relating to W and see if we can start building some

37
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:18,234
intuitions.

38
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:22,564
So let's say you have two different positions, right?

39
00:02:22,564 --> 00:02:24,124
3, 2 and 5, 3 if we were in 2D.

40
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:29,287
We could subtract them, right, to get the displacement

41
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:29,888
between them of 2, 1, 0.

42
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:34,090
Now we have two different positions somewhere else.

43
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,291
They have different coordinates, but the

44
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:40,054
displacement between them, different positions all have

45
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:42,555
different coordinates.

46
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:44,076
Different displacements do not.

47
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:49,689
So there's something right away there that's interesting about the differences between these.

48
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,072
And it's very easy for us to just say vector 3 position and vector 3 displacement, right?

49
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,013
And gloss over the differences.

50
00:02:57,013 --> 00:03:00,395
Another example, let's say you have an actor who's at 230 facing north,

51
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:02,897
and she gets bumped to the right.

52
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:05,438
Her position changes, her facing does not.

53
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:06,018
Right?

54
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,820
So, these are all obvious things.

55
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,442
I'm just trying to look for little nuggets of wisdom that we can harvest and chase down.

56
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,963
So let's take a little quick pop quiz.

57
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,720
What is a position minus a position?

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,541
Is a displacement, right? We all know that.

59
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,422
A position plus a displacement?

60
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:25,682
Makes more sense if I make the displacement on it.

61
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:28,283
That's another position, right?

62
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:30,304
I'm here at a location.

63
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:33,025
I take two steps to the left, now I'm somewhere else.

64
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:36,786
Two displacements? Sure, I can add that.

65
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:39,086
Walk five feet north, walk five feet east.

66
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,487
You've now walked northeast.

67
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,048
So we can add displacements, tip to tail.

68
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:47,509
Can we add two positions?

69
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,851
So, we can certainly add the numbers, right?

70
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,972
They would add up to five comma seven comma zero.

71
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:57,194
But, like, what does that even mean?

72
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,215
And if we try to justify it by drawing it

73
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:01,736
aligned to the origin, well, really now we're just saying,

74
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:04,277
well, if they were displacements, we could have added them,

75
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,858
but that's not the same thing, is it?

76
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:08,779
So that's part of the question is, like,

77
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:11,681
can you add positions or what does that even mean?

78
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:14,262
Clearly, however, positions and directions are not the same.

79
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,920
So let's take another example.

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,520
Let's say we have a box

81
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,101
that's kind of centered around the origin.

82
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:20,241
It's got these four points.

83
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:23,262
And let's say it has vertex normals

84
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,542
and maybe a forward vector, right?

85
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,423
If the box is rotated,

86
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:31,164
every single one of the things changed.

87
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:32,265
All the vectors changed.

88
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,125
All the positions changed, right?

89
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,046
But if we translate the box,

90
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:41,307
we'll note that the positions are all changing,

91
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,148
but the vectors, the directions, are not changing.

92
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:48,810
So translation apparently is changing positions, but not directions.

93
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,615
So positions and directions both rotate, but positions translate, somehow directions don't.

94
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:55,695
Mathematicians have provided us a fix.

95
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:59,618
This is the W, and this is where it comes from.

96
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:04,402
It's called the homogeneous coordinate, or it's a homogeneous coordinate.

97
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:10,526
And for now, we're going to say that someone told us, the mathematicians told us, you should

98
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:14,489
use W equals zero for directions, and W equals one for positions.

99
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:19,127
All right, so that's our first real working theory, right?

100
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:22,048
So let's take a look at what that means.

101
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:25,249
I'm going to break out a matrix here,

102
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:27,369
and I'm using column-major notation.

103
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,190
So by column-major notation, what I mean

104
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,172
is these three columns of the matrix

105
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:38,133
are the x, y, and z, or rather i, j, k, basis vectors that

106
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,193
form the coordinate system.

107
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:42,655
And then we have a potential translation as well.

108
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,095
And then we have, to make it a square matrix,

109
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,375
which we would call an augmenting matrix,

110
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,856
we have these 0, 0, 0, 1 terms at the bottom.

111
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:52,456
We don't know why there are those terms,

112
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:54,396
except that's kind of just following

113
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,097
the pattern of diagonals on the ones.

114
00:05:57,097 --> 00:06:01,478
But what's interesting is if I think about the matrix

115
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,678
in this way, as a basis of a space,

116
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:09,139
then I can extend those by stepping one in the i direction

117
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,199
and one in the j direction and draw a little point

118
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,500
and another one in the i and one in the j and draw a point.

119
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:16,275
And I can create a graph paper out of this, right?

120
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,097
And if I change those vectors by changing in the columns

121
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:22,638
where they point, I'm changing the graph paper.

122
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:27,380
Likewise, I can change the translation

123
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,121
here to change the graph paper and move it over.

124
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:33,743
So if I'm drawing something in local space,

125
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,025
like, say, in this square up there,

126
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:38,786
just by changing the graph paper, I rotate my object, right?

127
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:41,627
This is the whole basis of modern transformations.

128
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:48,088
And if I translate, I move the graph paper and I draw the object on the graph paper that's

129
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:53,169
now moved, rather than moving the object itself in the vertex buffer or something like that.

130
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,990
So let's look at a couple examples. Let's say I have a rotation matrix like this one,

131
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,531
and I have a position x, y, z, 1, because the mathematicians told us to put a 1 there

132
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,912
for positions. So we do the matrix math.

133
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:14,225
The result is that the position is changed.

134
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,387
It is rotated. Okay, that's great.

135
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,690
Let's do a rotation of a direction.

136
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,312
And sure enough, the direction was also rotated,

137
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:25,174
which is exactly what we saw on our box, right?

138
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:27,156
And the zero's still in the bottom,

139
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,817
so it's still a direction after it's rotated.

140
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:32,160
Now let's do translations on the matrix.

141
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,342
And when we look at the results for the position,

142
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:36,823
it is translated, right?

143
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,646
But when we look at the results for the translation...

144
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:47,554
of a direction, it's .7 times zero, meaning the zero specifically says I ignore a translation.

145
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:54,020
So directions ignore translation by virtue of this zero, right? That's why they told

146
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,104
us to put that there, to achieve mathematically what we kind of knew intuitively. So that

147
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:03,228
makes sense now to say W is zero for directions, W is one for positions. So the matrix math

148
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:07,032
with those rules just kind of does the right thing.

149
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,689
It translates our positions but not our directions.

150
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,830
If I've got a normal and I move way over here,

151
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,731
I don't want my normal to be something wacky.

152
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:15,992
It should still kind of point that way and be normalized.

153
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:19,674
So let's come back to the matrix itself and look at it.

154
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:24,836
If we have these i, j, and k basis vectors and the translation,

155
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:28,878
if we instead viewed those as four vectors, right?

156
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,059
Let's extend these columns all the way down

157
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:34,640
and include them in our new way of thinking.

158
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,481
What does that tell us?

159
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:41,261
Well, it's interesting that has zeros for the i, j, k basis vectors.

160
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:44,523
So those are now pure directions, which feels right to me.

161
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,885
This, however, feels weird.

162
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:53,249
The translation it's sort of implying is a position

163
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:54,190
with a one and a w.

164
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,252
That doesn't seem right to me.

165
00:08:57,252 --> 00:09:00,875
I think of a translation in a different way.

166
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,756
So if I'm translating something like this...

167
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,867
I think of that as more of a relative movement, right?

168
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,168
I could translate to the right and then translate again

169
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,309
and move more to the right.

170
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:10,730
That seems like a displacement.

171
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,533
So it's a little weird to me that there's a 1

172
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,855
in that W for the translation column.

173
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:20,877
All right, so let's play around a little bit more.

174
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,719
What about a matrix versus a matrix multiplied?

175
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,400
Does that illuminate anything?

176
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,402
So if I have some transformation

177
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:30,584
and I multiply it by a translation

178
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,425
that I'm trying to apply...

179
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,543
If we do the matrix math out,

180
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:39,866
we get a matrix who is affected,

181
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:43,027
that the translation was changed.

182
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:47,630
But we'll notice that the i, j, and k basis vectors, again,

183
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,951
were unaffected by the translation we just applied.

184
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:51,832
And in general,

185
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:55,614
the i, j, and k basis vectors are not gonna be translated,

186
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:58,355
and yet the translation...

187
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:06,712
basis is changed. So now let's update our theory to say, well, it's not exactly that

188
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:11,935
zero means directions and w1 means points. It's more like whether or not you should be

189
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:16,718
translated. That's what it means. And then actually, in that sense, it feels good that

190
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:21,441
a translation part of a matrix would itself be translated, because you could double, double,

191
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:26,524
triple translate and have them accumulate, right? So in that sense, it feels correct

192
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:27,344
to have a w of four.

193
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:31,689
So let's do the quiz again, but now in four dimensions, right?

194
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,550
In homogeneous coordinates.

195
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,391
I've got a position minus a position.

196
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,352
Those are points in space.

197
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:37,952
They have ones.

198
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:41,374
I subtract them, and now the one minus the one

199
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,035
gives me a zero for the w coordinate.

200
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,776
It is a displacement, right?

201
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,317
Mathematically now, not just intuitively.

202
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:50,238
Position plus a displacement.

203
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:53,220
I add the w, and I get another point.

204
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:59,304
displacement plus displacement, they both have zero for the W's,

205
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:01,705
so I add them up, and they still have zeros for the W's,

206
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:02,925
so that makes sense.

207
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:06,787
So now when I do my position versus position,

208
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:09,668
I get a 2 for my W coordinate.

209
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:14,610
Yeah, that's strange.

210
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,572
So, what does that even mean, right?

211
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:20,193
Now I have to, like, say W equals something else

212
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,614
for things that don't exist?

213
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:27,145
So let's look at real space, or what I think of as real space.

214
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,308
I'm sure the mathematicians here will have better terminology for this.

215
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:33,570
I'm just trying to give you my intuitions.

216
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,175
So we're saying it doesn't make sense to add two points together, right?

217
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,376
Well, but that's actually not true.

218
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:42,758
What if we wanted to say average two points?

219
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:43,738
How do you do an average?

220
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:45,860
Everyone knows you add two things and you divide by two, right?

221
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,322
Well, now that makes sense.

222
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,689
If I add these two points, I'm gonna get some crazy thing,

223
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:54,370
but I have to divide by two to finish the average,

224
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,811
and that brings it back into sort of real space.

225
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,352
Right?

226
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,512
And that's perfectly legit.

227
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,553
So it is OK to add positions together

228
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:09,174
as long as I divide by this W afterwards to clean up.

229
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:11,955
Right? If W ends up being 14, I need to divide by 14

230
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:14,295
to bring it back into the real world, so to speak.

231
00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:18,517
Likewise, if I have an average of n positions...

232
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:23,687
22 positions, I add them all up, I divide by 22,

233
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:28,649
and I get something still in real space.

234
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,190
So now I kind of feel like W means

235
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,331
how grounded a thing is in real space, right?

236
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,832
And it kind of feels, if I use that terminology,

237
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:38,512
while directions aren't grounded,

238
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:41,253
they fly around freely with no change,

239
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,814
positions are grounded, they're anchored,

240
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:45,894
and they can't move without changing values, right?

241
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:48,655
When we saw, we moved a position and changed its values.

242
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:55,809
OK. So let's shift gears real quick and talk about some applications of what this means.

243
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:03,411
Another pop quiz. What makes something look 3D? There are a bunch of Q's. One of them

244
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:09,812
is relative size. Right? Eric is much bigger, apparently, than someone back there to me.

245
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:16,914
Perspective. As things go away, they sort of converge all together in the distance.

246
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:20,095
Motion parallax. The people walking back and forth over there.

247
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,133
don't seem to be moving nearly as fast as the people in front of me.

248
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,875
Things that are close cover up things that are far, et cetera.

249
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,477
Texturing, lighting, shading, distance, fog.

250
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:32,660
Like in the mountains, they seem really foggy and far away.

251
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,383
I have my eyes triangulate on someone, blah, blah, blah.

252
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,645
W is gonna help us achieve these three.

253
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:38,825
OK.

254
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:44,569
So let's look a little more at the illusion of perspective.

255
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:49,813
And I have a simple cheesy gif here, but I think it's helpful to

256
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,818
take the things you take for granted and go back and look at them

257
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:54,439
with fresh eyes.

258
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,822
And you look at what's actually happening

259
00:13:56,822 --> 00:13:59,044
apparently to these things, is that they're all

260
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:02,487
getting smaller, that's obvious.

261
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:03,308
But they're also

262
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:06,030
converging on the center of the screen.

263
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,172
Right? As I pull away from them.

264
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:17,410
This is something that several people alluded to, and Eric did in his talk.

265
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,470
So let's say I have two views here.

266
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,812
One of them on the left is a top-down view.

267
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:26,173
And so that's the camera, that little cone.

268
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:29,154
And then the pink line at, that's the z-axis going up.

269
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:31,395
So the pink line is the near plane.

270
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:34,796
Or it's right in front of the camera.

271
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:40,498
And then on the right is going to be the, what I would see on my screen.

272
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:43,419
So let's say on my screen I see a big.

273
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,949
And it's actually a little bit far away.

274
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:49,010
It's kind of three units away from me

275
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,430
on Z on the left one.

276
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,512
And so kind of what we want to do is say,

277
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:58,173
well, how should that appear to be, right?

278
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:00,374
If I'm in 2-D mode, it should appear the same.

279
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:02,115
But if I'm in 3-D mode, it should appear smaller

280
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:03,936
if it's farther away.

281
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,017
So we should draw lines

282
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:08,197
from the points to the origin

283
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:10,618
and then move the object.

284
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:16,486
closer to the origin. And this is part of why we have a coordinate system by default

285
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:22,289
where 0, 0, 0 is in the center of the screen, is we can easily move things towards it just

286
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:27,912
by dividing them by something. And how much do we divide it by? If you look at the left

287
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:32,955
diagram, if we're three away, then we need to divide by three. In other words, we're

288
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:37,037
sort of projecting this thing onto the z equals 1, onto the near plane.

289
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:42,206
OK, so if I have a group of objects, I do the same for all of them.

290
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:46,268
A is already on the near plane, nothing to do.

291
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:48,770
B has to come in close.

292
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,471
C also is far away.

293
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:55,514
And so you can see on the right, which is our screen, C is going to appear to be much

294
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:56,795
smaller and in the distance, right?

295
00:15:56,795 --> 00:16:00,997
And D is going to already be right where it needs to be.

296
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:06,481
So this is kind of what it would be in 2D mode, and this is what it would be in 3D mode.

297
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,342
So the takeaway here is in order to make objects look smaller

298
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:16,985
as they go far away and get closer to the screen,

299
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,527
we want 0,0 to be in the center of the screen.

300
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:23,931
And basically we want to divide by the distance.

301
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:24,351
Right?

302
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,914
And we all kind of know this intuitively.

303
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:30,336
So the question is how does a matrix do that?

304
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,398
Right? I didn't think matrices could divide.

305
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:37,938
So let's look at this perspective projection transform.

306
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,319
And it's probably, unless you're a graphics programmer

307
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,299
and possibly even then,

308
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,620
it's usually something you just look up on the Internet

309
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,501
and you type in.

310
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,261
You used to just call glPerspective

311
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:51,223
or d3d get matrix left hand or whatever that is.

312
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:53,043
And now those are gone.

313
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:55,704
So now we have to just steal the code off the Internet, right?

314
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:58,866
Type it in and it's field of view, blah, blah, blah.

315
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,246
What does it actually do?

316
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,124
Cutting away all the chaff, let's say we assume a square screen,

317
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:07,605
so there's no aspect ratio to consider.

318
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:11,708
Let's say we consider a perfect 90-degree field of view,

319
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,850
so it's going to be like the tangent of 45 in the math,

320
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,631
so that goes to 1, all this stuff.

321
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:22,295
The most important term of the perspective that gets this out of us

322
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:25,978
is this term down below in the bottom.

323
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,040
It's a 1 typically in DirectX and a negative 1 in OpenGL.

324
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:35,227
So let's look at what that term does exactly.

325
00:17:35,227 --> 00:17:38,991
Just using that, what I'm calling a pure perspective matrix.

326
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,593
And you can do this, you can render this,

327
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,536
and it will have a 3D effect.

328
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:49,261
Let's transform a position.

329
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,423
Ooh, it's got a zero in it.

330
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,125
So when we transform it,

331
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,406
we get 0010 times XYZ zero.

332
00:17:56,066 --> 00:18:03,710
And so what happens is that this perspective matrix does nothing except take our Z coordinate

333
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:09,234
and put it in our W. That's all it does. And we call that clip space.

334
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:18,599
So the beauty of this is it's not actually a matrix that does the 3D illusion at all.

335
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,802
In fact, we would have to do it in software, and we did for a long time. It's the dividing

336
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:32,130
by W that does it. So we said before, if we, say, added up three points and they all have

337
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,691
– so we're going to take a three-way average, we have to divide by W to bring them back

338
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:39,693
into real space, right? And it was the same thing we saw when we were trying to bring

339
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:44,615
the objects, project them onto the Z equals one plane. Now, by having the W divide, we

340
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:45,435
basically take our XYZZ.

341
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:54,138
and divide it by whatever's in our W coordinate

342
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:56,278
at the time, which is our Z.

343
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:59,239
And since this is clip space,

344
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,199
which is based on I space,

345
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,299
that Z is gonna be depth out from us.

346
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,240
Or negative Z would be depth out in OpenGL.

347
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,221
And after this W divide,

348
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,901
which happens automatically all the time in hardware,

349
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,441
whether you want it or not,

350
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:17,542
now we're in what are called normalized device coordinates.

351
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:19,443
It's the same as clip space, 0, 0 in the center.

352
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:20,783
It's just now we've done this divide.

353
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:25,727
So now we get that effect that we wanted, right?

354
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:27,708
X divided by Z, Y divided by Z.

355
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,549
Where the farther you are out on Z,

356
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,030
the more you're going to divide your X and Y.

357
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,711
You make them smaller and smaller, close to zero.

358
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:39,492
That's going to bring them all closer to each other

359
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,973
and closer to the center of the screen,

360
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,834
which is exactly the perspective illusion.

361
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,982
So it's interesting, if we're in 2D, this is happening anyway.

362
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,745
Right, there really is no 2D, right, there's just 3D.

363
00:19:56,745 --> 00:20:02,969
And so we divide by W, but that's a benign divide, it divides by 1.

364
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:08,392
So what happens then, if we're just looking for little tidbits of intuition here,

365
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:10,434
what if our W was, say, 0.1?

366
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:12,455
It was kind of small.

367
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:14,937
Well, we would divide by that, right?

368
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:17,338
That would mean X divided by 0.1, which is like X times 10.

369
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,607
What if it was very small?

370
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,048
Very, very, very small.

371
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:25,550
Very, very small.

372
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:32,014
What happens is, you have this sort of sense that

373
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:34,475
as w goes down from 1 and sort of approaches 0,

374
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:38,298
that the point is getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,

375
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:40,819
but it's keeping its same proportions.

376
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,241
And as we divide by approaching 0,

377
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,522
we scale it by approaching infinity.

378
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:53,690
And so it's kind of an interesting thing that it basically means that directions are kind

379
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,955
of like points that are infinitely far away in a sense, mathematically. I don't know if

380
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:04,301
there's a more elegant way to say it. I just find it interesting.

381
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:08,846
OK. Let me just wrap up. I didn't have a whole lot I wanted to cover.

382
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,616
I guess there are a lot of different ways of thinking about homogeneous coordinates.

383
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:19,378
For me, I like to think of it as a measure of something's groundedness in real space.

384
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:24,161
But really that means it's a measure of its translatability.

385
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:28,683
Which generally means we're going to have zero for directions and one for positions,

386
00:21:28,683 --> 00:21:31,684
but of course we saw there are exceptions.

387
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:37,147
And it's the translatable part that's more important than the directionness or the positionness.

388
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:42,998
And generally, anything with a w value other than one or zero

389
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:48,361
is kind of in an improper state that almost always we want to resolve

390
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:52,784
back into real space by dividing by w.

391
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:59,848
And lastly, that directions are kind of like points at an infinite distance.

392
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:07,232
And Gino quoted Ken Schumach's amazing post,

393
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:08,453
and it's like plain text.

394
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:11,355
early internet about Pluker coordinates,

395
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:13,897
which if you're interested in this homogeneous stuff,

396
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,618
that's the next step.

397
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:18,100
I highly recommend it, and go read it.

398
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,503
It's really taking homogeneous coordinates

399
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:23,965
to their fruition, is how it feels to me.

400
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:26,727
So, and that's great if you can go read that

401
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:29,889
five times through and play with it for three weeks on paper

402
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:32,391
and see what all kinds of things will pop out at you.

403
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:33,051
And that's all I have.

404
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,072
Thank you.
