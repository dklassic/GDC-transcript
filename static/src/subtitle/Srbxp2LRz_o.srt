1
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:07,847
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:07,847 --> 00:00:10,067
My name is Stephen Hottie.

3
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:11,808
I'm responsible for audio at PolyArc.

4
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:15,349
This is just a reminder to silence your cell phones

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,409
and to fill out your evaluations afterwards.

6
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:20,430
That's super important to GDC as a whole.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,290
And so rehearsals have been going straight up

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,191
to the 30-minute mark, so it's likely

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,231
that I'm not going to have time to answer questions afterwards.

10
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:29,692
But we can hang out in the hall or go get a wrap-up room.

11
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,993
One of the CAs is going to help us with that in a little bit.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,871
So, um, finally, uh, things seem to be sounding pretty good in here, but if your listening

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:43,872
experience is substandard in any way, you can go play MOST at the IGF pavilion. So, uh, Jason

14
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:51,294
Graves, uh, did a great talk yesterday. Um, it was awesome. His music is incredible if

15
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:54,814
you've played MOST. So, uh, you should go check it out on the vault. It's sort of a

16
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,035
companion talk to this one.

17
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:02,587
So, and finally, if you're not familiar with the technical jargon in this talk,

18
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:07,929
just don't worry about it. This is fundamentally a talk about ideas. It's a talk about finding

19
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:13,331
the heart of what you're working on and thinking about design before sound. This is about the

20
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:17,772
perspective that emerges when you've been on one creative path for a really long time.

21
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:46,971
And then suddenly you're here with a mouse in a new world,

22
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:48,912
starting over from the beginning.

23
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:51,815
This is about what makes you a sound designer.

24
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:54,597
So what makes you a sound designer?

25
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:59,361
Is it knowledge of plugins that makes you a sound designer?

26
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:01,282
No, recording engineers know about plugins.

27
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:05,225
Is it knowledge and use of synthesis?

28
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,886
No, musicians also have this down.

29
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:09,973
How about Foley performance?

30
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:14,016
How about system design or implementation or scripting?

31
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:16,458
The game part is coming into focus,

32
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,360
but it's somehow not enough.

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,362
Is it your ability to craft supremely realistic weapon

34
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:21,562
LODs?

35
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:23,324
Are we any closer?

36
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:27,267
The answer to what makes you a sound designer

37
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:31,210
is in the portion of the name that gets the least attention.

38
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,971
Sound designer.

39
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,659
All that other stuff, plugins, editing, scripting,

40
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,880
it's all craft that you implement

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,141
in the service of design.

42
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:42,284
So unpacking the term designer is a bit of a trick,

43
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:43,805
so let's zoom out for a second.

44
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,866
If we're doing our jobs well,

45
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,948
player experience is continuous and holistic.

46
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:51,390
The sum total of the many choices

47
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,432
and details of development wash over the player,

48
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,594
bathing them in a kind of metaphorical light.

49
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,611
Our job as designers is to deeply understand

50
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,912
the light of player experience

51
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:03,633
through the prism of design intention.

52
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:07,375
This prism refracts the player's complex,

53
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,857
holistic experience into discrete components

54
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,078
in service of the game's design.

55
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:15,660
So the application of sound into a game

56
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,981
is the expression of this design intention.

57
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,224
So you might say that compelling sound design

58
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,605
starts with design and ends with sound.

59
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:29,740
Sound design starts with design and ends with sound.

60
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,501
So before you cut the first sound,

61
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,081
you're thinking about design.

62
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,982
And when you're thinking about design,

63
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,403
you're thinking about player experience.

64
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,964
You're wondering about what impact

65
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:43,946
you're making on the player at a fundamental human level, which

66
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,787
becomes their reason for playing the game.

67
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,961
But early on, these reasons may not be entirely clear.

68
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,542
And each player has their own reason for playing.

69
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,764
So you must listen carefully for that central design intention

70
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,284
to emerge during development.

71
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:00,206
So you're still not thinking about sound yet.

72
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,527
You're thinking about human impact.

73
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,247
And while the game is coming together,

74
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,608
there's a circular process where you're

75
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,529
embodying player experience.

76
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:11,210
What is the game telling you, not just

77
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,491
on a moment-to-moment basis, but after you

78
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,832
put the controller down?

79
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:16,913
What does this even look like?

80
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:21,853
As an example, I'll tell you the story of my first player experience with Moss.

81
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:25,774
The first time I met Quill was in November of 2016.

82
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:34,896
During my first visit to PolyArk, I played a very early Moss prototype that a few founding members had built over 12 weeks.

83
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:39,257
So, I put the headset on and I saw a cute mouse, which was pretty cool so far,

84
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:43,418
and then she looked at me, which was surprisingly compelling,

85
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:47,358
and then I pushed the joystick to move Quill around and started to sense how this could be a game.

86
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:54,281
I reached out, grabbed her, and felt her heartbeat through the controller's vibration.

87
00:04:54,281 --> 00:05:00,024
And that's when everything changed.

88
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:02,945
I caught the first glimpse of what made Moss special.

89
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:07,507
I felt something like genuine concern for this little VR mouse.

90
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,688
Like I wanted to protect her.

91
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:12,730
This experience felt wholly unique in all my decades of game playing.

92
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,245
Over the next few days, I wondered,

93
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:18,546
what would happen if my relationship with Quill

94
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,127
was central to the game's design?

95
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:22,809
What would it be like for a game to condition players

96
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:26,331
to feel empathy and a sense of protection for a character?

97
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:29,212
If we had more games that focus on powerful beings

98
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,934
protecting weaker beings, what would this world be like?

99
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:34,495
And is there anything this world needs more

100
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:37,016
than the cultivation of this sense of connection?

101
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:41,937
A simple mechanic, grabbing Quill with the controller

102
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:46,078
and feeling haptic vibration, generated

103
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:48,399
a ton of complex questions.

104
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,300
Tam Armstrong, PolyArc's studio director,

105
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,861
often says, a game is a function of its inputs.

106
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:56,222
And here, Moss was asking me to reach out

107
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,423
and to bond with another being.

108
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,704
Reduced down to its essence, the human impact

109
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:05,245
was enabled by one thing, an emotional bond with Quill.

110
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:09,551
So you see a design intention began to emerge,

111
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,572
but it didn't solidify magically overnight.

112
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,534
These questions continued to persist throughout development.

113
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:16,636
And three months after I joined PolyArc,

114
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:18,818
we started showing a new demo to players,

115
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:21,900
and the results we observed confirm our intuitions.

116
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,962
Sort of hard to gather what's going on here,

117
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,864
but off screen, the player's friends are coaxing her

118
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:28,005
to continue on with the demo.

119
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:31,407
But she's content just sitting at the dock, petting Quill.

120
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:34,089
She's so happy that she wipes tears from her eyes.

121
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:47,328
Okay, okay, I'm sorry!

122
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:48,329
So we understood

123
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:49,850
that the emotional bond with Quill,

124
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,693
the trigger for empathy, protection, and connection,

125
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:54,875
was what made Moss special to players.

126
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:57,667
So let's check in.

127
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,728
We understand the game's central design intention,

128
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:03,649
initiated by our own intuition, and more importantly,

129
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,470
solidified by observing player reactions.

130
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,871
We can use this intention, the focus

131
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:12,252
on Quill's emotional bond, as the prism I referred to earlier.

132
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:14,192
If compelling sound design starts with design

133
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,813
and ends with sound, this brings us

134
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,154
to the expression of the game's design using sound.

135
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:19,974
So how do we support this design intention,

136
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:20,675
the emotional bond with sound?

137
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:30,986
First, we must clear the way with comfort.

138
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:35,129
We all understand intuitively that certain emotions blot out

139
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,590
others, like how it's hard to feel compassion when

140
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,391
you're tired and hungry.

141
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,974
VR is wrestling with its own version of hangry,

142
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:45,655
which is VR-related discomfort and fatigue.

143
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:48,417
Poor frame rate, resolution, weight of the headset,

144
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,719
and the disconnection between player body movement and camera

145
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:53,901
movement are some of the more prominent examples that

146
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:55,221
induce discomfort in players.

147
00:07:56,213 --> 00:08:01,999
If players are comfortable, we create a space where other, subtler emotions can arise.

148
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:05,782
If players are agitated, the beauty of the world of Moss recedes.

149
00:08:05,782 --> 00:08:12,408
Players stop caring about Quill, and at its worst, they quit the game because they feel

150
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,710
they are physically unable to continue.

151
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,998
Danny Bulla, Polyarch's design director, often says,

152
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,119
VR is an amplifier.

153
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,642
And what he means by that is that we have to take care

154
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:26,265
that whatever we put into the amplifier is a clean signal.

155
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:28,888
Subtle discomforts that may not manifest meaningfully

156
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:31,971
in console games in VR may cause players

157
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,212
to take the headset off.

158
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,595
Sound can absolutely play a role in contributing

159
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:39,618
to VR fatigue, both through physical discomfort.

160
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,547
like listening fatigue caused by loud sounds,

161
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:45,589
and psychological discomfort caused

162
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:46,629
by intense or grating sound.

163
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:50,891
A great advantage of the current generation of VR headsets

164
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,153
is that players use headphones, which

165
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:56,694
allows us to take advantage of actual high dynamic range.

166
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:59,275
In Moss, the range between the quietest moment

167
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,597
and the loudest moment is somewhere

168
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:05,318
in the vicinity of 45 loudness units relative full scale,

169
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:08,000
which means the game can be quiet most of the time

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,320
and loud only when it needs to be.

171
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:17,859
The sounds themselves contain very gentle high frequency

172
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,942
content and are offered with careful use of limiting,

173
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,543
distortion, multiband compression,

174
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:24,325
and subharmonic generation.

175
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,407
So even if players are wearing a pair of headphones

176
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:28,729
that hype or exaggerate high end frequencies,

177
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,470
they're still going to have a comfortable listening

178
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,351
experience.

179
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:36,035
So we covered discomfort related to the physical sensation

180
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,256
of hearing.

181
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:40,139
However, even sounds that conform to a gentle aesthetic

182
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,640
can produce a grating effect.

183
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,577
During one playtest, players reported fatigue because of howling cave winds during one section

184
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:48,519
of gameplay.

185
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,607
They mentioned that the low, persistent rumbling frequencies created a sense of claustrophobia

186
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:54,968
and unease.

187
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:59,434
To combat this effect, we used Low Frequency Oscillators, or LFOs.

188
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:07,503
As most of you know, an LFO is a repeating figure that can be used to control or modulate the volume, filtering, or other properties of a sound.

189
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:19,146
And that by tying the value of sound properties to these moving signals, we can maintain the initial moodiness of the scene, but that feeling diminishes over time as the LFO value changes.

190
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:26,828
Multiple LFOs set to different rates and amplitudes can sum together to create more variable textures of modulation.

191
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:33,033
Overlapping LFOs can be used on any ambient bed with discrete layers to increase movement

192
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:38,574
and to create an undulating mosaic of unpredictable textures, reducing perceived repetition and

193
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:41,435
providing relief from psychologically intense sound.

194
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:46,376
So we're on our way to supporting the design of the player's emotional bond with Quill.

195
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:51,838
Now that the player is listening comfortably, we are free to focus our efforts on the world

196
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:52,718
that Quill inhabits.

197
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:00,587
Let's engage design before sound for another moment.

198
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:03,288
Immersion reinforces the player fantasy

199
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,769
of the virtual reality.

200
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:07,770
When the virtual reality is sufficiently convincing,

201
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,650
actual reality falls away,

202
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,731
and players have a chance to be along with Quill

203
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:12,451
in her world.

204
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:18,313
In Moss, players manipulate objects to help Quill progress.

205
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:20,414
If these interactions are sufficiently detailed

206
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,635
and responsive, and the weight feels right

207
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:23,855
in the player's hand,

208
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:25,776
then it will increase their sense of immersion.

209
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:31,811
The blue orb here represents the player's hand as tracked by a controller as it reaches

210
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:33,814
into the world and manipulates objects.

211
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:09,517
Small, delicate sounds that might not read in conventional games end up carrying a lot of the responsibility for selling this fantasy, like the crackling glue of the binding in this book.

212
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:24,203
Or the drifting ratchet of the spindle as it glides to rest.

213
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:42,145
The effect of the player fantasy extends beyond the interaction

214
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:45,326
and into the realm of environmental ambience.

215
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:48,167
In reality, much of what we attribute to ambience

216
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,529
is perceived as noise that the brain filters out.

217
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:53,770
So it's often not enough to take a single nature recording

218
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,591
and use that as the basis for an environment.

219
00:12:57,233 --> 00:13:02,677
To cross over the barrier between the passive, neutral experience of sound and into a realm

220
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:07,381
where the player actively registers the emotion of the world, we must saturate the listening

221
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:10,863
environment with story and narrative context.

222
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:14,086
Here's an example, starting with a few sounds over our logos.

223
00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:19,341
You arrive in a library, delivered from another realm.

224
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,423
A clock ticks slowly in the distance,

225
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:23,585
and you sense that time works differently here.

226
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,087
You hear the gentle scratch of pen on paper

227
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,390
emanating from the books piled on the tables

228
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,193
and lining the shelves as those stories are emanating,

229
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:35,136
or as those stories are forming on their blank pages.

230
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:53,042
Opening the book, it calls to you and you feel a force tunneling through the eons, having

231
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,724
waited and found you at long last.

232
00:13:55,724 --> 00:14:06,434
Here's another example.

233
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:11,066
The bright forest pulsates with the life of childhood adventure.

234
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,547
A time without worry, possessed only by discovery

235
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:15,328
in a search for freedom.

236
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:17,329
Birdsong pours in from every register.

237
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,170
Squirrels chase each other, their claws

238
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,251
scratching the bark, squeaking taunts.

239
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,872
Tree branches creak and groan in the wind.

240
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,993
A beetle's wing clips your ear as it hums by.

241
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,980
And finally, one of my favorite scenes.

242
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,126
It's nighttime now, and the wind whips through the pines.

243
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:05,710
Unseen creatures rustle and howl in the distance.

244
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,712
You're not supposed to be outside the hut at night,

245
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,855
but the fear of what might happen if you stay

246
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,278
drives you farther and farther away from safety.

247
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:50,318
So you can see how sound covers mundane things like time of day, weather, biophony, and geophony.

248
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:54,580
It tells you where you came from, where you are, and where you're going.

249
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:03,125
But it also triggers less precise phenomena like memory, nostalgia, joy, peace, mystery, and fear.

250
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:08,028
Quill and the player characters journey together. The experience that forges their bond

251
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:11,270
is reflected in the emotion embedded in the world of sound.

252
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,895
But the process of getting from room to room is just as important as what the player finds once they're inside.

253
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:21,359
In theater, there's a problem with changing scenes.

254
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:25,683
The curtain drops or the audience sees the vague outlines of the set moving around.

255
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:28,386
They're reminded of where they are.

256
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:31,650
In a theater, not the world played out on a stage.

257
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,490
The spell is broken.

258
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,914
The video game version of dropping the curtain is loading transitions.

259
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:40,228
It's easy to miss what's coming up in this next example,

260
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:42,631
but blanket ambience, or the environmental sound

261
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:45,754
that does not correspond directly to level geometry,

262
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,697
isn't tied to camera position within a volume.

263
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:51,721
Rather, each room is assigned ambience metadata,

264
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,983
which is prefetched and positioned around the camera

265
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:55,285
before the room even loads.

266
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:16,797
Seamless continuity of sound over hard load transitions creates a feeling in the player of having teleported and arrived,

267
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:24,905
accompanied by an imprecise feeling of the passage of a small amount of time where Quill travels from one threshold to the next.

268
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:30,790
So these environmental sounds we just covered, the player interactions we referenced earlier,

269
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,094
and all other in-world sound needs to interact with the geometry of the world in some way.

270
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,506
Reverb is like lighting for sound.

271
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:40,387
Through subtle shifts in technique,

272
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:44,490
it can take a simple scene and imbue it with complex emotion.

273
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,712
And like lighting, reverb design is its own rich craft

274
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:49,172
worthy of attention.

275
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:51,574
Some reverbs provide a sense of endlessness.

276
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:52,995
Others provoke claustrophobia.

277
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:56,196
And so reverb is not purely a functional description

278
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:57,317
of acoustical space.

279
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:02,584
MOS uses a little over 20 different reverbs across the span of about 75 rooms,

280
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:08,846
and each reverb has three layers. A convolution layer, a traditional algorithmic layer,

281
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:14,347
and an early reflection layer. These were designed in a digital audio workstation,

282
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:19,129
mixed together, swept with a sine wave, resampled and deconvolved back into the engine,

283
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:23,270
back into a single impulse response for use in real time in the engine.

284
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:30,397
So the room we are in may be too reverberant to adequately hear the subtleties in this clip.

285
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:35,178
However, try to listen to how Quill's sword and voice bounce around each space.

286
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:38,178
See if you can track not only your perception of the space,

287
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:41,179
but the emotional load that accompanies this change.

288
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:45,400
And just so you can calibrate your ear, the first clip is dry, so it doesn't have any reverb,

289
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,441
and the subsequent clips feature reverbs from different environments.

290
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:21,023
With the player comfortable and immersed, they are free to establish an emotional connection

291
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:22,103
with Quill.

292
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:25,164
Let's explore another idea that starts with design and ends with sound.

293
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,900
One of the ways that we connect with each other

294
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,723
is by sharing our perspective or empathizing with each other.

295
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:35,665
Moss is a self-co-op game where players simultaneously

296
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:39,388
control a third-person character, Quill,

297
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,890
and operate as a distinct character in the world.

298
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,852
If we only chose sounds that operated

299
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:45,873
at a scale that reflected the player character's point

300
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:48,175
of view and focused on reinforcing

301
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:51,638
the reality of scale, what might this flaming door sound like?

302
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:54,900
So use your imagination and focus on the reality of scale.

303
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:08,161
So from Quill's point of view, it sounds like this door might feel a bit larger and more intimidating.

304
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:19,151
Choosing sounds with more mass and weight doesn't simply add a layer of listener satisfaction.

305
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:25,036
It superimposes the player's perspective onto Quill's, so players can hear the world through her ears.

306
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:28,820
You might call this empathetic sound design, her mixed perspective.

307
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,206
The larger sounds also provoke a sense of danger,

308
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:34,571
elevating the player's protector instinct.

309
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:14,168
Can you guys see the screen okay?

310
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:15,329
Okay, cool.

311
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:22,191
These larger sounds also provoke a sense of danger, elevating the player's protector instinct.

312
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:28,873
So the player is comfortable and immersed, and has a sense of Quill's experience.

313
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:34,055
How Quill expresses herself in-game will clearly influence the formation of the player's emotional bond with her.

314
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:36,843
Should Quill speak a language?

315
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:39,305
Should she deliver story?

316
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:41,987
What about sinless gibberish or exertions?

317
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:43,969
Should she remain completely silent?

318
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,171
How mouse-like should her vocalizations be?

319
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,513
How female or male?

320
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,234
What's the right decision here?

321
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:53,437
Understanding this problem through the prism of the

322
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,339
player bond can yield a lot of compelling solutions.

323
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,923
But what if we want the player to determine who Quill is or

324
00:22:00,923 --> 00:22:01,983
what she may be thinking?

325
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:09,042
That starts to narrow our options into the range of content requirements that call for ambiguity.

326
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:13,988
In this way, the players become equal participants in the construction of her inner life,

327
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:18,493
and can project onto her their own interpretation of what she may be thinking or feeling.

328
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,561
Having a human perform these vocalizations

329
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:25,782
also gives us more access to a wider array of expression.

330
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:28,903
And although relationships between humans and animals

331
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:32,444
can be deep and complex, relationships between humans

332
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:34,684
start with an assumption for the shared capacity

333
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:37,265
to deeply understand each other's life experience.

334
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:41,366
So we knew we were successful with this fluid approach

335
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:44,867
when we observed some players giving Quill a unique identity

336
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,607
and interpreting her actions in ways

337
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,548
we couldn't have ever anticipated or planned.

338
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:54,956
So the player is comfortable and immersed and has a sense of the stakes,

339
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,758
and they can construct an ideal version of Quill in their own minds.

340
00:22:57,758 --> 00:23:04,864
Can you see how each new approach to a problem reinforces the goal of establishing a bond between the player and Quill?

341
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:10,428
The fluid approach is only part of the picture. Quill is not a total blank slate.

342
00:23:10,428 --> 00:23:17,073
We thought players would enjoy learning Quill's backstory and growing with her over the course of the journey.

343
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:20,828
The story of Moss serves a few purposes.

344
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:23,811
It mechanically propels both player and Quill

345
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:24,952
from room to room.

346
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:27,394
And it also seeds the gaps between story moments

347
00:23:27,394 --> 00:23:29,235
with emotional resonance that players

348
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,537
can use as the basis for their own construction

349
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:32,618
of Quill's inner life.

350
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:35,581
We found that the fluid version of Quill

351
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,583
coexisted comfortably alongside story narration.

352
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,626
So there's a field of established options

353
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:44,068
to draw from with narrator direction,

354
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:44,348
like.

355
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:51,964
curmudgeonly but loving grandpa, or ethereal otherworldly being, or plain-spoken albeit

356
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:55,366
earnest protagonist, but what about your mom?

357
00:23:55,366 --> 00:24:03,010
If the narrator establishes the world in a warm, safe, inviting way, players would be

358
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,712
inclined to connect with Quill.

359
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,538
We worked with voice actor Morla Gorondona, our narrator,

360
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,701
over the course of several theater-style workshopping

361
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:20,003
sessions to find a sweet spot somewhere

362
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:22,826
in between a maternal bedtime story

363
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:24,808
voice and an omniscient being.

364
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:26,690
We hoped the maternal style might activate

365
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,913
some familiar feelings like safety, rapt attention,

366
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:30,473
and wonder.

367
00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:32,856
Luckily, Morla had about six years

368
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:36,339
of practice in this role, reading to her son each night.

369
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:43,109
So, starting with design, looking through the prism of the player bond,

370
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:47,712
approaching each new small problem with this prism,

371
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:49,312
how would you approach microphone selection?

372
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:54,215
To support the audible perspective that occurs during bedtime stories,

373
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:57,457
we chose a large diaphragm microphone, which is probably no surprise.

374
00:24:57,457 --> 00:25:01,659
But the large diaphragm captures the richness of her voice.

375
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:04,761
As opposed to a shotgun microphone, which has a more hyped and aggressive tone,

376
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:09,984
we positioned her close enough to the mic to achieve a sense of intimacy

377
00:25:09,984 --> 00:25:13,426
without the player perceiving a two-dimensional, inside-my-head kind of sound.

378
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:18,609
You'll hear a subtle amount of reverb applied to the voice in some story moments

379
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:20,170
to place her in the room with the player.

380
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:29,605
Quill's hands trembled as she showed him the glass.

381
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:31,105
What is it? she asked.

382
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:35,247
A look of panic spilled over her uncle's stoic exterior.

383
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:41,330
Where did you find this? roared Uncle Argus.

384
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,811
Quill had never seen her uncle so shaken.

385
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:49,433
Hey kid, over here.

386
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,914
I know where your uncle went.

387
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:57,959
I can show you. You're two-fold now. Very important.

388
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:00,319
Bring that glass. And your sidekick, too.

389
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,680
We're going to need them.

390
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,521
Quill called out.

391
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:08,721
Hey, Stardin, wait!

392
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:13,783
So the stack of techniques used to support our design grows even higher.

393
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:18,844
What about sandbox sound effects? Because this is a game, after all.

394
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:23,229
As sound designers, it's likely you're always listening

395
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:24,950
as an extension of your craft.

396
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,712
You hear a sound that affects you in an interesting way,

397
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,674
and you take note of it and file it away in your brain.

398
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:32,036
If you're lucky, you have access to a recorder

399
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:36,580
that you carry with you so you can document these moments.

400
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,343
In the winter of 2012, I decided to document my sister's

401
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:40,724
pregnancy with her first son, Isaac.

402
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,406
I accompanied her to an ultrasound appointment

403
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:46,749
where I heard this very sound in real time for the first time.

404
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,838
I was moved powerfully by that sound.

405
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:05,561
There's something about it, the swishing rush of fluid and pumping valves.

406
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:09,924
It triggers a protector instinct, one that is crucial to the formation of a bond.

407
00:27:09,924 --> 00:27:15,188
But even though the sonogram technology is relatively new, it reaches deep down into

408
00:27:15,188 --> 00:27:17,290
some evolutionary drive and twists a knob.

409
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:22,532
When it came time for us to explore Quill's low health indication,

410
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:24,933
a fundamentally protective game mechanic,

411
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:27,313
this recording surfaced in my memory.

412
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,134
Unfortunately, as you heard, Isaac's sonogram recording

413
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:34,635
had room tone, reflections, ambient conversation, and speaker distortion built into it.

414
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:38,376
But thankfully, you can get just about anything on Amazon.

415
00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:40,596
Like this pocket fetal doppler monitor.

416
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:42,537
Which...

417
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:45,277
This one even has a headphone output jack.

418
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:49,697
So whenever Quill is in trouble and needs your help, you hear this.

419
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:21,085
This is one example of emotional sound, but it requires you to take something real and

420
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:23,886
authentic from your life and to give it to the game.

421
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:27,467
These are really hard opportunities to find, but they do exist.

422
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:29,307
So let's put it all together.

423
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,968
The player is comfortable.

424
00:28:31,968 --> 00:28:32,688
They are immersed.

425
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:36,849
They have a sense of the danger Quilla is in and have access to her point of view.

426
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:41,711
They are co-authors of a deep relationship and are primed for the bond through story.

427
00:28:41,711 --> 00:28:45,132
And the sound effects are sending emotional messages to the player.

428
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:50,637
The good news is that there are other examples of other choices that support the emotional

429
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:51,338
bond.

430
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:54,420
We didn't even talk about music or spatialization techniques or Foley.

431
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,965
When you're making choices, looking through the prism of design intention, these small,

432
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:05,590
even innocuous details sum together and create a powerful, cohesive player experience.

433
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,234
Compelling sound design starts with design and ends with sound.

434
00:29:11,423 --> 00:29:17,848
If this type of abstract, human-oriented approach to sound feels awkward or weird, I promise

435
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,749
it's worth the discomfort and confusion.

436
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:25,033
Because it's important to remember that people are giving precious moments from their lives

437
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,194
over to the experiences that we make.

438
00:29:27,194 --> 00:29:32,038
So we have to find ideas worthy of that gift, and to fill them with sound.

439
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,580
Thank you all for listening.

440
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,620
I hope you found this valuable.
