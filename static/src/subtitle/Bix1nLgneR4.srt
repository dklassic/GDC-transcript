1
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:08,374
So today I'm going to talk about my level design process.

2
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,675
This is a process that I developed while I was working

3
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,896
on Sunset Overdrive, and then I later applied

4
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,177
while I was doing the initial layout

5
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:15,518
for Manhattan on Spider-Man.

6
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:18,079
And so I'll go through each step in the process

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,240
and describe how the lessons I learned

8
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:21,741
on Sunset Overdrive helped me

9
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:22,782
while I was building Manhattan.

10
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,223
So just a little background on myself.

11
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:26,544
My name is Josue Benavidez.

12
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:28,945
I'm a senior designer at Insomnia Games,

13
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:30,926
and I've worked there for over 12 years now.

14
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,010
And one of the great things about working at Insomniac

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,891
has just been all the different games

16
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,831
that I've got to work on.

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,554
So on the Resistance games, I worked on multiplayer and co-op

18
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:44,456
and then on Sunset Overdrive, I got

19
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:47,438
to design most of the night defense bases and traps.

20
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:50,099
And then on Spider-Man, I got to do the initial layout

21
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,841
for Manhattan, as well as work on hero progression

22
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:53,801
and traversal.

23
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:57,423
And something that I actually struggled with quite a bit

24
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:59,244
early on was level design.

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,010
And this became a real challenge when I was working on Sense

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,631
and Overdrive because I was tasked

27
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,292
with building lots of different bases back to back

28
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:09,352
without a lot of time for iteration in between.

29
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:11,213
And so I tried to figure out how I

30
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:13,633
could be a more effective level designer, how

31
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:17,514
I could build bases faster, better, and more efficiently.

32
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:21,636
And really, I was looking for a step-by-step process,

33
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,456
particularly to help me overcome one of my biggest challenges,

34
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:27,037
which was this, figuring out where to even begin.

35
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:30,389
And I looked up a lot of guides and best practices

36
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,390
and tips and tricks, but nothing that I felt

37
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,531
was totally comprehensive.

38
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:36,313
Nothing that could take me from this

39
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,796
to the beginnings of a layout to bring it into 3D

40
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:40,796
and then to final.

41
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:43,418
And so because I couldn't find anything

42
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,420
that could help me guide me through the whole process,

43
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,081
I started building my own process

44
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:49,523
and I started to build my own step-by-step process.

45
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,485
So on the first base, after I built the first base,

46
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:54,566
I wrote down what worked and what didn't work

47
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:56,808
and then tried to carry that forward onto the next base.

48
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,537
And then I kept iterating and I kept updating this process

49
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:00,717
after each base.

50
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,238
And so by the end of the project,

51
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:05,739
I had a pretty solid process for how to build bases

52
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,599
in Sunset Overdrive.

53
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,280
And then I moved on to Spider-Man,

54
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,220
and on Spider-Man I was tasked with

55
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,341
doing the initial layout for Manhattan.

56
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,621
And this felt like a huge task,

57
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:16,641
and it was almost a little overwhelming

58
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,722
because building something like Manhattan

59
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:21,143
feels like it's so different from building something

60
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:22,203
like a Sunset Overdrive base.

61
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:24,872
But I learned that when I felt overwhelmed,

62
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:27,354
the best thing to do was just to try to rely on my process.

63
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:29,876
And so I actually went about laying out Manhattan

64
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,497
using the same steps that I had laid out

65
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:33,238
for building bases in Sunset Overdrive.

66
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:35,059
And so that's what I'm gonna go over today.

67
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,900
I'm gonna go over each step in the process

68
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,582
and talk about how each step applied

69
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:42,104
in both Sunset Overdrive and Spider-Man.

70
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:46,107
And so this is an overview of the whole process.

71
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,668
And it's define, research, experiment,

72
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,590
confirm, execute, and then reflect.

73
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:54,549
And it probably seems pretty simple,

74
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:55,770
and that's because it is.

75
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:59,193
In my opinion, good design is really about

76
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:01,454
just applying simple ideas in the right order.

77
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,557
I don't really expect anything that I say today

78
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:05,677
to really blow anyone's mind.

79
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,440
But at the same time, along with this sort of

80
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,183
simple step-by-step process, there are also 27 sub-steps.

81
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:16,405
So, this allows us to get into a little bit more detail.

82
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,111
So step one is define.

83
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,392
And this step is really about clearly stating

84
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:24,993
your intentions for a level or for a space.

85
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:28,434
And in my opinion, this is both the most important

86
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:30,574
and yet also the most difficult step to get right.

87
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:32,955
Because it's really hard to know

88
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:35,196
what you need to do before you do it.

89
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:37,036
But if you can clearly define

90
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:38,096
what you're trying to do up front,

91
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:39,917
it allows you to avoid a lot of rework.

92
00:03:40,257 --> 00:03:42,578
And so I have a lot of techniques that I use

93
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:45,898
that try to help me define my intentions early on.

94
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,462
And so I try to break down my intentions

95
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:50,362
into high-level goals.

96
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:53,965
And I divide these into thematic goals and gameplay goals.

97
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:56,867
So really thinking about what are the thematic elements

98
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,330
like the audiovisual experience, the emotional experience,

99
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,731
and the narrative experience.

100
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,472
And then what are the gameplay elements?

101
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:05,653
What are the mechanics that are in the level?

102
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:07,715
What's the interactivity of the level?

103
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:09,837
What are the different functions in the level?

104
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,147
And I form these goals around key questions.

105
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,610
So I ask myself, what sort of story do I want to tell?

106
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,232
What emotions do I want players to feel?

107
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:21,795
Do I want players to feel scared while they're

108
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:22,535
playing through the level?

109
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:23,976
Or do I want them to feel joyful?

110
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:27,039
What challenges do I want players to overcome?

111
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,581
And most importantly, what makes this level special?

112
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,743
What are the lasting impressions that players

113
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:32,424
are going to have?

114
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:34,205
What are they going to remember most?

115
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:38,556
And then if I'm having trouble deciding between goals,

116
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:41,137
I always try to pick out ideas or goals

117
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:43,319
that either scare or excite me the most,

118
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,580
because those are ideas that are interesting,

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,421
at least to me.

120
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:49,082
And I think self-reflection is really important

121
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,143
when you're building a level,

122
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:52,404
because the level should be fun for you.

123
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:55,486
If a level that's fun for you is at least one better

124
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,787
than a level that's fun for no one.

125
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,649
And I know that I appreciate risk.

126
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,853
And also, these are your high-level goals.

127
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:03,753
They should push you.

128
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,514
They should be trying to get you outside your comfort zone.

129
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:09,475
And it was actually kind of scary

130
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:10,796
when we started working on Manhattan

131
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:13,397
and thinking about trying to build a city that

132
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,717
was much bigger than anything we had ever built before.

133
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:18,518
But in the end, I think the payoff was worth it.

134
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:21,659
And in a lot of ways, I think we went beyond even

135
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:24,100
our own expectations because we set these goals that

136
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,740
pushed ourselves.

137
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:28,822
So now that you're trying to form your goals,

138
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,902
it's also important to make sure.

139
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,490
that you're aligning your goals,

140
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,431
particularly when it comes to thinking about

141
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:36,912
how your thematic goals and your gameplay goals interact.

142
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:38,793
Because a lot of times, you may find

143
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,434
that you have conflicts between these goals.

144
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:42,435
And any of these conflicts are things

145
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,116
that you want to try and resolve early on.

146
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:46,397
Because later on, when you get further into development,

147
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:48,858
they can be major points of friction and cause rework.

148
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:52,780
This is a lesson I learned the hard way on Sunset Overdrive

149
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,681
when we were building the first night defense base.

150
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,031
So I was struggling a lot with trying

151
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:58,931
to make the gameplay work.

152
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,773
So night defense is like this tower defense mode

153
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,214
where you have enemies streaming in

154
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:04,334
from different angles and lanes.

155
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,836
And I was struggling with making that gameplay work

156
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,236
with my thematic elements.

157
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:10,558
And so I ended up just throwing any consideration

158
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:13,559
for the theme away and focused solely on the gameplay.

159
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:16,685
And I actually did that by just sort of carving out

160
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:19,006
the lanes that I wanted the enemies to take

161
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:19,747
to get to the base.

162
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:22,229
And I got something that, from a gameplay perspective,

163
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,270
I thought worked pretty well and was pretty well balanced.

164
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,452
And then when it came to trying to figure out the layout,

165
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:30,314
I just sort of filled in the in-betweens with geometry,

166
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:32,815
but didn't really think about what the actual

167
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:34,397
thematic element of the base was gonna be.

168
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:38,199
And so this put a lot of pressure on the environment team

169
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,021
to try to realize the space and make sense of the space.

170
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,495
And in the end, it didn't really make very much sense

171
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:47,656
because I didn't bother, I didn't have the forethought

172
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:49,016
to think out what the theme was gonna be.

173
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:52,497
And so what we ended up with was a weird mishmash of things

174
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:54,037
where it's sort of like this diner

175
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:56,158
at the bottom of a corporate office

176
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:59,539
in the back of a neighborhood next to a shopping mall.

177
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:02,625
Didn't really make sense, even a game like Sunset Overdrive.

178
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:04,867
So when I moved on to the next base,

179
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,529
I wanted to make sure that my thematic and my gameplay

180
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,291
goals were better aligned.

181
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:12,694
So I knew for gameplay, I needed things like rails

182
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,176
and surfaces to grind on, but I also

183
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,598
needed ways to create lots of small substructures

184
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,419
to form lanes.

185
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,803
And so I came up with the idea of a brewery, which

186
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,644
would allow me to have a lot of things like pipes and vats

187
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,184
and things to bounce off for traversal,

188
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:29,886
but also allow me to create lane structures better.

189
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:34,107
And the transition from the rough art to the final art

190
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,588
was a much smoother process because I had worked out

191
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,469
the theme ahead of time.

192
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:39,089
And so the artist and the environment team

193
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,891
could really just focus on applying Sunset Overdrive style

194
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:44,211
and not trying to figure out what the space actually was.

195
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:48,665
So on Spider-Man, we knew we had potential conflict

196
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:49,505
with some of our goals.

197
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:52,647
One of our goals being that we wanted the world

198
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,829
to feel like a real place, like the actual city.

199
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:57,110
And the other goal being we wanted the traversal

200
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,151
to be smooth and fluid.

201
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,053
So when you're building things like a real city,

202
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:02,874
you come up with lots of elements

203
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:04,995
that are potential hazards for traversal.

204
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:06,116
I didn't bring a laser pointer

205
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:08,517
because I thought it would be a lot closer to the screen.

206
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:09,338
So, sorry.

207
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:15,059
So you have important details for real-world elements,

208
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,181
like things like billboards, little air conditioners.

209
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:19,962
You've got water towers, right?

210
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:22,443
Those things are necessary to build a real world,

211
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:25,085
but they become potential hazards for traversal.

212
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,187
So we made sure that we could support those things,

213
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,868
but that also whenever we included an element like that,

214
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:33,650
we had some traversal move or some way

215
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,391
that the player could overcome a flow over or through them

216
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:36,752
smoothly.

217
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,700
So while you're building your goals,

218
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,002
it's also really important to rank your goals.

219
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:45,625
You want to try to form them in a hierarchy if you can.

220
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:47,987
And most importantly, if you can,

221
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,890
try to figure out what the most important element of your level

222
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,650
or your space is.

223
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:54,533
This will help you while you're iterating on the space.

224
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:56,895
This will help you while you're resolving feedback.

225
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:01,058
But also, this will help you when you're considering

226
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:02,059
spaces between each other.

227
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:02,379
Because

228
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:06,063
You might have similar goals between different spaces,

229
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:08,525
but you might find that the priority shifts a little bit

230
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:09,305
between each space.

231
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,669
So this is the boat base on Sunset Overdrive.

232
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:17,131
And in this base, the boat theme was really

233
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:18,192
the theme that took priority.

234
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:21,892
We had to pull back a little bit on some of the gameplay

235
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,734
elements, but that was OK because we knew we really

236
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:26,354
wanted to have a base on a boat.

237
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:28,355
This was an idea that came from pre-production.

238
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,776
This was an idea that we thought would be really

239
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,417
important to include in the game.

240
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:34,178
And I'm glad we did because I think it adds a good amount of

241
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:36,359
variety to the total number of bases that we had.

242
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,182
So when we were thinking about the goals and defining our

243
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:44,162
goals for Manhattan.

244
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:48,585
Again, one of the main goals we had is we wanted it to feel like a real place.

245
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:50,666
We wanted it to feel like the actual city.

246
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:54,068
And more importantly, we wanted it to be familiar to people.

247
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:58,890
We wanted it to be familiar to players, even to players who have never actually been to

248
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,712
Manhattan, who maybe are only familiar with the city through TV and movies.

249
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:09,155
And what this meant was that we had to focus on things that people had seen before in TV

250
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:09,615
and movies.

251
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,696
And that meant we focused a lot on the landmarks.

252
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:15,111
And so, and I'll just, I'll go over to this side this time,

253
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:15,931
for fairness sakes.

254
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:20,354
And so, what we have here is we wanted to make sure

255
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:22,495
the landmarks were called out, even in the rough form.

256
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,377
So you can see that there's this big, tall

257
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,438
structure thing here, and even though you don't know

258
00:10:26,478 --> 00:10:28,539
what it is exactly, you can tell that it's probably

259
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,581
pretty important, and we wanted it to stand out.

260
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:33,502
And also, we've got another kind of little structure

261
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:36,084
here too, that's called out, and also seems like

262
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,425
it might be a pretty important thing.

263
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:40,067
And this is something that we wanted to be evident,

264
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:41,468
even in the rough form.

265
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:43,421
Because when we took it to final,

266
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:47,663
those things ended up becoming important landmarks

267
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:49,824
like the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building,

268
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,324
which are probably two of the most iconic buildings

269
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:53,165
in the city.

270
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:54,685
And so we wanted to make sure the players could

271
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,386
see those from different areas of the city.

272
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,967
And the landmarks ended up being the actual foundation

273
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:01,788
of the initial map.

274
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,289
So we went about creating the first map

275
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,529
by just plopping down all the different landmarks

276
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:09,090
that we wanted, and then including some of the roads

277
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,331
that we knew that were going to be important.

278
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:10,471
Iconic.

279
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:12,703
like Park Avenue.

280
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:15,324
And then from there, we filled it

281
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:18,046
in with the more generic roads and locations.

282
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,528
And this became the layout in the first map for our city.

283
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,191
So step two is research.

284
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:28,373
And I think for a lot of people, this step seems pretty obvious.

285
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,610
Of course, you're going to do research on a location,

286
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,271
particularly if you're building a location like New York,

287
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,152
which is based off of real space.

288
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:37,273
But I include this step, and I think

289
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:38,834
it's an important thing to consider,

290
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:41,495
because I found a lot of times I was

291
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:43,396
overconfident on my own knowledge of a topic.

292
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,097
I would think that I already knew a thing,

293
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,458
so I didn't need to do that much research.

294
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,899
And then when I eventually went back and actually did research,

295
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,361
I found details and things that I had missed.

296
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,802
Also, when you're starting on a new project

297
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:56,723
or you're starting on a new level,

298
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,510
It can be really tempting to try to just jump in

299
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,491
and start building right away.

300
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,595
But it's important to take a step back

301
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:04,837
and try to do a little bit of research

302
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:05,959
because a lot of things that you can learn,

303
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:08,482
there's a lot of actual time you can save yourself

304
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,924
by doing the proper research first.

305
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,549
So as an example, this is the first layout

306
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,251
for the brewery base actually that I showed earlier.

307
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:18,246
And I was super excited to start on a new base.

308
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,229
So I just started laying things out in 2D.

309
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,612
Because I figured, oh, I know what a brewery is.

310
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:24,753
I mean, I've been to BJ's.

311
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:27,075
They have things like pipes and vats and things.

312
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:27,436
I get it.

313
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:29,418
And so I just started laying things out.

314
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:30,659
But then I realized.

315
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,641
You know, this stuff's not really working out.

316
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,562
The layout's not vibing right.

317
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,943
Things don't seem to make sense.

318
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:41,325
I was struggling with why was I having such a hard time

319
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:42,065
with the layout.

320
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:44,527
And I realized it was because I didn't do

321
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:45,347
my proper research.

322
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:46,448
And so I ended up stepping back,

323
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:48,188
doing more research on breweries,

324
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:49,529
and then I found structures and things

325
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,970
and more useful tools that I could use

326
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,950
when I was laying out the space.

327
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,092
So when you're doing research,

328
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:56,833
it's also really important, if you can,

329
00:12:56,853 --> 00:12:58,734
to try to go beyond just reference images.

330
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,820
Places in the world are meant for people.

331
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,161
They're meant for people to use them.

332
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:06,984
And a lot of times, there's a lot of times

333
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:09,886
the getting into the mindset of the people that

334
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:12,648
are meant to inhabit the space will

335
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,229
help inform you on the decisions on why

336
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:15,350
those spaces were constructed.

337
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,292
And so if you can get an understanding

338
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,493
for the actual people that inhabit your space,

339
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:23,355
it helps you understand the reasoning behind that space.

340
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,477
And for Spider-Man, I actually ended up

341
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:28,819
reading a lot of travel guides for the different neighborhoods

342
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:29,399
around the city.

343
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,448
And I even joined some of the online communities

344
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:34,288
that were really just meant for people who lived in the city.

345
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,549
And one thing that I learned from this research

346
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:41,150
was that people like to talk about the subway system a lot.

347
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,490
People who live in New York are always posting about,

348
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,231
either there's a delay, or there's a shutdown,

349
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,471
or the subway's flooded.

350
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,311
It's really a major element of their everyday life.

351
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:52,812
And because we were trying to bring the city to life

352
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:55,433
for people, for our players, we knew this was something

353
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:56,353
that we wanted to include.

354
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,962
And even though our city doesn't have an actual functional subway network,

355
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:06,845
we still tried to deliver on that theme by having it as part of our fast travel.

356
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:10,646
So whenever the player flash travels, you get to see Spider-Man taking the subway.

357
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,187
And it's just a good way we can connect with people on and

358
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:14,448
make the space feel more real.

359
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:24,192
So speaking of allowing research to help you do some of the work for you is.

360
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,935
you can really learn from what other games have done.

361
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:29,516
A lot of times, something you're trying to do

362
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:30,436
has been tried before.

363
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,437
And my favorite version of a prototype

364
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,638
or a first pass at a level is something

365
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:35,718
that's been done in another game.

366
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:38,619
Because you can see what sort of issues come up

367
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:40,559
when you try to take something to final implementation.

368
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,780
And just because something doesn't work in another game,

369
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,661
doesn't mean it won't work in your game.

370
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,041
There might be techniques or circumstances

371
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:48,742
that you can apply that will make it work.

372
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:51,063
But at the same time, there's no reason

373
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:53,803
to repeat the same mistakes exactly as another game did.

374
00:14:56,002 --> 00:15:00,303
So one issue that I knew that we might run into from playing

375
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:02,764
other Spider-Man games was rooftop spaces.

376
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:07,105
So rooftops actually are a significant part

377
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:07,926
of a city space.

378
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:10,686
And yet, they're a big challenge for a character like Spider-Man

379
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:12,827
because Spider-Man needs tall things to swing from.

380
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:14,527
And generally, when you're on a rooftop,

381
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,688
you don't have anything to swing from.

382
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:22,095
So we went about trying to handle this by first making sure that whenever we have a low space right here,

383
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:25,078
we try to have a tall building next to it so there's something for you to swing from.

384
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:33,447
And then on our rooftops, we also try to include lots of elements for the player to either parkour or vault over to help you cross the roof quicker.

385
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,990
And in the end, we actually ended up

386
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,792
creating a brand new traversal move called the point launch,

387
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,133
where you can actually just zip to an object on the roof

388
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,134
and then bounce and leap off to allow you to quickly

389
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:45,855
and fluidly overcome rooftops.

390
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:50,057
And so we ended up taking the rooftops from a problem space

391
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,098
to something that's more in the player space

392
00:15:53,158 --> 00:15:54,779
and included in the gameplay experience.

393
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,961
And then speaking of playing the other Spider-Man games,

394
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,822
during research, I think it's really important

395
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:03,083
that you actually play the games, particularly the games

396
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,809
that relate to the content or the project that you're on.

397
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,713
I hear a lot of discussion about, as developers,

398
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,995
how much should we be playing games?

399
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:15,078
And I think, as a designer, it's really your responsibility

400
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:15,638
to play the game.

401
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,661
And then also, give the game the time it needs

402
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,283
to really understand the experience.

403
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,585
A trap that I see people fall into is,

404
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,987
they'll pick up a game and play it

405
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:26,689
for maybe like an hour or two and then drop it

406
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:27,830
and think that that's all they need to do

407
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,711
to get the experience.

408
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:33,117
I found a lot of times mechanics or the real insights

409
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:34,938
in other games don't really unlock

410
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,379
until kind of the later half of the game.

411
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:40,882
And then for Spider-Man, I actually

412
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:43,744
went through and played every Spider-Man released on console

413
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,246
since the first Spider-Man on PlayStation 2.

414
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:49,348
And I played through them, most of them, all the way through.

415
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:52,550
And there were a lot of things that I learned in those games

416
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,712
that I wouldn't have missed had I dropped the games early on.

417
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:56,893
So again, I think it's important.

418
00:16:57,665 --> 00:17:00,446
So if you can, play the games and give them the time they need.

419
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:04,027
So step three is experiment.

420
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:07,729
And this is where you get to dig in and start trying ideas out.

421
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:11,030
But I call this step experiment because it's

422
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,091
important that while you're at the stage,

423
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:14,512
you're trying to answer questions.

424
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:17,153
So again, I think that when you're

425
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:20,154
starting on a new project or a new level, it's very tempting.

426
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:22,365
to want to just dive in and start building things

427
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:22,905
that you know.

428
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,046
If you know what a thing is supposed to be,

429
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:24,846
you just want to make it.

430
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,527
But at this stage, it's not really

431
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,888
helpful to work on what you know.

432
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:31,629
It's more helpful to work on things that you don't know.

433
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,291
So you want to focus on things that you

434
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:38,673
need to prove big questions that you have or major risks.

435
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:41,134
You want to try those things out sooner

436
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:42,895
and then get those things out of the way

437
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:44,916
so they don't cause conflicts later on.

438
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:48,754
And while you're building these experiments,

439
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:50,816
try to build them in a controlled way

440
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,298
where you can control for variables

441
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,120
and you can get results that are quantifiable if you can.

442
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,383
This is where you start building metrics

443
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:59,264
and this is where you start to define things like

444
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:00,806
how big should spaces be,

445
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,888
how many characters are gonna fit in there,

446
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:05,330
how long is it gonna take the player to get through it.

447
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:09,935
And when you're doing these experimental layouts,

448
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:14,758
It's also important to not really think of them as a rough.

449
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,420
I think of them more as sketching,

450
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,602
because you're trying to get to your answers quickly.

451
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:23,425
And so you want to focus on just the things you need to do

452
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:24,786
to answer your questions,

453
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:27,648
and not get too hung up on details

454
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:29,089
that don't really relate to the questions

455
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:29,790
you're trying to answer.

456
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,513
So as an example, this is what I would consider

457
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:36,715
a sketch for the first layout of Manhattan.

458
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:41,218
And I call it a sketch because none of the building details

459
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:42,159
are really accurate.

460
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,378
In fact, a lot of buildings aren't even called out.

461
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:46,419
There's a lot of blocks that are just

462
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,100
sort of one square per block.

463
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:50,361
And there are a few landmarks in there,

464
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:52,102
but again, it's not very accurate.

465
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:54,464
The only thing that this really does answer

466
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:55,984
is how big is the city going to be?

467
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,005
And what is it going to feel like when

468
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,086
you're inside a city this big?

469
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:00,787
And that was what I was trying to answer with this.

470
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:03,408
I wasn't really trying to get into the details of building

471
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:04,589
heights and swing metrics.

472
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,190
I was just trying to figure out, what's

473
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,111
it going to be like when we're in a city the size of the one

474
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:08,591
we want to build?

475
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,545
Compare this to something like this,

476
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:14,146
which is a little bit more accurate to what

477
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,666
we built in the final game.

478
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,387
So you've got buildings that are called out correctly.

479
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:20,447
Things are at the right height.

480
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:23,048
This is definitely a much more detailed rough.

481
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:25,209
This is what I would consider a rough and not just a sketch.

482
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:28,670
This layout, however, took us weeks to get to.

483
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,390
And in fact, I needed to work with a Houdini expert

484
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:34,511
to generate a lot of this procedurally.

485
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:36,532
Not something we could get to quickly.

486
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,631
Whereas the previous example, this one I built in,

487
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,752
I think, maybe a day, two days max.

488
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:47,793
And so I was able to quickly get to answering the question of,

489
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:49,654
does this feel like the right size space for what

490
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:50,314
we're trying to build?

491
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:55,575
And during experimenting, it's important to try to be agile.

492
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,095
Again, try to work quickly.

493
00:19:57,276 --> 00:19:58,496
Try to get to your answers quickly.

494
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:01,377
Don't be afraid to throw things away.

495
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,997
This is the safe space to try things that aren't going to work

496
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,618
and then just toss them when they don't work.

497
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:08,247
And if you can, work in physical.

498
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:10,329
I think it helps to bring things into the real space

499
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:11,410
and bring it out of the computer.

500
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,052
So as an example, hopefully you guys can see this,

501
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,274
when we were talking about traversal,

502
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:18,176
I got this little toy on a string

503
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,257
that I was just like, okay, how does swinging work?

504
00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:22,679
Because our swing model is a physics-based model.

505
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,181
So I was like, okay, well, can he just do this?

506
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:26,042
What does it work when you're doing this?

507
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:28,264
And so we would work in the physical space a little bit

508
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:29,425
when we were talking about traversal.

509
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:32,428
And then how that applies to level design

510
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:34,430
can come back to that sketching idea.

511
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:38,684
So I talked before about how I sketched the lanes out

512
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:40,285
for that first sunset overdrive base,

513
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:43,328
and while not considering the theme was a bad idea,

514
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:45,990
sketching things out on paper actually did

515
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,651
what was really helpful in defining the gameplay.

516
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:49,172
And so when I built the other bases,

517
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,033
I actually started by just sketching out

518
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:52,734
all the different lanes on paper,

519
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:55,196
and so I could quickly get through lots of different lanes

520
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:56,998
and lots of different layouts by just drawing

521
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:58,379
lines and sticks and circles.

522
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:00,020
And then I just had to make sure that

523
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,262
whatever layout I came up with

524
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,763
would have some kind of recognizable theme in the end.

525
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:09,596
And while you're also working quickly

526
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,118
in this sort of experimentation phase,

527
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:13,939
it's important to make sure that you're keeping

528
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,200
the player's perspective in mind.

529
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:18,783
So I think one trap that's easy to fall into

530
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:20,664
is when you're a developer,

531
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:22,846
is you can get kind of locked into editor space

532
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,648
where you have top-down knowledge of the entire level.

533
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:28,290
But players don't have top-down knowledge.

534
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,411
Players have a limited FOV, generally speaking.

535
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:32,733
And so they can only fit so much into one view.

536
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,794
And so while you're building and while you're sketching,

537
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:35,995
it's important to consider that.

538
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:37,957
What is the player going to actually be able to capture?

539
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:38,910
in one view.

540
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:42,353
And you can do this even if the game's not playable.

541
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:44,936
And in fact, again, talking about sketching,

542
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,058
sometimes I would start a layout,

543
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,280
before I even did a top-down 2D layout,

544
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,722
I would just try to draw a little perspective sketch

545
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:53,223
of what a player might see standing

546
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:54,144
at one point in the level,

547
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:56,286
just what are the different things that are called out.

548
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:57,967
And again, it just helps you get

549
00:21:57,987 --> 00:21:59,128
into the mindset of the player.

550
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:03,663
So our experimentation in Spider-Man

551
00:22:04,044 --> 00:22:06,925
was focused a lot on defining building metrics, sizes,

552
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,206
and scales, and also traversal standards.

553
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:12,408
And one of the first metric we worked on

554
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:14,009
was the city block size.

555
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:16,330
We wanted to define how big were our city blocks going to be.

556
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,451
Were they going to be real scale,

557
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:18,991
or were they going to be something scaled down?

558
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:22,488
And so I started by building a bunch of different city block

559
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:24,149
layouts, different sizes.

560
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,511
And again, trying to create experiments

561
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:28,433
that control for variables, I tried

562
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,954
to use the same geometry in each experiment

563
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:33,056
and making sure that the only real difference between them

564
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:34,577
were the size of the city blocks.

565
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:37,339
And so at the top, we have something

566
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,722
that's a little bit more like the size of city blocks

567
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:42,603
you would see in the real world.

568
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:44,524
And in the middle is something a little bit more in between.

569
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:45,625
And that's what we ended up on.

570
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:52,465
And then another big metric that we worked on early on

571
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,446
was trying to figure out the size of street widths.

572
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:58,128
And so again, our swing model is based on a physics model.

573
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:02,610
And with that kind of a model, the smaller gap

574
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,152
you have between swing points, the more reliable swinging

575
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:06,512
feels.

576
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:08,994
But at the same time, the tighter the space

577
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,715
you put the player in, the more confined they feel.

578
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:13,816
So we had to try to figure out what's that sweet spot

579
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:15,297
between street widths.

580
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:18,518
And I did that by building one almost infinitely long street.

581
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,860
And it started with very narrow streets at one end,

582
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,901
and it progressively got wider and wider and wider

583
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:23,761
as you went down the street.

584
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,622
And then we would just swing up and down the street

585
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,583
and try to figure out where was that sweet zone?

586
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,204
Where did it feel right on both ends?

587
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:35,804
So for the city, for the building heights,

588
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:38,466
we wanted to make sure that we could get a good diversity

589
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:39,066
in building heights.

590
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,968
And I also wanted to make sure that we could standardize.

591
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,209
We could say that, hey, this area is a low building height

592
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:46,491
area, this area is a mid-range building height area,

593
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:48,452
and this area is a high-range building height area.

594
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:50,814
But we wanted to make sure that those different height ranges

595
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:52,476
would read against each other.

596
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:55,179
So that if we have an area like Hell's Kitchen, which

597
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,280
is supposed to be a low height area,

598
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,641
you could tell where that is supposed

599
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:59,603
to be versus an area like Midtown, which

600
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,625
is a medium to high rise area.

601
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:04,368
So I built a little test level where each area was called out

602
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:06,010
by a different color, and each area

603
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,432
was contrasted and set next to a different height range.

604
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,694
So we can make sure that those two different heights

605
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:11,775
would read well against each other.

606
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,268
And then we experimented a lot with Central Park too.

607
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:20,410
Central Park is a major element of Manhattan,

608
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,572
and it's a major consideration when you're building Manhattan

609
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:24,753
because it is central.

610
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:27,434
If you change the shape and size of Central Park,

611
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:30,556
you actually change the shape and size of the entire city.

612
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:33,138
So we wanted to make sure that we got the size right.

613
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,219
We wanted it to feel big and impressive,

614
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,861
but at the same time, we wanted it to be manageable.

615
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:41,103
And so at the far right, we have something

616
00:24:41,123 --> 00:24:43,104
that's a little bit closer to the actual size of the city.

617
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:44,685
And again, we ended up on something

618
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:45,746
that was a little bit more in the middle.

619
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:49,608
So at this point, you've been playing

620
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:50,529
with a lot of different ideas.

621
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:52,150
And you've been doing a lot of different experiments.

622
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,471
And you probably feel like you're

623
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:56,092
ready to really start building stuff.

624
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:59,774
But before you go into more final implementation,

625
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:02,756
it's important to take a step back and to verify.

626
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,222
that you're on the right track.

627
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:07,283
First thing to verify is just your goals,

628
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:09,263
the fundamental things that have been driving you so far.

629
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:12,624
Sometimes you set a goal for yourself and you achieve it,

630
00:25:12,764 --> 00:25:14,464
but in the end, the results you get

631
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:16,285
really aren't the thing that you're looking for.

632
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,846
And so this is a point in the process

633
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:20,226
where you can take a step back

634
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,766
and redefine your goals if you need to.

635
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:26,948
You also want to make sure that all the experiments

636
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:28,608
and everything you've been working with

637
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:31,589
are at the proper scale and have believable logic

638
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:32,409
and believable flow.

639
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:35,015
If you've been doing experiments at the wrong scale,

640
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:36,835
the results you get aren't gonna be accurate

641
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:38,316
when you start doing final implementation.

642
00:25:38,756 --> 00:25:41,117
If you've only been working with a single scale clue,

643
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:42,678
like maybe like the player height,

644
00:25:42,998 --> 00:25:44,919
you may not realize that things feel out of scale

645
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:47,960
when you start implementing things like doorways

646
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,980
or smaller props.

647
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:52,682
And you also need to make sure

648
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:53,962
that it'll eventually actually run

649
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:55,183
when you deploy it on your platform.

650
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:58,339
So again, at this point, you've been kind of blue-skying it,

651
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,440
just trying out ideas.

652
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,082
And you may not have been taking a lot of consideration

653
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:03,984
to the technical aspect of what you're trying to build.

654
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:06,025
And the tricky thing about this step

655
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:09,428
is that you don't always know the exact parameters

656
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,969
and the exact technical constraints

657
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:12,451
you're going to have when you do finally

658
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:13,551
deploy it onto the platform.

659
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,713
So you need to consider whether or not

660
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:18,095
you need to build in safety nets and have ways

661
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:19,596
that you can scale back if you need to.

662
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:22,919
And you also, before you go forward,

663
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,400
need to make sure that you're sharing your vision.

664
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,901
Again, at this point in the process,

665
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,222
you might have been working very quickly.

666
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:30,563
This whole up until now, it could have only been a few

667
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:33,985
hours, and before you go through to final implementation

668
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,606
or start doing the more expensive work,

669
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:37,467
you need to make sure that you're sharing what you're

670
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:38,428
trying to do with everyone else.

671
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:42,010
And also explain your goals and try to explain the intent

672
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,971
behind what you're trying to do.

673
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:45,232
If you show people what you were trying to,

674
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:46,833
if you tell people what you were trying to do,

675
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,354
and they see what you actually did,

676
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:51,376
that really helps inform them on the shortcomings.

677
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,460
And if you can, as much as possible,

678
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,062
only move forward with complete confidence at this point.

679
00:26:59,163 --> 00:27:01,184
You've been working fast, and you've been working loose.

680
00:27:02,365 --> 00:27:03,686
Hopefully, everything you've built so far

681
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:06,008
can be thrown away, and you can start over if you need to.

682
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:07,649
And this is the point to start over.

683
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,572
After this point, things get more costly,

684
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:12,773
and it becomes much more expensive to do rework.

685
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,475
And so you want to make sure that you're

686
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,696
very confident when you start doing final implementation.

687
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:20,239
And I also think this is the step that

688
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,600
scales well with the project.

689
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:26,437
So for Spider-Man, we had been defining a lot of metrics

690
00:27:26,838 --> 00:27:27,758
and a lot of standards.

691
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,519
But I wanted to be very confident

692
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,380
that we were building the right thing

693
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,700
and that we were going to build the right thing,

694
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,501
because we didn't have a chance to try

695
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,482
to build the entire city and then start over

696
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:39,442
if we didn't build it right.

697
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:42,504
And the city is very different and very varied.

698
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:45,185
There are lots of different areas and architecture

699
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:46,225
and layouts throughout the city.

700
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,046
So I wanted to make sure that metrics

701
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:49,706
that we were defining for one area of the city

702
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,487
were going to work throughout the whole city.

703
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,021
So I took our map layout that we had made,

704
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:58,104
and I took slices from it, and I composed those slices

705
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:01,146
in a scaled-down version of the entire city.

706
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,268
And this became our first real practical test

707
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,129
of all of our metrics.

708
00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:08,071
And this became our main testbed for all of our metrics

709
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:09,712
and traversal standards that we had been building.

710
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:14,295
So after you have confidence and you

711
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:15,476
feel like you're ready to go forward,

712
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:18,198
now is when you start to apply all of the metrics

713
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,239
and the standards you've been building.

714
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:22,892
Now is when you start to really define the final rough.

715
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:24,753
You want to snap things to metric.

716
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:26,233
You want to clean up your edges.

717
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:30,175
Ideally, this is where the rough actually

718
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:31,575
starts to look like the final game,

719
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:34,656
or as close to it as you can with your level of resolution.

720
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:37,417
And you also need to make sure that you're integrating

721
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:39,038
the rest of the gameplay that you've been building.

722
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:40,559
So hopefully before this point, you've

723
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:41,839
been playing with gameplay, and you've

724
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:43,460
been doing experiments, but you need

725
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,700
to make sure that it's all connected,

726
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,162
and that the game plays the way you expect it to play.

727
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:51,809
And inevitably, you're going to run into some conflicts

728
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:53,930
when you start doing implementation

729
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,831
of the final gameplay.

730
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,292
And so you may need to adjust.

731
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:59,014
And hopefully, you don't have to do major rework.

732
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:00,675
But this is a case where you may have

733
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:03,577
to step back through the process and redefine some of your goals.

734
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:07,159
So one issue that we had in Spider-Man

735
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,461
was the road network in the bottom half of the city

736
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,342
is very complex.

737
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:14,004
And that's because a lot of these roads

738
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:16,565
follow most of the roads in actual Manhattan.

739
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:20,208
And so the traffic system we had been building

740
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:21,870
wasn't really built to handle this.

741
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,311
And the traffic system we were building

742
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:25,333
was mostly built for four-way intersections.

743
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:28,095
But some of these intersections have five or even six ways.

744
00:29:29,187 --> 00:29:31,748
But we knew this was still important to have these really

745
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:33,750
complicated intersections because, again, we

746
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,231
wanted it to feel like the real city.

747
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,712
And the real city has these types of things.

748
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:39,934
So what we ended up doing was, for some

749
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:41,215
of these complicated intersections,

750
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:44,137
we ended up just blocking off a few of the roads.

751
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:46,979
So one road might be under construction,

752
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,681
so there was no actual traffic going through it.

753
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:51,062
or one road might just have parked cars in it.

754
00:29:51,362 --> 00:29:54,604
And so we converted some of our six or five-way intersections

755
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:56,185
back into four-way intersections so

756
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:59,167
that we could achieve both the goals of building something

757
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:01,268
that felt like the real city, but that would actually

758
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:02,649
work with the traffic system.

759
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,731
And then at this point, you get to a point in your level

760
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:10,753
where you basically just continuously test and iterate

761
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:11,213
on the level.

762
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,112
So you've been testing and iterating on it

763
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:16,674
before this point, but this becomes the entire process.

764
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:19,796
And this is pretty much where you take the game to final.

765
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,218
And during the testing and iterating phase,

766
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,239
you're going to come into contact with a lot of feedback.

767
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,201
And so it's important to have a plan for how you're

768
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,282
going to resolve your feedback.

769
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:30,624
And this is where I like having those goals

770
00:30:30,644 --> 00:30:33,186
and that hierarchy of goals, because this allows me

771
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:34,687
to better evaluate feedback.

772
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,269
And it's important to also not be dismissive.

773
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:41,675
you can have a very personal attachment with your level.

774
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:44,097
And so sometimes you can get a emotional response

775
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:44,678
to feedback.

776
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:47,260
But that's the advantage of comparing everything

777
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,401
to your goals, because it allows you to detach a little bit

778
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,022
emotionally.

779
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:52,064
And so when you get feedback, you can go, OK,

780
00:30:52,604 --> 00:30:54,506
does this feedback align with what I'm trying to do?

781
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:57,648
Maybe this feedback is pointing to a goal

782
00:30:57,668 --> 00:31:00,250
that's a lower tier than the goal I was trying to service.

783
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,172
And so it's OK to ignore it.

784
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:03,793
Or maybe this feedback really does

785
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:06,015
tell me I need to make some adjustments to what

786
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:06,515
I was building.

787
00:31:08,722 --> 00:31:11,544
So when we were starting to execute the final rough

788
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:14,867
across the city, we started to actually build

789
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:16,348
the rough into more detail.

790
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,930
So once we were confident with all of our metrics

791
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,493
and we knew that what we had been experimenting with

792
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:23,935
was the way we wanted to go with the city,

793
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,577
we can start building the rough and start

794
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,478
matching the buildings more to their final form.

795
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:30,660
So the rough started to look more like the final level.

796
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:36,025
And we could build those details with a little bit more

797
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:38,347
confidence that the details would carry through

798
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:39,708
and wouldn't be lost in the final level.

799
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:45,133
So the last step is reflect.

800
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,955
And even though this is the last step,

801
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:49,957
this was actually the first step in the process for me.

802
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:53,120
Because this whole process started with me just thinking

803
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,682
about how I could improve my process

804
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,344
and how I could do better the next time.

805
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,301
And then a fortunate part of this step

806
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,082
is it usually comes after you've run out of time.

807
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,402
I find that I always have the most insight

808
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:10,183
after I've run out of time to act on it.

809
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:12,444
And so I try to learn from that, and I

810
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,644
try to carry that insight forward

811
00:32:14,784 --> 00:32:15,764
and do better the next time.

812
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:18,945
Now, I also have a little bit of what

813
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:21,166
I call kind of a dubious personal philosophy,

814
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:23,266
in that even though I've run out of time,

815
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:25,927
I always think to myself, is it really too late?

816
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:27,807
So.

817
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:31,519
Because in that reflection process,

818
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:33,761
I try to think to myself, well, is there anything

819
00:32:33,781 --> 00:32:34,922
that I can still act on?

820
00:32:35,282 --> 00:32:38,204
Is there anything that I can still do to improve this?

821
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:40,306
And so I include this as an important part

822
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,348
of trying to think about what can

823
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:45,750
you do to actually improve the level in its final stages.

824
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:49,233
So one example of that on Spider-Man

825
00:32:49,874 --> 00:32:51,035
was something that we.

826
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:54,831
wasn't part of the initial layout of the city

827
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:56,031
were the faction bases.

828
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:57,752
So we had these different bases around the city

829
00:32:58,253 --> 00:33:00,054
that have enemies and thugs in them

830
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:01,755
that you can go through and battle

831
00:33:01,795 --> 00:33:03,015
in sort of a challenge type mode.

832
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:05,597
And we ended up implementing these

833
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:06,738
kind of late in the process.

834
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:10,540
And we actually had to rework a lot of final art

835
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,080
to get them in.

836
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,481
But we knew it was worth it

837
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,182
because we wanted to have those spaces

838
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:15,202
that would challenge players.

839
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:18,404
And we wanted to have spaces that would really allow players

840
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:21,566
to exercise their mastery of the game.

841
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:25,907
And reflecting on the whole project,

842
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:28,590
and thinking about what I could do better,

843
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:32,455
I do think that initially I was so focused

844
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:37,040
on all of the metrics that I didn't build enough space

845
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,563
in for the environment team in some of the.

846
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:42,956
to add details to some of the street level stuff.

847
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:45,597
And we actually did end up having to rework

848
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:46,497
some of the street metrics.

849
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:50,338
So after we built about half of one of the first districts,

850
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,779
we realized we didn't have enough space on the streets

851
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:54,599
to include the props that we needed

852
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:56,339
to really make the world feel detailed enough

853
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,140
to make it feel real.

854
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,040
And that was one of our major goals.

855
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,621
We wanted it to feel like a real space.

856
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:01,861
We wanted it to feel real.

857
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:05,842
And so we made the decision to change the street metrics,

858
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:08,663
which ended up having to do a lot of rework

859
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:09,543
in that first area.

860
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:13,556
Luckily, we did this soon enough to where it wasn't

861
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:15,758
detrimental to the whole project.

862
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,321
But it would have been better had we considered, or had I

863
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:22,344
considered, that had I considered a better buffer

864
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:24,345
zone for the propping spaces early on.

865
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,609
And we also did end up shaving off some

866
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,389
space from the city.

867
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,771
So we actually ended up taking off some

868
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:32,752
spaces from the sides.

869
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:39,578
But this ended up being okay because we found that if we took space off the sides, it still

870
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:40,098
felt right.

871
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:44,501
It still felt like Manhattan and it didn't really disrupt the layout or it didn't disrupt

872
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:46,082
our landmarks very much.

873
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:51,325
We also considered if we could take space out of the middle of it and we found when

874
00:34:51,345 --> 00:34:54,588
we tried to take space out of the middle, it disrupted a lot of things.

875
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:59,151
It made the shape not feel like Manhattan and it disrupted the position of all of our

876
00:34:59,191 --> 00:34:59,591
landmarks.

877
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:03,197
And so considering our goals of trying

878
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:04,577
to make this feel like a real space,

879
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:08,479
we knew that we would be OK if we took space out of the sides,

880
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,700
but we needed to leave the space in the middle alone.

881
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:19,423
And I think that all of the experimentation, all

882
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:21,944
of the confirming that we did, and all the planning that we

883
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,064
did, and all the research we did,

884
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:25,985
really shows off when you compare the initial sketch

885
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:26,705
to the final product.

886
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,446
Because there are a lot of similarities between the two.

887
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:35,878
And so reflecting on the actual process itself,

888
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:40,160
during applying the process on Spider-Man,

889
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,002
is when I really thought about experimenting with intent.

890
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:45,663
And so thinking about this as a scientific process

891
00:35:45,703 --> 00:35:49,444
and not just as freeform experimentation,

892
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:51,906
but trying to actually answer questions.

893
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:55,187
And then also thinking about using evidence

894
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:56,408
to support what I was trying to do.

895
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:59,388
So again, one of the scary things about building Manhattan

896
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:00,709
was it's a huge level.

897
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:04,771
And we didn't have the time to try it once and then restart

898
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:05,672
over and try it again.

899
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:08,033
So we had to be sure and confident with everything

900
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:08,773
we were trying to do.

901
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:11,535
And we basically needed to accurately predict

902
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:12,876
what the outcome was going to be.

903
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,017
And I find that when you're trying

904
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:17,638
to make accurate predictions, it's good to have evidence.

905
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:20,219
So I started thinking about the experiments I did

906
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,321
and the research I was doing as evidence

907
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:24,902
when I was trying to predict how well the final level was

908
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:25,422
going to come out.

909
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,451
So in summary, you want to define,

910
00:36:30,832 --> 00:36:33,053
so define your thematic and your gameplay goals,

911
00:36:34,013 --> 00:36:35,534
form goals around key questions,

912
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:37,716
and resolve conflicts you may have

913
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:39,517
between gameplay and thematic goals.

914
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:41,738
You want to do research,

915
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:43,459
you want to make sure you do research

916
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:45,300
even if you think you're familiar with the content,

917
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,861
and you want to try to go beyond reference images.

918
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:49,923
And be sure you play the games

919
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:52,584
and make sure that you give the games the time they need

920
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:54,465
to really understand the full experience.

921
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,620
And then when you experiment, try to answer key questions.

922
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,821
Try to build controlled experiments.

923
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:03,382
Think of this phase like sketching,

924
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:05,322
so don't get too hung up on details yet.

925
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:07,423
And be OK with throwing things away.

926
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:09,043
Being OK with starting over if you need to.

927
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,685
And then confirming, you need to make sure you step back

928
00:37:12,745 --> 00:37:14,085
and verify your goals.

929
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:17,246
Check your scale, your logic, your flow.

930
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:21,588
And if you can, only move past this step with confidence.

931
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,793
And then execute, this is where you define the final rough,

932
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:27,034
this is where you lock down metrics,

933
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:28,555
you clean up your edges.

934
00:37:30,236 --> 00:37:32,177
And everything should start to finally play

935
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,138
like you expect it to.

936
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:35,119
And then finally, reflect.

937
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,121
Consider what you could have done better,

938
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:40,703
consider what about how you can improve the process,

939
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:42,084
and consider whether it's really too late

940
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:43,665
to try to improve your level.

941
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:45,706
And so.

942
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:49,409
The main point I have is a base in Sunset Overdrive

943
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:53,031
is a very different type of space from the city of Manhattan.

944
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:57,253
Yet the same fundamental process was used to build both.

945
00:37:57,813 --> 00:38:00,314
And that's really the power of a good process.

946
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:03,275
And that's really the power of good old-fashioned level

947
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:03,556
design.

948
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:05,577
Thank you.

949
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,668
So I think they're doing questions now,

950
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:24,908
if anyone has any questions.

951
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:29,009
There's microphones if you have questions.

952
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:39,333
Yeah, you can go first, you go first.

953
00:38:39,593 --> 00:38:40,293
I'll go back and forth.

954
00:38:40,474 --> 00:38:40,854
Hello.

955
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:42,234
Hi there.

956
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:44,915
Okay, so I'm wondering each steps,

957
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:46,876
how long, for example, like for,

958
00:38:47,396 --> 00:38:48,796
take Spider-Man as example,

959
00:38:48,856 --> 00:38:50,717
how long did it take for each steps?

960
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,371
How long for each step?

961
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,452
Well, it would have been good if I had recorded that.

962
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:02,494
So for example, to get to one thing I do know

963
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:06,795
is to get to the initial map, basically that first map

964
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:07,956
where we had everything filled in.

965
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:11,017
For me, that was about three months of work.

966
00:39:11,397 --> 00:39:15,078
I know that because I started on the project in January,

967
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:17,539
and I had to get the map done before my daughter was born,

968
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,559
and she was born in March.

969
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,420
So it was about a three month process.

970
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,623
And then from the rest of that, the process

971
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:27,265
kind of blends into most of the game.

972
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:29,226
And sometimes you do step back and go back and forth.

973
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:32,288
So it's not always done in discrete chunks.

974
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:34,229
OK, thank you.

975
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,251
So I just want to ask about the DLC.

976
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:41,673
When you guys had to work, when you finished the game

977
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,815
and you had to start on the DLC, how

978
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:46,716
did you approach the level design for the DLC

979
00:39:46,756 --> 00:39:49,118
as well, knowing that you're going to reuse the same map

980
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,159
but change some things in it?

981
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:53,927
Well, I wasn't as involved with the DLC,

982
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:56,588
so I can't speak to that as specifically.

983
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:59,270
I do think that there are a lot of constraints

984
00:39:59,971 --> 00:40:01,051
that go into that, though, when you're

985
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:03,753
trying to approach spaces that are already built.

986
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:06,335
And that was actually some of the challenges

987
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:08,176
that we had, actually, with the.

988
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:12,818
just the initial release game, because the city was so big,

989
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,939
we had to basically start building it from the beginning.

990
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,321
And we ended up having to do a lot of final art

991
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,902
before we had a chance to build all the gameplay

992
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:24,062
in every area, because we needed to basically just start

993
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:25,383
building final art almost right away.

994
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:28,264
And so there were a lot of challenges

995
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:30,165
that a lot of designers had, because they ended up

996
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:31,945
having to build in a lot of gameplay spaces

997
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:32,766
that were already final.

998
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,346
And so it's always just looking for opportunities where.

999
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:38,543
you can build something new and looking for opportunities

1000
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,004
where you can reuse spaces that are already used.

1001
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:42,265
Okay, thank you.

1002
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:45,007
How you doing?

1003
00:40:45,387 --> 00:40:45,967
My name's Josh.

1004
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,349
I work on a relatively large map too.

1005
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:49,809
It's 8K by 8K in Unreal units.

1006
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,390
Oh, nice.

1007
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,691
Mine is 3K by 8K.

1008
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:52,111
Yeah, I saw.

1009
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,787
Early on in development, once the levels really

1010
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:57,269
started taking shape, we obviously

1011
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:58,390
ran into performance issues.

1012
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,793
It being such a big map, obviously it probably

1013
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:02,675
came up when you guys were building the city of Manhattan.

1014
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:05,197
What kind of challenges did you have with performance,

1015
00:41:05,237 --> 00:41:06,619
and how did you solve those issues?

1016
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,943
So performance was the big consideration for us.

1017
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:15,654
Actually, part of the 8K limit was beyond 8K,

1018
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:16,955
there'd be dragons, I guess.

1019
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:19,957
There's some sort of math issue with going beyond that.

1020
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,878
And so they're like, don't go bigger than that.

1021
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:23,359
So that was the initial boundary.

1022
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,101
But we did have some previous history

1023
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,502
with streaming on Sunset Overdrive.

1024
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:30,523
So we had some metrics that we could build from.

1025
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,345
And we knew, and again, talking about scaling,

1026
00:41:33,185 --> 00:41:34,906
we knew there were certain things that we could scale back.

1027
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:40,110
And so we had idealized metrics that we wanted to hit.

1028
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,011
And we knew there was ability to scale there.

1029
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:45,405
And then ultimately, one of the things we do at Insomniac

1030
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:47,027
is just sort of rely on our awesome engine

1031
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:47,787
and technical teams.

1032
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:49,889
I don't know what those guys do.

1033
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:50,649
I think they're wizards.

1034
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,351
But I just say, hey, I want to do this thing.

1035
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,512
It's going to be insane.

1036
00:41:54,552 --> 00:41:55,053
Can you do it?

1037
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,074
And somehow they figure it out.

1038
00:41:56,174 --> 00:41:59,416
Hi.

1039
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:01,177
What part of the process do you start

1040
00:42:01,538 --> 00:42:03,739
worrying about where the story missions take place

1041
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,861
and how many collectibles there are everywhere, all the sort

1042
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,182
of gameplay specifics like that?

1043
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:10,988
I mean, we were trying to map that out from the beginning.

1044
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:14,309
We tried to make sure that each of the locations...

1045
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:16,150
I think one thing that helped that we knew

1046
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,510
that a lot of those things were probably

1047
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,951
gonna pivot around landmarks too,

1048
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,111
because that makes for interesting gameplay

1049
00:42:21,151 --> 00:42:22,852
if you have a mission or something that takes place

1050
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:24,693
at a well-known location, right?

1051
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:25,893
Particularly in something like Manhattan.

1052
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,434
So, we tried to make sure that there was

1053
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:30,754
a good distribution of landmarks

1054
00:42:30,874 --> 00:42:33,915
to help people build missions around there.

1055
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:37,173
We would map things out early.

1056
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:38,514
So we would map things out early.

1057
00:42:38,554 --> 00:42:42,236
We would do sort of speculative mission flows

1058
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:43,757
throughout the city, and then just

1059
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:45,378
try to accommodate whenever missions did come up.

1060
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:46,339
Thanks.

1061
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,421
OK.

1062
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:52,362
You mentioned playing games and studying them

1063
00:42:52,843 --> 00:42:55,985
to learn things from them and play through the whole thing

1064
00:42:56,005 --> 00:42:57,045
to learn things.

1065
00:42:57,065 --> 00:42:59,407
Do you have a specific process or things that you look for

1066
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:02,649
or how you go about doing that to learn the most

1067
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:05,330
and get the most out of it as a designer?

1068
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:07,884
Yeah, I mean, obviously, it's a little bit easier

1069
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:09,264
when you're making something like Spider-Man, right?

1070
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:10,725
Because you just go play all the Spider-Man games.

1071
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,086
But I also looked for, I try to find common elements

1072
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:18,047
or common threads, or things that I want to achieve

1073
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:21,088
that either have been done well, or maybe were tried

1074
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:22,549
in kind of a crazy way in a different game.

1075
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:25,850
So, obviously, you play through all the Spider-Man games,

1076
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,631
but then there are other games that take place in New York,

1077
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:31,372
and so it's important to try to play those games.

1078
00:43:33,084 --> 00:43:36,346
There are also games that are trying to go for just the feeling of New York.

1079
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:42,328
And so I work with looking at games that achieve critical claim,

1080
00:43:42,568 --> 00:43:45,630
right, or are related to what I'm trying to do,

1081
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,151
or to just do something unique and novel.

1082
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,392
And in terms of finding those games, I guess

1083
00:43:50,412 --> 00:43:51,933
that could be a difficult challenge, right?

1084
00:43:51,953 --> 00:43:53,914
There's lots of diamonds in the rough out there.

1085
00:43:55,704 --> 00:43:57,666
I feel like that's why it's important just as much as you

1086
00:43:57,686 --> 00:43:59,508
can try to do research and try to play games.

1087
00:43:59,528 --> 00:44:03,111
Because what you'll find is by researching for one game,

1088
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:06,554
you may see an interesting or unique element

1089
00:44:06,874 --> 00:44:08,035
that you can maybe remember.

1090
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:09,777
And then you can come back and revisit

1091
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,478
that when you are doing research for another thing.

1092
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:13,980
So it just helps us try to, as much as you can,

1093
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:15,882
try to build that repertoire of interesting mechanics

1094
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:17,364
and interesting games to reference.

1095
00:44:18,424 --> 00:44:18,645
Thank you.

1096
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,553
Hi, I love all the transference from Sunset Overdrive to Spider-Man.

1097
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:27,075
That seems to be like a key thing.

1098
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:30,397
Was there anything you thought players overlooked in Sunset Overdrive

1099
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,439
that you were really proud to bring back in Spider-Man

1100
00:44:32,479 --> 00:44:34,421
that maybe they didn't catch the first time around?

1101
00:44:36,122 --> 00:44:41,387
I mean, you know, we were really proud of and I guess felt like

1102
00:44:41,427 --> 00:44:43,589
Sunset Overdrive was overlooked in general.

1103
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,935
But again, a lot of it just comes, again,

1104
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,235
with just sort of the basic principles of the design

1105
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:54,436
and trying to build the diverse and different layouts

1106
00:44:54,476 --> 00:44:55,337
for the world.

1107
00:44:56,017 --> 00:44:57,417
There are a lot of other principles

1108
00:44:57,457 --> 00:44:59,017
of just trying to invoke.

1109
00:45:00,278 --> 00:45:03,678
One big thing that I was really big on with Sunset Overdrive

1110
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:05,479
was including natural elements.

1111
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:08,799
I was really big on just adding trees and waterfalls

1112
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:11,080
and anything that could anywhere we wanted.

1113
00:45:11,848 --> 00:45:16,272
And for Manhattan, I was super big on Central Park.

1114
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:20,876
I wanted Central Park to be this really beautiful, natural space.

1115
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:23,579
Because I felt like it was important that we gave players

1116
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:24,920
a break from the city.

1117
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:29,044
And so a lot of the effort that went behind making sure

1118
00:45:29,064 --> 00:45:31,326
that Central Park is actually, compared

1119
00:45:31,346 --> 00:45:33,668
to the rest of the map, a pretty massive space, even though it's

1120
00:45:33,688 --> 00:45:34,990
totally different from everything else.

1121
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,251
A lot of that comes from.

1122
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:39,777
all the desires to create natural spaces in Sunset Overdrive.

1123
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:41,699
And so I think that was a big inspiration that was brought over.

1124
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:52,229
So I thought it was really fascinating what you were showing about the burden on you specifically

1125
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:56,673
building the layout for this space, this massive space.

1126
00:45:57,093 --> 00:46:00,116
And specifically with regards to level design.

1127
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,561
What kind of division of labor came on later in the project?

1128
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:05,942
To what extent did...

1129
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:08,463
Were you able to then start breaking chunks up?

1130
00:46:08,503 --> 00:46:10,005
And when were you able to start doing that

1131
00:46:10,545 --> 00:46:15,568
from your base layout state, if you did at all?

1132
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:19,654
You mean division of labor between the design side

1133
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:20,474
and the environment side?

1134
00:46:20,855 --> 00:46:22,896
Specifically, actually, within design,

1135
00:46:22,936 --> 00:46:26,958
like did you then, once you got your core layout built,

1136
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:30,439
did you then start dividing up districts for other designers?

1137
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,061
Or was that primarily your responsibility

1138
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,282
the whole way through, and then working with environment art?

1139
00:46:35,302 --> 00:46:35,342
Or?

1140
00:46:35,802 --> 00:46:37,483
Well, that was actually the original intent,

1141
00:46:37,603 --> 00:46:40,885
was to basically try to do like a first pass

1142
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:45,007
layout for the city, first pass like designer layout,

1143
00:46:45,187 --> 00:46:45,547
and then.

1144
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:48,821
the other designers would come in and build the gameplay

1145
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:49,362
into the level.

1146
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:51,304
Unfortunately, what happened was,

1147
00:46:52,004 --> 00:46:54,086
because we found we needed to start building the level,

1148
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,988
so building the actual final art so quickly,

1149
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:59,431
and a lot of the initial gameplay ended up being

1150
00:46:59,852 --> 00:47:01,253
things more like interior spaces,

1151
00:47:01,974 --> 00:47:04,697
a lot of designers ended up having to actually

1152
00:47:04,717 --> 00:47:06,018
build spaces into final art,

1153
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:09,481
instead of being able to come back and work in the layout.

1154
00:47:11,652 --> 00:47:12,973
One thing we started doing later on

1155
00:47:13,573 --> 00:47:16,095
was a lot closer to the phase where

1156
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:18,437
we started considering bases that I think

1157
00:47:18,457 --> 00:47:21,338
would have been good to include sooner

1158
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,300
if we were to rebuild the whole city again, which

1159
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,742
I don't think we will, is to try to get people to basically just

1160
00:47:27,782 --> 00:47:28,763
build speculative space.

1161
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:31,065
We did that in a few areas where we were just like,

1162
00:47:31,545 --> 00:47:33,906
we don't know, but this is maybe a space for something cool.

1163
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:34,887
It's like an arena.

1164
00:47:35,087 --> 00:47:36,208
Put something there if you want.

1165
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:39,010
And so we built some of those, but I

1166
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,210
feel like we could have built more of them

1167
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,031
because.

1168
00:47:41,798 --> 00:47:46,080
We ended up doing things quicker on the art side

1169
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,040
than we could keep up with on the design side.

1170
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,921
Thank you.

1171
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:55,382
All right.

1172
00:47:58,563 --> 00:47:59,063
All right, everyone.

1173
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:01,003
Thanks for coming.
