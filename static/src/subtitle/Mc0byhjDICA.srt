00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:12,907
Okay, hello and welcome to this talk, How the Hell Do You Make Money on Video Games,

2
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:19,471
which is inspired by the extreme difficulty of actually selling your game here in 2021.

3
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:29,358
I was thinking about this topic because there were some 10,000 games released on Steam in 2020.

4
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:33,941
And as you can imagine, most of these games do not rise to the top.

5
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:36,518
They're not all sales blockbusters.

6
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,181
In fact, most of them, I see stories all the time

7
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:41,803
about people whose games have completely failed

8
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:42,864
in their estimation.

9
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:45,766
But I don't believe that has to be the end.

10
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:48,569
You got to make money somewhere.

11
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:52,132
There are a lot of avenues other than sales direct

12
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,973
to consumer that you can make money with

13
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,596
either during production or afterward.

14
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:57,376
And so.

15
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:04,292
That's based on my experience. Hello, I'm Brandon Sheffield of Necrosoft Games. We have put out

16
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:09,697
three games and every single one of them has been funded multiple times by completely different

17
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:15,283
entities and each time we incrementally improved the game with each release.

18
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:18,046
And none of them have been huge sales successes,

19
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:19,027
I'm willing to admit that,

20
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:21,568
but they have all contributed to the company

21
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:22,929
continuing to go along.

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,411
We've always been able to do our own original IP

23
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:31,034
and we continue to exist and continue to make new games.

24
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:35,757
And I'm not the only person with this experience.

25
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,719
So that's why this panel is assembled.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,941
So in general, we're gonna be talking about

27
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,280
the types of money, things you can get from different types of platforms, publishers,

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,321
crowdfunding, whatever other stuff to fund development for your games or also to make

29
00:01:55,381 --> 00:02:02,143
money once the game is already released, independent of selling it to consumers.

30
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:08,924
Without further ado, I would like to introduce everybody else that is on this panel, or rather

31
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:09,904
have them introduce.

32
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:15,666
themselves. Just a brief re-intro of myself. I'm Brandon Sheffield, Creative Director of

33
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:25,316
Microsoft Games, and we have never made more money on sales than we have selling to platforms,

34
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:32,264
and that's where we're coming from. So let us have everyone introduce themselves. Let's start with

35
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:32,644
Justin.

36
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:35,054
Yeah, my name is Justin Woodward.

37
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:38,222
I'm the co-founder and creative director of Interrobang Entertainment

38
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:41,088
independent game development team and as well as.

39
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:48,628
the co-founder of The Mix, the media indie exchange, a platform used to to get visibility

40
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:57,074
and partnerships for game developers around the world. I'm also one of the lead advisors on the

41
00:02:57,114 --> 00:03:02,557
Humble Black Game Developer Fund, so I helped select titles and get prototype funding for

42
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:08,682
black game developers. Great, and let's next talk to Ava.

43
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:16,476
Hi, my name is Eva Carr. I'm the founder and CEO at Glitch, focused primarily on designing systems and also strategy.

44
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:24,439
A lot of my work is really around, you know, forming deep connections through play and also building a better and more inclusive creative economy.

45
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:32,601
I think for this talk, I've probably tried every single source or type of funding, except for taking out a loan.

46
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,662
So I'm excited for the conversation.

47
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:38,963
I'm really focused on co-creating what I would consider the future of play.

48
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:47,015
through $100,000 to $250,000 equity checks through Moonrise and also $10k grants through

49
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:52,703
the Galaxy Fund for prototypes for people who are really making games that

50
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:53,885
are doing something a little different.

51
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:58,789
I'm trying to think some of the other stuff that you may have seen before.

52
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,873
Before last year, when we had started Moonrise and Galaxy, we shipped HyperDot in partnership

53
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:10,717
with Charles McGregor of Tribe Games, focused on player insights, mostly usability, progression,

54
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:17,182
things like information architecture, plus business development. And you may have seen

55
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:20,945
that HyperDot was recognized for its innovation and accessibility through the Game Awards.

56
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,393
and we're really proud of it, played over by, you know, a half a million people worldwide.

57
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:32,816
We like to think that we made good money and also made history, which we think is pretty dope.

58
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:37,239
Some other projects you may have seen around the internet that I worked on, Game Dev Salaries. It's

59
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,122
an open data project. I really love the idea of open data with nearly a thousand entries worldwide.

60
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:46,264
The goal is really to, like, help people get paid what they really deserve,

61
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:49,746
and I'm excited to be here with y'all. Thank you.

62
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,311
Mike, let's have you go next.

63
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,412
Hey, everyone. My name is Mike Tucker.

64
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:58,454
I'm an independent developer based in the south of England.

65
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:02,395
I've been doing this for 13 years, but formed Bitmap Bureau,

66
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,976
our latest studio, about five years ago now.

67
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:09,378
And our first game was H8 Heroes, which was a traditional

68
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:12,479
Steam title, really, but we also bought it physically

69
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,620
to the Switch and PlayStation 4 as well.

70
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,542
But since then, we've gone on to create Xenocrisis, which was kickstarted

71
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:27,677
a couple of years ago, and we've produced retro versions of that game for the Mega Drive or

72
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:34,122
Genesis if you prefer, Dreamcast and Neo Geo. But we've also pushed the other physical aspects as

73
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:39,707
well, so we have like a vinyl soundtrack and the CD soundtrack, t-shirts and so on. And yeah,

74
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:44,271
we're getting more and more into physical now, and we've realized that there's still a, well,

75
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,353
there's a growing demand for it, it seems, over digital products.

76
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:48,354
Yeah.

77
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:50,339
Megan.

78
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,061
Hi, yeah, I'm Megan Fox.

79
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,282
I run, founded, et cetera, Glass Bottom Games.

80
00:05:57,802 --> 00:06:01,904
We are currently working on Skatebird, which you might have heard of, and previously we've

81
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:05,526
made the games Jones on Fire, Hot Tin Roof, and Spartan Fist.

82
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:11,089
Kind of like Necrosoft, we have never made much money by selling our games, but also

83
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:14,870
we've never really made much money selling our games to platforms until Skatebird.

84
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,372
Up until this point, we mostly survived on...

85
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:22,994
weird combination of grants in certain cases and work for hire.

86
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:28,996
And this one really weird contract with a games adjacent company, that whole process.

87
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:33,338
Though with Skateboard, we've since found a lot of other cool things that, you know,

88
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,219
are more in keeping with something a reasonable business would do.

89
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,220
And we've been doing this for like a decade.

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,741
I think my tenure was last month or something.

91
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:43,981
So yeah, we've been at it for a while.

92
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:45,062
Nice.

93
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:46,102
Uh, Robert.

94
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:55,038
Hello, my name is Robert Gurski. I am founder of Black Moon Design, a studio, which is three people basically.

95
00:06:56,078 --> 00:07:04,081
And we are making games since 2005. And we haven't, we've made around 100 games, and we've never

96
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:08,943
sold those directly to consumers. All our money comes from

97
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:20,001
business deals, licensing, advertising, and all different types of B2B deals.

98
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:28,747
So, yeah, for our players, the games are free, which is kind of fun for us.

99
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:31,829
And for them as well, I guess.

100
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,633
Yeah, so as you can see, there's a lot of different pathways to actually...

101
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:46,579
continuing to succeed in this business. Everybody here has been in it for a while and very few of

102
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:53,741
us have had big sales successes. So it is possible. You can do it. So we're going to start.

103
00:07:54,081 --> 00:08:02,143
We're going to start talking about grants with Ava first because I mean so just to start off

104
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:05,023
a little bit there are a lot of grants that you can get if you're in

105
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:13,851
Europe, like the EU and Canada and a lot of good grants, but in the United States, it's basically

106
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:22,599
garbage except for what Ava's doing. So yeah, get us started talking about that and let's see

107
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,860
where we get to.

108
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,272
Yeah, I feel like two of the biggest sources that we just don't simply talk about enough

109
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:33,813
in games in terms of financing is equity financing and grant financing.

110
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:39,915
I feel like grants really play a big role in our ecosystem from financing, you know,

111
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:44,577
experimental projects to leadership training. A lot of people get their first injection of

112
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:46,238
cash through grants like...

113
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:49,940
You know, I think Grace Bruxner with Frog Detective,

114
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,281
like literally so many people who are,

115
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:55,143
especially in Canada through, you know,

116
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:57,545
the Canada Media Fund or Australia

117
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:00,147
through Film Victoria or Europe.

118
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:03,269
I don't even, well, like the UK, I suppose, with Yuki.

119
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:11,015
But to be considered a grant, I really think that, you know, funding is oftentimes non-recoupable

120
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:16,941
and is or charitable or matching dollars don't need to really be repaid or anything of sorts.

121
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:25,249
So I, like we started our whole entire journey with starting with grants. I got my first grant

122
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:29,473
at 19 with 50k and then it just kept going from there each year.

123
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:35,214
And I think that it's really important to be able to find,

124
00:09:35,294 --> 00:09:39,776
not only find grants, but also apply for them, get them.

125
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:43,257
And that's usually oftentimes a lot of studios

126
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,877
get their first kind of injection of capital there.

127
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:47,918
How do you find them?

128
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:51,429
Um, that is a good question.

129
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,049
Uh, it depends on where you're at.

130
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:59,413
I actually, so Brendan, you had asked for, um, you'd asked for some metrics and, uh, I

131
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:03,115
actually have a lot of these stored cause we love insights over a glitch.

132
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:10,859
Um, so I, there's a bunch of them that actually, um, are based in different areas.

133
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,022
So I'm just going to focus on the U S for now, because it's the saddest one of all of them.

134
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:25,188
So really grants are actually very rare in North America, specifically in the U.S., not so much in Canada.

135
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:35,294
But if you take a look at, for example, where I'm at and where I'm based, Minnesota actually has the highest grant budget per capita in the U.S.

136
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:38,337
due to a lot of the specific trust that we currently have.

137
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,341
Right now it's like $6 per capita

138
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:43,544
compared to the national average from, you know,

139
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:46,328
say organizations like the National Endowment of the Arts

140
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:48,130
or National Endowment of the Sciences

141
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,393
or whatever that is at like 50 cents.

142
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:57,797
per capita. Folks over in Canada, Australia, Europe have it better. When you look at orgs

143
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:04,621
like again, Canada Media Fund, Uki, Film Victoria, they all sit at actually like 25 to 35 USD

144
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:08,303
per capita. So to show you like where we're currently at.

145
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:14,669
There's different areas, so I'd say like arts organizations are one of them and oftentimes

146
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:19,754
those are actually funded by the NEA, which is the National Endowment of the Arts, and then there's

147
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:23,618
a whole segment of people who receive funding from say,

148
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:28,323
foundations and foundations have very like specific things that they focus on.

149
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:35,070
But for example, I am currently, I currently have like a two-year grant for

150
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,812
a leadership grant and that's through a foundation.

151
00:11:39,674 --> 00:11:54,515
So depending on what you're looking for, what type of project you have, whether it's a game or just focused on you as developing as an artist, or you developing as a leader, whatever that is, there's most likely a grant for them, but look for local arts organizations.

152
00:11:54,895 --> 00:12:02,422
look for foundations that are doing some really cool things in this space, and be in a state that

153
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:10,168
cares because not very many states do. I think there's really only like the most grant dollars

154
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,070
in the United States really are either in Minnesota or New York City.

155
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:18,132
What I just to jump in to, I think that a lot of it's networking.

156
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:19,833
Like, yeah, you got it.

157
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,435
You have to know other people who know about the grants,

158
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,937
especially in the United States, like the CMF is very much,

159
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:28,899
you know, prevalent or the Victoria.

160
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,361
Is it Victoria, Victoria?

161
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,062
Like they have a film. Yeah.

162
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:34,863
Yeah. Film Victoria has one.

163
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:36,865
I received a few grants.

164
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:40,947
I received one from, you know, the covid fund from PlayStation.

165
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:43,329
I've also received one from the Chamber of.

166
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:50,993
of commerce for their diversity funds.

167
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,495
This is all COVID and also...

168
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:57,556
Yeah, but you're in California.

169
00:12:57,616 --> 00:13:00,758
So that's like, just to give people some hope

170
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:04,700
that occasionally you can get some money

171
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,820
regardless of where you are.

172
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:09,232
Yeah, yeah, you just have to, and yeah, California is tough.

173
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:12,997
You got, you just have to hustle it and like figure out where things are.

174
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:17,643
And some folks in the industry have told, like, kind of put me up on game as to

175
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:19,685
where to sign up for these funds.

176
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:21,267
And they're very, very timely.

177
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:25,849
the Black Chamber of Commerce fund came from California.

178
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:29,011
That was in Alameda County up in, you know, in the Bay Area.

179
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:34,114
And if I didn't know that within 10 days, this fund would have been depleted,

180
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:35,274
I wouldn't have known.

181
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:39,997
So one of my friends who owns a sound studio down for me

182
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,238
and is like a really good friend was like.

183
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:47,820
Apply now, apply now, but I wouldn't know that unless I had this connection or also the PlayStation Fund.

184
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,621
Luckily, I'm connected with some of the BizDev folks there, and they kind of told me,

185
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:59,243
hey, you should apply within this given time. But I would say in the States, that's one of the big

186
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:05,064
things. Of course, look for them, but also help other people out. If you see one that's for Asian

187
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:11,005
Americans or indigenous Native Americans, tell the people that you know, because it'll just

188
00:14:11,913 --> 00:14:19,519
reciprocate. Yeah, and I think we can, we might be able to have like some resource guide by the time

189
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:24,843
you're all looking at this so that you can see some of the stuff we're talking about. But like

190
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:31,749
Justin said, a lot of this stuff comes up real fast and goes away real fast and there is some,

191
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:37,994
certainly some hustling involved. I wanted to talk, Justin, more about some of the ways that you've

192
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:39,035
tried to get

193
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:44,773
production money because you've done some interesting things and some interesting partnerships

194
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:47,295
that are very hustle oriented, I would say.

195
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:51,997
So like I'm always looking for opportunities because I'm like, I'm a super hustler.

196
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:59,141
So I'm trying to figure out any ways to flip in a, you know, in a way that's like beneficial

197
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,402
to everybody, right?

198
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:05,185
Like I just want to make cool stuff and cool games and help other people make cool stuff.

199
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,685
So I try to figure that out.

200
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:14,629
So I've done, you know, I've done kickstarters before I used to, uh, I was at double fine for a few years.

201
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:21,192
And when fig spun out of double fine, I was the curator, uh, and I helped them with publishing.

202
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:27,916
Um, and I ended up funding my Jan's on a Bob game through fig while I was working at fig.

203
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:34,219
So when I was working at fig, all of my money that I got from being a consultant went back into my games.

204
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,039
Like I didn't really.

205
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:36,563
You know what I mean?

206
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:37,764
Use that money.

207
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,785
I didn't, I wasn't like balling off of that, right?

208
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,307
And I'm trying to think of other ways like.

209
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:46,650
Talk about that chocolate shop partnership.

210
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,131
I was fascinated by that.

211
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:50,633
What?

212
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,835
You tried to, back in the days,

213
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:57,478
you tried to partner with like a chocolate company

214
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,159
for like in-game advertising stuff.

215
00:15:59,179 --> 00:15:59,639
Wasn't that right?

216
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:06,209
I tried to try, you know, cream, the ice cream, they have in Berkeley, there's

217
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,232
an ice cream, uh, cookie ice cream company.

218
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:14,116
So I went over there to do some, this is so ridiculous for super combo, man.

219
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:18,620
I was trying to find any way to make money or to fund our project.

220
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,843
So I went over there and I pitched to them, Hey, this character could be

221
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:25,246
your, you know, uh, he eats cookies in the game.

222
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:26,247
He loves cookies.

223
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,909
He's got a little gut and like, it would be perfect.

224
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:34,947
Um, and so like I went over to the storefront, I talked to the owner and I

225
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:40,411
said, Hey, how about we like package a key of our game or demo in your, every

226
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:45,955
time you purchase a, uh, uh, ice cream cookie, um, snack or whatever.

227
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:49,878
And they were, they were down for it, but it just didn't allow me to, it didn't

228
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:53,040
make sense, but I figured out other ways to do that later on.

229
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,924
I was in the IGN in the open house, uh, which was a, um,

230
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:02,080
an accelerator that GameSpy started.

231
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,183
And when I was there, they really liked what we were doing

232
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:07,825
because we had like the game has like very fluid animations,

233
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:08,746
very colorful.

234
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,567
And at that time they were trying to figure,

235
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:11,708
they are owned by Fox.

236
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,210
So they were trying to figure out ways to get into

237
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,013
indie game development and in-game advertising

238
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:18,914
and that type of thing.

239
00:17:19,014 --> 00:17:24,378
So I like hustled away to like get them to put production

240
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:29,069
engineers on super combo man to build out the features that I wanted.

241
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:30,053
And that was like.

242
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:34,289
That was probably like $100,000 worth of engineering help.

243
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:38,132
They helped me set up my pipeline for development when I was,

244
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:41,274
because I'm not an engineer, I'm an artist and a producer

245
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:44,376
and, you know, a director creatively.

246
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,238
So like I didn't understand all the pipelines for like,

247
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:50,320
let's say, get source tree, those type of things.

248
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,462
But since production is my background, that was very important to me.

249
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:57,485
They helped me set up the whole foundation for the pipeline for our team.

250
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:01,486
And then I was able to kind of lock that out and build upon that.

251
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:07,007
And they put a lot of man hours on our game, which was it's not dollars,

252
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,548
dollars, but it was something that I couldn't afford at the time.

253
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:13,869
Yeah. And when you did I mean, you're still doing Jay and Silent Bob.

254
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:19,050
Was that a license that came with money or a license you had to approach?

255
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,692
Or how did like how have you leveraged that into additional visibility and success?

256
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:30,328
That was very serendipitous in that when I was at IGN, I spent very long hours and I

257
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,109
really got to know everything to me.

258
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:33,570
Everything is, is networking.

259
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,872
I believe if you're a good, you know, if you're a good person and you're helping other people.

260
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:37,933
So.

261
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:43,709
When I was at IGN, IGN had this thing called IPL, which was their pro league.

262
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:49,854
And they had, you know, they threw tournaments. I got, I was working there all the time. So I got

263
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:54,638
to meet all and become friends with all the video producers. And then when they broke off,

264
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:59,783
I was still friends with them. And one of the video producers was working at WB. And he said,

265
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:04,047
I have this friend who wants to make an indie game, which was Trevor Furman. He's friends

266
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:04,828
with Kevin Smith.

267
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:10,431
And so he was like, he asked Kevin years ago, can I use your IP for a game?

268
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:13,312
And so then we, we connected and he's out here in Berkeley.

269
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:14,613
We just hit it off.

270
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:17,014
And, and we talked about it.

271
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:19,775
We, I started creating design documents for the game, what I

272
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:20,756
thought would be really cool.

273
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,157
And then Kevin hit us up.

274
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:27,340
And he the funny thing about that was it was not a licensing,

275
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,481
licensing type of situation.

276
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,462
And I've dealt with those.

277
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:33,224
But it was more like a handshake thing.

278
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:35,886
In matter of fact, when we went to Kevin Smith's house

279
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:38,368
and I was with Justin from

280
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,232
from Fig at the time, he's like Kevin's like, don't fuck this up.

281
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:47,254
Like, I don't know if I could curse my bad and get that out.

282
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:48,795
But I think it's I think it's a lot.

283
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,842
Yeah, he said, he said, Don't fuck this up. Don't talk business. You got it. You could,

284
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:58,425
we can do it for this small percentage. And we're good. We just want you to be creative

285
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:03,648
and to utilize this in a game. And it was a handshake. And then we did all the paperwork,

286
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:09,892
but it was a very serendipitous, easy thing to do. So it wasn't like, and I'm never going to do

287
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:13,314
personally, I'm never going to do a cash in, you know, like this isn't like,

288
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:18,137
I'm not just trying to make money. I want to do something cool. I believe in the ViewSKU universe

289
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:24,600
and all that stuff. But yeah, I stack stuff. I tell developers to stack stuff. So I'll say,

290
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,864
I know Mike, you work with Adult Swim Games. When I was working on Super Combo Man, I was struggling.

291
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:34,086
I did the cookie thing. I was working with IGN. I was trying to figure out ways to fund our game.

292
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:34,946
I didn't know how to do it.

293
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:38,468
Like Adult Swim said no, all the publishers said no.

294
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:41,690
I just kept making the game and getting like a bunch of,

295
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,871
you know, press around the game.

296
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:45,832
I did a Kickstarter.

297
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:48,733
The Kickstarter was, you know, successful.

298
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:50,054
I took that Kickstarter.

299
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:53,396
I hit back every publisher that I talked to previously.

300
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:55,316
They're, oh, you got a successful Kickstarter?

301
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:56,457
Hell yeah, we'll jump in.

302
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,638
Oh yeah, I showed, oh, we got Adult Swim.

303
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:01,759
Hey, investor, we got Adult Swim games.

304
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,099
They put in 40 grand.

305
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,520
Oh, I got an investor and Adult Swim

306
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,560
and look at the articles.

307
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,621
Then I was able to leverage that and just stack.

308
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:11,681
And then now, since I'm like,

309
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:13,262
you know, we have all this coverage

310
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:15,983
and that's what I did with Chronic Blunt Punch

311
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:17,283
and I don't want to steal any more time.

312
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,984
No, it's like, ultimately it's,

313
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:24,125
I think it's really important to talk about how

314
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:30,835
Like the hustling is really like it's something you got to actively do.

315
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:36,658
And, and that's one of the hardest things with this is that, you know, people put

316
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:40,260
out games and they're like the game didn't do well, there's nothing else I can do.

317
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:47,204
But you, you have to have someone on your team who is dedicating some of their

318
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:49,405
time to doing this kind of hustling.

319
00:21:49,546 --> 00:21:53,408
If like, unless you have some kind of crazy breakout hit there's like.

320
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:58,287
It's a lot of work, and I think that that's the main,

321
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,848
like one of the important things that I take away

322
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,649
from what you're saying, Justin, is like,

323
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:07,791
it's not just, you can't just apply for some grants

324
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,192
and then like hope that it happens.

325
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:10,292
You gotta be applying to grants

326
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:13,134
and like talking to all your friends and find,

327
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:16,996
like for me, we got a publishing deal recently

328
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:20,397
to bring a console version of one of our games out.

329
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:24,179
And in order to do that, I looked at a list

330
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:24,499
of

331
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:26,822
350 publishers.

332
00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:28,684
I went down that entire list,

333
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:31,866
checked are any of these applicable to what we're doing.

334
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:36,128
I mailed, I put together like a press kit, essentially,

335
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,610
or like a pitch kit that would hopefully

336
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,951
answer all their questions in advance.

337
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:42,372
I mailed it to 40 publishers.

338
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:44,554
Three of them got back,

339
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,296
and one of them signed a deal with us.

340
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:51,398
And like, you just have to be able to do that.

341
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,400
Like, because...

342
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,650
Your game may not sell.

343
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,731
So you have to be able to do...

344
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,252
Can I add one thing to this real quick?

345
00:22:59,292 --> 00:22:59,412
Sure.

346
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:04,675
Last, like, so I'll just tell you from this call, when I jumped in the call

347
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:08,156
immediately, how can I connect someone with someone?

348
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:11,638
How can I help that person or how, how, what do they connect them?

349
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:14,219
So I, Ava was talking about all of her stuff.

350
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,881
My, my brain is firing, you know what I mean?

351
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:17,081
Like.

352
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,862
Oh my god, Mike is in here. I wanted to talk to Mike for so long.

353
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:22,923
You know, we met seven years ago.

354
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:25,925
Everyone's yeah. Yeah. Megan's a super hustler.

355
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:29,427
I see her like on all the shows and like she's always hitting people.

356
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:34,090
Anyway, I just thought I was like any situation my brain is firing.

357
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,872
How can I help this person? How can I? How can how can I?

358
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:38,833
How can we help each other? Really? Exactly.

359
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:43,115
Because it's a lot of time when we talk about networking, it winds up being like.

360
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:47,333
It's not like networking isn't actually a slimy thing

361
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:48,913
unless you're a slimy person.

362
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:51,914
Like it's ultimately just like how,

363
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:54,175
you know, when I was doing my 300,

364
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:56,896
going through my 300 publisher list,

365
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:59,136
I told other people that didn't know that that list existed.

366
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:03,658
And I was also like, oh, these people came back to me about,

367
00:24:04,418 --> 00:24:05,258
you know, with a no,

368
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,659
but they told me this other thing that they're interested in

369
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,419
which is more along the lines

370
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:10,720
of what you, my friend are doing.

371
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,020
So like, you gotta be.

372
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:15,647
paying it forward as well as absorbing it.

373
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,648
But I want to talk more about licensing stuff

374
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:23,190
because Robert, you've got really, I would say,

375
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,131
unique experience in that compared

376
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:27,552
to most traditional game developers

377
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:31,213
because you're making games for dumb phones,

378
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:33,774
like old brick phones.

379
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:37,316
You're making, the web game market is still there.

380
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,727
Tell me about what you're doing.

381
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:46,470
I would say like my story is not unique. I would say it's very,

382
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:53,734
it was very common back in 2007-8. Everybody was doing flash games and

383
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:58,136
publishing them somewhere on web, on some portals, anywhere.

384
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:05,119
And we basically, we tried to go out of it because we

385
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,160
started as a flash game.

386
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:19,178
developers tried to follow the herd and do the Steam PC huge game that will bring us

387
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,060
money and fame and everybody will love it.

388
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,623
And it didn't work out, surprisingly.

389
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:32,808
And yeah, and we basically went back to doing small, silly web games.

390
00:25:34,043 --> 00:25:35,924
that people still love to play.

391
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:40,247
It's and there's

392
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:41,888
there are a lot of places where

393
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:46,150
there's demand for small,

394
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,712
silly games that can just

395
00:25:49,192 --> 00:25:50,953
be played anywhere on anything.

396
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:53,575
And what does that market

397
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:54,696
look like right now?

398
00:25:54,716 --> 00:25:57,277
And because you're you're looking

399
00:25:57,357 --> 00:26:00,379
at increasingly shrinking markets,

400
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,940
but they're expanding maybe in other

401
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,961
countries or.

402
00:26:03,654 --> 00:26:07,155
the platforms are forgotten and so there's not as much competition.

403
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:17,979
Yes, there's like a lot we are doing with games for developing countries, like the whole Africa,

404
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:28,863
India, like a lot of countries where access to very new devices like top-of-the-shelf iPhones is

405
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:29,423
not really...

406
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:36,098
possible. So people are playing on what they have basically, which are basically lower end devices.

407
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:45,306
And they can't play new games because demands, technical requirements are too much.

408
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:57,395
So yeah, we try to be there and offer them our games, which are playable on such devices.

409
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:58,717
And how do you wind up?

410
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:04,813
partnering with licenses and what does revenue actually look like for you?

411
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,755
Because you're not making money on individual sales.

412
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:09,497
You're doing these kind of bulk deals.

413
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:16,582
In most cases, we find channels, portals, some kind of like places where

414
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:26,089
the owner of those places, of those portals, of those like carrier

415
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:35,394
stores and such, would like some content for their users. They have a lot of users and there's

416
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:42,596
no content for them. They ask us to deliver the games and we know that advertising is not really

417
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:52,639
an option because in most of those countries the rates for advertising is not really high.

418
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,480
So we engage in deals that

419
00:27:57,345 --> 00:28:04,988
basically we get some fixed amount of money just because we publish the title on this specific

420
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:13,991
platform and for users of this platform the game is free and usually the portal owner or the

421
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:20,934
platform owner earns money on web traffic. Usually those are like in most cases right now

422
00:28:21,774 --> 00:28:26,036
we deal with carrier operators so they charge users for data.

423
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:33,041
and the game itself is free after you download it or...

424
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:39,143
Right. So you get kind of small, kind of minimum guarantee buyouts,

425
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:42,143
or maybe large ones, I don't know.

426
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:52,966
It's, they're mostly, we work on scale, so we have a lot of games and the fees are not high.

427
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:57,436
Uh, but it's like not even current minimum guarantee.

428
00:28:57,476 --> 00:29:01,279
It's like, so we get this money and that's it.

429
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,983
It's we don't, there's, there's no more revenue coming, uh, coming in.

430
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:11,368
So, uh, so yeah, so we, we have to make new games and, and, and publish them.

431
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:11,928
Yeah.

432
00:29:12,128 --> 00:29:14,330
So you're making games, just grinding them out real fast.

433
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:15,271
Uh,

434
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:17,128
Okay.

435
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:22,052
As far as licensing is concerned, I've been working with Viacom and some other companies recently.

436
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:28,097
And what's interesting is that I'm hitting console and the PC market and retro.

437
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:33,582
And what's really interesting and fascinating about that is they have these large companies doing their AAA releases.

438
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:37,704
So for the smaller releases, they're willing to work with you on minimum guarantees.

439
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,204
And so they're not exuberant.

440
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:44,346
They understand and their licensing teams understand kind of the indie

441
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:46,567
struggle and not struggle hustle.

442
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,908
I don't want to say struggle.

443
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:50,509
Yeah, it's just it's both.

444
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:56,971
They're intertwined sometimes, but they their teams want to do creative stuff.

445
00:29:57,052 --> 00:30:01,733
They don't always want to do like these big games and like deal with all of the.

446
00:30:02,646 --> 00:30:06,772
uh you know walls that they have to break down in order to make those deals work so they're willing

447
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:13,360
to work with you on that as far as long as it's not you're not competing with their direct you

448
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,929
know huge large licensing deals that they're doing with you know triple-a companies um

449
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:25,344
So if you, if you like kind of hit those blue waters with something that's maybe more obscure,

450
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:30,567
but has its own fan base, that's kind of what I'm going after. Because like, just working with on

451
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:35,909
the Kevin Smith, Chance on Bob stuff, like I'm not looking to be a multi multi, I mean, I would

452
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,591
love it. I'm not looking to be a super multimillionaire, but I know it has a built in fan

453
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:45,494
base. So I could build upon that if I have like from our mall brawl cartridge that we released

454
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:46,575
with limited run games.

455
00:30:47,255 --> 00:30:51,738
I have the data, now I can go and take that to investors

456
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:54,400
and other people and other publishers.

457
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,701
And again, I'm stacking it.

458
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,242
It's like, look, this made a million dollars,

459
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:59,123
this grossed a million dollars

460
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:00,524
just for this particular game.

461
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,386
Like this is what I could do if I had more,

462
00:31:04,226 --> 00:31:06,127
you know, more things to work with.

463
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:09,189
And on the, you know, on the scale of things

464
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,432
and building like for our game, Gun House,

465
00:31:13,032 --> 00:31:16,154
we have gotten five different.

466
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:24,958
funding partners for that and each time we made the game incrementally better and so we were able

467
00:31:24,998 --> 00:31:33,221
to like we could essentially sell it to a company for even a small amount of money like 10,000 bucks

468
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:40,384
or whatever as we will give you uh like this new feature and it's a feature that we want to finish

469
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:46,087
anyway and so each like each time we get the game a little better and a little better with these

470
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:46,547
small

471
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:53,436
tiny buyouts and then by the time we've done all those buyouts now we have a game that is much more

472
00:31:53,496 --> 00:32:00,539
console worthy than before on the backs of these small buyouts and that's something else you can

473
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:07,242
kind of do. I wanted to talk a little bit about crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is pretty, you know,

474
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:11,964
there are whole conversations we can have about that but I'm particularly interested in

475
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,512
using crowdfunding to fuel further success.

476
00:32:19,112 --> 00:32:21,413
I know that Justin's talked about it a little bit.

477
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:26,297
Let's hear, Megan, you've done some pretty good work

478
00:32:26,357 --> 00:32:32,841
leveraging SkateBird into some pretty serious,

479
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:35,823
into a really good space even before release.

480
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,685
Yeah, so it kind of all started with the,

481
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,887
like SkateBird, whenever I build a project,

482
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:42,327
I tend to build.

483
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,574
three different versions in my head.

484
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:48,276
There's the one that if it goes nowhere

485
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:49,656
and I just have to kick it out unfinished,

486
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:51,637
there's the one if it does moderately well,

487
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:54,399
and then there's that moonshot,

488
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,460
I guess it could get this big if I needed to.

489
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,841
And so what I did was I announced Skatebird

490
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:01,122
with the minimum viable product

491
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:02,843
looking as good as it could look,

492
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:04,524
and it started to get traction.

493
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,465
So then I did a Kickstarter,

494
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,986
which was the following six months later,

495
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:10,046
which happened to be around E3.

496
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:12,888
Kickstarter snowballed.

497
00:33:13,088 --> 00:33:15,569
Oh, and before the Kickstarter, we are actually in talks with

498
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:16,969
Humble amongst other people.

499
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,250
They said, no, we were, we were okay.

500
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,911
We moved on to the Kickstarter and the Kickstarter leveraged, uh, it was

501
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:26,971
a not Kentucky fried gaming show.

502
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:32,113
It was, uh, I don't know, one of the, one of the not E3 conferences in

503
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:33,433
2019 that started springing up.

504
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:37,594
It was like E3 in the van across the street kind of thing, but it worked.

505
00:33:37,654 --> 00:33:38,054
It was fun.

506
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,694
And that got huge really fast.

507
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:45,896
The Kickstarter went to 3X overfund, just did really well.

508
00:33:47,117 --> 00:33:49,138
That got the interest of Xbox.

509
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:52,560
And we were able to sign a Game Pass deal within a month.

510
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,541
I'd been kind of priming that for a while

511
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:55,682
and hoping I could get something.

512
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,463
And then after everything broke,

513
00:33:57,483 --> 00:33:59,164
it's like, oh, hey, you want this?

514
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:01,565
And then Humble comes back and says something like,

515
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:03,446
you know, there's more chips in your court now.

516
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:05,087
Oh, it's like, thanks.

517
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:08,989
Yeah, boat already kind of sailed on that one, sorry.

518
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:12,745
But still, like Justin was talking about,

519
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,706
that kind of stacking of possibilities and properties,

520
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,787
things that you could come back to later

521
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,187
ends up being really useful.

522
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:21,928
Like maybe we go with Humble for a next game or whatever.

523
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:22,828
Now we have a hot lead there.

524
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,948
That'll make that a lot easier.

525
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:28,109
Xbox will probably make connections on future games

526
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:32,290
a lot easier because of, oh, and the Kickstarter

527
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,151
and the E3 and all of that then led to the Enough Interest

528
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,612
that that December, I think it was,

529
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:39,172
was the first...

530
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:42,678
video game show, video game awards

531
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,260
that had the game festival concept

532
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,041
that Jeff put together and Jeff Keighley.

533
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:52,044
And we were one of the 13 games that they chose to tap

534
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:54,325
to be in the first ever giant steam festival.

535
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:57,727
And that made our numbers go ridiculously vertical.

536
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:01,109
And then that again, primed future things.

537
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:02,430
So yeah, the Kickstarter,

538
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:04,992
we like to run all of our games

539
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:06,353
with a Kickstarter at this point,

540
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:07,413
just because it creates a.

541
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:12,036
community nexus. Once you've got some kind of community built around something, you've got

542
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:16,177
something to build off of. You've got directions you can go. And again, like Justin was saying,

543
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:20,359
once you have the core, you can then take that to people and say, look, this is getting pretty

544
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:24,661
good trust among this small audience. If you would just give us an introduction or access to your

545
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:29,483
larger audience or larger funding or et cetera, we can grow this at scales, et cetera. I really

546
00:35:29,523 --> 00:35:34,344
like building from that. And then also working from a Kickstarter means that I'm controlling

547
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:34,805
my audience.

548
00:35:35,336 --> 00:35:38,777
and I'm growing an audience around my studio or me or my games.

549
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:44,378
If you go with a publisher like Devolver is great, but whenever it becomes

550
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:45,158
a devolver game.

551
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:47,239
Yeah, it's not like your game anymore.

552
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:49,120
So they pay well, they're easy to work with.

553
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,460
But you don't like come out of that with that audience.

554
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,501
You like to get a tiny share of the devolver audience, maybe.

555
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:56,741
But really, it's their game.

556
00:35:57,182 --> 00:35:58,202
Where's the Kickstarter approach?

557
00:35:58,642 --> 00:36:01,983
Less money, but over time you can grow something large out of that.

558
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,668
And Mike, I'm curious to hear about your experience,

559
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:10,031
because Xeno Crisis had, and you've also

560
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:12,913
done Battle Axe since then, I would

561
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:16,935
say more of a modest Kickstarter success, which

562
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:21,539
then you were able to turn into a lot of physical release

563
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,761
success, but across more platforms

564
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,402
than most people would consider.

565
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:28,944
Yeah, it's a bit crazy, really.

566
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:30,745
And I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.

567
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:30,965
But.

568
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:35,437
For us, it's meant a different stream of revenue

569
00:36:35,617 --> 00:36:39,039
other than just Steam and the eShop and so on.

570
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,781
But yeah, Kickstarter worked really well for us.

571
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:43,042
It was our first Kickstarter,

572
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:44,823
so we had to do a bit of research

573
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:48,225
and just see what elements needed on the page and so on.

574
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:51,347
We didn't really release it to much fanfare,

575
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:54,108
but I think because we were producing a Genesis game,

576
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:57,150
that generated quite a bit of excitement straight away.

577
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,773
So yeah, we, like Megan, we were three times

578
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:07,503
funded. So that was great. And even beyond Kickstarter, you know, you can start an Indiegogo

579
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:12,025
page after that. And then you can set up a BackerKit page so you can still make, you know,

580
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:18,047
keep the revenue stream coming in. And then after that, we opened our own online store as well.

581
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:23,088
And yeah, we've pretty much exploited every physical aspect we could. We found that,

582
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:26,569
yeah, there's a growing demand for physical, it seems, especially with

583
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,422
certain storefronts closing and certain consoles now not being supported.

584
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:35,263
Yeah, I think the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Vita are both on the brink of

585
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:38,164
closing down. So, yeah.

586
00:37:39,104 --> 00:37:41,645
Yeah, we we've got I don't think it's a bit dark here now.

587
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:44,126
Yeah, we've got the Switch version.

588
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:49,127
Dreamcast recently did a deal for the Vita version with EastAsiasoft.

589
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:49,888
They're great guys.

590
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:53,029
There's the Evercade version, which.

591
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:54,629
All right. Yeah.

592
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,859
which is essentially a Mega Drive version.

593
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,860
Yeah, we got our own Mega Drive version.

594
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,821
We got the Neo Geo.

595
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:04,342
Backed that up, that's amazing.

596
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,982
And we got the vinyl as well.

597
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:07,043
Nice.

598
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,623
And a t-shirt.

599
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:11,264
So yeah, we really went for it.

600
00:38:11,404 --> 00:38:14,645
And yeah, I think people just love having

601
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:17,026
cool games on the shelves, you know.

602
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:25,158
Do you have some maybe breakdown of, even just generally, of digital sales? Because it did come

603
00:38:25,218 --> 00:38:30,501
out on the regular game consoles versus physical sales in terms of how that did for you?

604
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:37,404
I think if you talk to any indie developer these days, it's all about Switch, really.

605
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,726
The Switch just has such a following now, and...

606
00:38:42,622 --> 00:38:44,723
Yeah, we did a deal for the physical Switch version,

607
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:47,125
which was strictly limited, which sold out right away.

608
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:48,846
So that was a real nice bonus for us.

609
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:52,407
As for metrics, I can't go into too much detail,

610
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:55,129
but yeah, I would say Switch is the big one, really.

611
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,930
Steam kind of disappointed,

612
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,452
but we did get a Game Pass deal with Microsoft,

613
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:02,733
which was a great injection of cash,

614
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,734
which we weren't expecting.

615
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:08,196
But yeah, we continue to produce the physical Mega Drive

616
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:09,657
and Dreamcast versions.

617
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:10,977
There are a lot of work, though.

618
00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:11,558
But yeah, we have to.

619
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:19,403
to get the PCBs designed in China, and then we have to get all the plastics molded, various

620
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:25,009
things printed, we have to assemble the cartridges ourselves, deal with manufacturing, assembly,

621
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:30,415
and shipping. We had to hire a warehouse, so it's not something I'd recommend for everyone,

622
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:34,419
but it's just cool making a game for your favourite childhood console.

623
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:41,894
And straight away, you have a community there, a real hardcore community who are just really interested in whatever you're going to do in the future.

624
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:43,976
So, yeah, it's worked out well for us.

625
00:39:44,216 --> 00:40:00,945
So, yeah, I can say that for us, even though we've only done physical on PlayStation 4 and Vita and it was just for one release that in terms of like revenue from sales, I would say that physical was roughly 50 percent.

626
00:40:02,322 --> 00:40:11,390
of our total revenue despite the game being on like eight digital platforms or something like

627
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,716
that physical physical revenue from just two platforms was about 50 percent of our revenue

628
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:23,561
Justin what was your experience releasing for uh man I wish I had all my stuff let me see if I can

629
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:24,962
grab some stuff

630
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:28,184
Let me grab.

631
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:28,364
Yeah.

632
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,766
So we did, I don't have all my stuff right here.

633
00:40:30,826 --> 00:40:31,246
You know what I mean?

634
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:35,368
But yeah, we did the, the actual, the cartridge for the NES version.

635
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:36,009
Yeah.

636
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:37,069
For mall brawl.

637
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:41,452
Uh, and we actually developed, and this is the switch deluxe version, uh, version.

638
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:42,733
We work with limited run games.

639
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:46,675
But we did, we released vinyl as well, which was awesome.

640
00:40:47,515 --> 00:40:51,017
Because it was all, you know, chip tune, but that was a great experience because of the limit.

641
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,939
I like the limitations of developing in assembly.

642
00:40:53,959 --> 00:41:01,003
You know, partnering with Thomas to create that experience because we were able to develop the game in nine months.

643
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:04,425
And this was a bigger piece of our, like the chronic blunt punch.

644
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:10,291
like lore and we put it out there kind of like Curse of the Moon did, like kind of as a piece

645
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:18,517
to give away for our larger crowdfunding, you know, backers and stuff like that. But

646
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:26,022
having something physical was quite amazing and to kind of basically reflect what you said,

647
00:41:26,202 --> 00:41:31,126
Brandon, it was like that was a huge injection of money to help us.

648
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:41,378
with our studio move forward that those physical releases we so we released on switch PlayStation four or five Xbox one as an X.

649
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:50,163
And we did get some revenue in there, I think it also that's another stacking thing look we're look at what we did we created this pipeline to develop on these other things but.

650
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:54,606
The NES and the physical Switch did pretty well.

651
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:59,309
And we just released, we just did a PS4 physical release too.

652
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,450
And those were really good because of the collectors.

653
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,151
And then the game is retro.

654
00:42:03,211 --> 00:42:06,214
So like having a cart, people wanting new carts

655
00:42:07,354 --> 00:42:09,055
is pretty awesome.

656
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:11,277
So yeah.

657
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:13,979
It's an interesting, like, you know,

658
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:17,441
we're talking about post-release revenue streams now

659
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:18,041
at this point.

660
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:18,782
And it's.

661
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:26,118
It's interesting that there are multiple niches for releasing games after,

662
00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:30,603
I mean, re-releasing games after they already exist, basically.

663
00:42:31,243 --> 00:42:39,292
And, you know, like in the case of Xenocrisis with Mike there, you all have...

664
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:44,845
you know, like, is there a limit to the number of platforms that you can release? I mean, of course,

665
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:51,930
like, in terms of the power of the consoles there is, but do you see, like, an end to that, or is

666
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:58,215
this going to be a good thing going forward? And will you, like, put it on the DS or something in

667
00:42:58,255 --> 00:42:58,395
10 years?

668
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:02,774
I mean, we'd love to get it on as many platforms as possible,

669
00:43:02,795 --> 00:43:06,197
but there's only so many hours in the day and there's just two of us here.

670
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:08,639
And my colleague Matt does all the technical stuff.

671
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:09,760
You know, he's a real genius.

672
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,843
So I leave all the assembly and stuff to him. Right.

673
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:15,605
But yeah, I mean, really, it's down to resolution.

674
00:43:15,645 --> 00:43:19,328
You know, the Mega Drive version is 320 by 224 pixels,

675
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:21,569
and that ports over perfectly to Neo Geo.

676
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:25,573
But if you want to put it on the SNES, for example, that's 256 pixels wide.

677
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,214
So then the art really has to be.

678
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:33,746
redrawn quite heavily and the, yeah, the rim generation as well, that takes a hit because,

679
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:39,668
yeah, there's fewer tiles that you have to squeeze everything into. So, yeah, we could,

680
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:45,729
we've thought about Jaguar and Amiga, but, yeah, we also like to, you know, start on new projects

681
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:51,991
as well. So, yeah, it might be something that we go back to. A PlayStation 1 version could be quite

682
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:55,772
viable, but you have to be careful not to tread on Sony's toes, of course, you know, you can't just

683
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:56,012
slap.

684
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,491
PlayStation on your box or Sega on your box.

685
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:02,913
So, but yeah, with the way things,

686
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:04,874
the way we have things set up, yeah,

687
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:07,955
other platforms are definitely a possibility, yeah.

688
00:44:08,055 --> 00:44:10,676
And that's another good point because what,

689
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:13,118
like, especially if you're a small developer,

690
00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:18,100
when you are continuing development of your existing game

691
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,161
that may not be that successful,

692
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:23,282
like, not saying you all, but us, for example,

693
00:44:25,153 --> 00:44:27,254
then you're not making new games.

694
00:44:27,895 --> 00:44:31,437
And so you sort of need to almost have that

695
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:33,218
be a separate pipeline if you can.

696
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,460
In our case, we've been working more and more

697
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,762
with one programmer on our team

698
00:44:40,922 --> 00:44:42,923
becoming like the porting person.

699
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:46,746
So when we're putting stuff onto new platforms,

700
00:44:47,286 --> 00:44:49,387
we will have them do it

701
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:50,948
and have them develop the new features

702
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:51,969
and do the

703
00:44:55,008 --> 00:45:02,131
the ports and all this stuff because otherwise you wind up kind of just like cycling in one space

704
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:09,874
and you can't move forward and it can be really tempting to just stay there because it's like,

705
00:45:09,894 --> 00:45:14,276
ah, we could squeeze a little bit more money out of this, but then you can wind up getting

706
00:45:14,316 --> 00:45:21,639
into a situation like we were in earlier this year where we had three unfinished games that

707
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:22,599
we were trying to...

708
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:25,965
pitch around and figure out how to get through.

709
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:28,126
And it's like, we gotta, we gotta prioritize

710
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:30,588
and like just go in, go in one direction for a while.

711
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,429
But then we got this porting person to help out

712
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:37,291
and she's been great in terms of us being like, okay

713
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:38,532
we can just put this over there.

714
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:39,932
She can keep doing that.

715
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:43,134
It will, we'll get some revenue out of this later.

716
00:45:43,654 --> 00:45:45,335
And then we can continue making new products

717
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:45,995
at the same time.

718
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:47,876
It's a tough balance.

719
00:45:49,943 --> 00:46:02,678
I wanted to talk a bit about some more post release revenue stuff. The big obvious ones are platform buyouts for subscriptions like PlayStation Plus Xbox Game Pass at the game store.

720
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,325
All these other kinds of things we've done really small ones we've done decently large ones.

721
00:46:10,772 --> 00:46:13,374
We won't talk about whether subscriptions are healthy for the industry.

722
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:14,455
That's another conversation.

723
00:46:14,515 --> 00:46:17,897
I think they probably aren't really, but we got to get money to survive.

724
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:19,538
So let's talk about it.

725
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:25,843
Ava, do you want to talk a bit about like using platform subscription buyouts and

726
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:27,804
stuff and turning that into more success later?

727
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:31,228
Yeah, honestly, my logic around all of this is

728
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:35,651
the more the merrier and the better that you can stack revenue,

729
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:38,813
especially with like buyout revenue at the right time

730
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:44,476
or utilize some of the platforms to bring in players and or increase wishlist numbers.

731
00:46:44,996 --> 00:46:46,057
Those are all huge wins.

732
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,598
It just depends on kind of your goal.

733
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:51,320
For HyperDot, our entire strategy was actually buyouts

734
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,222
because we didn't have a pre-existing set of players

735
00:46:54,342 --> 00:46:56,163
that we knew were going to be really excited.

736
00:46:56,623 --> 00:47:04,131
quite yet about HyperDot. So we were pretty much all in on trying to figure out which ways and how

737
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:12,399
we could stack different buyouts, whether it was with Xbox or Epic, etc. So what we ended up doing

738
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,865
was really focusing on, okay, well, can we do like a timed exclusive or something of sorts with...

739
00:47:18,846 --> 00:47:24,490
Xbox, which we ended up doing. And then we followed that up with Game Pass, primarily

740
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,774
to kind of test out the waters on what it would look like to do a timed exclusive, how

741
00:47:29,814 --> 00:47:33,958
long that would be, what the players are like, how many people are actually buying the game,

742
00:47:34,078 --> 00:47:35,399
and what is the kind of uptake.

743
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:37,681
in terms of like cross promo on Steam.

744
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:39,663
And then when we entered Game Pass,

745
00:47:39,703 --> 00:47:42,645
we had really planned out that there would be essentially

746
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:46,809
like leaderboards and a couple of like online ways to play,

747
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:52,373
especially with the introduction of more levels

748
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:53,694
that people can actually design.

749
00:47:53,734 --> 00:47:57,037
So custom levels were actually entered in at that time.

750
00:47:57,257 --> 00:47:59,539
So we saw a really huge lift of players

751
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:00,700
during that time as well.

752
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:04,003
And then we ended up really thinking about like, okay,

753
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:09,587
whether it was bundles or sales or any other platform buyouts,

754
00:48:09,627 --> 00:48:10,928
what does that really look like?

755
00:48:11,028 --> 00:48:13,429
And how much are we actually selling the game for

756
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:16,811
when we're looking at the actual numbers of who is playing?

757
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:19,753
So our team is really focused on insights.

758
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:22,555
So again, on our back end, we were really tracking,

759
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:26,357
like, how many players were actually, you know,

760
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:27,958
playing the game till completion?

761
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,119
How many players were actually...

762
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,320
turning on the game and coming back to it over time.

763
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:36,762
We just wanted to know what that looked like and

764
00:48:37,022 --> 00:48:38,602
what the end of the day,

765
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,783
what we were actually selling our game for.

766
00:48:40,803 --> 00:48:43,484
Because to me, when I'm looking at buyouts,

767
00:48:43,544 --> 00:48:45,425
it's not actually development dollars,

768
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:48,366
it's cash advance sales.

769
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:52,067
What it really looks like is that you're looking at how much

770
00:48:52,107 --> 00:48:53,768
did you actually sell your game for

771
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:56,049
with the number of downloads that you actually got.

772
00:48:56,429 --> 00:48:58,590
and the amount of players that actually played your game.

773
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:03,251
So again, I think it really depends on how you want to stack

774
00:49:03,711 --> 00:49:06,412
and the goals that you have when you're stacking.

775
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:09,813
But I often say, again, like the more the merrier.

776
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:13,615
I think it's really smart if you have a couple of goals in mind and can.

777
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:15,776
talked to a bunch of different platforms.

778
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:20,038
I know we ended up on like an Amazon buyout towards the end.

779
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:23,400
And then we really talked a lot about like pricing

780
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,862
after it came out of Game Pass and even during Game Pass,

781
00:49:28,783 --> 00:49:30,624
which maybe we'll go to a little bit later

782
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:32,164
in like the bundles and sales section.

783
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:34,286
But I think it's really important

784
00:49:34,386 --> 00:49:38,167
and I think it's a really viable way to think about it.

785
00:49:38,968 --> 00:49:42,049
Yeah, I wanted to talk about a couple of numbers there

786
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:42,190
that.

787
00:49:43,015 --> 00:49:48,437
I thought of when you were talking about how many people have actually downloaded it and

788
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:48,757
whatever.

789
00:49:48,857 --> 00:49:56,621
For our game, Gun House, we've been in some bundles, which we'll get into, but because

790
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:00,783
of those bundles and because of buyouts and other things, we have had...

791
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:04,324
We don't actually know the total number of people that own the game.

792
00:50:04,444 --> 00:50:09,427
It's basically impossible for us to know how many people own it, but we know it's over

793
00:50:09,447 --> 00:50:09,787
a million.

794
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,120
Then in terms of number of people that have downloaded it,

795
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,401
it's around 250,000.

796
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:17,363
And then in terms of the number of people

797
00:50:17,383 --> 00:50:18,584
that have actually paid for it,

798
00:50:18,604 --> 00:50:20,285
that is a much smaller number.

799
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:22,167
Like paid for it individually,

800
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:23,448
that's probably in the,

801
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:24,869
I don't actually know the real number,

802
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:28,612
but it's probably in the 30, 40,000 range.

803
00:50:29,412 --> 00:50:34,896
And that was through like pushing it on every platform.

804
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:36,718
That's across like eight or nine platforms

805
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:37,939
that we were able to sell 30, 40,000.

806
00:50:39,188 --> 00:50:45,053
And then I also wanted to say like some numbers for what those buyouts can look like.

807
00:50:46,054 --> 00:50:49,457
For us, without saying specific platforms, we've had them as small as $10,000.

808
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:55,962
And that was just like from our minds, it was like, OK, it's going to take us two weeks to port this.

809
00:50:56,283 --> 00:50:57,464
We get $10,000.

810
00:50:58,064 --> 00:51:04,450
That gives us like a little like another month or something for one or two programmers.

811
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:08,249
And then we've gotten up to like $250,000 as well.

812
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:11,912
And other deals can be in the $500,000 range,

813
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:12,773
even for an indie.

814
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,674
Then when you get up into like AAA,

815
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:15,735
you're talking about millions

816
00:51:15,795 --> 00:51:19,178
and that's different sphere than we may be involved in.

817
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:22,101
But those are some of the kinds of numbers

818
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:23,702
that you can think about it

819
00:51:23,822 --> 00:51:28,006
and they can all be viable as long as it's worth it.

820
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:30,548
Like in my opinion, if you take a buyout,

821
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:32,510
it's got to pay you.

822
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:36,842
much more, at least twice as much as it will cost you

823
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:39,643
to make the thing if you're doing it in advance.

824
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,423
And if you're doing it after the fact,

825
00:51:41,863 --> 00:51:43,044
it's got to be like,

826
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,704
I've sold as much as I want to on this platform,

827
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:50,065
and now I will take whatever other money I can get from you.

828
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:55,486
Megan, did you have some things to say about this zone?

829
00:51:56,086 --> 00:51:57,706
Yeah, my take is,

830
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,807
I'm less concerned about maximizing.

831
00:52:02,305 --> 00:52:06,007
revenue, like it's important to me, but the important thing for me is to make sure that

832
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:07,248
my, uh, my ass is covered.

833
00:52:07,868 --> 00:52:12,431
So when I'm looking at backend deals, uh, platform deals, buyout deals are almost all

834
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:12,831
backend.

835
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:14,813
Some aren't though we actually got some advances too.

836
00:52:15,293 --> 00:52:20,736
I'm looking less at, well, how much is this going to, uh, go for versus my theoretical

837
00:52:20,776 --> 00:52:21,697
sales on this platform.

838
00:52:22,077 --> 00:52:25,959
I'm looking more at, okay, if I take this deal, does this mean that the game doesn't

839
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:29,802
have to sell any copies on any other platform and I'm still 2x profitable.

840
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:33,630
If I can get a deal like that, and those deals do exist,

841
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,892
I take it because, come on, it's worth it.

842
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,773
I tend to view.

843
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:43,535
So Switch aside, Switch is a special case.

844
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:46,257
Both of the remaining platforms, Sony and Xbox,

845
00:52:47,057 --> 00:52:48,958
have weird sales behavior.

846
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,400
Like depending on what end you talk to, a lot of them

847
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,281
will find that one of them sold really well, and one of them

848
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,762
sold like 10 units.

849
00:52:55,982 --> 00:52:57,043
It's not that bad, but it's.

850
00:52:57,461 --> 00:52:58,962
It's significantly terrible.

851
00:52:59,082 --> 00:52:59,582
It can be.

852
00:52:59,962 --> 00:53:01,042
So true.

853
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:01,803
Negligible.

854
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:05,124
They're like really random and hard to account for.

855
00:53:05,204 --> 00:53:10,066
So if I can find something that says I get big chunk of money and I don't have to worry

856
00:53:10,106 --> 00:53:10,366
about-

857
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:11,627
The guarantee.

858
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:12,527
Yeah, the guarantee is huge.

859
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:18,909
Now, the big problem you run into with that though is great, now you get hundreds of thousands

860
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:23,651
of dollars at launch, but you don't have any money right now since most of those are going

861
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:24,332
to be-

862
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:25,352
Posts.

863
00:53:25,392 --> 00:53:25,652
Posts.

864
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:30,009
Really? Yeah, they're post like I believe Xbox deals.

865
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:31,510
They're they're post.

866
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:36,512
And just because a game just because a deal you sign is like

867
00:53:36,832 --> 00:53:38,412
at launch date is when it pays out.

868
00:53:38,492 --> 00:53:43,294
Well, most consoles have some kind of billing that's net net 90, net 180.

869
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:44,735
It's kind of hard to tell.

870
00:53:45,075 --> 00:53:48,936
So you might not see that money until six months after lunch or after lunch.

871
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,657
Hustle that to, you know, hustle.

872
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:51,497
Yeah, I got it.

873
00:53:51,617 --> 00:53:54,198
And I'll give you my money, son.

874
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,142
You got to have a plan for how to survive, not just through launch or through pre-launch and

875
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:03,643
development, but also through that. So we ended up stacking a combination of deals that some of

876
00:54:03,683 --> 00:54:09,365
them we negotiated for half upfront, half backend. Some of them were backend. Some of them were

877
00:54:10,105 --> 00:54:14,807
other stuff that we can't actually get into. But suffice it to say, we stacked enough deals that by

878
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:20,388
launch, we were going to be between two and three X profitable no matter what, which was nice.

879
00:54:21,163 --> 00:54:24,785
And we also had just enough money to make it through to launch.

880
00:54:24,805 --> 00:54:28,408
And that actually ran out and I had to pull from savings, which is getting

881
00:54:28,448 --> 00:54:31,129
to the other point, which if you're going to try and work this strategy,

882
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:37,994
it really helps if you have some revenue, some portion of money that it doesn't

883
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:40,796
have to be money that you're meant to spend, like it can be money that you

884
00:54:40,816 --> 00:54:42,137
need to put back within a year.

885
00:54:42,337 --> 00:54:44,778
And that's okay because you've got all these guarantees that say

886
00:54:44,878 --> 00:54:45,939
it will be put back in a year.

887
00:54:46,505 --> 00:54:48,727
But if you've got at least something to draw on,

888
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:51,529
a lot of these deals become a lot more accessible.

889
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:54,351
Whereas without that, I mean, sure,

890
00:54:55,352 --> 00:54:57,493
a lot of the platforms are offering really good indie deals

891
00:54:57,593 --> 00:54:58,454
with back-end pay.

892
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:01,076
Well, how many indies can afford to develop a game

893
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:02,977
without money now?

894
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:04,798
So how accessible are they really?

895
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:06,299
And yeah.

896
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:07,220
Yeah.

897
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:10,262
We're in our last five minutes here.

898
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:14,905
So I wanna get through, kind of combine a couple things

899
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:15,926
and talk about.

900
00:55:17,174 --> 00:55:23,038
just additional, all kinds of additional places where you can get money.

901
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:33,826
A quick story that I have always enjoyed is Amanita Games, who make

902
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:37,009
Machinarium and a bunch of these high-end adventure games,

903
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:41,772
they found that in the Czech Republic it was hard for their customers to buy,

904
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,595
for older people and a lot of folks to

905
00:55:45,246 --> 00:55:47,428
to buy the game because they didn't have credit cards, they didn't have Steam.

906
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:55,534
And so they wound up partnering with like a friend who ran a series of newsstands to like print CDs

907
00:55:55,874 --> 00:56:05,022
and sell it for like two euro in like a little paper hang tag thing in a newsstand. And I love

908
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:11,927
that kind of hustling stuff. So we'll talk about bundles here as well, but I want to start with

909
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:14,129
with Robert to hear about.

910
00:56:14,878 --> 00:56:19,200
you know, some of the different kinds of platforms that you've put games on, like you put games on

911
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,802
planes, have you done cruise ships? I just want to hear about this kind of stuff and what those

912
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:35,787
deals look like a little bit. So basically I don't have a like scenario how to get to those deals,

913
00:56:35,867 --> 00:56:42,690
but yeah, like at some point in time we were asked if we would like to

914
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:51,214
partner with a company who has like those tablets installed in airplanes, but also on

915
00:56:51,254 --> 00:56:54,276
buses and trains, they do all kinds of transportation.

916
00:56:55,276 --> 00:56:56,097
And we said, yeah, sure.

917
00:56:56,197 --> 00:57:03,180
And basically there are planes flying somewhere around Europe with our games, like pre-installed

918
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,201
on those seats.

919
00:57:07,202 --> 00:57:08,222
And yeah, and people are playing them.

920
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:21,135
And they buy like in number of seats, right? Is that how they buy? Because when I was trying to talk to some cruise ships about selling games, they're like, we'll buy 20,000 units of this or whatever.

921
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:37,623
So no, we actually we, we have like a fixed amount per year, just because we license those games to be used within the system. Right. And so so I'll

922
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:44,245
Like I think everybody here said that and I'll repeat that.

923
00:57:44,265 --> 00:57:52,974
Like if you have a game and even if that game is not for everybody, there's a 100% chance

924
00:57:53,014 --> 00:57:58,079
that there's somebody out there, some platform out there that they would like your content.

925
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:06,164
yeah there's somewhere funding them and and just discussing the deal and and it will happen if

926
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:12,968
you'll put a lot of work in it it is a lot of work uh every i i believe every game will find

927
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:22,433
their audience eventually totally yeah i think go ahead uh and

928
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:26,355
like i said there is no there is no

929
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:34,078
guarantee way of achieving that. So like you can go to a lot of conferences, do a lot of like

930
00:58:34,158 --> 00:58:44,482
formal networking, go to meetings, cold mailing everybody. But in the end it just happens after

931
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:52,004
some time if you're a little bit lucky and you put a lot of work in it. That's right.

932
00:58:53,065 --> 00:58:54,265
One thing about the networking.

933
00:58:55,311 --> 00:58:58,032
A lot, if you're watching this, you've heard a lot about networking and a lot

934
00:58:58,052 --> 00:59:01,774
about getting in with important people and yada, yada, try not to think of it

935
00:59:01,934 --> 00:59:06,377
like talking to the head of Sony or whatever you don't network by cold

936
00:59:06,437 --> 00:59:11,040
calling the head of Sony India or whatever you network by working with

937
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:16,102
your peers and over time, your peers become the head of Sony or whatever.

938
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:19,725
So absolutely work within your local spheres, local communities first.

939
00:59:19,865 --> 00:59:22,246
And then over time you'll find those people tend to get better and better

940
00:59:22,286 --> 00:59:24,407
jobs and then, Oh, Hey, you just know them.

941
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:29,755
words of wisdom. Yeah. So we got we got we got 20 seconds left here. We were going to talk about

942
00:59:29,795 --> 00:59:34,037
bundles. Now we can't. But I'm just going to say one great thing you can do if your game just can't

943
00:59:34,057 --> 00:59:39,701
make money at all is put it into charity bundles and it just becomes one more thing that can be

944
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:46,806
like in the bundle for racial justice or for Palestinian aid. And it just at least your game's

945
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:51,248
doing some work. Thanks, everybody. Bye. Thank you. Bye bye.
