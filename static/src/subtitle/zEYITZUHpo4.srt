1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,859
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:12,903
What we have for you next is, you know,

3
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:15,525
who here has been to the Tricks of the Trade before?

4
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,287
Yeah, so this is, I could start this off

5
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:19,408
with spewing some random facts,

6
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:23,051
but there are six animators with me up on stage,

7
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:24,372
so we're gonna jump right into it,

8
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:28,235
and I think you're gonna find it more enjoyable,

9
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,777
because it's historically our top-rated talk

10
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:31,158
of the animation bootcamp, the Tricks of the Trade.

11
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:32,019
We're starting with you.

12
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:33,540
Oh, be beautiful.

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,851
I told him I wasn't going to introduce him.

14
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:39,531
I'm not just rude.

15
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:39,932
This is Jake Clark.

16
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:48,595
Hey, everybody.

17
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:49,636
I'm Jake.

18
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:53,517
I worked on Cuphead, and I'm now working on the upcoming Cuphead DLC.

19
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:57,519
Most of my tips come from my traditional animation experience.

20
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:01,680
They will be the most useful for the few traditional animators in the room, but that said, I'll

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,402
try to make the tips useful for 3D animators as well.

22
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:10,637
First tip, nail down your main poses as soon as you can.

23
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,118
I had a lot of trouble with this robot

24
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:13,718
before I started doing this.

25
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:15,179
I wish I had my first attempts,

26
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:16,920
but they were not worth keeping.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,160
I used to spend too much time

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,821
in the rough stages of my animations,

29
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:23,402
without finalizing any of the main poses

30
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:25,323
until I had already done a lot of animating.

31
00:01:25,323 --> 00:01:26,843
But then sometimes I would find that,

32
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:29,184
because I hadn't fully fleshed out the major keys,

33
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,425
I didn't notice serious problems,

34
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,006
and I would often have to fix a lot of my animation,

35
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:34,826
if not start over.

36
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:38,660
So these days I like to nail things down early,

37
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,781
because it prevents some problems down the line

38
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:45,863
and it eliminates the uncertainty of whether my animation will work or not.

39
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:50,185
I find the most stressful period of animating, especially on a deadline,

40
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:54,246
is the time up until I know for sure that the animation is going to work.

41
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,527
I know that once the poses are nailed down and they work,

42
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:59,868
at the very least I won't have to start over and I can relax a little bit.

43
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:03,987
Now for 3D animators, I'd summarize this tip as,

44
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:06,768
focus on the poses before you focus on the motion.

45
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:07,988
If you can work that way.

46
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:10,509
I know some 3D animators will do things like,

47
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,670
animate the torso first throughout the whole animation

48
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,130
and go from there.

49
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,431
I'm way out of my element.

50
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,071
Moving on.

51
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,372
Next tip.

52
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:21,473
Consider the motion of each element of your character

53
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,994
before animating between the poses.

54
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:25,534
A good way to avoid problems down the line

55
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:26,135
in your animation.

56
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,063
is to consider each part of your character in advance,

57
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:31,445
and not just jump into it and pray that things work out.

58
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,847
For example, with this animation,

59
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:37,650
I had to really think, how will this snake move?

60
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,051
How will that snake move?

61
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:40,532
How will that snake move?

62
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:41,753
How will that snake move?

63
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:43,594
And oh my God, there's another one too.

64
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:45,796
Thinking about each part,

65
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:48,178
I could make sure that everything moves together nicely,

66
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:50,200
and that there are no problems like

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,562
two snakes moving together in the same way at the same time,

68
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:54,884
the snakes awkwardly overlapping each other,

69
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:55,384
things like that.

70
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,670
If I didn't think ahead, I could have found

71
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,791
that there were a lot of issues

72
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,452
once I was already knee deep in animating.

73
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:04,533
The more you figure out before diving into animating,

74
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:06,474
the better your animation will be

75
00:03:06,474 --> 00:03:07,895
because you're animating thoughtfully.

76
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:11,036
For 3D folks, I recommend the same thing,

77
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:12,757
having a plan for each piece of the character

78
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:14,597
and thoughtfully placing everything

79
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:17,299
according to that plan as you go along.

80
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,340
If you don't, you may go from stepped to splined

81
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,221
and see that some parts of the character move,

82
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:25,742
eh, good enough, and just keep it that way.

83
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:29,745
The more intention you have, the better.

84
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:33,108
Next tip, rough your poses light and push when tying down.

85
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:36,851
I think I and many others have a subconscious tendency

86
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,792
to hold things back just a little bit,

87
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,314
even when we think that we're pushing them.

88
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:43,156
So I often find, even to this day,

89
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,977
my first attempt at a pose or drawing

90
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:48,040
isn't quite pushed as far as it could be.

91
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,621
Here's an example of a face that I roughed

92
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:51,122
to show what I mean by this.

93
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,680
After roughing, I went over it clean,

94
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,301
but I pushed things just a little bit.

95
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:57,521
You can see if you look closely.

96
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,743
The eyebrows go down a tiny bit more in the middle,

97
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:03,284
the corners of the mouth go just a bit higher,

98
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,145
and the bottom of the mouth goes a little bit lower.

99
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,686
And I find almost always when I do this,

100
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,447
it tends to make things a little bit better

101
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:12,528
and not a little bit worse.

102
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:14,369
And for this tip for the 3D folks,

103
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:16,810
I'd just say, after you pose something out,

104
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,111
just try pushing things a little bit.

105
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,012
You don't know it's too far until you try it.

106
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,271
And unlike on paper, you can just undo.

107
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,912
Sort of.

108
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:30,393
Next tip, keep your animation sincere.

109
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:31,334
I think it's much more important

110
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,275
to keep your characters animating sincerely

111
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,955
than it is to try to pack the animation

112
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,536
with as much entertaining motion as possible.

113
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:39,837
Here's an example from Princess Mononoke.

114
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:41,058
The motions are pretty simple.

115
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:42,919
Her head turns just a bit,

116
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,480
her body subtly tenses as she spits the blood,

117
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,720
then she adjusts her posture

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,682
and wipes her mouth with a simple motion of her arm.

119
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:52,744
She doesn't need to ham it up with a lot of extra movement

120
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:53,965
because that would take you out of the story.

121
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:57,166
You want people to believe in your characters

122
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,687
as if they were real and see them as alive.

123
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,488
You don't want people to be pulled from that illusion

124
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:04,429
by too much purposeless movement.

125
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,229
You want every movement to have purpose,

126
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,930
not just to show off that you know how to overshoot things.

127
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,732
In this example, nothing is superfluous.

128
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:15,393
Simba closes his eyes because the weird monkey man

129
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:16,833
is dropping some gunk on his head.

130
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:19,705
He stretches out and wiggles his nose

131
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:21,126
because he's preparing to sneeze,

132
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:22,507
and he overshoots with his face

133
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:25,089
because sneezing is a surprising burst of force

134
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,751
and it causes your face to overshoot.

135
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,892
It's important to make use

136
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,734
of all of the animation principles that you can,

137
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:33,696
just as long as they actually add to your animation

138
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,377
and don't distract or go against

139
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,260
what the animation needs to accomplish.

140
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,340
Last tip, contrast.

141
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,563
Contrast is one of the most important things,

142
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:44,765
not only in animation, but in almost everything,

143
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:46,466
and I think about it a lot when animating.

144
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,017
If you have pose A start out fast and ease into pose B,

145
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,058
and then you have pose B start out fast and ease into pose C,

146
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:56,919
and C to D, it will be distractingly boring.

147
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,860
It will put the audience into a coma on site.

148
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,400
It would be so boring.

149
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,101
That's why I didn't make an example.

150
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,001
I'm trying to protect you.

151
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:08,703
In music, you need the contrast of high notes and low notes.

152
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:12,524
In cooking, you need sweet and you need bitter.

153
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:16,885
And so in animation, you need fast and slow movement.

154
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:20,759
steady and erratic movement, big and small movement.

155
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,160
Without any contrast, life would be very boring.

156
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,181
Life needs contrast, and so does animation.

157
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:26,581
That's it for me.

158
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:28,561
Thanks, everybody.

159
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:37,843
Hello, everyone.

160
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:39,824
I'm Sophie Evans.

161
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:42,064
I'm an animator at the Molasses Flood,

162
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:44,145
previously at Sony Santa Monica with Melissa.

163
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:46,718
And today I'm going to be going over my personal animation

164
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:47,879
philosophies.

165
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,701
I'm going to be quickly going over the importance of workspace,

166
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,043
some camera tips, and some lessons from yoga.

167
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:56,125
Tip number one, make your workspace work for you.

168
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,466
When I say workspace, I'm talking

169
00:06:57,466 --> 00:07:00,009
about sitting ergonomically, making sure your wrists aren't

170
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,370
straining, using scripts and hotkeys

171
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,812
to automate as much as possible, that sort of thing.

172
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:06,774
This is what Maya looks like the first time you open it up.

173
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:09,796
You're presented with 8,000 tools to handle a billion

174
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,417
possible tasks.

175
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,218
So it's your job to curate and make sure

176
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:15,161
you're being as efficient as possible with which tools

177
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:17,443
you're using and how your tools are arranged.

178
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:18,964
Seems pretty obvious, but you want

179
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,325
to make sure you're set up for success

180
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,627
before you even start animating.

181
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:24,729
An efficient workspace is going to make you faster,

182
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,231
which is going to make you a more valuable animator.

183
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,213
As animators, we do a lot of repetitive operations

184
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:30,274
throughout the day.

185
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:32,375
So if you can cut a few seconds each time,

186
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,138
that's going to save you a lot of time in the long term.

187
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,073
We want to keep thinking about the long term

188
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:38,294
and work smart more than hard.

189
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:42,276
Our risks are essential to our livelihoods

190
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:44,837
and RSI, carpal tunnel, these are real threats

191
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,318
we need to be diligent about preventing

192
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:47,879
and we can do that with a proper workspace.

193
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,940
And to that I say consider switching to a tablet

194
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,521
or a vertical mouse at least.

195
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,362
Might feel weird or slow you down temporarily

196
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,243
but for me it has sped up my workflow

197
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,685
probably more than anything else.

198
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,926
So if you can, give it a shot, I highly recommend it.

199
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,367
As far as animation tools go.

200
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:05,109
There's tons of great stuff out there,

201
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,409
so I just wanted to highlight some scripts

202
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:06,749
that I use a lot.

203
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:09,530
I use a lot of stuff from Aaron Carusel,

204
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,991
who's an Animation Tools Lead at Pixar.

205
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,632
On his site, he's got a bunch of stuff.

206
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:15,072
If you work heavy in the graph editor,

207
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:17,013
there's lots of scripts for flipping curves,

208
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:19,033
pushing, pulling curves, making loops

209
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,054
based on nearby keys.

210
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:23,635
Really great stuff if you work heavy in the graph editor.

211
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:24,655
Go to his site, check that out.

212
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,916
There might be something there to speed up your workflow.

213
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,437
Tip number two, let's talk about cameras.

214
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,364
I know we don't all have the ability

215
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:35,065
to have animatable cameras in our games,

216
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,426
but if you do, learning more about the features of a camera

217
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:40,007
can help bring your animation to the next level.

218
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:42,147
We all understand how important composition is,

219
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,588
but do we understand focal length or depth of field?

220
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:46,129
Learn these things.

221
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:48,370
Just like composition, a focal length

222
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,851
is gonna evoke a certain feeling or mood.

223
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,772
You wanna make sure you're using the correct one

224
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:55,632
that's gonna emphasize what you're already

225
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:57,093
trying to say in your shots.

226
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:59,074
A shot's gonna feel more dramatic or more intimate

227
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:00,114
depending on a focal length.

228
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:03,782
Every piece of the camera is a decision that we make.

229
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:05,903
And by leaving the camera at default settings,

230
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:06,903
that's a decision too.

231
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:08,904
But somebody else has made it for you.

232
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,824
So learn these pieces so that you can better make

233
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:13,045
the decisions for yourself.

234
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:15,646
And again, if you have the ability to have a camera,

235
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:17,207
really take advantage of that and emphasize

236
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,367
action with camera movement.

237
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:21,208
This is a really early rough blocking of a camera sync

238
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,149
move from God of War.

239
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,350
You can see, especially when we remove the background elements,

240
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,971
that Kratos doesn't actually move within the frame very much.

241
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:30,752
So on a later pass, what we did was.

242
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,087
basically swung the camera left and right

243
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,988
during the high action moments to put Kratos closer

244
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:38,829
to the edges of the frame so that he takes up more space

245
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,749
on the big movements.

246
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:44,611
And you can see how that compares with the before

247
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:48,092
and after.

248
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:50,713
So really take advantage if you have the ability

249
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:53,173
to have an animatable camera.

250
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:53,974
OK, tip number three.

251
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:56,395
What the heck does yoga have to do with animation?

252
00:09:57,232 --> 00:10:01,335
Well, one reason I love yoga so much is because the things you learn in a class are really

253
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,676
applicable to all areas of your life.

254
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:07,839
One thing you hear all the time in yoga class that I really love is, go to the uncomfortable.

255
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,383
I know it's a little cheesy and we've heard it a lot, but we often gravitate towards the

256
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:14,104
things that we're already good at.

257
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:17,426
But we're not going to grow as much if we only do those things that we're comfortable

258
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:17,867
with.

259
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:22,130
So next time you're taking on an animation task, try to take on something that scares

260
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,012
you a little bit or something that challenges you, maybe something you're not quite sure

261
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:26,453
you can do.

262
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,660
I think it's good for us to be in over our heads every once in a while.

263
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,823
But you need to understand the difference between uncomfortable and painful.

264
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:37,705
You want to go to the uncomfortable but not to the painful.

265
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,986
Find where that edge is for you and tread along that.

266
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:44,048
We don't want to leave our comfort zone because we're afraid of failure.

267
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:45,849
But don't forget, it's okay to fail.

268
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:48,891
We've all done it lots of times.

269
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:50,531
Failing is the best way to learn.

270
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:54,313
Next time it happens to you, just be grateful you're given an opportunity to learn something.

271
00:10:55,808 --> 00:11:00,113
Something I like to think about is failure doesn't have to be the opposite of success.

272
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,756
Failure can be a stepping stone on the way to success.

273
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:06,480
So just to recap, take a look at your workspace,

274
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,463
see if there's something you can do to make yourself just 2 percent more efficient.

275
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:15,070
Learn the other pieces of a camera and maybe take a yoga class every once in a while. Thank you.

276
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:29,900
Hello everyone, I'm Raul Ibarra, or KraSan on social networks,

277
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,121
and I'm an animator at Moon Studios.

278
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:36,003
I'm going to talk about a concept that I would like to call

279
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:39,425
visceral animation. We have all been students,

280
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:44,848
and we have all been fighting against the rig, trying to animate cool moments,

281
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:48,190
get time in contrast, and craft beautiful poses.

282
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,413
We usually start by copying some references from movies or video games we like.

283
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,453
And it's OK to do this.

284
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,414
There is nothing wrong with that.

285
00:11:57,414 --> 00:12:00,357
And then, at some point, you feel confident enough

286
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,878
to create your own stuff.

287
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:05,901
Not only to start experimenting with your animation styles,

288
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:08,143
but you also start ensuring the workflow

289
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:10,725
you learned a long time ago.

290
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:13,027
Start making a layout, do the blocking

291
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:16,189
with your golden poses, define some breakdowns,

292
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:18,671
go to spline, refine the animation,

293
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,413
and do the final polishing.

294
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:24,398
The problem is that many animators don't ask themselves

295
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:27,140
if that is the right flow for them.

296
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,002
The rules are necessary when you start,

297
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:32,883
but also the rules are made to be broken

298
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,364
when they limit your creativity.

299
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:39,087
I always start an animation in spline.

300
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,088
I polish some part of the character

301
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,529
even before blocking others.

302
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,012
I don't keyframe the whole rig in the same frame.

303
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,613
I start an animation without knowing

304
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:50,953
what the character is going to do.

305
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:56,669
I even change my animation depending on the music I'm listening to.

306
00:12:56,669 --> 00:13:01,531
This may sound crazy, but it's how I work.

307
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:06,172
I'm sure that there are a bunch of people that fit perfectly with the classic workflow,

308
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:11,374
but I would like you to ask yourself if that workflow is the one that allows you to enter

309
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,894
an animation trance.

310
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,755
Here are some tips that helped me in my animation process.

311
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:20,093
I imagine the hip of your character

312
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:22,893
for getting the poses is really helpful.

313
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:25,314
I like to think that the character will be like a stain

314
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:28,315
on the screen, so I don't really care about posing

315
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:31,555
at the beginning of my animation process.

316
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:35,456
And once you have the timing and the spacing defined,

317
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:38,297
you will be able to work on posing.

318
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:43,378
Moreover, if you imagine each limb of a character as a ball

319
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:46,179
and the whole body as a stain or even as a fluid,

320
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:53,057
it will be easy to define how to deform them to give more or less plasticity.

321
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:58,481
Using the motion paths could be helpful to constrain the smear frames and body deformations.

322
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:05,126
Deform, scale, move the bones, do whatever you need to get the best pose.

323
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:09,169
There is no one inside that mesh, it's not gonna crack.

324
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:13,813
When you have your animation almost done, try to break it with some

325
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:18,524
crazy keyframes and you will probably discover pleasant surprises.

326
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:25,689
This is especially interesting for overshoots and contacts, where introducing some noise could help

327
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:31,133
a lot to get more believable actions. The last one, but the most important for me,

328
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:36,577
is try to find the musical beat for your animations. We have the musical rhythm

329
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:39,639
internalized, so let's use it to animate.

330
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,418
No matter how bad you are playing an instrument,

331
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:46,480
you have listened to music your whole life.

332
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,961
If you look closely, every action has its own hit moments,

333
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,162
some more obvious than others,

334
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:54,963
but being aware of the musicality we want to give

335
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:58,745
our animation will let us avoid boring timing.

336
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:00,986
You can use your own voice,

337
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:03,627
maybe record your hand playing a rhythm,

338
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:06,048
or even follow a song beat

339
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:07,688
to have a cool timing reference.

340
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:12,577
At the end, we want to work on animations that thrill people.

341
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,778
And as far as I'm concerned, animation

342
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:17,199
is about enjoying the tempo.

343
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:17,860
Thank you very much.

344
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:17,960
Woo!

345
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,040
Woo!

346
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,100
Woo!

347
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,160
Woo!

348
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,220
Woo!

349
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:30,047
Woo!

350
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,247
Woo!

351
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:30,447
Woo!

352
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:30,707
Woo!

353
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:30,847
Woo!

354
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:30,907
Woo!

355
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:30,967
Woo!

356
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:31,088
Woo!

357
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:31,148
Woo!

358
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:31,288
Woo!

359
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:31,468
Woo!

360
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:31,548
Woo!

361
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:31,608
Woo!

362
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:31,668
Woo!

363
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:31,728
Woo!

364
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:31,948
Woo!

365
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:32,108
Woo!

366
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:32,288
Woo!

367
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:32,488
Woo!

368
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:32,849
Hi, everyone.

369
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,169
I'm Sylvia Chong.

370
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,410
I'm a lead artist at League of Geeks.

371
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:45,428
Working at a small indie studio, I also juggle other roles as an animator, rigger and character artist.

372
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:49,049
My tips today will be about how getting a little technical will expand your toolset

373
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,571
and can save you time without compromising on quality.

374
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:57,474
It can be quite common for animators to overlook or, sorry, tip number one, get comfortable with constraints.

375
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,835
It can be quite common for...

376
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:02,492
and meters to overlook or avoid using constraints

377
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:03,752
in their workflow.

378
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:05,793
It can seem complicated or cumbersome,

379
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:08,094
but they're actually not as tricky as you might think

380
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:12,416
and can be a powerful tool to add to your arsenal.

381
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,837
Constraints can help you easily create overlaps,

382
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:19,099
transfer motion from dynamic systems,

383
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,540
optimize your workflow,

384
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,261
utilize spline paths in geometry,

385
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:25,182
stabilize movement in mocap and more.

386
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:28,323
So encourage those who aren't comfortable with constraints

387
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:31,564
to take a closer look and discover how they can make the most of them.

388
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:34,925
Tip two, block faster by breaking the rules.

389
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:39,647
That's right, go ahead and animate the world control.

390
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:44,128
Generally speaking, we never animate the world control.

391
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,869
There might be some exceptions for locomotion,

392
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:48,529
but it simply creates too much havoc.

393
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,790
The curves of child controls can become difficult to edit and understand.

394
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:55,154
But sometimes it just feels more intuitive

395
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:56,874
to move and rotate the entire character

396
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:57,535
when you're blocking,

397
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:59,875
particularly for more complicated actions

398
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,496
that involve spinning and flipping.

399
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:03,777
So instead of avoiding the world control,

400
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:06,338
I use a method where I try to leverage it,

401
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,680
positioning it where it would be most useful.

402
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,801
This position can change from pose to pose,

403
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,182
but it's best to keep the keys stepped.

404
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:18,663
When I'm done, I'll delete the animation from the control

405
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,264
and use a constrain and bake workflow

406
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:21,564
that lets me retain one of keys.

407
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:25,033
In this clip, you can see I've changed the relative position

408
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,094
of the world control to help me quickly rotate

409
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,776
the character from the hips.

410
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:31,057
Here I'm blocking out a swing,

411
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,798
so I've moved the world control to the hand.

412
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,900
This helps me rotate the entire character from this point,

413
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,061
letting me quickly block out the gross motion

414
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:40,443
just using a single control.

415
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:44,286
I can then add more poses and easily adjust the time

416
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:45,887
of the swing as I iterate.

417
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,789
When I'm done blocking, I use CGMonk's Lockinator tool

418
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:49,489
to help me clean up.

419
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:52,268
You can do this manually, but obviously the script

420
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:52,868
makes it much quicker.

421
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:55,330
So basically what the Locinator does

422
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,033
is create locators for every selected control.

423
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:02,235
So you should select everything you've keyed in the step.

424
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,797
Then it constrains and bakes the motion on the locators

425
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:05,638
to record the animation.

426
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:09,180
You can then delete the animation from the world control

427
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,542
and recenter it, then bake the recorded motion back

428
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,123
to your rig.

429
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,484
This is a non-destructive process,

430
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,566
which leaves your rig and animation intact

431
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:18,187
and your world control centered and clean.

432
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,581
Sounds a little complicated, but I'll show these steps again visually.

433
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:27,262
So there are a couple important notes if you use this method. You need to bake the

434
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:33,003
heap controls first to avoid broken results, and you should run an Euler filter on all curves

435
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:40,765
after baking. This is the process in action. Apologies if this goes a little quick.

436
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:44,166
So I select the rig controls. The script generates locators for each one.

437
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,607
The script constrains and bakes the animation to the corresponding locators.

438
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:51,124
I select the world control and delete its keys.

439
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:52,925
I select the hip controls and the script bakes.

440
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:57,588
This grabs the motion that was previously recorded

441
00:18:57,588 --> 00:19:00,769
on the locators and transfers it back.

442
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:04,752
The remaining controls are then selected

443
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,373
and baked at the same time.

444
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:09,274
The final results is a clean scene

445
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,895
with the stationary world control

446
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:12,717
and the original animation rig intact.

447
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:19,443
So advantages of this workflow are,

448
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:20,484
it can speed up blocking,

449
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:22,865
letting you iterate on more ideas.

450
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:25,326
The world control can be repositioned anywhere you need it,

451
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:26,826
giving you cleaner arcs and control

452
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,287
over the center of a spin or flip.

453
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:31,168
And it can reduce the amount of IK, FK switching

454
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:31,849
you might have to do.

455
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,329
Tip three, speed up polishing

456
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:36,290
by simulating secondary motion.

457
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,172
If you haven't tried out simulating secondary motion,

458
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:42,833
you should, it might not be for everybody or every style,

459
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,234
but it can be a real time saver,

460
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:46,315
so it's worth trying out.

461
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,841
The results may not always be perfect

462
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:50,282
or exactly what you intended,

463
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,023
but it lays down a nice base.

464
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,724
And from there, it can be quicker to adjust

465
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:55,405
than key it all by hand.

466
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:57,566
And if your core animation needs to change

467
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:00,107
for whatever reason, it's easy to re-sim.

468
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,869
You can create your own dynamic setup

469
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,730
or use one of many scripts available online.

470
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,411
Some scripts you might wanna check out

471
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:10,032
are Overlapper, Physics Tool, and Magic Spring.

472
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:10,493
So give it a go.

473
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:12,694
You might find it saves you a bunch of time.

474
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:16,636
So in summary, there isn't just one way of working.

475
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:20,557
So keep experimenting and exploring.

476
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:21,718
Go beyond your comfort zone.

477
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:24,881
Don't be afraid to get a little technical.

478
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,444
It only increases your understanding of the greater picture.

479
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:31,067
Reflect on your process, pinpoint your bottlenecks,

480
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,310
and see if there are better solutions.

481
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,532
We work in an incredibly demanding industry.

482
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,455
As I say, work smarter, not harder, and always stay curious.

483
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:39,015
Thanks for your time.

484
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:52,667
Hi, I'm Zach, an indie developer from Toronto.

485
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:57,411
Today, I want to share with you how my skills as an animator

486
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:59,733
benefit from being exposed to multiple disciplines

487
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,295
within a studio.

488
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:04,257
I'll illustrate this, how it can be beneficial,

489
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:07,840
and try to give you a few tips of how you can do the same.

490
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,962
So I co-founded a company called Oddbird,

491
00:21:09,962 --> 00:21:12,724
where I focus on game design mostly,

492
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:15,887
but I also do freelance animation at a company called

493
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:16,287
Vertex Pop.

494
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:16,347
So.

495
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:25,401
To best illustrate my point, I want to frame this as the area between where my design skills and my

496
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:30,722
animation skills overlap. I'm going to use examples that have helped me, but I think this can apply to

497
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,963
any discipline, really. I want to start with how my design knowledge can improve my animation.

498
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:41,744
So this is an example from Oddbird's currently unannounced project,

499
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:44,845
and I want to frame it a little bit differently, or explain how I did.

500
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,489
The game revolves around these little fruit with big personalities,

501
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:52,391
and there's 84 of them with two states each,

502
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,854
meaning I needed to create 168 animations,

503
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:58,015
and that just wasn't realistic with the time frame.

504
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:04,220
So to tackle the quantity of animation I actually needed to produce,

505
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,522
I thought of it as designing animations rather than just going for it.

506
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:09,924
And this allowed me to develop a more creative solution.

507
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:19,444
Instead of rigging each of them, I used a few empty game objects to create a setup that let me reuse animations for any character.

508
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:24,286
I planned out which fruit would get what animations, and ended up with 37 unique ones in the end.

509
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:31,190
Out of these 37, some of them were specific, but most could be applied to any fruit.

510
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,591
I made a few variations as well to add a little more personality.

511
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:37,413
These were also animated directly in Unity, so if...

512
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:39,507
any other team members needed to edit them,

513
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:42,448
they didn't have to open any software that they weren't familiar with.

514
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:50,471
Another example can be found in how animation can be informed by the mechanics of the game.

515
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:55,073
This is especially easy to do in character cinematics or things like highlight intros,

516
00:22:55,073 --> 00:23:00,135
but collaborating with a designer will make your animations so much more effective in the game.

517
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:02,796
This will also help give context to the game mechanics,

518
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:05,477
and it's always better to show rather than to tell.

519
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:10,005
Last year, Aubert was working on a game called Super Random Heroes,

520
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,526
and I created this intro cinematic for a mini-boss.

521
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:16,167
The enemy does a jumping attack where he tries to land on the player,

522
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,447
so I put that right in the cinematic.

523
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:20,488
This gave a lot of context to the mini-boss

524
00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:26,130
and created an opportunity for players to feel smart for picking up on it.

525
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,951
Now let's flip it.

526
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:30,151
How can animation help my design skills?

527
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:34,293
I want to use the principles of animation as an example.

528
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:38,579
What perspective can they give to a design?

529
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:41,820
Well, I consider things like, how much time

530
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,641
am I giving the players to learn something?

531
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:48,002
How do I anticipate a design beat in the game?

532
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:49,562
Can I anticipate player progression?

533
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:53,983
How can you use staging to draw attention throughout a level?

534
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:57,324
Or what order am I presenting things?

535
00:23:57,324 --> 00:24:00,184
How many things am I requiring the player to mentally keep

536
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:00,925
track of at once?

537
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:07,208
This kind of thing is really useful to me, since using it as a lens to see my own work differently

538
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,530
allows me to ask myself questions that I wouldn't have otherwise thought of.

539
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:17,754
Another interesting perspective that animation can give design is visual language. Games are

540
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:21,617
interacting with a system that's behaving in a specific way. At the end of the day,

541
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:26,139
you're communicating an emotion or some kind of information without words.

542
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:30,962
Designs can use words, but generally I think it's more engaging to not.

543
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:35,468
I worked on both the level design and animation

544
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:38,410
for Vertex Pop's new game, Super Crush KO,

545
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,333
and I needed to use my skills through both disciplines

546
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,495
to communicate with the team to communicate

547
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:46,896
the visual language of the game.

548
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:50,038
I hope this gives you an idea of how you can learn

549
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,319
from other perspectives or workflows

550
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,141
to improve your own work.

551
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:56,222
It can be a lens to critique,

552
00:24:56,222 --> 00:24:58,604
or a basis for your approach for something entirely new.

553
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:00,345
And the best part is,

554
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:04,005
You can learn this from the people already around you.

555
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,286
This can be coworkers, dev friends,

556
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:08,826
or people that you just met on the street.

557
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:14,268
So, the problem is, seeing something

558
00:25:14,268 --> 00:25:16,228
from another perspective can be unsettling at first.

559
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:17,668
So I want to try and leave you with a couple tips

560
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:19,729
on how you can do this on your own.

561
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:21,789
Try asking someone, what do they consider

562
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:22,649
before they start work?

563
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:25,910
What principles do they follow as they work?

564
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,510
And my personal favorite.

565
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:31,265
What criteria do they use to measure the quality of their own work?

566
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:38,228
And as a bonus, you might find a more creative solution to a problem you're having.

567
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:38,488
Thank you.

568
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:38,688
APPLAUSE

569
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:49,272
Oh, okay. Hi, I'm Melissa Shim,

570
00:25:49,272 --> 00:25:53,013
and I'm currently a senior animator at Sony Santa Monica.

571
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,814
I most recently worked on God of War.

572
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:57,978
and a lot of other things before that.

573
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:01,920
So I'll be covering some tips and tricks about networking

574
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,841
and job hunting.

575
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:05,941
And I think they're applicable whether you're

576
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,642
new to the industry or you've been doing this for a while.

577
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:12,564
First off, I'd like to say that networking can be super awkward.

578
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:17,305
However, if you're just starting out, over time,

579
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:19,686
it'll get easier.

580
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:22,567
While networking can also seem self-serving,

581
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:23,968
I don't think it really has to be.

582
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:25,668
We're all here to help each other out.

583
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:25,748
So.

584
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:29,750
Just be yourself and be genuine with your interactions.

585
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,831
My first topic is etiquette.

586
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:33,152
Provide a reason to connect.

587
00:26:33,152 --> 00:26:39,577
Part of networking is to reach out to as many people as possible.

588
00:26:39,577 --> 00:26:45,222
However, I don't necessarily think that quantity is better over quality.

589
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:50,466
When I started networking online specifically, I would usually contact an animator at a studio

590
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:54,889
I was interested in and see if they had some time to answer some questions.

591
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:59,648
I believe that striking up a conversation with the other person actually provides a

592
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:01,689
more authentic and therefore useful connection.

593
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:05,792
Keep in mind that not everyone will respond to you, nor are they obligated to.

594
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,615
This is totally normal and nothing to take personally.

595
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:12,517
Be professional.

596
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:14,539
This is a pretty obvious one.

597
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:19,322
If you're looking for information or for mentorship, showing gratitude with a please and thank

598
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:22,024
you and respecting their time and space will go a long way.

599
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:25,869
especially if that person has taken time out of their day to help you out.

600
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:32,414
I also would love to advise against using Facebook as a way to connect with someone

601
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:35,516
you've never spoken to or you've never met in person before.

602
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:41,239
Honestly, you don't want someone like me to post a picture of you from 10 years ago doing

603
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,061
drunk limbo, right Simon?

604
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:51,927
So if you're looking for a professional connection, please use these platforms instead.

605
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:58,908
My second main topic is to know yourself and your audience.

606
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:00,790
Have clear goals of what you want to accomplish,

607
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,671
and ask yourself if the move you're making

608
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:05,053
is in the right direction or not.

609
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:07,155
When deciding on a piece of work you want to do,

610
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:08,596
choose something that really excites you.

611
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:10,818
Your love for an idea will actually

612
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:13,220
show more than you realize in your final product,

613
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,542
and therefore make it stand out.

614
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:21,087
Here's an example of a piece I did back in 2014.

615
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:23,677
I didn't really create this to get a job

616
00:28:23,677 --> 00:28:25,017
at any specific studio.

617
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:29,779
I had a great admiration for work for games like this,

618
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,881
and lo and behold, a year a bit later, I ended up at Sony.

619
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:39,123
Be self-aware of your work.

620
00:28:39,123 --> 00:28:42,364
And what I mean by this is to be honest and realistic

621
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:45,085
about where the quality of your work stands.

622
00:28:45,085 --> 00:28:47,907
Compare your work to the goal studios you have in mind,

623
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:50,908
as well as to other animators at your experience level.

624
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:53,392
Find areas where you can improve,

625
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:55,293
and if asking for feedback, point these out.

626
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:58,956
Also remember to be kind to yourself during this process.

627
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:01,357
You can always aim for the stars,

628
00:29:01,357 --> 00:29:05,180
but be aware of what it will take to get there.

629
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,781
Do your research.

630
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:07,721
Be familiar with the studio

631
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:09,262
and the position you're interested in,

632
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:11,164
the history of their games,

633
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:12,985
their work culture, management style,

634
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,106
and get as much detail as you can

635
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:17,368
on the position you're applying for.

636
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:18,588
As much as they're looking to see

637
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:19,609
if you're a right fit for them,

638
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:23,791
you want to ensure that they're a right fit for you.

639
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:26,433
My final main topic is to always be learning.

640
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:29,074
I learned how to do that in one night.

641
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:33,016
Don't be afraid to ask for feedback,

642
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:37,759
whether it's regarding personal animation, how you interviewed,

643
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,800
or how you're performing at work.

644
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,102
Constructive criticism is crucial for growth.

645
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:45,083
For example, some years ago, I had done an animation test

646
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,204
which I had not passed.

647
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:49,144
the team was actually more than happy to provide me

648
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:52,207
with some great feedback I could use going forward.

649
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,148
Not all studios will be able to do this for you,

650
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:58,971
but it's never, you know, don't be afraid to ask, basically.

651
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:01,193
Finally, don't let failure get you down.

652
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:03,954
It's often looked at as a negative thing,

653
00:30:03,954 --> 00:30:06,216
but there's so much that we can learn from it,

654
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:09,258
and you really never know where it'll bring you.

655
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:11,179
In 2013, my goal was to break into

656
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:12,960
the visual effects industry by the end of the year,

657
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,622
and that never actually happened.

658
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:17,659
But with each job I took subsequently,

659
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:19,420
it ended up bringing me to Sony Santa Monica,

660
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,722
where I've worked on some of the most exciting and challenging

661
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:24,222
animations of my career.

662
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:29,245
So in conclusion, being respectful and polite,

663
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,906
practicing self-awareness, and remaining open to growth

664
00:30:32,906 --> 00:30:35,687
will go a long way in maintaining a strong career.

665
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:36,768
Thank you for your time.
