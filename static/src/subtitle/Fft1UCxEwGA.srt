1
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:06,183
All right.

2
00:00:06,403 --> 00:00:08,164
That's close enough to one more minute.

3
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:12,705
So welcome to the session called Surviving

4
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:14,025
the Jump from AAA to Indy.

5
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:15,106
Thank you for being here.

6
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,046
Out of curiosity, how many of you

7
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:19,527
have heard of the session during the flash-forward this morning?

8
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:21,288
Cool.

9
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:22,308
All right.

10
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:22,988
It worked.

11
00:00:23,388 --> 00:00:23,648
Great.

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:25,709
So welcome.

13
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:26,509
Thank you for coming.

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,331
So as I mentioned during flash-forward,

15
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,912
the idea is basically if you're either

16
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:40,627
AAA developer who's thinking of doing the leap into indie development, or maybe you

17
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:44,592
have already jumped into indie development and you're sort of trying to figure out your

18
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:47,135
next steps, this session is for you.

19
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:52,301
We're going to share information and sort of our learnings about our own adventures

20
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:52,841
in indie development.

21
00:00:53,382 --> 00:01:19,921
switching to indie, because you know, it's hard. It's hard to start out. I can't speak for the other speakers, but myself, when I was starting an indie studio, I had no idea how much I didn't know. And thankfully, I had good advice from former co-workers and so on, who were able to sort of tell me, don't do this, do that, and so on. So that's what we're hoping to sort of do in this session. Because there is a lot of

22
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:26,324
different things that working in a large studio maybe we don't necessarily learn things about

23
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:31,967
business, things about marketing that are very new and they have to be learned quickly. So

24
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:36,830
that's what we're going to do this session. We're going to start with Sean Alexander Allen

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,811
talking about the transition into being independent.

26
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:40,952
then Mike Bithell on community,

27
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:42,392
Cliff Harris on business,

28
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:44,033
Board Pfeiffer on publishers,

29
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,234
and me on multi-platform.

30
00:01:46,294 --> 00:01:47,935
And we're gonna have a lot of material,

31
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:48,875
so we're gonna go fast,

32
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:52,397
and let's hold Q&A until the very end of the session.

33
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:54,617
So without further ado.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,841
Hi. So my name is Sean Alexander Allen. I go by that full name because if you Google Sean

35
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:16,103
Allen you get a country music star. But if you Google Sean Alexander Allen you pretty much

36
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:22,844
only get me and a guy who's been arrested twice. So I worked at Rockstar Games in New York

37
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:26,225
City for about four and a half years before going independent in mid 2012.

38
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:34,771
actually this is kind of interesting. Before I go on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention this.

39
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:39,813
It's kind of going on right now. I was actually supposed to be demoing my game in and around

40
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:48,838
GDC and PAX this week, but so this game was, my game was funded on kick started last year. I

41
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:55,120
was unable to demo it this week because my programmer that I work with, the one other person

42
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,362
that I work with pretty much to build the game from the ground up.

43
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:04,467
had two near death experiences. One was dental infection and the other one was he was nearly

44
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:11,292
paralyzed by an anesthesia reaction. So kind of just shows that when you work with one other

45
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:16,255
person it's like working, it's like building a wall made out of two bricks instead of

46
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:21,700
hundreds. You remove one and the whole wall will fall apart. So yeah last year I had this game

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,102
funded. It actually failed right before GDC last year.

48
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:31,587
uh, and I hit the ground running. I'd spent two weeks and, uh, talking about it, which I really

49
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:37,228
didn't do beforehand. And then a month later, so about two and a half months straight of running a

50
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:41,909
Kickstarter and it was successful. And I want to thank everyone who helped, uh, make that happen.

51
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:46,450
I wouldn't be here today without that. And, you know, as the head of a tiny team, like I do most

52
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,130
of the work that.

53
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,070
isn't programming music and some of the production key art.

54
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,171
Like I work with Inverse Phase on music,

55
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,491
Manuel Marcano on, he's a programmer,

56
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:57,372
and The Game Wouldn't Exist Without Him,

57
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:01,233
and Diana Santiago, she does some of the key art

58
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,953
and production art and some of the character design.

59
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,254
But I have a lot of things to look at,

60
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:07,774
create, listen to.

61
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,955
I have to pretty much sign off on everything,

62
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,255
but while running a Kickstarter,

63
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:12,435
I couldn't actually do any of that,

64
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:15,616
so that pretty much held up the entire production.

65
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:16,576
On that side, I had to look at

66
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,212
look at builds but also have to figure out how to get people interested in the

67
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:25,996
kickstarter. Uh I had to like keep trying to contact press and do all these

68
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:30,499
different things. And it's interesting because you know I'm I'm kind of we like

69
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:34,101
the toll of this kick this toll of this on my life was super immense and it kinda

70
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:38,024
made me think like do I actually wanna do this like in such a small team

71
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:38,384
anymore.

72
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:44,290
I'm still doing it because I love working on my own projects for myself. And you know, much like

73
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,033
in Birdman, the idea of triple, going back to triple A goes, runs through my mind. But at this

74
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:53,477
point I don't think I could do it, not on, not on triple A's terms. Uh, and my kickstarter was

75
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:58,440
necessary because I don't have that much family or friends that have any money or could help us

76
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,904
bootstrap like other people. Uh, and we needed to cast a much wider net, hence crowdfunding.

77
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:09,969
And, you know, gaining fans, going to events, meeting people who believe in what you're doing is imperative.

78
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,133
So, this slide is dedicated to another former Rockstar Games employee, Kara Ellison,

79
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:24,875
who is going to be on the GDC MicroTalks roundtable tomorrow that you should be at, full of amazing people.

80
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:25,735
It's at 11.30.

81
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:26,155
So, I worked on...

82
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:31,933
a lot of these games when I worked at Rockstar and in terms

83
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:34,994
of the career that I started, kind of like Drake, like not

84
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:38,415
actually from the bottom but from the middle. I started at

85
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:42,756
the bottom of the top. You know Rockstar has immense uh,

86
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:46,177
respect. Like you say, you say hey I work at random dev

87
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:48,818
animating like stuff for this game and people are like

88
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:51,339
whatever. You say hey I worked on trailers at Rockstar. They're

89
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,220
like oh, I love those trailers. Like you immediately get this

90
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,381
and it kind of makes people already interested in what

91
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:57,841
you're doing.

92
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:04,549
Um, but the problem is, like, I didn't actually work on any of those games.

93
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,171
Like, I wasn't a game developer.

94
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:07,033
Um...

95
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,371
I made the trailers for them and it was very creative and it was a lot of hard work and

96
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:16,652
it was really great and I learned a lot at the company but I didn't make any games.

97
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:21,214
I learned editing, I learned working with some of the best editors in the industry,

98
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:27,456
I got to write and dialogue and perform dialogue and most importantly I developed team leadership

99
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:33,618
skills working with people of various different skill levels kind of around the game development

100
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:33,838
scene.

101
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:38,327
And I learned what I learned because I was in an environment

102
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:41,029
that you could take some initiative.

103
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,191
And that's kind of a hidden prerequisite

104
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:46,352
that if you're going to go on your own,

105
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:49,455
you actually have to take your own initiative to make your own.

106
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,057
I had to become a leader among my small group of people

107
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:54,558
in order to help them all out.

108
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:56,480
It helped me in the company, but it also

109
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,381
helped me when I got out of there

110
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,603
to be able to work with a group of people

111
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:01,703
who all have different talents.

112
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:07,456
And you know at the same time much of my time in the games industry was very

113
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:13,518
Shielded from game development like I don't I didn't know what TCR is where I had to ask

114
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,440
My job didn't hold up the game at all and in fact they often would

115
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:25,203
They would optimize the game for our needs like if we were needing a gun or some or an animation to look good

116
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:28,385
They would fix that right then so it was actually pushing the game forward and if anything

117
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,919
and uh our trailers actually made some of the devs really

118
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,920
excited about the game. We would get emails about it and it was

119
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,003
pretty cool. So the IndieBug kind of bit me really hard. You

120
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:43,484
know seeing a lot of great games. Uh but as an artist and a

121
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:47,466
writer not a programmer or anything I began to think huge

122
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:50,328
and started to work on creating a world and characters for a

123
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,329
brawler and you know one day I had the realization that even

124
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,171
this was still too big and I'm still at still in triple A.

125
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,533
And I finally like made some like pixel art and got it up and running in GameMaker.

126
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:07,056
And I was starting to talk to Manny about working on this game and he was kind of going through a hard time in his life.

127
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:13,119
And when I finally got it up in GameMaker he was like, oh, I need to start helping out on this or else he's going to, Sean's going to leave me behind.

128
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:19,122
So in order to get my first other team member on I had to show him that I was actually willing to make the game by myself.

129
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:23,988
Um, so that's actually really good. Like having something tangible will get people to help you.

130
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:30,557
Um, it was still too big of a project though to be my first game because I, I had no confidence as a

131
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:34,722
designer because I was not a designer. I was designing something hoping it was going to be good.

132
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:41,648
So I turned to game jams. Um, the first one I attended was the Global Game Jam 2012 at NYU Game

133
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:46,711
Center and it went, almost went too well. Uh, I had a diverse team of five talented people. We

134
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:50,854
had three programmers, two people to do art and two to record sound. You know, we had a lot of

135
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:56,038
overlap as you usually do. And I was able to flex my, you know, art, rapid concepting, game

136
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,901
design and team management muscles in the project in a very natural way.

137
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:04,816
and I also got to see the cycle of where you think your game is terrible for 99% of the

138
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:10,837
development time until your first playtest that we, after we had to finish and people

139
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:16,018
actually liked it and then I was like, I actually told people not to come to the playtest

140
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:20,179
session because we, all we had was garbage and people actually liked it, we won best

141
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:25,340
overall at the, at the game jam site, the same one that uh Mushroom 11 came out of.

142
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:30,344
uh that also won an award and the next day I went into work, still working in AAA and Evan

143
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:36,127
Narcis had written about it on Kotaku. Uh and and then I ran and I actually went to my first

144
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:40,289
GDC that year and I ran up to him and I thanked him for writing the article and that's another

145
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,852
good lesson like make free stuff while you're in AAA. Uh if someone writes about it keep in

146
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:50,114
contact with them because they will be interested in your future career. I mean I just I just

147
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:54,556
wrote we did a article called Video Games Blackness Problem that I was a part of and

148
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,353
because I've known him for years and we've been able to introduce other people to him too.

149
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:05,237
Uh my second game jam and subsequent prototyping projects were a lot less successful but that

150
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:09,881
was kind of par for the course and it was actually good to just start off and keep working on

151
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:14,384
things and finishing things. And also your first games don't actually have to really be bad. So

152
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:19,728
I mean you know just try to do something. Uh.

153
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:26,264
So this is actually interesting. So leaving a mediocre paying job with little savings and

154
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:31,225
shifting the money and responsibility balance in your family and living situation can be very

155
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:36,847
tough. I mean we talk about a lot of people have funding or whatever but I worked check to

156
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:42,790
check but I was like not interested in doing this stuff anymore. Seeing all this creative work

157
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,972
I was just like I can't stand this. But as the shadowy cabal nature of AAA is I can't really

158
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:49,772
talk about how I left.

159
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:53,057
But I left with minimal severance and some unemployment.

160
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:56,060
New York State actually offered a self-employment program

161
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,022
that allowed me to use unemployment

162
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,223
to fund self-employment.

163
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:01,585
And with this stuff being set up,

164
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,029
it was interesting because I still

165
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:07,992
had way less money than I had when I was in my job.

166
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:09,954
And even after having a conversation

167
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:11,816
with your partner, things can get difficult.

168
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:17,439
and game dev takes a long time and unexpected delays and the like can happen and you have to

169
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,300
stretch more, you stretch what little you have more and you know this affected my everyday

170
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,822
life and because of the personal nature I won't get too deep into this but you know the

171
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:32,884
highs and lows of 2014 actually kind of ended in the dissolution of my marriage so in a way you

172
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:39,626
could say part of me did not survive the jump from AAA to indie. I have only like one minute

173
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:49,586
thing. So I'm just gonna jump to the end. So in the end, uh, as an indie, you know, it's like

174
00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:52,949
bittersweet happiness. Like, oh, well, in AAA I looked at indie and it was like, oh, you're

175
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:56,873
gonna be super happy and you wanna make your own passion projects, but as an indie it's a

176
00:11:56,913 --> 00:12:01,077
bittersweet happiness. You know, my destiny is mine but my failures are mine as well. Uh, you

177
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:04,620
can't be too ambivalent about all the criticism you receive but you also can't beat

178
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,103
yourself up over making mistakes. Uh,

179
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:12,073
if you have a passion and you can get people to really, if you have a passion you can get people

180
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:16,054
to really care about what you're doing but it will take you throwing your own skin in the game.

181
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:20,935
Success can feel like it's always over the next hill and after tumbling over multiple hills it

182
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:25,957
can be exhausting but you have to keep pushing forward, stay positive but also practical. And

183
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:30,178
also if you have zeal, like even if you've never made games before, that's something that you can

184
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:31,058
do. Thank you.

185
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:44,911
Hey. That's weird. Um, Thomas was alone became famous because

186
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,454
it was a free game which Evan Narcisse wrote about so that's

187
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:55,823
so meet him. Um, that's a tip. Um, I think I'm next. I hope

188
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:59,828
I'm next. Yes I am. Woo! Um, okay.

189
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:02,815
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about community.

190
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:06,502
I guess it's the thing that, if I'm honest with myself,

191
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:07,785
I'm sort of best at.

192
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:11,892
I make good games, like I'm not ashamed of my games,

193
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,074
but I think one thing that...

194
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:18,337
I've done quite well is talking to a community about my games and interacting with them.

195
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:22,799
I'm illustrating some of these slides with fan art, which is lovely and a little bit

196
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:25,060
egotistical but it's pretty, so that's fine.

197
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:31,884
So the first point is, this is the first quote, is this is how I know I looked at it, and

198
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:32,765
a lot of people do.

199
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,786
If I make a good game, I'll get a community.

200
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,007
That's like 10% true.

201
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:40,989
We'll come back to that point throughout, but it's not that easy.

202
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:41,790
I wish it was.

203
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:48,196
Basically, the short version is there are about 10 indie devs in the world that are that good.

204
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:51,978
I'm not going to embarrass myself by naming them because I'll miss someone out.

205
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:58,883
I'm not that good. Statistically, it's unlikely any of you are. It might have been possible.

206
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:02,385
So we have to do the other things, which is what I'm going to talk about.

207
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:08,430
the skills that made me a good lead designer in, in the traditional games industry are not the

208
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,898
same skills I use now. There's an overlap, obviously, the game bit, um, but there's a lot of

209
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:19,286
stuff that I didn't know. Um, I was, I was a cog, I didn't really think about this stuff.

210
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:26,787
So I spent too long being afraid to assume I had fans.

211
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:30,549
Now, I don't know if this is a particularly British issue.

212
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,832
I know my American friends have less trouble with this.

213
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,154
I find it really uncomfortable to say the word fan

214
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:40,935
and to use that word to describe

215
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:43,877
the hundreds of thousands of people who've played my game.

216
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:49,301
Um, but I just boasted about my numbers so obviously I'm not the most humble person in the world.

217
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,583
Um, it feels awkward.

218
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:56,386
But the problem with that is while that makes you a nice human being in conversations

219
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:59,228
and makes people want to like invite you out for drinks a bit more often,

220
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:03,191
that humility actually can stand in the way of a lot of the stuff we're talking about.

221
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:06,573
Um, I know my natural inclination is to assume the worst.

222
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:07,194
To assume...

223
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:12,617
no one's going to buy volume, is genuinely something I still find myself saying when I'm

224
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:18,300
talking to colleagues, business partners, potential partners in the platforms and platform world.

225
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,882
I say, well, of course, you know, if volumes are flop, and that's fine,

226
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:28,104
and I think that's actually helps us, but at the same time, it limits my thinking.

227
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:32,888
if I'm not, if I'm prepared for being absolutely small and insignificant.

228
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,450
And it's dishonest because I know that I have an audience.

229
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,851
I know there are people who've played my games.

230
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:39,733
I know that the chances are a lot of those will want to play my future games.

231
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,715
I know that, you know, X number of Twitter followers, this kind of thing.

232
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:46,250
but we have to fight that urge to downplay that.

233
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,591
Conservative estimates basically get in the way.

234
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:50,632
We should consider them.

235
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:52,413
We should consider the number of people

236
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:53,333
who are playing our stuff.

237
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:56,375
We should consider that they actually exist.

238
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,195
The chances are you make any game,

239
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:00,616
you're going to have a few fans at the very least,

240
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:01,837
and that number will only increase.

241
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,158
We just need to be realistic, basically,

242
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,959
but not take them for granted, which is where we go next.

243
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,880
It's a fun journey through these slides.

244
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,122
So the first thing I learned very quickly

245
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:13,182
was to give something away.

246
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,401
Um, it's, it depends how you think about it. I think, again, we are very, we're very

247
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:22,881
conservative and very, uh, limited in our thinking often that we go, well, I need the

248
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:27,322
money now. Um, I was in a very fortunate position. I had a day job which covered my

249
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:32,323
rent and bills. That's a massive privilege and one that a lot of devs don't have. Um, but

250
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:35,444
I'm assuming given the subject of this talk a lot of you are in that boat that you're kind

251
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:38,684
of getting by, the mortgage is getting paid, this is something you're maybe thinking of

252
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:39,565
doing in your spare time.

253
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:43,613
or at least kind of starting in your spare time and then moving over.

254
00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:46,774
I know that everyone who...

255
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:51,397
So, one thing I did very early was everyone who bought the game before Steam,

256
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:54,819
so a few thousand people, so this was people who bought it direct and on DeZero,

257
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,400
I gave them a free key.

258
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,282
That's the email that I sent out to people,

259
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:02,963
kind of thanking them for buying the game and encouraging them to spend the money

260
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:05,505
they would have spent buying it on Steam to go and buy another indie game.

261
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:09,688
which is the kind of saccharine bullshit that I enjoy writing.

262
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,272
It's true, I am really that cheesy.

263
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,195
But I'm not faking it. I really am not.

264
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:22,340
But it was something that immediately made, I got loads of thank you emails.

265
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,882
It never really, it didn't make sense to me that I would get people to pay.

266
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:29,487
I did an interview earlier today about volume and one of the questions was...

267
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:34,476
is the game cross-buy. If I buy the game on PlayStation Vista, I also get on PS4, and it just

268
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:37,282
seems silly to me. Of course you do, you've already given me your money.

269
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:40,890
I don't need more of your money, I'd like more of your money, and by all means, you know...

270
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:45,417
But at the same time, it just struck me as very odd.

271
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:48,299
These random acts of kindness pay off

272
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,701
with unintended consequence.

273
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:50,661
They don't always pay off.

274
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,964
A great example I always go back to,

275
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,467
while I'm closing my notes by accident there, there we go,

276
00:17:57,528 --> 00:18:01,652
is I saw on Reddit, someone tweeted an image

277
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:03,373
of Thomas was alone's Steam page.

278
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:07,538
with the caption, my name is Tom and this just freaked me out

279
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:11,601
because I'm alone in the dark in my house and it freaked me out.

280
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:14,544
So I wrote him, and this was a bit fake,

281
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:17,787
I wrote him kind of a faux apology for upsetting him.

282
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:21,531
I wrote him kind of, you know, obviously it was not my intention to make you uncomfortable

283
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:23,352
sitting in the dark alone.

284
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:28,316
here's a free key for the game. Uh, that was on Reddit, the front page of Reddit for a day,

285
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:33,680
that email, um, because funny stuff works and people got into it. That doesn't mean that we

286
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,665
all need to now target Reddit by sending emails to everyone who posts about our game, but sometimes

287
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:43,828
these things work. Sometimes these, these, these approaches work. Uh, it's, it's, it's rare. The

288
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:46,770
point is you have to do a lot of silly things for one of them to work.

289
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:52,503
and you don't need to be in control. So this is something that I think we, and this is

290
00:18:52,523 --> 00:18:57,488
definitely something I'm aware of, is I'm used to the way marketing works in AAA, because

291
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:02,252
that was what I had the most awareness of. Um, so things like you have to set up a forum.

292
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:03,474
Why?

293
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:08,953
Like, seriously, why do I have to, like, for a big game, I guess it's useful.

294
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:10,894
You can sell ads and you can localize stuff.

295
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:14,775
But w but the, the goals of a big company are very different to my goals.

296
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:18,856
It makes no sense at all for me to try and centralize my community or own my

297
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:22,177
community or set up a website where my community gather, because my community

298
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:24,938
are a million people who've played a game for two hours.

299
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,101
They're not a community in that sense.

300
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:32,185
I'm not going to create a Facebook equivalent for the Thomas Was Alone fan base.

301
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:38,151
Now, that thinking, even things like wiki pages, so this is completely unlicensed wiki.

302
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:42,316
We're doing something similar with the same site for volume where I'm going to provide some help to them,

303
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:44,178
but ultimately it's not owned by me.

304
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:51,343
And it's the best thing ever. I actually use this website now to check story details if Thomas was alone

305
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:54,706
Before doing interviews genuinely or when answering questions

306
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:59,129
I actually check this page to get the spellings of some of the characters right not the main characters

307
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:07,235
Those are all you know first names. I'm not a child, but like the the the other characters in the backstory. It's useful and

308
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:11,078
That's because I don't own it because I wouldn't have made a resource as good as this one

309
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:20,683
It's also a way to put people off. It's very children's TV presenter to want to kind of corral your audience and look after them and tell them where to go and what to do.

310
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:26,447
Um, it's, it's, it's a bit creepy. And it's especially creepy. Big companies can get away with it because it's a big company.

311
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:35,054
But when you're just Mike Bithell from London and you're sending emails to people asking them to go inside up to a website so they can hang out with you, it's creepy. It's weird.

312
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:41,499
Um, the, the, the kind of unique kind of thing about Indies that we get to be individuals makes this stuff odd.

313
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:47,173
don't do it. And look after those individuals. So, uh, more fan, I love this fan art because

314
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:51,316
this fan art is about the meta story that's kind of hidden in Tom, not hidden, but there

315
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,078
in Thomas was alone, a lot of people don't notice that it's existing on a computer and

316
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:57,340
I just, I love that image. It's beautiful. I want to make that game next.

317
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,903
I'm not going to make that again, because that was not an announcement to any journalists in the room.

318
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:01,324
Please don't.

319
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:03,166
At the start with...

320
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:03,686
So, yeah.

321
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:05,528
So at the start, we can treat an audience well.

322
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,011
So when you're first starting out, when your game's kind of getting out there,

323
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,052
it's going to be small.

324
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:11,434
Unless you make something that just goes massive overnight.

325
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,457
But again, those are so rare, they're almost not worth discussing.

326
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:19,547
you're probably going to start small. Which means you can really look after each user.

327
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:23,711
You can really, like, and I did, like those first few thousand players of Thomas was

328
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:28,435
alone, I followed them all on Twitter, we had chats, they could send me questions about

329
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:32,718
levels they were stuck with, stuck in, I'd re, I'd reply to them. That was possible at

330
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:37,262
that stage, it quickly became impossible to actually maintain that and, and eat and live

331
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,984
and hang out with people and sleep. Um.

332
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:45,450
that's the order of my priorities apparently. I did that off the cuff and that's very telling.

333
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,793
That's very, it's always useful to make psychological breakthroughs in front of an

334
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:53,878
audience. Thank you very much. Um, uh, so, but as things got bigger that got harder,

335
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:58,503
um, and I had to learn to deal with that stuff. Um, what I found was basically, I kept in touch

336
00:21:58,543 --> 00:22:01,807
with a lot of those early people. I still follow a lot of them on Twitter and chat to them. Um,

337
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,631
it becomes a case of engaging more generally in a friendly way with your community.

338
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:08,354
I'm gonna have to rush because I've over over ad-libbed here.

339
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:10,276
It's okay to be a name. This is another thing.

340
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:13,419
I'm kind of annoyed like I'm wearing a Thomas was alone t-shirt right now.

341
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:17,985
I'm someone who kind of puts myself out there. I'm very visible, very noisy.

342
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:22,549
I decided I had to do that because my games are not good enough for me not to do that.

343
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:26,031
Like I said, there's those 10 developers who can be shy because they're geniuses.

344
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:28,674
I'm not. Statistically, you're not.

345
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:33,097
So therefore, we have to actually be okay with putting ourselves out there.

346
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:37,521
Now, I wrote this slide about four months ago in more naive times,

347
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:41,064
before a lot of the more obvious recent stuff that's been going on.

348
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:43,846
I don't want to say the word. It's weird. It's like Candyman.

349
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:51,290
But basically it's horrible and this slide becomes harder to convince. If you are someone who's

350
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,752
worried about having negative horrible stuff sent to you and you should be because that's human

351
00:22:56,412 --> 00:23:00,874
and it's not cowardly to be scared of that stuff, there are ways around it. You can create a

352
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:05,536
persona. That's what I do. I'm not the same on Twitter as I'm in real life. I have separate

353
00:23:06,116 --> 00:23:12,643
areas of my life. You can also create an alternative character. There are at least, I can think of one very specific game developer

354
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:13,884
that doesn't exist.

355
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:18,929
Is on Twitter, has more followers than me, but is a fake human being.

356
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:24,175
And this is the last note, because all of that, about all the marketing and stuff,

357
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:26,978
um, it's also important to have a good game.

358
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:29,240
Bad games don't have fans. You can do all of that.

359
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,081
If your game's not working, it's not gonna work.

360
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:34,024
The other guys will give you better advice than me on how to make good games, though.

361
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:36,386
Thank you for your time. I've gotta run, because I've overrun. Thank you.

362
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:48,771
Okay.

363
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:51,634
Right, here we go.

364
00:23:51,654 --> 00:23:57,019
If you're just like wondering who on earth I am, I'm basically the guy that made Democracy

365
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:00,722
and the Gratuitous Space Battles, Tank Battles, Games, stuff like that.

366
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:05,466
And I have a blog that a lot of people read and talk about.

367
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:10,147
Half of this talk is very practically how it feels

368
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:13,588
and what happens when you go from AAA to indie.

369
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:14,908
The other half is kind of like general

370
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:16,069
what it's like to be indie stuff.

371
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:19,789
And I've done the sort of like quit my job

372
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:21,690
and go indie twice, because the first time

373
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,730
I ran out of money and had to get a job.

374
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:28,851
Ironically, that's the job I got was in AAA.

375
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,792
So I've kind of experienced it twice.

376
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:40,852
Okay, this is my kind of like artist's impression, as it were, of how it actually feels when you go indie.

377
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:49,823
You should be really panicked and scared, because if you look around UDC, you see how many other people are like making games and it is quite a tough business.

378
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,202
One of the big problems I had, it kind of depends where you're from, but

379
00:24:56,943 --> 00:25:01,148
I live in some tiny little village where I'm the young person, believe it or not,

380
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:02,670
who, like, understands computers.

381
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,835
So, I don't have this, like, community of people to talk to about my game.

382
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:13,141
And if you work in AAA, you're used to talking about the game with everyone all the time.

383
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:19,385
If you then suddenly go to being indie, like, literally working in your bedroom,

384
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:23,689
then you... it kind of like depends on your circumstances,

385
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:25,972
but you may have no one to talk to about the game,

386
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:28,934
and that is suddenly very weird and very different.

387
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:35,537
It is perfectly natural for your parents to think that you're wasting your life.

388
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:38,818
This is perfectly normal.

389
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:45,161
And it's also very natural for people that you used to work with to say that you're nuts and you're doomed.

390
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:49,483
They don't do this as much since Minecraft.

391
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,984
because there's kind of like obvious counter examples.

392
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:59,346
And they're not kind of being cruel and they're not doing it maliciously.

393
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:01,746
It's just if you've decided to do it and they haven't,

394
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:04,027
obviously they want to feel good about their decision

395
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:05,768
to kind of like stay within AAA.

396
00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:08,369
So you do kind of get a skewed opinion there.

397
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,410
It is very important to sort of get out there and meet other Indies

398
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,271
because, like I say, you don't have this support group anymore.

399
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:21,494
You have to accept the fact that you may fail and end up with no money and have to get a job flipping burgers.

400
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:22,955
I mean, that just is the reality.

401
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,037
It's, I would say, probable, actually.

402
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:30,679
And if you can't handle that, then don't do it, frankly.

403
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,883
You also have to realize that suddenly you're a small businessman or woman

404
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:42,366
and you may find it hard to identify with the problems that your buddies in AAA have.

405
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:49,357
This seems ridiculous, but I think one of the most important things about going indie is getting a good office chair.

406
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:52,439
Nobody really thinks about it, but...

407
00:26:53,560 --> 00:27:00,865
If you had, like, a similar kind of job in terms of, like, you're a one-man band or two-man band or whatever,

408
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:02,986
and you're a plumber or an electrician...

409
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:06,427
you wouldn't kind of balk at buying a decent van

410
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:09,128
because that's just the cost of doing business.

411
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,789
And having decent equipment and a decent office,

412
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:13,429
even if it's like a home office,

413
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,531
and a comfortable chair to sit in, you need that.

414
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:19,231
And yes, you can justify it.

415
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:22,392
It doesn't have to be thousands, but not a $20 chair.

416
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:26,573
And if you're in your 20s, you can shake it off,

417
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:28,334
but as you get older, no, you need a good chair.

418
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:35,098
Yeah, archery. I know it sounds ridiculous, but the sport for you is archery.

419
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:39,841
And I know that just sounds like some crazy English guy that lives in a field saying that.

420
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:45,125
I actually really love archery, but one of the motivations for doing it is

421
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:48,488
if you get into archery, you have to stand up absolutely straight,

422
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:51,930
you have to concentrate, and you have to stare at something a long way away.

423
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:54,032
And that is the complete opposite of game development.

424
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:57,855
So, you know, it's just really good for you.

425
00:27:58,295 --> 00:27:59,376
It gets you outside as well.

426
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,334
Yeah, this is kind of the change that a lot of people

427
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:07,916
kind of can't cope with.

428
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,058
They don't think about the money.

429
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:12,041
They get caught up in a very kind of like GDC positive,

430
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:15,044
I'm making a game and it's cool and I'm following my dreams

431
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:16,465
and it's gonna be so artistic.

432
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:19,488
But actually there's a load of kind of businessy stuff.

433
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,011
Suddenly you need decent hardware and you need licenses.

434
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:25,933
I'm one of these smug people in England

435
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,815
that doesn't have to pay for healthcare.

436
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:29,176
Woo!

437
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,218
But, well I know we pay for it.

438
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:35,401
But yeah, suddenly you have to worry about that stuff.

439
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:39,805
And Breaking Bad teaches me that it can all go tits up

440
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:41,106
if you don't have healthcare.

441
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:43,408
So suddenly you need to worry about that,

442
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:45,029
you need to worry about the corporation tax rate

443
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:45,750
and stuff like that.

444
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,177
This is a slide kind of from a talk I did a long time ago

445
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,962
that just like breaks down the numbers of how much money

446
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,388
you need in terms of game sales to actually have

447
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:57,831
enough money to live on.

448
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,287
And so I kind of looked up in the UK

449
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:03,208
what the average income is.

450
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:06,650
And if you scale it up and take away all this other stuff,

451
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,611
and you're making one game a year,

452
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,652
and it always does well and makes money,

453
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:13,534
and you're never ill, and you never have to take time off

454
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:16,716
or whatever, then yeah, you definitely

455
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,377
need to gross at least $100,000 a year.

456
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:22,019
And I know people talk about making huge amounts of money,

457
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,781
but actually, selling $100,000 worth of games

458
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:26,022
is actually really hard.

459
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:31,671
I also like publish indie games, so I get pitches.

460
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:36,675
And most of them are absolutely hilariously bad.

461
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:39,918
Most of the game ideas are good. The games look good.

462
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,781
You know, the programmers are talented, the people have talent.

463
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,483
But then when they get to like the business slide if there is one

464
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,765
It's it's often just just like funny if you've been in the industry a long time

465
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:53,786
The marketing budget is always zero

466
00:29:54,187 --> 00:29:59,889
Because they're Indies and they're like gorilla and a bit rude a bit way and like they don't need to do any advertising or anything

467
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:00,170
Like that

468
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:07,553
Um, and they stupidly think that a, a team of people who can make a really good successful piece

469
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:12,836
of software are all gonna, uh, like work in coffee shops and like sleep on the floor and eat

470
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:18,179
noodles and stuff like that. And that's really romantic for the first week, but like after a year,

471
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:24,322
no, everyone will quit. Everyone will go and work for, you know, some bank. So you have to budget

472
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:25,423
for that. You really do.

473
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:30,459
Yeah, and also if you're going to go to GDC, it's hellishly expensive.

474
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,321
If your plans are, I don't need a marketing budget, I'm just going to go to GDC and network,

475
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:39,363
well, you know, you've got flights and hotels and if you live in Europe, you know, that's

476
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:40,723
going to cost you a small fortune.

477
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:46,607
And one way of thinking about this is if you are an electrician, you have, for example,

478
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:50,849
and you are kind of like an electrician, you are a small business, and they have all these costs

479
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:54,471
that it just goes without saying that they're going to have to spend this stuff.

480
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:59,414
And game developers seem to think that they won't need any tools, they won't need an accountant,

481
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,075
they won't need all this boring stuff, but you do.

482
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:05,241
Okay, this is, I keep pimping this book,

483
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:07,703
and I keep pimping it so much that

484
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,005
I really should have shares in it or something.

485
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:11,646
But it is a really good book.

486
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:15,129
And that book is kind of just there for people

487
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:16,631
that think advertising doesn't work.

488
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:20,934
It does, it's one of those things where it just does.

489
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:23,757
If you disagree, I'm afraid you are just wrong,

490
00:31:24,457 --> 00:31:25,518
and you need to read that book.

491
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:29,362
If you know it works, or you will accept that it works,

492
00:31:29,402 --> 00:31:30,723
but you're not really sure how,

493
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:33,145
there's another book called Seducing the Subconscious,

494
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,147
because adverts don't work the way you think they do.

495
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,550
And it does work for indie game developers.

496
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,052
People think that it doesn't, but it does.

497
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:44,774
But it is quite technical.

498
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:46,435
You have to know about what you're doing.

499
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:48,517
Advertising used to be like Mad Men.

500
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:51,279
Maybe it's not anymore, and it's incredibly technical.

501
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,141
And you will just burn your money

502
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:54,782
if you don't really look into how to do it.

503
00:31:55,932 --> 00:32:02,939
A few other bits. This is why I do strategy games at $20 or more, because I can advertise them and it makes sense.

504
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,105
If you're making like a $5 game, don't advertise. I don't know how you're going to sell that. I just have no idea.

505
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:12,649
Maybe you'll get lucky, I don't know. But you won't do it with this model.

506
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:24,881
You cannot track advertising. You can track it a bit and there's loads of companies here and I'm sure there are loads of talks about analytics and that's great and go to those talks and learn all about it but you cannot track it 100%.

507
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:32,889
And that puts people off, that puts geeks off. They hate it. They say I've spent this amount and I can't track that it was worth it.

508
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,497
but they're at GDC.

509
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:36,938
And when you say to them,

510
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,579
why are you at GDC?

511
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,520
Are you sure you got value from that?

512
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,320
They're like,

513
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,802
you know, probably, you must have done.

514
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,623
And they would do that,

515
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:47,084
but they won't take that same risk

516
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:48,565
on spending money on advertising.

517
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:50,206
It's the same kind of thing.

518
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:51,466
It's an investment in, you know,

519
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:52,807
PR, marketing, your game.

520
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,233
This is me just sort of like pimping advertising again, really.

521
00:32:59,655 --> 00:33:03,400
So it's quite easy to look up how much you've spent on Google AdWords, which is why that's on there,

522
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,405
but I don't think it's even the majority of the money that I've spent on advertising.

523
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:10,549
These are just stats that nobody tells anyone.

524
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,032
So when you look at your stats, if you do some advertising,

525
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:15,934
and you sort of think, is this shit?

526
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:16,935
I have no idea.

527
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:18,797
You can Google it.

528
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,619
No, nobody shares stats like this.

529
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,921
So it's quite important just to kind of know

530
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:26,744
what at least one other person's stats were.

531
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,060
One of the things that I really like about advertising is it's guaranteed coverage,

532
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,581
and it's the only guaranteed coverage you can ever get.

533
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,802
If you want to be on the front page of Rock Paper Shotgun next week,

534
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,303
it's easy, if you've got the money.

535
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:45,964
And obviously that's a real pain, and it's a real nightmare,

536
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:49,946
but you can guarantee it, and you cannot with anything else.

537
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:57,272
You have to have charisma and know people and like you know have an amazing game and all this other stuff and still you

538
00:33:57,292 --> 00:33:58,373
Have to hope for the best

539
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:01,496
but the reason that a lot of people advertise is

540
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,481
if you if you pay someone to have a banner ad or whatever for your game, then it will definitely be there and

541
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:14,047
That's kind of quite reassuring. You know your game won't be ignored obviously the downside is you have to find the money for it

542
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:21,820
So yeah, it is quite scary if you kind of like look at some of these sums about how much money I'm suggesting people

543
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:23,402
spend to promote their game.

544
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:26,266
And I'm only saying it because, you know, it works.

545
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,935
Okay, I'm running out of time and that's it. Thank you very much.

546
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,021
Hey, I'm Bort, and I'll start with a little bit about myself.

547
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,502
Back in 2001, I went indie before it was like actually

548
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:50,682
that's what it was called.

549
00:34:51,783 --> 00:34:54,543
And there were four of us, and we were trying to build a demo

550
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:57,524
and pitch it to publishers, building our own engine,

551
00:34:57,884 --> 00:34:58,704
all this sort of folly.

552
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,624
And we eventually ran out of money,

553
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,225
and I went to work for Radical, and then Sony Online, and EA.

554
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:10,104
And eventually I left EA as it was kind of like in the middle of canceling projects in like 2009

555
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:13,992
And started working on Skulls of the Shogun in collaboration with 17-bit

556
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:20,560
And so with Skulls, we eventually signed a deal with Microsoft to publish on Xbox 360,

557
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,564
Windows 8, Windows Phone, and then we self-published on all the other platforms

558
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:27,266
and we're coming out on PS4 in a few months.

559
00:35:27,646 --> 00:35:32,571
So I'm here to talk about publishers and give you my wisdom over that whole time frame,

560
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:35,614
all the meetings I've had with them and the relationships I've had with them,

561
00:35:35,954 --> 00:35:36,755
how to deal with them.

562
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:45,968
I mean, it's not just the basic, like, okay, they'll take a cut of your profits that hinders your ability to sustain your business.

563
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:52,370
It's also the fact that you think that they will bring, like, their business and, you know, marketing skills to the table,

564
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,571
but the reality is you will need to learn to do those things anyway.

565
00:35:55,911 --> 00:36:00,793
So you really have to look hard at what they're saving you and what they're bringing to the relationship.

566
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:05,834
So there's two main kinds, right now anyway, in terms of publishers.

567
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:08,015
Platform owners, the Microsofts, the Sonys of the world.

568
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:10,843
And you think of these, okay, they have a solid user base,

569
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:13,305
they have channels to promote to their users,

570
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,487
that kind of thing, but in reality it's more like this.

571
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:18,649
There's so many platforms, they're all overcrowded,

572
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:21,311
the value of getting a feature on any one of them

573
00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:23,912
has just gone down from day one on all of them pretty much.

574
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,054
And so you think, well, okay,

575
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:27,695
they're promotional-only publishers,

576
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:30,797
and they have the PR skills, the business skills

577
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,919
that you might lack, and you feel like

578
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:34,700
you have the game-making skills,

579
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,101
you can bring those together, that'd be great.

580
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:39,594
But in reality, 90% of them are more just

581
00:36:39,654 --> 00:36:42,416
like they're just sort of leech value and not really adding

582
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:43,817
value right now in the industry.

583
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,579
And so I'll talk more about that in a second.

584
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,182
The third is sort of the more elusive development funding

585
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:50,702
publisher.

586
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:51,883
And there's not a lot of them.

587
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:53,784
And I would have had a picture of a unicorn.

588
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:55,945
But like Cliff said, he actually does a little bit of that.

589
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:56,986
So it's not entirely true.

590
00:36:57,026 --> 00:36:57,627
But it's pretty rare.

591
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,669
And some of the logic and the rules and advice I'll give

592
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:02,690
kind of apply to those two from each category.

593
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:07,840
So obviously with a platform owning publisher you get some

594
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,781
dev funding, you get on their platform, uh, and they usually

595
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:13,462
want exclusivity or like highlighting their features.

596
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:15,763
With Skulls of the Shogun Microsoft liked that we could

597
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:18,865
play asynchronously across the PC and the console and the

598
00:37:18,885 --> 00:37:21,446
tablet and the phone, all these things. And that was what they

599
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:25,168
wanted. And so, you know, in terms of, you know, you think of

600
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:27,409
exclusivity and it's like, oh no, you don't want to give that

601
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:27,669
away.

602
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:32,258
But in reality, there's a certain amount of time it will take for you to port your game to the next platform.

603
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:36,420
And giving away excessivity under that time is basically free to you.

604
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,263
And they will give you money for that, which is great.

605
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:46,367
So, on the flip side, if they want more excessivity, you can tie that to, you know, higher sales amounts.

606
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:50,890
So if you sell really well on their platform, enough to sustain their business, they get more excessivity.

607
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,432
So it turns out to be a more fair arrangement.

608
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:58,385
And one more thing to think about when big companies are making new platforms.

609
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:01,829
There's always a business opportunity there and sometimes a creative opportunity.

610
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:06,093
But the reality is, it's a big company trying to do something innovative.

611
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:10,598
And so there's even more gear grinding and bureaucracy you might have to deal with.

612
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:15,343
And that's definitely time beyond just the tech development of working with beta software and that kind of thing.

613
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:23,093
Now with promotional-only publishers, I've seen a bunch of contracts that they'll hand you just to start,

614
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:29,359
and it's like, I'll take, you know, they'll take a certain percentage of your royalties for no guaranteed marketing.

615
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,502
Like no marketing budget, no specified amounts.

616
00:38:32,522 --> 00:38:36,666
It's like, well, how about we just leave an unspecified amount of royalties in that contract?

617
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:43,010
So the real question to you is like, you know, what can they commit to in writing?

618
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,533
Because you might think they are essentially being rewarded if the game does well, if they promote it.

619
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:50,034
You know, the more they promote it, the more it sells, the more money they make.

620
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:54,437
But in reality, they're actually rewarded for signing like 10 indies.

621
00:38:54,977 --> 00:38:56,198
They don't have to do much work.

622
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:58,139
One of them hits, and they make money from that.

623
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,223
So the system isn't really set up right now in the current state of the industry for that to sort of foster.

624
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:06,825
So yeah, you have to look at what can they commit to in writing.

625
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,945
And you might think, well, what...

626
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:10,216
you know, these things are sort of amorphous.

627
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:13,417
But no, like going to a show like PAX has specific travel costs.

628
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:15,938
Buying online advertising has specific costs.

629
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,478
So if they can't build a marketing budget and show it to you,

630
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:21,119
then they probably don't know how to market your game.

631
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:25,800
And so really be extremely skeptical of any sort of, you know,

632
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,361
claims of their promotional ability.

633
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:31,542
Something else you also want to consider is, like, actual spending caps.

634
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:33,723
And you might think, oh, let them spend all they want.

635
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:36,003
But the reality is, if they're spending money ineffectively,

636
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:41,706
then that's coming out of your bottom line and you need to be like, you need to have some kind of input in that process.

637
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:49,550
And just towards the overall negotiation process, you know, it's an old adage but being able to walk away.

638
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,172
And you might go into it and you might think you've got to get this money, it's the only way you're going to make your game.

639
00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:59,015
But if you can't talk yourself out of that, you will just put yourself in a position where you accept a deal

640
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:02,197
that will really impact your life, you know, negatively and stressfully.

641
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:04,118
It will not be worth it, I guarantee it.

642
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,562
And so you want to find what they want,

643
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:08,485
what's your leverage, what's unique about you

644
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:11,510
that you can then use to kind of be creative

645
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,732
and figure out their needs

646
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,596
and come to a creative solution in terms of things.

647
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:18,140
So stuff like sliding exclusivity scales.

648
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:20,973
And I've done this before myself.

649
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:22,354
I've seen many friends do it.

650
00:40:22,694 --> 00:40:24,096
Never chase money.

651
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:26,838
Like, whenever a publisher asks you to change something

652
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,800
in a pitch or a demo, and they're

653
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,843
doing it for free without a contract in your hand,

654
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:32,884
just don't do it.

655
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:34,826
Like, that's the big, big red flag.

656
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,349
I've seen people just keep doing that, keep chasing,

657
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:39,892
keep making tweaks for a particular partner.

658
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:45,349
and it just never sort of appears visually,

659
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:46,170
you know, comes together.

660
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,934
Anyway, so definitely, you know,

661
00:40:49,174 --> 00:40:50,676
keep that as a sign of a red flag.

662
00:40:50,836 --> 00:40:54,481
And lastly, just understand that you're going to be dealing

663
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:55,763
with two or three BizDev people,

664
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:58,066
they're gonna hand that off to their legal team.

665
00:40:58,507 --> 00:41:01,368
which is potentially tens if not hundreds of lawyers.

666
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:03,570
And they're going to give you back a boilerplate contract

667
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,091
which will not include anything that you talked about.

668
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:08,112
And you have to go back to them and be like,

669
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:09,833
we talked about X, Y, and Z,

670
00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:11,214
and then they'll put it in the contract.

671
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:13,095
Don't be offended, don't be pissed off.

672
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:14,896
It's just a sort of a side effect

673
00:41:14,996 --> 00:41:16,457
of the organizational structure.

674
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:21,436
So in the future we'll definitely see more promotional only publishers.

675
00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:25,717
You know, we'll see YouTubers are effectively becoming publishers.

676
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:29,558
The successful ones will kind of build a name for themselves and what they promote.

677
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:31,898
Folks like Devolver Digital do a great job.

678
00:41:31,938 --> 00:41:35,539
You can see them, like the games they promote, you can see where they promote them and how

679
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,139
they promote them.

680
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:41,520
And now, let's players are basically taking royalties of games for like set numbers of

681
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,541
videos and that's a great sort of equation in the sense that you know how many subscribers

682
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:45,961
they have.

683
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:46,762
You know.

684
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,623
what percentage they're going to take, how many videos they're going to make,

685
00:41:49,783 --> 00:41:52,245
and you can estimate how much your game's going to make

686
00:41:52,285 --> 00:41:56,227
and decide if that number of impressions is worth it to you for that cost.

687
00:41:57,728 --> 00:41:59,610
And lastly, just some parting advice.

688
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,493
So like I said, all these sort of skills,

689
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:05,574
selling your own game, business development,

690
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:08,056
you're going to have to learn those on your own regardless.

691
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:10,618
And so what the publisher really brings to the table,

692
00:42:10,938 --> 00:42:15,101
you really have to kind of look at what demonstrable value they can bring.

693
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,881
And so, you know, if you really absolutely do need external money to fund the game,

694
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:22,762
like really question yourself.

695
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:24,083
I'm like, how can you scope it down?

696
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:25,484
How can you make it without that money?

697
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:30,146
Is there any sort of, you know, game in that range that is feasible?

698
00:42:31,307 --> 00:42:34,408
And you got, like I said, you're gonna have to sell your own game anyway and

699
00:42:34,848 --> 00:42:36,229
do your own business development.

700
00:42:36,629 --> 00:42:37,190
So yeah.

701
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,370
What did they bring to the table?

702
00:42:50,622 --> 00:42:53,385
Alright, now time for the last session.

703
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,969
And that's me on, I'm sorry.

704
00:42:57,762 --> 00:43:01,684
Time for the last session and that's me on multi-platform PC and mobile development.

705
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:07,226
So what I want to talk about in this session is basically the question of what do we do about mobile.

706
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:14,890
If you're starting a new project or you're thinking of starting a new project coming from AAA,

707
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:18,132
we're kind of familiar with either PC or console development.

708
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:22,774
We're familiar with the market. We're probably gamers, so we kind of know how, you know...

709
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:29,844
Press works and so on. But what about mobile? Right? I mean, it's a huge market. We all know the stats about how many millions of devices there are out there.

710
00:43:30,305 --> 00:43:35,272
We've all heard about Supercell or King making unknown millions of dollars a day probably.

711
00:43:35,973 --> 00:43:37,535
Um, do we try to do this?

712
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:45,483
So the background is that I come from, you know, EA, Three Rings, Zynga, sort of large mid-sized companies,

713
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:51,608
mostly PC development, web and console a little bit, then decided to go indie.

714
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:59,054
We released a game called 1849, which was a simulation strategy game on PC and tablet last year, this time.

715
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:04,340
And that was actually really interesting. It was a premium title, so you know, pay once,

716
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,542
play as much as you want, not a free-to-play game.

717
00:44:07,503 --> 00:44:10,186
And so I'm gonna be sharing some of the lessons from that.

718
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:15,092
And just to start with conclusions, and we'll sort of unpack them a little bit,

719
00:44:15,813 --> 00:44:21,279
I think at this point, I wouldn't do a mobile-only indie title. I mean, honestly, I think that ship has sailed.

720
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:29,742
If you do a premium game that's mobile only, it's too risky because your sales are completely dependent on getting featured

721
00:44:30,322 --> 00:44:33,563
or getting a good word of mouth, both of which are very difficult.

722
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:35,804
And without them, you're dead in the water.

723
00:44:36,964 --> 00:44:40,045
But free-to-play is too expensive for an indie developer.

724
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:44,646
I mean, buying ads is how you get players, and ads are expensive.

725
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:47,468
But I think there is hope in cross-platform development.

726
00:44:47,808 --> 00:44:50,269
So if you start with PC, or maybe console,

727
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:54,811
but I'll talk about PC mainly, that is something

728
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:56,431
that we know how to do.

729
00:44:56,912 --> 00:44:58,092
We know how to build up that audience.

730
00:44:58,412 --> 00:45:01,614
And we can use that to then improve our chances on mobile

731
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:04,335
and to make the game sort of larger

732
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,615
and available to more players.

733
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:08,476
And yeah, you will have to adapt the game,

734
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:10,177
redo the UI, that kind of stuff.

735
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:12,658
But I think it's worth it because.

736
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:15,300
who doesn't want a larger audience, right?

737
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:21,344
Going mobile plus PC means more players, means more discussion, means

738
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:26,448
more word of mouth, buzz. It also means diversifying your revenue sources, so

739
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:26,769
you're not

740
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:31,352
depending solely on your Steam sales or your iOS sales or whatever.

741
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:35,497
And that's always good. Here's our stats for 2014.

742
00:45:36,638 --> 00:45:40,543
For the game that I mentioned before, 41% of that sold on Steam,

743
00:45:41,304 --> 00:45:44,308
40% sold on mobile, iOS and Android combined.

744
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:49,775
That's a huge chunk of the sales, right? It would be a shame not to do that.

745
00:45:50,896 --> 00:45:52,956
But, as I mentioned, it has to work with the design, right?

746
00:45:53,096 --> 00:45:59,418
It has to work not just with the UI, not just making the swipe feel correctly or whatever,

747
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:03,518
but also with how you approach the players and how you approach what they expect, because

748
00:46:03,538 --> 00:46:06,819
your mobile players are going to be different from your PC players.

749
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:10,580
Mobile players, you know, I'm going to stereotype this right now, but they're more casual, they're

750
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,120
more occasional.

751
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:21,466
They're going to be maybe getting game recommendations from their family or friends, but they typically are not going to be seeking out your title as much as PC gamers.

752
00:46:21,526 --> 00:46:28,049
PC gamers are enthusiasts, they're into their hobby, they are opinionated, and they know what they like.

753
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,554
Also, some of them will react poorly to what they think are mobile ports.

754
00:46:32,714 --> 00:46:33,855
So that's something to keep in mind.

755
00:46:34,796 --> 00:46:37,499
Because these are different audiences and they value different things,

756
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,384
you not only have to change your UI and UX to meet their expectations,

757
00:46:41,944 --> 00:46:44,507
but you also have to change your communication style,

758
00:46:44,587 --> 00:46:46,609
which is something we actually failed to do with our game.

759
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:52,494
And now we've learned and we're going to do it for our next game, which is you need different product stories,

760
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:57,539
because your mobile audience is going to value accessibility and short play sessions,

761
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,042
and your PC audience is going to be a little bit more hardcore.

762
00:47:01,202 --> 00:47:05,786
They're going to value different things, so different store descriptions, different YouTube videos,

763
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:07,947
different artwork, different screenshots.

764
00:47:08,648 --> 00:47:11,530
Your entire story needs to be tailored to the audience.

765
00:47:13,032 --> 00:47:16,173
So if you do go with PC and mobile, what kind of a revenue model do you do?

766
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:23,655
I would say premium is easy because it matches sales on Steam or one of those stores.

767
00:47:24,896 --> 00:47:27,777
So it's easy, right? Just pay for the game once and you're done.

768
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:34,779
One thing to keep in mind though is that it's hard to scale the revenues up in a premium model.

769
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,522
as you grow your studio, because you are going to be capped at some level.

770
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:41,565
We've all heard about Monument Valley, for example.

771
00:47:41,786 --> 00:47:44,789
Beautiful game, super popular, justifiably so.

772
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:51,035
I think they were recently reported as making some number of millions of dollars in lifetime revenue.

773
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:52,656
Now that's lifetime, right?

774
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:59,060
all the stars aligned for them. They got Game of the Year awards, they got multiple

775
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,841
featuring by Apple, I mean, it was perfect. By definition, there's only going to be one

776
00:48:03,861 --> 00:48:07,643
game of the year per year, right? Most of us are not going to be that lucky, even if

777
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:12,145
we make good games. So we have to keep in mind that without all of that stuff coming

778
00:48:12,185 --> 00:48:16,046
together, we're probably looking at maybe hundreds of thousands, if we're unlucky, tens

779
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:21,468
of thousands of dollars in lifetime revenues on premium on mobile. So that's not a, you

780
00:48:21,488 --> 00:48:21,568
know,

781
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:25,090
not to scare anybody about it, it's kind of a realistic thing.

782
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:31,733
Which is again going back to, well, if we combine that with PC, that's a different story.

783
00:48:32,373 --> 00:48:42,017
Free-to-play, I don't think it's a feasible thing for indies, because you're going to be going up against big players who spend a lot of money to acquire users,

784
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:44,398
and we don't have that kind of money. I mean, unless...

785
00:48:44,418 --> 00:48:51,061
If you're running a startup that's already venture-funded, then you can ignore the rest of the stuff. You're in a completely different league.

786
00:48:52,402 --> 00:49:03,393
And if you're looking at ads as a revenue source, there are some recent good examples of that, but historically they have not been worth it too much.

787
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:07,236
You have to have a huge viral hit for that to work, and those are very rare.

788
00:49:08,637 --> 00:49:13,038
If you do go with premium, picking a price point is going to be difficult and there's no good

789
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:20,220
solution to this basically because your anchoring on PC is high and unfortunately on mobile it is

790
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:29,463
not, right? A mobile $5 game is expensive. People will not like to pay that. If you're Minecraft

791
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:32,203
or if you're Final Fantasy you can charge $8, right?

792
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:39,772
that's not, you know, compared to the cost of developing it, that's a kind of a different story.

793
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:44,934
So you're, typically people go with this tiered approach where they do one price on PC and

794
00:49:44,974 --> 00:49:49,275
another price on mobile. And yes, there will be a fraction of your PC players who are going

795
00:49:49,295 --> 00:49:54,957
to be upset by this because they will see this as you making a $5 game and then charging

796
00:49:55,157 --> 00:50:00,018
them $15. They're not thinking of it as it's a $15 game that has to be discounted on mobile.

797
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,279
So just keep this in mind. Maybe one solution to this is to make...

798
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,241
something different about the PC game that justifies a higher price point.

799
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:14,704
Getting the word out is also interesting in the mobile world. On PC, on console, we kind of know how that works.

800
00:50:14,724 --> 00:50:22,508
We know how to talk to the press, we know what the press is interested in, we know that gamers read and interact with gaming media,

801
00:50:22,988 --> 00:50:25,570
YouTube, all that stuff. In mobile it's different.

802
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:36,177
From my experience and from reading player surveys, the two biggest drivers for purchase of a premium game on mobile are store featuring and word of mouth.

803
00:50:36,778 --> 00:50:42,082
And store featuring is a complete crap shoot because you will not know whether you're going to get featured until you've already made the game.

804
00:50:43,283 --> 00:50:48,547
And then word of mouth is just difficult to get because it depends on people knowing each other and talking about your game.

805
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:55,630
Ads, I don't think, work very well for premium. People have been habituated to when they click on an ad for a game,

806
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,692
that it's going to be a free game, and they're going to bounce when they discover you're asking them to pay.

807
00:51:00,272 --> 00:51:08,775
And review sites are not as influential as on the PC side, again, because mobile gamers are not hobbyists in the same way that PC gamers are.

808
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:16,498
So they will, you know, they will read less, maybe, review sites and, yeah, they're just a different audience.

809
00:51:16,899 --> 00:51:30,349
So, once again, if you do a PC version first, then you can build up your PC fan base based on the ways you know about, get people excited, and then use that to promote your mobile game.

810
00:51:30,649 --> 00:51:35,953
And then one last word is about getting featured, because it is a crucial thing in getting your game out.

811
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:45,184
Basically, it's not black magic, right? Platforms look for games that will showcase the quality of their platform.

812
00:51:45,204 --> 00:51:51,772
So, of course, you have to have a quality game, right? I'm patting myself on the back because we got featured by both Apple and Google.

813
00:51:52,794 --> 00:51:54,736
But, don't wait to be discovered.

814
00:51:56,438 --> 00:52:03,122
platforms do have biz dev people who are looking actively for games to feature. Find your own biz dev

815
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:08,025
people who will represent you. There are contractors who do business development who just like book

816
00:52:08,485 --> 00:52:14,189
authors agents, the way that authors agents represent authors to publishers, same way people

817
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:19,312
will represent you to Apple and Google. Find them, hire them, and don't wait to be discovered.

818
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:26,436
seek it out yourself. So that's the end of my slides. Thank you very much. And that's our talk.

819
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:37,023
And now let's do some Q&A. If you'd like to come up to the mics in the middle, if you have

820
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:42,746
questions for a particular person, please ask them by name, otherwise you can just ask at all of us.

821
00:52:43,086 --> 00:52:43,286
Thank you.

822
00:52:46,592 --> 00:52:51,956
Hello, thank you for the talk, that was awesome. I find that for me personally, one of my biggest

823
00:52:51,976 --> 00:52:56,920
struggles is still working in the AAA and just trying to work on my own projects, because

824
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,022
professionally I'm an engineer, but I'm trying to work on my design skills through my side

825
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:00,462
projects.

826
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:05,647
there's this constant tension of trying to work on my project outside of work and burning out

827
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:11,692
very quickly because I'm working AAA full time all day and so it's hard to find the time and

828
00:53:11,712 --> 00:53:16,496
energy to work on the side projects. And yet needing those side projects partly to prepare

829
00:53:16,536 --> 00:53:22,721
myself to do design work on my own stuff and also to have projects ready to work on as soon as I

830
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:27,845
take the plunge. So I was wondering if you guys had any thoughts on just kind of dealing with

831
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:28,866
that inherent tension.

832
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:38,235
I'd say, I mean, I had to actively, I think we were maybe in crunch when I did the Global

833
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:41,979
Game Jam and I said, I'm not coming in this weekend and I did the Global Game Jam.

834
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:48,427
I mean I'd say like, call in sick on Friday of the Global Game Jam and just hang out all

835
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:49,728
weekend and make a game.

836
00:53:51,434 --> 00:53:56,058
Um, personally, like I think, um, so I was very lucky in that the, my last

837
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:58,641
company I worked at for two years while I made Thomas was alone, were aware of

838
00:53:58,681 --> 00:53:59,341
Thomas was alone.

839
00:53:59,381 --> 00:54:02,324
It had kind of gotten a name for itself at that point, but still I was going

840
00:54:02,344 --> 00:54:03,245
home and working every night.

841
00:54:03,585 --> 00:54:07,889
The, all I can, all I can advise was I found, I found that what worked for me

842
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:12,714
was doing something that was so different, so vastly separated from what I was doing

843
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:13,114
at work.

844
00:54:13,695 --> 00:54:42,391
actually made it a hobby. So Thomas was Alone was, you know, specifically a game that had nothing to do with, I was making social games by day at that point. I was working on, you remember Facebook games? They were awesome. Remember GDC like three years ago? Funny times. So I was doing that stuff by day. So for me, like going home and making a platform was just like, it was a hobby. It was different enough that it would felt interesting. The other thing I would suggest as well is you specifically describe your skills, play to your skills, especially with the project now, because you haven't got time

845
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:47,734
We should always push ourselves, but push yourselves within the criteria.

846
00:54:47,814 --> 00:54:53,037
If you're not, like for me, I knew I was a graphic designer who was a decent level designer

847
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:57,700
and could write for a bit, and therefore designed a game that was entirely about those skill

848
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,541
sets so that I didn't hit those walls, because the walls are what kills it.

849
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:06,165
The walls, when you hit that wall and it's like, I need to go and learn how to do something,

850
00:55:06,285 --> 00:55:11,088
that's the point where suddenly watching Breaking Bad box sets just seems like a better play.

851
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:19,151
Thank you. I just add to that I think just go home on time. You know, even if you're in the

852
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:23,454
AAA industry and everyone's like, oh, you have to work really late, everyone works late. And

853
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:28,297
I've been there when I've walked out and everyone is still in the room coding. And I just think,

854
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:32,520
well, I don't care. But be prepared because I've been in that position. Be prepared for

855
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:38,465
everyone to hate you. Like, no, I know I have this cavalier way. Genuinely, like be prepared.

856
00:55:38,858 --> 00:55:43,042
to be the asshole in the office who doesn't stay because I had to make that choice. And it

857
00:55:43,582 --> 00:55:46,565
burned some bridges. Some people didn't like me because, you know what, Mike's gone, it's

858
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:52,771
five o'clock, Mike's gone. That was a choice I had to make. It's a hard choice, especially if

859
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:55,113
things had gone the other way and the game hadn't worked out.

860
00:55:57,195 --> 00:56:02,820
Hi, my name is Stephanie. Question for you. Going from Terbillia to Indie, team sizes

861
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,082
change, right? So...

862
00:56:05,105 --> 00:56:09,809
What are your takeaways on, is there any role that,

863
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:11,730
going from those big teams to small team,

864
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,772
you felt, oh my god, those were irrelevant

865
00:56:13,812 --> 00:56:15,794
when we had them on big AAA titles.

866
00:56:16,394 --> 00:56:20,077
What I'm looking for is any strategies to reduce teams.

867
00:56:20,157 --> 00:56:22,519
One of the, the other way around is you have

868
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,841
some AAA teams that are looking at the indie guys,

869
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:27,343
like, wow, you did this in three guys, you know?

870
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:30,426
And we have 15 guys and we can't even reach that.

871
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:33,448
So any, like, now that you've seen both sides?

872
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:34,783
Reflection on that?

873
00:56:35,203 --> 00:56:40,127
With Skulls of the Shogun, the three of us that started working on the game, we were all multidisciplinary.

874
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,990
Two programmers, designers, and one artist designer, so we could wear all those hats.

875
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:50,514
And we were also advanced and self-motivated, so we didn't really need a producer for a long time,

876
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:53,837
because we were all just sort of on top of tracking that ourselves.

877
00:56:54,117 --> 00:56:57,360
And we'd also, thankfully, we'd also worked remotely before,

878
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:02,583
so we knew how to kind of stay in touch and keep on it without having to be super regimented,

879
00:57:02,643 --> 00:57:03,524
which saved us a lot of time.

880
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:11,943
The other thing, and I think this is sneaking up and I think everyone needs to take advantage of this because those of us who are making games, big games of small budgets are doing this and no one's talking about it.

881
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:17,625
Um, don't, it doesn't have to be one job, one company, one team, one person ever.

882
00:57:18,085 --> 00:57:23,407
Um, there is amazing support industry starting to grow, which is people who do creative jobs.

883
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:26,188
that take roughly a 10% of development

884
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:27,609
are making 10 games a year.

885
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:30,571
People like my sound engineer is working on about eight games

886
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:31,471
coming out next year.

887
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,492
My composer's working on a couple

888
00:57:33,512 --> 00:57:34,472
because that's a bigger job.

889
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:36,773
You can work out ways to structure this.

890
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:39,415
The biggest problem big, well, medium-sized,

891
00:57:39,515 --> 00:57:41,876
big companies have is the dude sat at the desk.

892
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:47,120
who's not got anything to do, that we need to not repeat that mistake because we haven't got room to do that.

893
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:52,885
Treat it in a fair way, pay people well if they're part time because they may be out of work, you know,

894
00:57:52,965 --> 00:57:57,048
and you've got to make sure everyone's safe and comfortable and happy and you're not screwing anyone over.

895
00:57:57,068 --> 00:57:57,128
But...

896
00:57:58,689 --> 00:58:03,014
work with those people. I have an animator who's working on three games. He is making much, much

897
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:07,800
more money from working three freelance gigs that are the same hours as his old job, working full

898
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:13,147
time. He's happy. I'm happy because I'm not paying him to keep him at his desk.

899
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,168
and everyone's winning, he gets to put his,

900
00:58:16,568 --> 00:58:18,328
and it's great for him as well because we've,

901
00:58:18,448 --> 00:58:21,089
even if one of those three games he's working on is a hit,

902
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:23,009
he gets to walk around GDC as the guy

903
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:24,649
who animated that game you've heard of,

904
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:26,249
and he'll just like not mention the other two.

905
00:58:26,529 --> 00:58:28,850
So it's great for everyone, and everyone's doing it,

906
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:29,990
but we're not talking about it

907
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,530
because we're pretending we have these massive offices

908
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,471
because we think we have to,

909
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:33,811
because we think that's the way to get respect

910
00:58:33,831 --> 00:58:34,651
from the bigger companies.

911
00:58:35,751 --> 00:58:37,711
You know, nest it, work out a way to do,

912
00:58:37,992 --> 00:58:39,632
to be like the film industry, basically,

913
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:40,492
bringing people who need it.

914
00:58:40,532 --> 00:58:41,512
I'm sorry I'm getting waved off.

915
00:58:42,346 --> 00:58:44,230
All right, I apologize, though.

916
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,412
We are running out of time.

917
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:47,676
But please come over to the podium,

918
00:58:47,856 --> 00:58:49,960
or we'll go to the splatter room.

919
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:51,563
And we're done.

920
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:52,445
Thank you very much.
