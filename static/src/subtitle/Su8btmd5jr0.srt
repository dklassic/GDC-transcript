00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:09,570
Hello, everyone, and welcome to GDC 2021.

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,614
This talk is Voice AI for Game Developers,

3
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:16,200
and it's all about optimizing the narrative process.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,001
My name is Treyas.

5
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,146
I'm co-founder and CEO at Replica Studios.

6
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,534
For those of you who haven't heard about Replica yet,

7
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:24,815
we're an AI company.

8
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:27,958
We make AI voices for games and movies.

9
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,440
And so I'm really excited to be here today

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,762
and talk to you all and tell you a little bit

11
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:35,844
about this new technology that's coming your way

12
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:37,545
and can massively compliment

13
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,787
all of the wonderful work you guys are doing.

14
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,845
So to start with, some of you are probably wondering,

15
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:45,186
what is an AI voice?

16
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:45,866
What is Voice AI?

17
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:49,388
So we've got a couple of demos for you right up front,

18
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:51,429
and then over the course of this presentation,

19
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,430
we'll be diving deeper

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,850
and giving you more practical examples.

21
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,671
But check it out.

22
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:59,872
Hello stranger, needing a new set of armor, are you?

23
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:02,053
I mainly specialize in plated armor,

24
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:05,015
but on the odd occasion, I've worked with leather as well.

25
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,056
That'll be two gold pieces.

26
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:08,836
And here's another one.

27
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:17,919
How dare you! If you speak to me in that filthy tongue again, I will cut yours out.

28
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:22,062
Now leave me, while I still allow it.

29
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:28,468
No, please! Don't kill me! I can help you regain the throne, but only if you let me live!

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,646
Okay so what you heard there are two of Replica's AI voices and so all of that spoken dialogue

31
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:43,793
was synthesized by a neural net by a computer which is pretty cool and so hopefully by the

32
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:48,037
end of this presentation you'll go away with a bunch of ideas, your head will be buzzing about

33
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:53,923
cool ways you can use AI voices in your game or movie within the context of Game Narrative.

34
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:59,589
So, to start out, I thought we'd cover a brief overview of all the topics we're about to

35
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:00,550
cover in this presentation.

36
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,694
So, we'll start with a quick who am I, a bit of background about me.

37
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:08,218
Then we'll jump right into game narrative and storytelling.

38
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:09,639
Why is it important?

39
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,061
Why is it great?

40
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:15,325
We'll then look at some of the challenges with regards to game narrative and storytelling.

41
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:19,669
and how voice AI could help overcome some of these challenges.

42
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:23,353
Then we'll look at a bunch of really cool voice demos.

43
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:27,618
There will also be visual parts to this voice demo, so you guys are going to love it.

44
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:30,100
Definitely stick around for this.

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,944
We'll then break down the process of what did you actually witness and hear.

46
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:41,829
how does that fit into the game narrative theme. And finally, key takeaways. Because we're covering

47
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:49,434
so much stuff in 30 minutes, we'll just summarize before the end of this presentation. So in total,

48
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:53,657
a lot of stuff in 30 minutes. Thankfully, this is a pre-recorded session.

49
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:58,819
and we'll be around to answer any questions you may have. And you can also go back and watch parts

50
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:05,341
again that maybe was too quick the first time you saw it. So with that, let's get started.

51
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:11,284
My name is Shreyas. I started my career as an aerospace engineer. So yes, I'm a bit of a nerd.

52
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:18,386
been doing startups, hardware and software, for about 10 years. About four years ago, I got into

53
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:25,328
deep learning, specifically voice AI. About the same time I met my co-founders, we started Replica.

54
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:32,810
The rest is history. But really, at the time, four years ago, we saw the enormous potential

55
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,131
that voice AI as a technology has for creative people. We thought we would set out and build

56
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,252
Photoshop for voice.

57
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:47,035
Outside of work, I do have some hobbies. I like playing the drums. I like playing all sorts of

58
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:54,119
games, but specifically I like racing games because I also like to race in real life. So

59
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:59,522
while I'm an expert on voice AI, I'm not actually an expert on game narrative,

60
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:02,704
which is also part of this talk today. So

61
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:08,349
the most popular Google search result says narrative in game consists of plot, sounds,

62
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:13,714
music, atmosphere, dialogues, player choices, and of course gameplay, and it creates the overall

63
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:19,059
impression of the game and allows the player to feel a part of the story. So that sort of

64
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,782
makes sense to me. I've also spent some time asking

65
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:28,226
experts in the field and while they more or less agree with the most popular google search result

66
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:33,870
there are slight variations to this. Some feel more that it has more to do with the actual

67
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,333
writing aspect, some prefer the ability for player choices.

68
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:43,635
But overall, I think we can all agree that game narrative is like good storytelling with

69
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:46,076
the addition of player-driven choices.

70
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:50,577
So when I think back to Lord of the Rings when it was still a book, I had to imagine

71
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:53,818
what all of these characters looked like, what they sounded like.

72
00:04:54,895 --> 00:05:01,200
And Tolkien was amazing because he could do this. He could paint pictures and movies with words.

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,265
But when the movies came out, obviously it was fantastic. And so we think that game designers

74
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:12,630
and narrative experts should really be using all of the tools and technologies that are available

75
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,094
today to really help you tell your story in the most compelling way possible.

76
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:21,316
And if we think about how storytelling has evolved,

77
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:24,837
the visual side of storytelling has really come a long way

78
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:28,198
from our cave painting ancestors,

79
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:30,760
where we're now using, we've evolved through books

80
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,460
and we now have video games,

81
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,462
thanks mostly to advances in 3D graphics,

82
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,323
company like NVIDIA is doing a lot in the space,

83
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:42,765
Epic Games is doing a lot with their Unreal Engine,

84
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:44,785
Unity, Roblox, these are the ways

85
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,046
in which stories are being told today.

86
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,584
Unfortunately, though, here's a problem.

87
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,402
voice acting is still too hard and this is despite how powerful the human voice is and how crucial it

88
00:05:56,402 --> 00:06:02,864
is to storytelling. From the previous slide, back in the days sitting around campfires we would

89
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:09,727
still tell stories and so it's a shame that the voice acting component is often an afterthought

90
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:14,208
and left to the final stages of any creative production. For those of you who have worked

91
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,250
with voice actors you know that they're pretty expensive and the process can also be quite

92
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,010
time-consuming.

93
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,532
And so what happens is most of you are using this guy.

94
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:23,992
Get to the chopper.

95
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:28,993
And that's a shame because generic TTS will break immersion.

96
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:33,315
It is not going to give you the superpowers

97
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,216
that you need to really sell your story.

98
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:38,097
And so we think this is a challenge,

99
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,717
but we think voice AI is the solution to this

100
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:43,218
because voice AI does give you superpowers

101
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:45,359
because it can sound like this.

102
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:49,400
One step closer, demon filth, and your general dies.

103
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:52,049
Right? It's pretty cool.

104
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:56,234
So voice AI is much more than just plain old text to speech.

105
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:58,277
We're about to be overrun.

106
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:00,259
Fall back to the fortress now.

107
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:07,950
right? It has the ability to inflect emotion, tone, and stylistic control. So even though you can still

108
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:15,053
use text to go to speech using Voice AI, it is fundamentally different to the generic text to

109
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:19,635
speech that you've probably been working with so far. In this presentation, we're not going to go

110
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:25,877
into the technical details of how this works. We thought the best way to prove to you what it does

111
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,638
is through a practical example. So...

112
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:34,955
Let's play a little game. This game is we're going to pitch you an idea for a video game,

113
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:41,478
very meta, and you, the audience, are going to help us fund it. This game is called The Quest.

114
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:44,960
It's got two lead characters, male and female, like you can see on the screen.

115
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,546
and it's loosely inspired by the Witcher, it's inspired by the Lord of the Rings,

116
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:57,392
so this game, this adventure is set in magical, mystical, fantasy land,

117
00:07:57,392 --> 00:08:01,837
but also our two main characters, they're warriors and they're hard-fighting people.

118
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:07,699
So we thought the next step, now that we have the general idea for what the quest is,

119
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:14,000
we would progress to a rough visual storyboard because that is the best way to try and pitch

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,362
your idea. So we've put together some scenes, I'll be taking you through it. We've also collected

121
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:26,484
some sound effects and foley to really add to the atmosphere. So in this scene, we've got our

122
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:30,265
two main characters, they're on horseback, they're riding through the woods.

123
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:32,756
And they're having a conversation.

124
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:33,716
Things are fine.

125
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,216
No problems so far.

126
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:36,397
Then things are changing.

127
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:40,678
They dismount from their steeds, draw their swords,

128
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:42,638
because the enemy is advancing.

129
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:46,759
And then finally, there's a fight scene.

130
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:54,621
And in the end, they ride away on horseback.

131
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:09,303
Okay, so, so far so good. We've only spent a couple of minutes mocking up a visual storyboard

132
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:14,007
to convey this idea. We've collected some sound effects in Foley,

133
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:18,430
and I guess the next step is let's put some voices into this, right?

134
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:27,457
Remind me again what the plan is? Kill anything that comes our way.

135
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:31,400
Freya, behind you. Thanks, we're even.

136
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:38,051
There's too many. We must make more village.

137
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:43,916
All right, so, well, to take nothing away from generic text

138
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,619
to speech, it's really not compelling. There's no acting

139
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:51,583
going on. And so this breaks immersion, and it's not a very

140
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,363
convincing pitch.

141
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,254
Let's contrast this with using Replica Voices, right?

142
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:58,675
That's the whole point of this little game that we're doing.

143
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,357
So this is how we're gonna do it.

144
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:03,078
We jump into Replica Studios,

145
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:05,079
which is a desktop app that works on your Windows

146
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:05,599
or your Mac.

147
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,260
And as you can see,

148
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,941
we have a growing library of AI voices

149
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:10,881
that you can choose from.

150
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,943
So in this menu, you can browse through voices,

151
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:16,684
you can audition them, listen to samples.

152
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,826
You can also drill down into individual voice profiles.

153
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:22,347
For example, let's look at Colt over here.

154
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,583
So Colt's voice is inspired by your stereotypical

155
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,704
sort of cowboy kind of guy.

156
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:33,748
As you can see there, he's got a few different moods

157
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:38,331
or styles, so he can be charming, he can be intimidating,

158
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:41,494
and he also has a battle style, so he can shout in battle.

159
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:45,117
And what we're gonna try and do is find a good fit

160
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:46,898
for our two lead characters.

161
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:49,441
So this is what Colt sounds like.

162
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,222
There's too many.

163
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:52,603
We must make for the village.

164
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,474
Cool, so he sounds like what you'd expect him to sound like and that's not a good fit

165
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:03,039
for the Lord of the Rings Witcher inspired theme that we're going for.

166
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,801
But it's a cool voice anyway.

167
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:11,607
Similar to Colt we have Vinny here and Vinny is inspired by your stereotypical Italian

168
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:13,068
mob boss guy.

169
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:14,189
So this is what he sounds like.

170
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:14,990
There's too many.

171
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,892
We must make for the village.

172
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:26,542
Alright, so just like Colt and Vinny, surprise surprise, we also have a voice that's perfect for the quest.

173
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:30,626
And we're calling him Deckard. This is what Deckard sounds like.

174
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,969
There's too many! We must make for the village!

175
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:34,349
Alright, so...

176
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,746
Hopefully you've understood by now, Replica lets you audition and search for a number of voices.

177
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:44,112
So similar to Finding Deckard, we've gone ahead and auditioned our female lead character.

178
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:51,341
And now that we have our two characters, let's go to this interface, which is the main Replica interface,

179
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:53,744
where we can start adding in the lines.

180
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:56,607
that our characters are going to be saying in these scenes.

181
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:58,710
And if you look there, you can also

182
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,313
see there is a column for the default style

183
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:02,314
that we're applying.

184
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:03,816
So you can see that initially, things

185
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:06,278
are quite lighthearted and casual.

186
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,122
So they're having a casual conversation.

187
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:10,844
Then things turn serious.

188
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:11,985
The enemy is upon them.

189
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:16,668
and finally there's like battle scenes so there's battle shouts and all that stuff going on.

190
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:23,312
So this interface is really cool because it lets you experiment very quickly. You just type in text

191
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:28,655
or we're also building a feature where you can import all of your dialogue and lines from a CSV

192
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:35,759
and pre-populate all of these things in Replica so you can go from text to voice in an instant.

193
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,443
So this is a great way for you to get an overview of everything that's happening in your project or

194
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:46,469
your scene, but you can also go one level deeper. So for a given line you can drill down

195
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:49,877
and you can fine tune the performance.

196
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,778
And you can do this in a number of ways.

197
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:53,780
You can highlight bits of text

198
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,781
and then apply some transformations

199
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:59,084
using sliders and dials and knobs that we provide.

200
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:00,745
Some of these screenshots that I'm showing you

201
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,187
in the presentation are in beta.

202
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:05,849
So you can download Replica Studios right now,

203
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:07,950
but you may not see exactly what we've got here

204
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,632
because we're still testing this

205
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,553
with a smaller subset of users.

206
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:14,555
But this is coming very soon to everyone on the product.

207
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:21,799
So in this scene we're going to listen to a couple of variations of the same line,

208
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,600
one with emphasis on the word anything and one without. Have a listen.

209
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,543
Kill anything that comes our way. Kill anything that comes our way.

210
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,326
So that was just to illustrate the ability of fine-tuning that you could do with this interface.

211
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,193
Alright, so now that we've spent some time populating all of our lines, we've even spent

212
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:48,678
the time drilling down individually for lines that we wanted to fine tune and tweak.

213
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:55,684
And so now we're ready to go back to our rough storyboard and listen to what this sounds

214
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:56,805
like with replica voices.

215
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:57,466
Here we go.

216
00:13:57,466 --> 00:14:00,868
Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming?

217
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:02,650
That's not what I'm saying.

218
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,214
Whatever you're trying to say, that's what it sounded like to me.

219
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:11,385
Pretty good. Next scene.

220
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:14,206
Speaking of smells, do you smell that?

221
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:16,887
It smells like...

222
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:18,407
Ghouls!

223
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:19,548
The girl.

224
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:20,688
They must have her scent.

225
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:21,989
OK, and the last one.

226
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:28,811
Kill anything that comes our way.

227
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:29,832
Freya! Behind you!

228
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:33,173
Thanks! We're even!

229
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,292
So that's not bad, right?

230
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,434
It's not bad, especially when you compare it to...

231
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,215
Remind me again what the plan is.

232
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,897
Kill anything that comes our way.

233
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:47,559
Okay, so hopefully that illustrates the point

234
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,180
in a nutshell.

235
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,142
And hopefully at this point,

236
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:54,424
you, the audience, actually like what you've been watching.

237
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,156
Well, we've kind of made the decision for you.

238
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,098
We think you really loved it, and we

239
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,160
think you want to greenlight this.

240
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,482
You want to fund this project so we

241
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:06,325
can go out and actually make it.

242
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:08,367
So let's do that.

243
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,210
We've gone now to Unreal Engine.

244
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,092
We're going to the Marketplace where

245
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,675
we can go and find assets so that we can put them

246
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:16,376
into a scene.

247
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:22,279
add some cameras, add some lights, and really start blocking out some shots for the visual

248
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:27,481
aspect of storytelling. And that's when we ran into a really interesting challenge,

249
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:32,603
because it turns out if you've got high fidelity characters on the screen and they're speaking,

250
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:38,726
their lip movements really need to match what's being said, otherwise it breaks immersion.

251
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:39,266
Check this out.

252
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:46,772
Then, all of a sudden, you somehow were elbow deep with your obsidian blade in its jugular.

253
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:49,857
Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming?

254
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:52,021
That's not what I'm saying.

255
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:52,702
Right, so...

256
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:59,702
Even though this looks really good, it's got high fidelity humans, way better compared to the rough

257
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:05,788
visual storyboard that we had a couple of slides back, it's actually worse because it breaks

258
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:10,952
immersion because all of your focus is on the lips and the fact that they're not saying or they don't

259
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:16,398
seem to be saying what's actually being heard. So we decided that this was a big enough problem

260
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:17,799
that we wanted to fix it.

261
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:22,385
and we started working on trying to fix this earlier in the year.

262
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:26,871
And so I'm going to show you a quick update on the progress we've made.

263
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:32,498
But before then, I'll just say quickly, we've got these plugins coming out that can do lip-sync,

264
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:36,123
that work with Unreal Engine, and also works with Reallusion iClone.

265
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:42,488
and we're going to be working to add integrations and support with Unity and Roblox so that you have

266
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:47,912
not only do you have voice acting with AI voices, you also have compelling lip sync

267
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:51,195
as an automated solution. So this is our latest progress.

268
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:59,061
Then all of a sudden you somehow are elbow deep with your obsidian blade in its jugular.

269
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:03,544
Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming? That's not what I'm saying.

270
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:06,349
Okay, so that was a sneak peek.

271
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,550
Don't worry, we'll show you the full video in a moment.

272
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,552
But it's a big improvement from the other video

273
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,633
that I showed a moment ago.

274
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,234
So this is not bad given we've only been working on it

275
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,295
for a few months.

276
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:20,576
And so we're fairly confident that with continued effort,

277
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:23,358
we'll get to something that looks really, really good

278
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:24,098
not long from now.

279
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:32,300
And so this is a demonstration of how we're solving lip sync for Unreal Engine MetaHumans.

280
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,342
So I'll play this video for you in a moment, but let me just explain what you're going to see.

281
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:42,583
We've got our developer here, and he's using an iPhone camera, which is running an app that scans

282
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:48,984
his face, and based on the changes in his face and lip movements, that drives the MetaHuman

283
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,345
visually in real time.

284
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:51,885
So that's really cool.

285
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:54,426
Thank you, Unreal Engine.

286
00:17:54,426 --> 00:17:56,527
But the cool part here is, at the same time

287
00:17:56,527 --> 00:18:01,129
that he's performing the line and doing the face acting,

288
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:04,690
Replica can take the audio input from your own voice

289
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,692
and use that to direct the performance of the AI voice,

290
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:10,833
which can then be applied onto the metahuman.

291
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,974
And so that's what you're about to see.

292
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:14,534
Have a look.

293
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:18,396
Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming?

294
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:25,880
Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming?

295
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,700
So I should explain that the visual side of things,

296
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,141
where you're driving the MetaHuman

297
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:35,562
through the face capture, that is in real time.

298
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:37,002
Thank you, Unreal Engine.

299
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:40,083
However, the part where your voice is being used

300
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,924
to direct the performance of the AI voice,

301
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:45,405
that isn't quite real time just yet.

302
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:47,085
It's going to get there.

303
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,766
Currently, depending on the length of the line

304
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,447
that you're trying to direct,

305
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:53,888
it could take anywhere from 40 seconds

306
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:56,488
to a little bit more than a minute per line.

307
00:18:57,172 --> 00:19:02,296
Before moving on, I thought I would play that demo for you again so you can just see that again.

308
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:04,938
Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming?

309
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:12,544
Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming? Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming?

310
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:18,399
Okay, so that feature that lets you direct the performance with your own voice, this

311
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,760
is coming soon.

312
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,941
It's not part of the app yet.

313
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:27,346
But if you think back to the slides that I showed you of replicas, product and UI, most

314
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:30,288
of the controls for fine tuning now involve.

315
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:36,571
selecting bits of text and then applying transformations by changing a value on a

316
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:43,234
slider or a dial to get the desired output. This new feature is another way that you could get the

317
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:48,096
desired output where you don't have to use the sliders and dials you could just use your own

318
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:50,017
voice to perform the line and

319
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:57,022
Replica can transfer the energy, cadence, and tone from your own performance onto any of our AI voices.

320
00:19:57,022 --> 00:20:04,567
To further demonstrate how this works, you start out with a default AI voice output that sounds like this.

321
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:10,711
There's no way you can copy how I speak. You then use your own voice to coach the performance.

322
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:18,877
There's no way you can copy how I speak. And finally, there's no way you can copy how I speak.

323
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:25,691
So what I've just played for you there is the default AI voice output for Deckard.

324
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:32,916
Then we had Gavin, who's a Replicas designer, sit there and record his version of how he

325
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,720
wanted the performance to come out. And then you have the final output that combines

326
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,603
Gavin's attributes in terms of his cadence and his tone and his energy.

327
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,365
and applies that through an AI voice.

328
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:47,848
This can be extended to any of our voices.

329
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:50,930
So here's a version with a female AI voice.

330
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,352
There's no way you can copy how I speak.

331
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:58,136
There's no way you can copy how I speak.

332
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:01,318
There's no way you can copy how I speak.

333
00:21:01,318 --> 00:21:01,358
So.

334
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:05,179
All in all, really cool functionality.

335
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:07,820
This is still in development, but we're

336
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,861
excited about this feature because this

337
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:13,203
is how we think, at least for high-fidelity characters,

338
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:15,984
you can solve lip-sync, or it's one of the ways in which you

339
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,545
can solve lip-sync.

340
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:22,288
So finally, now that we've shown you all of the tools available,

341
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:28,444
with Replica, we've actually gone ahead, since you were so kind to fund our project,

342
00:21:28,444 --> 00:21:33,426
we've gone ahead and created an entire cutscene for the quest.

343
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,787
And so we're really proud to present the quest.

344
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:43,251
Remember the time we fought the Dragonauts? Of course I remember.

345
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:48,855
I remember a dragon swooping down and almost lighting the whole field on fire.

346
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:55,758
Then, all of a sudden, you somehow were elbowed deep with your obsidian blade in its jugular.

347
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:58,780
Do I hear a thank you for saving my life coming?

348
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,201
That's not what I'm saying.

349
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:06,224
Whatever you're trying to say, that's what it sounded like to me.

350
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,785
At any rate, I smelt like dragon fuel for weeks after that.

351
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:12,307
Speaking of smells, do you smell that?

352
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,227
It smells like...

353
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:15,788
Ghouls.

354
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:17,629
The girl.

355
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:18,930
They must have her scent.

356
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,791
The village is only an hour's ride.

357
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,614
If we hurry, we may be able to warn them.

358
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:26,334
There's no time.

359
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:26,935
Get ready.

360
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:32,558
Remind me again what the plan is?

361
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:38,982
Kill anything that comes our way.

362
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,522
Freya!

363
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:40,323
Behind you!

364
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:40,883
Thanks!

365
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:43,065
We're even!

366
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:49,892
There's too many! We must make for the village!

367
00:22:49,892 --> 00:22:50,293
Nope!

368
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:55,357
You get to the village! I'll lead them away!

369
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:59,020
Find the girl! She is the key!

370
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,203
No! I won't leave you!

371
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:03,223
I've got this! Go! Now!

372
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:08,448
Come on, you belt! Are you hungry? You want your fresh bones and all?

373
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,546
Well, we're hoping you really enjoyed that.

374
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:26,328
It's not bad given the fact that this entire cutscene

375
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:30,469
was put together by one talented CG artist

376
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:32,610
working for about two and a half weeks.

377
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,632
And so from an indie developer perspective,

378
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:38,453
voice AI definitely gives you superpowers.

379
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:41,655
And this is also quite novel, I should mention,

380
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:43,716
because it's one of the first...

381
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:51,100
early use cases of using AI voices to drive digital humans, especially in this case realistic

382
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:57,983
Unreal Engine metahumans, to make a cutscene. So as the technology evolves all of this will start

383
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:04,146
to look and sound much better, but it's really not that bad given where we are right now. In fact,

384
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:05,747
one could go as far to say that

385
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:11,090
It's kind of like we're comparing Toy Story 1 with Toy Story 4 and see how far they've

386
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,271
come in a matter of several years.

387
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:19,693
The good news is I don't think audio technology and AI voice is going to need that much more

388
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:24,675
time to get to very acceptable levels, even for big budget studios.

389
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:26,675
And we're definitely working on it.

390
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:32,483
And so we're finding that a lot of the biggest studios use Replica in the pre-production cycles

391
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:38,350
and during the early creative process. And if you think about it from the context of game narrative,

392
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:45,099
this is also a great chance to really help tell a compelling story without having to resort to voice

393
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:51,182
actors, which traditionally happens much later on. So you've actually got all this extra free time

394
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:56,625
to experiment with story ideas and dialogue. And that's what we mean by voice AI literally gives

395
00:24:56,625 --> 00:25:02,569
you creative superpowers because this was not possible before. So it's really hard to compare.

396
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:09,074
what was possible before voice AI with what's possible now because they're two entirely

397
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:15,159
different things. You could use voice AI right now as a big studio in pre-production but as a

398
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,583
smaller studio or an indie developer, well the voices are good enough for you to ship in the

399
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,925
final game so you've gone from having

400
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:25,587
no voices potentially or just text on the screen

401
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:29,070
to actual voice acting pretty compelling in your game.

402
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,372
And doing this in an affordable way

403
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:33,373
and in a way that doesn't take you too much time.

404
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:37,496
So all in all, voice AI gives you superpowers.

405
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,358
We hope that this will help game designers

406
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:43,201
and narrative experts make bigger and more compelling games

407
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,623
if they have tools like this early on in their cycles.

408
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:53,550
So here's an example of how a pretty big studio, Midwinter Entertainment, used Replica in pre-production

409
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,531
in their title Scavengers.

410
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:56,431
And this is how they did it.

411
00:25:56,431 --> 00:26:02,094
So they had writer, game designer, creative producers, and a bunch of folks all around

412
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:02,534
the world.

413
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:09,282
being able to iterate on big parts of story and dialogue and get those changes in front

414
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:13,267
of their 5,000 beta testers on an almost daily or weekly basis.

415
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:17,513
Again, this is an example of something that you could never have done without this kind

416
00:26:17,513 --> 00:26:18,614
of technology.

417
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:20,597
And, obviously, scavengers then...

418
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,573
brought real voice actors in to record the final lines

419
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:26,154
once they had ironed out all the pieces

420
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:27,975
of what they actually wanted to say.

421
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:30,277
So this helped them in a massive way.

422
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:32,919
It's important to say here that voice actors

423
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,561
are a really big part of what Replica does.

424
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,922
We're working closely with a growing pool

425
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:40,164
of really talented voice actors

426
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:42,265
that help create all of these voices

427
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:43,887
that are available in our library.

428
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:48,848
In fact, some of the voice actors we've worked with have made three or four different character

429
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:54,929
voices that are all in our library. And we're developing profit-sharing models so that as these

430
00:26:54,929 --> 00:27:00,530
AI voices are used by millions of studios around the world, the voice actors who helped create them

431
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:07,212
can earn a passive income stream alongside their regular day-to-day job. So this is really a win-win

432
00:27:07,212 --> 00:27:11,633
scenario. It's great for talent and it's really great for creative studios because now they can

433
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:13,793
do things that traditionally were impossible.

434
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:16,155
So we're really happy about this.

435
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:18,576
And that brings us to our mission.

436
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:23,279
Replica is trying to build the world's greatest library of AI voices for games and movies.

437
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:34,405
And as the technology improves, we will expand our pool of talent to include premium actors, famous voices, celebrities, and work with the unions.

438
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:36,566
So we're really excited about all of that.

439
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:38,507
Finally, is the future bleak?

440
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:46,403
This is a joke title guys, the future of storytelling is not AI and NPCs alone, but we do think

441
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:49,865
AI and NPCs have a part to play in the future of storytelling.

442
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:55,988
And so this video that I'm about to show you is actually a game created by a user of Replika,

443
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:58,529
so the game is called Modbox, it's on Steam.

444
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:07,420
And so the developer here has done this really smart thing where he's combined OpenAI's GPT-3 with Replica Voices.

445
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:14,863
So in this game, which is a VR experience, you can walk around and have believable conversations with NPCs,

446
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:19,446
and they will respond to you in almost real time. Check it out.

447
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:20,787
Hello, Bobby.

448
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:23,148
What do you want?

449
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:25,609
Where are you going?

450
00:28:32,062 --> 00:28:32,962
I have to go to work.

451
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:37,703
I'm already late and my boss will punish me if I show up even later.

452
00:28:37,703 --> 00:28:38,643
Please leave.

453
00:28:38,643 --> 00:28:39,364
I can't help you right now.

454
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:39,984
Where do you work?

455
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:40,944
I work at City Hall.

456
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:42,184
It's a government building in the center of town.

457
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:57,674
So I paused it there to explain to you what's actually going on again.

458
00:28:57,674 --> 00:29:05,340
As you can see, the developer who's actually made this video asks a question to the NPC,

459
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,803
after which point there is a bit of a time delay or a lag.

460
00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:13,105
it combines a whole bunch of different AIs strung together.

461
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:17,286
So there's one AI that listens to the developer

462
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:20,788
or the player speaking and converts or transcribes

463
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:21,888
his speech into text.

464
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:23,108
So that's part one.

465
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:27,650
That then sends the text transcript to GPT-3.

466
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,231
GPT-3 takes the text input and then comes out

467
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:33,592
with a response based on that text input.

468
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:34,873
That takes a bit of time.

469
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:41,698
and then finally when gpd3 has its text response that gets sent to replica and replica converts

470
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:47,763
that into bobby's voice and that takes a bit of time so all together you've got three separate

471
00:29:47,763 --> 00:29:53,428
ai systems that all add up in terms of how much time they take but we think it's really awesome

472
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:57,051
you guys should definitely check out modbox on steam because it's a fun game to play

473
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,702
We've covered a lot in this video, so hopefully you'll also go back and re-watch sections.

474
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:06,464
And if you have any questions or any thoughts or any feedback, that's our email, so we'd

475
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:07,865
love to hear from you.

476
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:13,848
We also have an active Discord community where loads of Replica users have discussions.

477
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:18,670
This is where we make early announcements, where you can potentially sign up for the

478
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:18,890
beta.

479
00:30:19,491 --> 00:30:21,313
and get access to some of those features

480
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:22,935
that are in early access.

481
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:25,398
And it's also a great place to share the kinds of work

482
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:27,580
that folks are making with Replica

483
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,023
and how they're using that to make games and movies.

484
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:32,166
So we hope you'll join and check it out.

485
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,529
But thank you again for tuning in.

486
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:37,292
It's been a pleasure speaking here at GDC.

487
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:39,314
Shreyas from Replica signing out.

488
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:39,635
Thanks.
