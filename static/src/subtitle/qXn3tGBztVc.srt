1
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:07,337
Good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:08,178
Oh, that's loud.

3
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:08,798
That better?

4
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:13,022
I hope everybody enjoyed the lunch break.

5
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:17,126
I'm excited about giving this presentation.

6
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:20,168
Before I get started, just a couple of announcements.

7
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:23,811
Just make sure that if you have a cell phone or anything

8
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:29,436
else that makes noise, that you put it into the quiet mode

9
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:30,457
at this point.

10
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:30,617
Also,

11
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:35,854
If you have an opportunity to do the survey afterwards, it

12
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:37,215
is really useful.

13
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:42,076
I did a presentation last year, and reviewing those was

14
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:44,357
extremely informative for me, especially those

15
00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:45,417
that left comments.

16
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:48,258
So really appreciate it if everybody can go do that.

17
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:50,619
I'd also really be excited to get onto that deck of cards

18
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:51,739
for next year.

19
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,780
We'll see if we can do that.

20
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:58,417
So I'm here to talk about randomness in games.

21
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:04,940
Before we get started, just a quick couple of things about

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,540
my background.

23
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:12,316
So, for those of you that are not familiar with my work, I'm a game designer.

24
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:17,479
I've got about ten published titles at this point, ranging from Space Cadets to The Expanse

25
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,401
is actually my latest title.

26
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:24,104
We are currently working on an expansion for that.

27
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:28,947
If anybody has a good title for an expansion for The Expanse, let me know.

28
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:30,748
We're in a little bit of a quandary over that.

29
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,866
Yes, Expansion, I don't know.

30
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:40,628
There's some good pun title there that we'll come up with.

31
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:45,991
I also am on the Dice Tower doing the Game Tech segment

32
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:49,273
for that podcast and do the Ludology podcast, which is a

33
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:52,195
biweekly show that goes into the nuts and

34
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,535
bolts of game design.

35
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:58,198
And I teach board game design at the NYU Game Center in New

36
00:01:58,198 --> 00:01:59,879
York City.

37
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,320
So I wanted to start with.

38
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:08,904
This quote from the designer Greg Castikian in his really excellent book,

39
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:12,893
Uncertainty in Games, which was published in 2013, which I would recommend.

40
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:18,775
And he talks about uncertainty as being an essential part of games.

41
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:23,216
As he says, in designing games, a degree of uncertainty is essential.

42
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:26,958
And that if there is no uncertainty, then it is not a game.

43
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,479
You can have other forms of entertainment that don't have any uncertainty, a book or

44
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,080
a movie, if you're watching it for the second time, it's going to do exactly the same thing.

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,542
But a game, if you know exactly what the outcome is going to be, then there is no reason to

46
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:38,882
play.

47
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:46,564
So he looks at it and breaks down four major areas of uncertainty in games and ways that

48
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:48,624
you can introduce uncertainty.

49
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:54,446
Hidden information, examples would be in poker, things like that, where you've got cards or

50
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,726
something that your opponent doesn't know that you have.

51
00:02:56,726 --> 00:03:00,007
There is skill or performance-based uncertainty.

52
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:05,689
that is like darts or basketball or anything where you have to flick a disc or something

53
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,331
like that, there is opponent uncertainty.

54
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:13,074
Even in perfect information games like chess, you don't know what plans your opponent has

55
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:16,316
or what move your opponent is going to make, and you have to make plans on how you're going

56
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:16,897
to react to that.

57
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,779
And then the last one is the traditional randomizers, which

58
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:24,401
are dice and spinners, card draws, tile flips,

59
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,181
stuff like that.

60
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,623
And it's that green box, the randomizers, that I want to

61
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:28,503
focus on today.

62
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:31,685
Each of these deserves their own lecture and presentation,

63
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:34,547
but I really want to focus on the randomizers and the way

64
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,148
that those can impact the game.

65
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,419
So as I said, there's a couple of different types of this.

66
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,739
Die roll card draws.

67
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,900
You also have classic spinners.

68
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,561
One of my goals in life is to design a spinner-based game.

69
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,621
I'm actually working on a game where you build your own

70
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:54,822
spinner, like a giant roulette wheel, with different

71
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:56,162
probabilities for different things.

72
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:59,963
And then the venerable cube tower, where you throw cubes

73
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:01,824
and then they come out.

74
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,184
These are all ways that you can create

75
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:05,525
uncertainty in your game.

76
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:09,589
But how does that get applied?

77
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:13,173
So let's take a look at some basic, this is just sort of a

78
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:16,877
really basic representation of the flow of a game.

79
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:19,740
There is a state of the game, then the player makes a

80
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,085
decision, and that ends up with a result.

81
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:28,008
Now there's two main places that the randomness can fit

82
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,310
into this picture.

83
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,043
The first is what I refer to as input randomness,

84
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,544
and that is where the game state is randomized.

85
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,265
So first the game state is randomized,

86
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,806
then the players make a decision based on that,

87
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:47,508
and then the results of the decision are going to be fixed.

88
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:48,688
When a player makes a decision,

89
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,250
they know what the outcome of that decision is going to be.

90
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,211
The uncertainty in this case is on the input side.

91
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:55,812
What is the game state?

92
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:02,450
Now on the flip side, you can also have output randomness.

93
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,813
In output randomness, the game state is fixed,

94
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:06,555
and you're just making a decision

95
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:07,596
around the current game state.

96
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:11,060
But the result of your decision is going to be random.

97
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,663
You make the decision, and then you see what the outcome is.

98
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:15,625
You don't know how those two things

99
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,067
are going to be correlated.

100
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,560
So some examples of output randomness.

101
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,282
This is typically the type of randomness

102
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:28,184
that is used in games, and certainly

103
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:29,725
was going back millennia.

104
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:30,846
You have risk.

105
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:34,028
Of course, in risk, when you decide

106
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:35,289
you're going to attack a territory,

107
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,891
then you roll the dice and decide,

108
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:39,852
figure out what the results are going to be.

109
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:43,254
Roulette, you place your bets and then see it.

110
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:46,517
In Dungeons and Dragons, every action that you take,

111
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:49,439
you roll a die to see what the effect of that is.

112
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:53,001
It's not necessarily super random things.

113
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:55,343
There's also more sophisticated games.

114
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:58,925
War games, in particular, have a lot of output randomness.

115
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,708
I've shown here a typical combat results table from a 70s, 80s war game,

116
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,750
where you decide you're going to do an attack,

117
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,231
and then you roll a die or dice and see what happens.

118
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,953
So those are all some examples of output randomness.

119
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,695
Input randomness tends to be a more modern phenomenon

120
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:16,176
in terms of games, with some exceptions.

121
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:21,019
But one looking at here is Dominion is a great example.

122
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,760
In Dominion, in one mode of play,

123
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,882
there is a randomization for the kingdom cards

124
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,723
that you select at the beginning of the game.

125
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,785
But once you select those decks, that

126
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:34,687
creates that game state that players then react to.

127
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,859
Dominion actually, interestingly, has a couple of

128
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,061
different levels of input randomness versus output

129
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,161
randomness.

130
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:43,602
One is the overall game state.

131
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:46,884
But also, each time you draw a hand of five cards, that's

132
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,045
sort of input randomness.

133
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:49,986
And then you have to decide how you're going to play out

134
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:50,967
those cards.

135
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,769
There may be some output randomness in that.

136
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:55,170
Like if you're playing a blacksmith and you have to

137
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,151
draw cards, you're not necessarily sure what you're

138
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:57,952
going to draw.

139
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,973
But in general, you have a pretty good indication of the

140
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:02,535
way that your turn is going to flow based on the input

141
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,456
randomness of the cards that you draw.

142
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,399
Similarly, backgammon is input randomness.

143
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,063
You kind of roll the dice and then decide what you're going to do based around that,

144
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,805
make your plans based around that.

145
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:19,191
Contract bridge, to a certain extent, has a level of this in that, you know, as a declarer

146
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:24,296
you see all your cards and your dummies cards and you can kind of build a plan around that.

147
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:25,077
There is some...

148
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:28,459
unknown factors, of course, in what your opponents hold,

149
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,681
but typically you can have a pretty good idea of a plan.

150
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:33,143
And then finally, I just threw in a video game here,

151
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:35,784
the recently released Into the Breach,

152
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:39,187
which is a great example of input randomness

153
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:43,150
in that it very, very deliberately shows you

154
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,092
exactly what the opponents are going

155
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:47,213
to be doing on their turn.

156
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:50,435
So in this case, for those of you that haven't played

157
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:52,076
Into the Breach, you can see that there's a,

158
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:58,999
those red striped lines there, those are the areas that the enemy is going to be attacking

159
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:01,119
on their turn unless something happens to them.

160
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:05,341
If they get moved out of the way or they get destroyed, you know exactly what's going to

161
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:11,023
happen and your moves are also very, have limited randomness.

162
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,444
You just know if you move here and you shoot here, you're going to do this damage, you're

163
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:16,605
going to push this guy into the water, he's going to die, you know exactly what's going

164
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:17,025
to happen.

165
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:19,646
So those are some examples of input randomness.

166
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:28,521
Now, it's good to divide it up and to think about it

167
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:32,365
as you're designing, as a way of approaching randomness

168
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:35,268
and these decisions that you build into games.

169
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:36,529
But they're not.

170
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:40,637
you know, they're not very clearly, you know,

171
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:42,858
absolutely perfectly delineated in games.

172
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,139
Because, you know, you think about risk.

173
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:48,581
There is a fixed setup to when you start your turn

174
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:49,862
about what the board looks like.

175
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,803
And then you have to decide what you're going to do,

176
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:54,765
and then you roll the dice to the outcome.

177
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:57,527
But the input from your turn is the output randomness

178
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:58,587
from somebody else's turn.

179
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:02,169
So there's this constant flow, this constant cycle.

180
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,030
But it still can be, um...

181
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,953
It's still, I think, very useful from a design standpoint.

182
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:10,555
There also can be longer term consequences,

183
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:14,097
like in Settlers of Catan, there is also

184
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:15,618
sort of input randomness for your turn,

185
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:17,439
where you roll and see what goods are available,

186
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:19,541
and then you decide how you're going to deal with it.

187
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,502
And when you're building a settlement,

188
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:24,344
you know if I play these four cards,

189
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:27,066
I'm going to be able to put a settlement in this area

190
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,907
in Settlers of Catan.

191
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,048
But I don't necessarily know how that's

192
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,309
going to produce for me down the road.

193
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,551
So that's kind of longer term output randomness.

194
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,512
So there's a lot of gray areas in this, but in general, I

195
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,453
think this is a useful classification.

196
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:46,076
Typically, input randomness built into a game will lead to

197
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:49,897
strategy, a more strategic feel to the game, gives the

198
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:54,779
players more sense of control, and rewards more skillful

199
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,001
play, whereas output randomness is typically going

200
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,321
to feel more random.

201
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,022
There's little things that you can do.

202
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:10,073
It becomes more tactical in that you have a shorter planning horizon, and it's typically

203
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:11,615
associated with lower skill caps.

204
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:15,521
Now, these are broad generalizations.

205
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:18,566
There's a lot of examples on both sides.

206
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:24,752
For example, war games. War games are filled with output randomness.

207
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:27,515
Every time you do an attack, you typically roll the dice and see what happens.

208
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:33,180
And those still feel very, you know, obviously have a lot of strategy, have a lot of tactics.

209
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,002
There's ways to rise above that.

210
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:39,985
But if you take the example of like Into the Breach, the video game example,

211
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:45,609
that game would have a very, very different feel if you didn't know the results of your combats going into them.

212
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:49,552
If you just planned your moves and then there was some sort of randomization about what happened.

213
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:53,995
It's a very, very different game and it's a very less puzzly sort of a game.

214
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:58,598
It becomes more of a, you know, just more random.

215
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:06,494
there's a blend there of what you want to approach.

216
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:13,757
Interestingly, also, which is a little bit outside the scope of this, but the more

217
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,882
uh... randomness that you have in your game

218
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:20,685
you can actually make it feel less random the more dice rolls that you have

219
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:21,846
you're going to start to

220
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:25,009
approach an average value that's a whole separate talk but

221
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:28,652
uh... just keep that in mind and war games take a lot of advantage of that

222
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:31,515
there's so many dice rolls that you can pretty much predict over the long run

223
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:32,856
what's going to be happening

224
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:39,460
Now there's more than at least two axes of randomness.

225
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,762
Input, output is one of them.

226
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:42,204
I ran through that one kind of quickly,

227
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:44,727
but I want to spend a little bit more time

228
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:47,750
talking about the correlation axis of randomness,

229
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,933
because this is not one that's considered all that often,

230
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,115
and I find it really interesting

231
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:54,598
to look at games in this light.

232
00:11:55,846 --> 00:12:00,608
So what is correlation in terms of this randomness

233
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:01,889
and the way I'm approaching it?

234
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,170
The idea is basically that there's gonna be

235
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,411
a series of events or a series of random numbers

236
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:07,971
that are happening over time.

237
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:10,212
Time one, time two, time three, time four.

238
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:13,674
And if you know what's happening at time x,

239
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:16,035
how much does that tell you at time x plus one?

240
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,116
If I know that this is happening this turn,

241
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:19,476
how much does that tell me

242
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:20,537
about what's happening next turn?

243
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,998
And there's a lot of different answers to that question.

244
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:26,918
Sometimes, the answer is, you know nothing.

245
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:28,999
You know absolutely nothing about what's happening next.

246
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,660
And that, in the scientific or mathematical terminology,

247
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,980
is called white noise.

248
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,281
And what that means is that, again, there's

249
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:41,301
no correlation between the last result and this result.

250
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:44,682
If I'm playing Risk and I roll the dice,

251
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,002
the battle result that I got last time

252
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:50,523
is not impacted at all, does not impact in any way

253
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:51,723
the result that I got this time.

254
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:55,646
They are completely unrelated to each other.

255
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,127
Just as a fun fact, we'll come back to it.

256
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,108
It's actually called white noise.

257
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,849
It's related to a frequency spectrum.

258
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,891
So when you have noise, it generates different

259
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:06,872
frequencies in it.

260
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:09,373
And white noise has all the different frequencies, from

261
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,555
low frequencies to high frequencies, low correlations

262
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:15,256
to high correlations, small jumps and big jumps.

263
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:18,758
So in a light spectrum sense, that would be white.

264
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,719
And so that is why it is called white noise.

265
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:27,805
And this is, as you can imagine, the most common way of treating randomness in games.

266
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:28,926
But it's not the only way.

267
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:32,368
Next option is called brown noise.

268
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,170
In brown noise, you know a lot.

269
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,994
The results at time step one are very, very highly correlated to what's going to be happening

270
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:40,535
at time step two.

271
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:47,012
By the way, white noise is called white because of the color of light, but brown noise is

272
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:49,394
not called brown because of the color of the spectrum.

273
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,515
It's called brown off of Brownian motion.

274
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:56,979
In a spectrum standpoint, it's called red noise, which you'll sometimes see as a term.

275
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,921
But brown noise is a little bit more of a common term.

276
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:05,886
A really simple way to generate brown noise is to say you're starting at a certain value.

277
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,567
You're starting at a value of eight, and you flip a coin.

278
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:12,190
And on a heads, it goes to nine, and on a tails, it goes to seven.

279
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:16,867
So you have a really good idea of what the next result is going to be,

280
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:20,129
but you can't over the long run predict exactly where it's going to be.

281
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:23,970
This is also sometimes called a random walk type of randomness

282
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,972
because it's tied to where you start from,

283
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:31,253
and it will spread out from there, but it spreads out

284
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:33,314
in a controlled and slower way.

285
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:40,562
And then the last type of noise is in between these two,

286
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:41,703
white noise and brown noise.

287
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,205
It's called pink noise.

288
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:47,489
And pink noise, which goes back to our spectrum again,

289
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:48,270
you have a

290
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:56,628
very high chance of a small change, but a much smaller chance of a big change. So over

291
00:14:56,628 --> 00:15:03,577
time, that's going to start to gradually drop down and you could get really, really big

292
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:08,003
jumps, but most of the time it's going to be focused on those small areas.

293
00:15:09,614 --> 00:15:12,055
Now, pink noise actually is sort of interesting,

294
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:17,296
because it ties a lot into what humans like,

295
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:20,217
and the way that humans experience the world.

296
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:23,258
Pink noise is actually the best representation of randomness,

297
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:24,718
and the randomness that we see.

298
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:27,279
There's been studies, Vossen Clark did studies in 1975,

299
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
where they took music, and they plotted

300
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,860
the frequency of the notes over time,

301
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,341
and how the frequency changed from one note to the next.

302
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:39,284
and it's exactly corresponding to pink noise.

303
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:41,045
They did the same with human speech.

304
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,507
Human speech in terms of its tone,

305
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:46,390
in terms of its volume, in terms of the pacing of it,

306
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,713
also is a pink noise type curve.

307
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:51,194
Financial systems follow this.

308
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:53,976
You get a lot of small changes in the stock market,

309
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:55,678
and every once in a while you get big movements

310
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:56,959
and crashes and big jumps.

311
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,113
You also have what are so-called black swan events,

312
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,414
like the giant stock market crash in 2008,

313
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:09,696
which are supposed to be exceptional events.

314
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:12,538
So systems tend to be, you have an idea

315
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,479
of where the Dow Jones is gonna end up every day.

316
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,161
But every once in a while you get these big giant jumps.

317
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:21,004
So a pink noise, in a very real way,

318
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:25,347
represents a closer representation to reality.

319
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:29,710
And it's also been found that systems that model pink noise,

320
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,552
musical systems particularly, and voices and speech

321
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:34,614
and things like that, that people respond to them better.

322
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:36,895
People like them.

323
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,037
Even if you just, I was going to play some noise for you,

324
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:39,557
but I'm not going to.

325
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:41,439
I'm not going to burden you with that.

326
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:45,222
But if you listen to samples of white noise, audio, white

327
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:48,264
noise, and brown noise, and pink noise, people universally

328
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:50,386
like the sound of the pink noise better, even though it

329
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:52,148
just sounds like noise.

330
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:54,690
It just sounds like a fuzzy noise.

331
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,591
But it's a better fuzzy noise than white noise.

332
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:56,651
So.

333
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:05,195
A couple of game examples that I wanted to jump into and talk about how these three different

334
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:07,156
types of noises are represented in some board games.

335
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:11,339
So this is a game from 1987 called Shotgun Company about building a chocolate company.

336
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:17,162
And in this game, as a business simulation, there's at the end of each turn or beginning

337
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:21,845
I forget if it's beginning or end of each turn, but you flip over a card that says what

338
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:23,246
the market conditions are.

339
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:26,597
and it basically tells you how much chocolate people want

340
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,458
and how much they're willing to pay for it.

341
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,999
But there is zero correlation from one turn to the next.

342
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,940
You have no idea if the market is going up

343
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,460
or the market is going down.

344
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,321
So you can invest in all this infrastructure

345
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,462
to build your chocolate and process all your chocolate.

346
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:42,643
And then you flip over a card and there's only

347
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:44,604
10 bars of chocolate that are wanted in the world

348
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:45,724
and you're in trouble.

349
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,747
It makes it very chaotic feeling.

350
00:17:50,747 --> 00:17:53,710
It makes it very, very difficult to plan for the future.

351
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,013
And also, there are some special abilities in this game

352
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:57,975
that will let you peek at cards coming up,

353
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:00,517
and that makes those extremely powerful.

354
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:03,320
But as a business simulation, it doesn't really feel right.

355
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,302
It just feels like you're just taking a guess

356
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:06,183
at what's gonna be happening.

357
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:14,838
As a counterpart, a counterpoint to that, the game Crude or McMulty, which was originally

358
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:18,220
released in 1974, in that game you roll two dice.

359
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,823
There's an economic situation, so there's like prosperity or there's expansion.

360
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:27,384
You roll two dice in that game to see what areas on the border can it produce.

361
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:30,546
Actually it's really similar to Settlers of Catan, it's really interesting.

362
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:33,347
This is a sort of a precursor to that system.

363
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,533
But on doubles, the economy changes to a new state.

364
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,319
And when you get doubles, I don't know if you guys can see

365
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,385
on the thing here, but at the bottom of those cards, it

366
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:44,630
tells you where it goes to next.

367
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:49,088
So, like, if you're in prosperity, it may go to rapid growth.

368
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:53,630
Most of the time, if you roll doubles, it's going to go to downturn, or it may go to depression.

369
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,631
So that is sort of a combination of white noise and brown noise.

370
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:01,592
You have a pretty good idea of what's going to be happening, but kind of the trigger of

371
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:02,812
that is more random.

372
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:06,233
But it makes the economy feel a lot more alive.

373
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:12,244
This was refined even more in the re-release in 2012 of Crude.

374
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:16,646
The rules were changed in that point.

375
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:20,928
Instead of the economic changes being triggered by doubles,

376
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:26,867
on that roll, it was changed instead that there was an accumulator that was created.

377
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:31,368
When you rolled those two dice, you took the difference between those two dice, you rolled

378
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:35,009
a two and a four, it was two, and you added that up on a track.

379
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:39,271
And when the track reached eight, then it moved into a new economy.

380
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:43,912
And then you again rolled a die to see where it was, which economy it would go to.

381
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,052
The great thing about that system, that's a real pink noise system because you can have

382
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:50,573
big changes.

383
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:52,813
Somebody could roll a one and a six.

384
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:56,895
Somebody could roll doubles for a while in a row and it's not going to change at all,

385
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,316
but you can kind of see it coming.

386
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:03,658
With the first system in Krugman-McMulty, you knew ultimately what most likely economy

387
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:05,859
was, but you couldn't see it coming.

388
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:06,759
Here you can.

389
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,361
You can say, okay, it's at six, it's at seven, it's getting close to that eight point.

390
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:11,361
It may change next turn.

391
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,281
It may not change next turn.

392
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:13,342
Do I want to deal with it now?

393
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:13,922
Do I want to wait?

394
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:20,658
So, you've got big swings, little swings, and some idea of where things are going.

395
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:24,480
So, a much more robust and interesting system for players.

396
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,824
To look at another genre, I want to compare two dinosaur games.

397
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:32,805
The first one is Evo in 2001.

398
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:35,866
This is the environment track from Evo.

399
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:46,091
So one of the things that's really important to your dinosaurs is whether it's temperate or desert or whatever and

400
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:46,331
so the

401
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,493
You guys can see my mouse. You can't see my mouse. Okay, so

402
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:52,636
You have a marker on this track and at the end of each turn you roll a die to see where it moves and you

403
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:57,540
Can see that on a three four five or six it moves forward to the next one on a two

404
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,042
It stays where it is and on a one it actually moves backwards

405
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,806
So again, as a player, I have a really good idea where it's

406
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:04,587
going to be.

407
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:06,628
This is classical brown noise.

408
00:21:06,628 --> 00:21:09,990
So it's kind of a random walk, but it's even more directed

409
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,472
than a random walk.

410
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,833
But it has a very staid feel to it.

411
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,195
It's not going to move that much over the

412
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:17,835
course of the game.

413
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,968
Again, as counterpoint, the game Tyranno X from 1990,

414
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:26,451
which really should be reprinted.

415
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,515
God, please somebody reprint this game,

416
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:32,358
has these environment tokens that are put

417
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,121
onto each separate environment

418
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:39,506
that represent the fruits or suns or whatever.

419
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:45,499
The way that this works, though, is when players add environment tokens, they put them on face

420
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:45,860
down.

421
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,703
So you know what you're putting in, but the other players don't know what you're putting

422
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:48,763
in.

423
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:54,509
And when the number of face down tokens exceeds the number of face up tokens, the environment

424
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:54,870
changes.

425
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,173
You throw away all the face up tokens, you flip everything else up, and the majority

426
00:21:58,173 --> 00:22:00,216
becomes the new winner.

427
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:04,171
depending on how that goes, that can actually cascade

428
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:08,193
into multiple changes immediately.

429
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,915
It can also leave the environment

430
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:13,156
in a really stable state if everyone put

431
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:14,857
in the same kind of feature.

432
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:16,678
Or it can leave it in a really unstable state

433
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:18,500
if there's a lot of different things that are in there.

434
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,262
So it's very much a pink noise process.

435
00:22:22,262 --> 00:22:25,584
And it's a really, really dynamic and interesting part

436
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:28,646
of Torano X because of those cascading features.

437
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:34,329
You also get that cascading feel a little bit in Pandemic

438
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:37,310
when you get kind of these supercritical states

439
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,231
and small differences can make big changes on the board.

440
00:22:40,231 --> 00:22:42,431
But that's, it's not as much of a pink noise process

441
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,512
as there is here.

442
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:48,874
So generating pink noise is actually pretty challenging

443
00:22:48,874 --> 00:22:50,294
in a board game environment.

444
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:52,775
It's really easy in a video game environment.

445
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:55,096
From a board game it can be challenging.

446
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:57,517
There's a couple of different ways to do that.

447
00:22:57,517 --> 00:22:58,357
One is,

448
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:07,072
by using the Dice Delta, like I talked about, which was used in Crude. You can have, I'm

449
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:11,476
going to talk about exploding dice in a second, but you can also have something like this

450
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:15,660
Heat of Battle table from Advanced Squad Leader, which I call Extending the Extremes. In Advanced

451
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,846
Squad Leader, crazy stuff can happen any time you roll a 2 or a 12.

452
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:23,287
This is the chart that what happens if you roll a two.

453
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:26,069
So if you roll a snake eyes on two dice,

454
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:28,030
you then go to this second table

455
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,791
that can result in people going berserk.

456
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,753
It can result in people promoting heroes arising

457
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:35,074
from a squad that was just about to be destroyed.

458
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:37,475
There's all different kinds of things that can happen.

459
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:39,516
And there's this very small chance

460
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:41,818
of gating into this other world,

461
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:43,539
this other table of things that can happen.

462
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,080
So that can be really interesting.

463
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,141
Exploding dice, which as far as I know,

464
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:52,042
were originally used in the game The Uncharted Sea,

465
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:54,343
the miniatures game, is really interesting

466
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,743
because in this game you just roll lots of dice

467
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:58,444
when you're doing an attack.

468
00:23:58,444 --> 00:24:01,125
A one, two, or three is a miss, a four, five is one hit,

469
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,066
but a six is two hits and you get to re-roll those dice.

470
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:05,669
the sixes.

471
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,390
So it creates these moments.

472
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,771
It creates this tension that you have a pretty good idea

473
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:13,792
of what your distribution is going to look like.

474
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:17,894
But you've got a tail now that extends infinitely out.

475
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:20,155
And I've seen some crazy stuff that happens because you're

476
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:20,855
rolling like 20 dice.

477
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:23,736
And so you can get tons of sixes, and it just

478
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:24,477
keeps going and going.

479
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:27,498
And it can lead to these really dramatic and exciting moments.

480
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:31,159
So it leaves out the possibility for real extremes

481
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,621
while keeping things generally focused in the middle.

482
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:40,219
I'm just going to throw out one other thing, just because I've

483
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:41,239
got five minutes left here.

484
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:44,941
So violet noise, as far as I know, has never been

485
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,921
used in a board game.

486
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,002
Violet noise is the exact opposite of pink noise.

487
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:51,142
There's a very, very small chance of something small

488
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:53,123
happening, but really big chances of

489
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:54,003
big things happening.

490
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:56,584
I'm not sure how that would be used, but I'm just throwing it

491
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:58,344
out there for the sake of completeness on the different

492
00:24:58,344 --> 00:24:59,145
colors of noises.

493
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:06,145
So just a couple of design tips, just to kind of wrap it up.

494
00:25:06,145 --> 00:25:09,247
When you're making decisions for the players in terms of how

495
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:12,129
they're approaching things, look at input versus output

496
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:14,210
randomness and how that's going to affect planning,

497
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,371
how that's going to fix strategy,

498
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:17,592
how that's going to affect analysis paralysis of players

499
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:19,073
that have to consider every last thing.

500
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:23,369
Lastly, people like pink noise.

501
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:25,111
So white noise is easy to do.

502
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:26,632
Brown noise is easy to do.

503
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:28,955
Try to come up with systems that will generate pink noise

504
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:33,419
that will give this opportunity for you know mainly what's

505
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,782
going to happen, but it has the chance for these outlier

506
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:39,585
events that keep things really interesting and spice them up.

507
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:42,728
So that's all I've got for today.

508
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:43,528
Thank you.

509
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:45,150
I'd be happy to grab any questions.

510
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,031
I think we've got a

511
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,997
We've got about five minutes left for questions.

512
00:25:52,997 --> 00:25:55,259
So I think there's a microphone in the middle,

513
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,079
if anybody has any.

514
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,562
Otherwise, I will just keep talking.

515
00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:04,987
So your initial quote said, was about uncertainty.

516
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:05,147
Yes.

517
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:10,792
And randomness is one way to achieve uncertainty.

518
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:16,672
in games that I've designed that have a lot of uncertainty being generated by uh... player

519
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:22,395
behavior uh... but no randomness. I've ended up with situations where the play testers will

520
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:27,338
tell me your game is way too random because they're it's too unpredictable to them what's

521
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:32,501
gonna happen based on other people's behaviors uh... if they're not the designer and they

522
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:36,484
don't have they don't see the table well enough to to predict um...

523
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:39,907
Can you think of ways that one might use randomness

524
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:43,510
to provide more predictability to unpredictable player

525
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,150
behavior?

526
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,672
Which seems counterintuitive, but.

527
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:52,777
I think that one way of looking at that is,

528
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,060
I'm almost kind of reminded of a bluffing aspect of a way

529
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,520
to do that.

530
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,943
So you kind of have more of an idea of what,

531
00:26:59,943 --> 00:27:01,864
you don't want it to be absolutely certain what

532
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:02,485
the players are doing.

533
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:05,187
And I'm going to lean back on what Tom Lehman talked

534
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:06,128
about in the last talk.

535
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:12,651
about Race for the Galaxy and the way that players are making choices and the first level heuristic is just pick what's best for you and

536
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:15,992
then after that start to leech off of what other people are doing.

537
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:21,675
So I could kind of see that where you don't want your choices to be too obvious of what people want to do.

538
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:26,657
If all choices are equally valid for people then that's a design

539
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:29,479
related issue that you need to fix. There needs to be...

540
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,902
things that are in general better for people but not to the level of certainty

541
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:39,124
uh... you know this is absolutely what I have to do I have no other options so

542
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:48,350
I would just try to constrain people's choices and that'll make it feel a little

543
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,210
bit better.

544
00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:53,890
lots of different kinds of randomness other than randomizers like other players and so

545
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,071
on.

546
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:59,896
Is there, how do you see being able to apply this concept of different colors of noise

547
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:00,777
to that?

548
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:04,120
Because I'm trying to wrap my head around how would you get pink noise out of other

549
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,102
human behaviors as opposed to randomizers?

550
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,671
That's an interesting question.

551
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:13,334
I'm not sure if there's a direct analog, really, as much.

552
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:15,215
I think with your skill-based stuff,

553
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:19,658
there's always going to be a certain distribution of player

554
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:23,461
performance in flicking games or shooting three-pointers

555
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,362
or what have you.

556
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:29,125
So I'm not sure it's as easy to control it.

557
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,587
In terms of uncertainty with hidden information,

558
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:35,770
stuff like that, I think you can tune it to a certain extent

559
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:38,672
allowing information to come out partially.

560
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:42,195
Like if you look at social deduction games like Werewolf

561
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,436
or Avalon or things like that,

562
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:45,617
there's ways that information leaks out.

563
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:48,219
So then you've got, you don't have a perfect,

564
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:49,380
you're basing it on a little bit of information

565
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,381
which may not be suspect, which I think kind of lays

566
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,542
some of that groundwork that you're talking about.

567
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:52,702
Yeah.

568
00:28:52,702 --> 00:28:53,703
Hi, my name is Toti.

569
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:54,423
And thank you for the talk.

570
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:55,064
It was, I loved it.

571
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:14,722
And I have maybe a comment that I'd like for you to elaborate on.

572
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:25,651
So basically, I think it's interesting that you have these, like you said about pink randomness,

573
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:26,372
or pink noise.

574
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:35,194
That's kind of the holy grail, right? That's what you want to have, that's what people like the most.

575
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:47,541
And you say that it's a trick to make it in a board game environment, it's easy in a digital game or a computer game.

576
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:57,458
I have been designing MMOs, and there it's extremely difficult to prevent it from being

577
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:03,201
a game-killing event, which is like a world-killing event, right?

578
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:07,344
And you know, it's extremely difficult.

579
00:30:07,344 --> 00:30:10,585
So I think it was very interesting that you were...

580
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,017
Mandelbrot and Chaos Theory and Black Swan, right?

581
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:17,619
These are Chaos Theory events.

582
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:21,023
And so, yeah, yeah, this was just my comment

583
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:24,168
that I wanted you to maybe elaborate on it.

584
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:24,728
Thank you.

585
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:27,292
Yeah, I think that you don't wanna have.

586
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,715
And as a designer, you've got to keep the game on track.

587
00:30:30,715 --> 00:30:36,596
I mean, and that's part of the fun and challenge and frustration about being a game designer

588
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:40,377
is you kind of set up this machine, but then it's got to run on its own and the players

589
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:42,118
are providing the input for it.

590
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:45,939
And you can't set up a situation where the players can push it all the way off the edge

591
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:49,559
of the cliff, because they will if they have an opportunity to do that.

592
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:49,619
So...

593
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,607
So you can extend the extremes but still kind of try to keep it constrained in some fashion.

594
00:30:55,607 --> 00:31:00,114
You have to look for closed feedback loops that can move things off really quickly and

595
00:31:00,114 --> 00:31:00,835
stuff like that.

596
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:02,437
So I think that there's...

597
00:31:03,156 --> 00:31:07,219
As a designer, I also do software development.

598
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:10,001
And as a computer programmer, 99% of the things I screw up

599
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,063
are at the edges of my loops, or I forget to check for nulls,

600
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:14,424
or at the corner cases.

601
00:31:14,424 --> 00:31:16,766
And in game design, it's the same thing.

602
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:18,187
You've got to look at your corner cases.

603
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:20,088
What if somebody just does this move over and over and over

604
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:20,628
again?

605
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,789
Or if all the players try to do that,

606
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:23,130
or somebody tries to tank the game,

607
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,072
or somebody tries to end the game on the second turn.

608
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:28,733
You know, you got to look for all of those extreme events.

609
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:32,075
And so you want to create good randomness,

610
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:34,496
but you want to create it in a bounded sandbox

611
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:36,677
that the players can operate in.

612
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,598
You can't let them just completely run amok,

613
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:40,099
because you're not going to get the experience

614
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:42,540
that you want out of it, so.

615
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,720
Okay, I think that's time.

616
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,061
If anyone else has any other questions,

617
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:47,362
I'll be outside afterwards at the meetup area.

618
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:51,724
So thank you all, and please remember to do the surveys

619
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:52,845
if you have the opportunity.
