1
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:07,086
My name is Bobby Stein.

2
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:08,469
I'm Navira King.

3
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,514
And we're here to tell you a little bit

4
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:12,378
about narrative mentorship.

5
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:15,565
So let's get started.

6
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:20,956
So before I actually get into the details of the program

7
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:22,757
that we actually piloted last year,

8
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:25,539
I'll tell you a little bit about the game that we work on

9
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:28,200
and kind of what our studio has been up to the past few years.

10
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:31,742
So our primary project that we work on at ArenaNet

11
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:32,583
is Guild Wars 2.

12
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:34,404
It was originally released in 2012.

13
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:38,706
Currently has a global user base in North America, Europe,

14
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:39,326
and Asia.

15
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:43,449
And at last public count, we had 11 million players.

16
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:47,910
Once the game came out in the fall of 2012,

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,831
we supported it with post-release content

18
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:53,631
that was a blend of two different types of things

19
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:54,251
that we were doing.

20
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:56,812
The first thing was Living World releases

21
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:59,573
that would come out roughly every few months

22
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:01,253
to support the live game.

23
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:02,934
And these were free releases, so all you had to do

24
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,534
was log in and unlock them.

25
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:11,077
And also we had expansions that would be sold for $20 or $30

26
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:15,139
and would have a campaign of a fixed length.

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,880
So between those two post-release strategies,

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,942
we've been able to keep the game basically populated

29
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,703
and successful for the past 6 and 1⁄2 years.

30
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:26,744
So the serialized story releases that

31
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,545
fall under the living world umbrella actually kind of

32
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:35,610
loosely emulated television show, where we'll have a serialized story that progresses with

33
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,554
every release, and then we'll have an expansion which roughly equates to something like a

34
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:43,436
film where it's a bit smaller and more focused.

35
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:48,621
In between those releases, we'll also support the game with new things and features like

36
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,783
raids, fractals, PvP, World v. World.

37
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:55,370
Rapid content, which is just adding small bits into the game.

38
00:01:56,452 --> 00:02:01,200
Microtransaction things like new skins and dyes and things like that.

39
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,843
And quality of life improvements.

40
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:09,120
So in short, when we're talking about Guild Wars as a product,

41
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,221
it has a very diverse player base

42
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,582
because we are a global game.

43
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:15,724
We have people who are playing with their kids.

44
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,125
We have adults, retirees.

45
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,485
My father is a player.

46
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:22,567
So yeah, we got people in their 70s and 80s

47
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:24,428
who actually play the game, as well as kids

48
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:26,389
who are pretty young.

49
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,211
It's a global game with a global audience.

50
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:32,633
So actually everything on this map represents where we have players.

51
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:36,396
If it's filled in with any color, there are players there.

52
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:40,619
The two darkest regions are the ones with our biggest concentrated player bases.

53
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:46,603
Fun fact, actually in Antarctica we have four players, so they're very active.

54
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,911
So all this means, it leads us to the importance

55
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:55,573
of storytelling diversity to reach such a global audience.

56
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:57,253
And when we're talking about diversity,

57
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:01,276
we're not just talking about diverse characters in game

58
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:05,398
or diverse ways of dialogue and ways of speaking

59
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:06,518
to represent those people.

60
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,940
We're talking about diversity of teams

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,441
that will bring about more authentically diverse stories.

62
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:18,279
When you have a diverse team, and I'm talking about across demos, we're talking gender,

63
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:24,661
ethnicity, sexuality, generation, neurotypicality, if that's a word,

64
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:31,063
all of those sorts of buckets that would make up the diverse human population,

65
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:37,805
those are the kinds of folks you want to bring to a diverse narrative team. The reason is that

66
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:42,787
the more folks you have represented at your table in your narrative team, the more perspectives

67
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,387
the more authenticity to those stories and the less fear.

68
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,800
comes less fear and more checks and balances.

69
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,961
So there's no way to represent everybody

70
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,142
within a narrative team.

71
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,362
But when you have more diversity,

72
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:59,303
you have folks who have more,

73
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,984
they've encountered different stories.

74
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,785
There's more likely to be someone who says,

75
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,066
hey, that sounds like appropriation.

76
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:08,666
Why don't we go check over here

77
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,607
and get a better feedback

78
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,348
on what the story we're trying to tell.

79
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:14,508
It makes our stories more authentic.

80
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,929
And when we're talking about diverse stories,

81
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,290
we're talking about dynamically diverse stories.

82
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:22,591
It's the difference between, you know,

83
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,492
we can research anything.

84
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,833
Google, internet, we can do all of those things, right?

85
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:28,374
We can come up with a story,

86
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:33,196
but a personal point of view is much stronger.

87
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:35,676
It's the difference between hearing about the Civil War

88
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:38,398
with locations and battles and the dates

89
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:43,420
versus a soldier's personal on the field remembrances

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,180
and how engaging that story can be.

91
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,115
And that leads us to specificity.

92
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,878
Specificity leads to universality.

93
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:53,339
And when I talk about that,

94
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,401
there's two sides to the audience coin.

95
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,504
There is the A side,

96
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,907
the side that's represented on the screen or in the story.

97
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:04,209
It's familiar to them, it represents them.

98
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,964
themselves or it is familiar to them in some way or it's their story.

99
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:11,745
The B-side is everyone else, the others.

100
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:19,067
You're not represented on that screen, but if the representation is authentic, you know,

101
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:20,487
even if you're the other.

102
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:25,369
On some subliminal level, even if you can't articulate, you recognize the authenticity,

103
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:30,950
the truth in that story, in that character, in that plot, the groundedness of the world

104
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,511
and of the interactions.

105
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:36,813
So when we talk about both sides of that audience coin,

106
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,534
we're talking about a global hunger right now

107
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,234
for diversity in stories and representation.

108
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:45,955
New stories, new perspectives, perfect examples,

109
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:48,896
Black Panther, Get Out, Crazy Rich Asians.

110
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:52,177
Those are all very specific stories

111
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:54,557
told by very specific personalities,

112
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:58,578
very specific communities with very specific perspectives.

113
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,659
But global audiences ate those stories up.

114
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:05,616
regardless if they saw themselves in it

115
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,996
or if they were among the others.

116
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,597
So, and also there's a new,

117
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:12,297
the new normal is a spectrum

118
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:14,178
of representation within a story.

119
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:16,078
Perfect example, Captain Marvel.

120
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:17,259
So everyone's looking at it,

121
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,619
it's the first female superhero,

122
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,599
but if you've seen the movie,

123
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,420
there are many women.

124
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,961
many diverse people of color mixed in,

125
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,583
and no one's like, hey, here's this other person,

126
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:29,804
and it's not called attention, attention's not called to it,

127
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:32,545
but it's strong, and it gives a stronger story,

128
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,566
and an audience that's more engaged.

129
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:37,567
This hunger leads to audience engagement.

130
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,469
Engaged, happy players equal profit.

131
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:42,289
That's in case you need a business case

132
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,151
for why diverse staffing is important, there you go.

133
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:49,133
So.

134
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:56,764
The whole concept of mentorship as it was kind of

135
00:06:56,784 --> 00:07:00,611
developed on our team.

136
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:04,353
was basically we were confronted with a problem.

137
00:07:04,513 --> 00:07:06,814
We had, at the beginning of last year,

138
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,816
a couple of vacancies in the narrative department.

139
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,638
We were looking for a couple of writer narrative designers.

140
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,780
And when we opened up the job position

141
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,101
and we started getting applications,

142
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,843
we started realizing that we were

143
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:22,865
seeing a lot of the same people applying for the job

144
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:23,925
repeatedly.

145
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:24,506
That's great.

146
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:28,390
Just because someone didn't get a job the first time they

147
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,313
applied doesn't mean that they're not qualified.

148
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:33,816
It might just mean that what we were looking for specifically,

149
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:37,080
they didn't have, or there was someone more

150
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,001
appropriate for the role.

151
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,245
But we did start realizing that we had a lot of.

152
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,933
the same applicants over and over again,

153
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,874
and we weren't really seeing a lot of new people

154
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:47,994
come through the pipeline for review.

155
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:52,576
We also started realizing that after talking to some folks

156
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,756
about the position, we realized that they were interested

157
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,297
in the job, but they didn't bother applying

158
00:07:57,337 --> 00:08:00,978
because when they looked at the job requirements, they...

159
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:04,600
felt that because they didn't meet every single bullet point

160
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,703
that they would have no chance, and therefore, they

161
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:08,723
didn't bother applying.

162
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:12,146
So they were sort of self-selecting themselves out

163
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:13,047
of the candidate pool.

164
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:18,811
And also because those job requirements were a bit heavy,

165
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,113
we were asking for people who had experience in television

166
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:25,837
and then also in other media like comics or novelizations

167
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:26,537
or pen and paper.

168
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,267
There was a bit of a barrier to entry.

169
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:33,409
We were getting some people who were applying who had really

170
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,771
great portfolios and samples, but because they lacked the

171
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,552
years on the job that we were looking for, we were actually

172
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:44,514
hiring for a mid-level position, that they just

173
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:46,895
decided not to bother.

174
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:53,478
So these promising candidates, we realized that we were

175
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,939
discouraging them, and we needed to do

176
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,720
something about it.

177
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:04,039
At the end of the review cycle, we figured, let's take a look at this and figure out if

178
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:05,040
there's a better way to do it.

179
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:11,046
So we figured that mentorship might actually be a good solution to the problem.

180
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:16,946
If we could provide a roadmap to the candidates who

181
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,390
were promising but maybe not quite ready for the job,

182
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,052
we could maybe help prepare them,

183
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:24,895
not only for a job with us, but really for a job

184
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:26,577
at any studio in the industry.

185
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:31,442
We felt that getting more people into the mix

186
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:34,085
would ultimately benefit the industry as a whole.

187
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:42,408
We would offer support to those folks and also basically make ourselves available,

188
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:46,570
whether it was during work hours for certain sessions or

189
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,290
just make ourselves available to answer

190
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,511
e-mails if they had questions about any particular thing.

191
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,552
Lastly, we wanted the mentorship program to be self-directed.

192
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:57,473
Not everybody coming in was going to be looking for the same thing,

193
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:02,195
and rather than try and manage every person trying to come through the program,

194
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:06,385
we felt that it would be better if we put that responsibility

195
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:06,786
on them.

196
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:12,130
So now that we decided that we wanted

197
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,492
to use mentorship as a way for people to kind of get

198
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:16,614
over that hurdle, whether it's to get their first job

199
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:19,536
or just to kind of leverage their own experiences

200
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:21,939
into a new career path, we needed

201
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,521
to figure out who we were going to invite to participate.

202
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,583
So we set out a couple of guidelines,

203
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:28,424
and they were very simple.

204
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,246
We were actually going to open the mentorship

205
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:31,126
program to anybody.

206
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:36,911
So anybody could apply or express interest.

207
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,513
But we wanted to also focus on folks

208
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:41,154
who needed a little bit of extra help getting

209
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:42,576
over that hurdle for the first job.

210
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:46,198
So we were looking for people whose voices were

211
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,680
underrepresented in game narrative.

212
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:51,663
Those who were experiencing financial hardships

213
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,284
didn't have the means to necessarily get

214
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:56,847
the education that is often required for these jobs.

215
00:10:57,307 --> 00:11:02,112
and folks who show strength of character like veterans and folks involved in public service.

216
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:09,438
To sort of summarize that, everyone who is, when we say underrepresented voices,

217
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:16,464
we really mean not white, not male, cis, male, heterosexual, that little bucket.

218
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:21,088
So investing in those future storytellers

219
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:22,830
and bringing them to the table is not just

220
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,571
about hiring an arena net like Bobby said,

221
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:28,374
it's also about elevating the industry as a whole.

222
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:32,117
The more really strong storytellers we have out there

223
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:34,278
in games, the better stories we'll have in games,

224
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:38,462
the more engaged people will be in what we're creating.

225
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,467
So now that we had decided to start the program,

226
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:44,828
we needed to reach out to folks.

227
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,070
The first thing that we did is actually

228
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,533
get back in touch with folks who had applied for the position

229
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,515
with us, but didn't quite make the cut.

230
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:56,477
We scheduled conference calls with them,

231
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:59,279
kind of explained to them why we felt they weren't quite

232
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,581
ready for a job with us.

233
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,942
But we then extended the offer to have

234
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:04,944
them participate in the mentorship program.

235
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,007
We also polled our professional network.

236
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:12,370
We started asking narrative folk at other companies

237
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:16,893
and asking if they knew of anyone through their network

238
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:18,374
who they could recommend.

239
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:20,956
Lastly, we reached out on social media.

240
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:25,600
If there was anybody whose conduct and candor

241
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,082
and thoughts about narrative design and writing

242
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,504
we felt were interesting or promising,

243
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:33,065
we would reach out to them and try and get to know them

244
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:33,626
a little bit better.

245
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:43,796
So I was one of these people who was looking to break into narrative design and writing for games.

246
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:51,682
A little secret, I'm older than I might look and so when I was in undergrad there weren't

247
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:56,565
any creative narrative game development tracks.

248
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,589
It just wasn't anything that folks were thinking about.

249
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:03,635
Like maybe if you were in computer engineering,

250
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:04,896
it was something for you.

251
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,979
But from a creative writing perspective,

252
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,283
it just wasn't there from a storytelling perspective.

253
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:10,945
I was a film student.

254
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:12,607
My first career.

255
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:18,671
was as a creative producer and writer in variety TV and video.

256
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,173
I had a few years prior to looking to move into games

257
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,854
where I was working as a developing content

258
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:29,636
for mixed reality, but I didn't have any traditional game

259
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:31,577
experience, game writing experience.

260
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:39,099
I had uncredited writing chops and that production creative team experience, but it really wasn't sure how to

261
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:42,440
Make the transition. There's no clear roadmap

262
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,321
Everybody says a little bit different, you know gives you a little bit different type of advice for how to break in

263
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,362
But it's very difficult if you're on the outside to figure out what that track is

264
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:56,683
What skills that I had which which skills were applicable? I

265
00:13:57,784 --> 00:14:02,628
didn't know because every single studio has a different posting

266
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:05,371
for what it is to be a writer, a writer narrative designer,

267
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:06,412
a narrative designer.

268
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:07,753
Everybody's terms are different.

269
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:09,735
I couldn't figure out when everybody

270
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:13,339
says change your resume to reflect this particular job

271
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,403
posting, what in my varied freelance career of

272
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:23,986
more than decade, could be applied for what I was trying to get into.

273
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:29,189
Let's be honest, studios and narrative departments and recruiters,

274
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:33,231
when they're posting something and trying to fill a spot on their team,

275
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:40,214
they don't have time to walk applicants through how to showcase what your skills are

276
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:44,396
and how to tell them that you really should be on their team.

277
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,177
So...

278
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:49,940
I didn't know what I didn't know, right?

279
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,463
I'm a storyteller, but the games industry, that landscape,

280
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,205
was really foreign to me, and I needed a map.

281
00:14:58,386 --> 00:14:59,847
I was doing informational interviews,

282
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:04,211
but I really wished for the sort of invaluable resource

283
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:08,334
of hands-on training, field apprenticeship, if you will.

284
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:12,577
I needed honest feedback and quality attention

285
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,438
from folks who were already in it.

286
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:22,642
So now that we were committed to doing the program,

287
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:24,344
and we had actually reached out to folks,

288
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:27,947
we wanted to actually have a plan of what

289
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:28,868
to do once they showed up.

290
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,391
So we decided to focus on three major areas

291
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,273
that we felt would be most useful to mentees who

292
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:35,814
were trying to.

293
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:41,712
market themselves, but then also to us as a team looking to grow.

294
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:46,998
Basically, if we could foster somebody's career development,

295
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:49,862
what would we want to advise them on?

296
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:52,264
So we've broken into three categories.

297
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:56,089
Screenwriting, just basically writing screenplays or teleplays

298
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,951
to adapt it for games.

299
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:02,134
Narrative design, basically getting people to understand

300
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:05,718
that they are writing not just for linear media,

301
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:08,340
that we have concepts of things like branching,

302
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,123
that we often will be partnering with game designers

303
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:16,187
and artists and programmers to represent the story

304
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,330
in outside of scenes and cinematics,

305
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,651
but also through gameplay.

306
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,061
And lastly, career development.

307
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:26,163
A lot of schools don't really give you much coaching when

308
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:28,945
it comes to how to be a good collaborative

309
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:30,866
partner on the job.

310
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:35,189
So we felt that if there was anything that we could do to

311
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:40,191
give people tips and a little bit of direction on how to

312
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,533
present themselves in interviews, and also once they

313
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:46,355
were on the job, how to basically be good partners in

314
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:47,236
development.

315
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:51,239
basically to be good advocates for story,

316
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,463
but then also to respect partners in adjacent disciplines.

317
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,994
So the structure was we would meet once per week.

318
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:03,575
Every Wednesday, the mentees would come in.

319
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:07,276
We would play the game together for about an hour, at

320
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:10,177
which point various members of staff would answer any

321
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,998
questions if people were new to the game that we were making.

322
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:15,719
But then after that session was over, we would spend the

323
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,479
next couple of hours doing a variety of things.

324
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,260
Some days it would be just a question and answer session of

325
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,560
people.

326
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,582
had something that they wanted to learn more about.

327
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,525
We would do lectures or give presentations

328
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:30,447
on various aspects of screenwriting or narrative design.

329
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:34,890
We'd also give feedback either on the scripts

330
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:36,071
that people want to show us

331
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,914
or on some projects that they were working on.

332
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:42,216
Lastly, we would periodically give assignments.

333
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:44,038
So at the end of a presentation...

334
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:47,400
covering a particular topic, we would ask them to come back

335
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,242
for the following week and maybe dissect

336
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:55,545
a narrative moment or gameplay moment from something that they had been playing

337
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:59,448
and kind of break it apart into its components and talk about

338
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:03,530
if they were to re-engineer it or if a game director came to them and said,

339
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,131
okay, listen,

340
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:07,133
we need to change the sequence. Let's not use a cinematic, but

341
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,515
do this through gameplay. Like, what ideas could they bring to the table?

342
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,717
So that we get them thinking critically about story delivery in games.

343
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,625
beyond just the script itself.

344
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:23,640
Here's a picture of a couple of mentees and some of the guys

345
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,322
who work at ArenaNet, game designers.

346
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:31,146
This is really to show it was a very casual environment

347
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,449
a lot of times that fostered that sort of relationship

348
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,371
and give and take and asking questions.

349
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:42,396
And also just dialogue, which is very important and also very

350
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:44,178
rare when you're trying to break in.

351
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,971
Yeah, this is actually a photo from a mock.

352
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,680
Oh yeah, sorry that's coming up.

353
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:51,863
Spoiler.

354
00:18:53,614 --> 00:19:01,058
So the end goal that we wanted was to provide a career guidance for the mentee, give them

355
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:03,920
advice and help with their portfolio development.

356
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,162
You know, if they came to us with a portfolio, we'd give them feedback on how to strengthen

357
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:08,262
it.

358
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:13,125
And a lot of that would come based on what jobs they were actually looking to get.

359
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:18,387
Someone's portfolio might look different if they were going for a pure narrative design

360
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,888
job versus a pure writing job.

361
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:25,434
So we wanted to kind of educate them on the differences so that they could scale their

362
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:29,878
samples accordingly and also just provide ongoing support as they needed it.

363
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,781
So my experience coming in, as I mentioned,

364
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,702
I had been doing informational interviews

365
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:39,163
and sort of mining my network as much as possible

366
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,884
to try to figure out who to talk to

367
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:42,905
and who's already doing the job

368
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:45,246
or something above the job that I really wanted to do.

369
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:48,527
And through that, I was introduced to Tom Abernathy,

370
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:50,808
who's our studio narrative director, and Bobby.

371
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:53,549
One of the first things that they asked me for

372
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,070
once they told me about the program,

373
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:58,153
was a couple of writing samples,

374
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:01,457
preferably a teleplay if I had one,

375
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:05,581
but something that I thought represented my range

376
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,844
and my abilities, so that they could kind of see

377
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:08,545
where I was at.

378
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:12,309
In addition, Bobby sent me a self-assessment to fill out.

379
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:17,210
And the beauty of this is that it got us on the same page.

380
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,931
I was able to say, here are what I believe my strengths are,

381
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,431
what I feel very comfortable in,

382
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:25,592
and here are the weaknesses that I know that I have,

383
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:28,373
even in general, in terms of those three buckets,

384
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:33,154
screenwriting, narrative, design, and career development.

385
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:38,555
So for me, it set the tone and set expectations

386
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:40,436
for what this program was going to provide.

387
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:46,127
It also set the feeling of a safe space to not know.

388
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:49,349
I think a lot of people in underrepresented groups,

389
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,790
folks don't understand is that they always feel

390
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,132
that you need to put your very, very, very best foot forward.

391
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:58,893
Like I know I'll fake it till I make it, you know what I mean?

392
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,513
Like, and so when you do that,

393
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:02,834
yes, you can, it'll help you get in sometimes,

394
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:04,335
but it also doesn't,

395
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:10,960
in a mentorship program where you're supposed to be learning and taking away all of the benefits,

396
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,583
being comfortable and saying, I just don't know about this is really important. So setting that

397
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:21,027
tone from the outside was great. For me personally, I was missing that game development narrative

398
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:25,330
design side. I had some screenwriting, even though it was nice to get

399
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:32,256
more honest feedback on how I was doing and I wasn't green in terms of my professional career.

400
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:38,020
The other thing was that I came into the program several weeks behind the other mentees.

401
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,023
I mention this because it speaks to the agility of a program like this,

402
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:48,027
that I was able to jump in and still get a lot out of it.

403
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:55,471
It was about the quality of the time that I spent with Bobby and Armand Constantin,

404
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:58,913
our narrative design lead, and a couple of other people.

405
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:03,515
It was about the quantity, the quality of time, not the quantity of time.

406
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:10,759
So one of the things when I first started, I did the narrative design lectures like Bobby was mentioning.

407
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:11,579
He had...

408
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:15,484
some one-on-ones with me to catch me up on the lectures he'd given.

409
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:19,307
The nice thing about this is that they were structured, but they were also very organic.

410
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:26,692
So if there was something that I was like, okay, I get X, Y, but Z over here, let's dig

411
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:27,152
into that.

412
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:28,133
Give me more examples.

413
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:29,153
Let me ask more questions.

414
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:30,054
Let me really deep dive.

415
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:34,180
I did the group session with other mentees.

416
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,087
The great thing about that is that if you have a diverse group of mentees at different

417
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:43,213
walks of life, career life, they're going to bring different

418
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,504
points to the table and ask different questions,

419
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:48,266
and the dialogue will be a lot richer.

420
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,687
So instead of having a bunch of,

421
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:52,590
you know, having my cohort be everyone just like me,

422
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,074
it was much nicer to have that diversity

423
00:22:56,154 --> 00:22:57,736
within the group as well.

424
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:02,181
We did things like I broke story for my,

425
00:23:03,322 --> 00:23:03,543
my,

426
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,361
we were pitching an episode of Guild Wars 2.

427
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:10,342
And so I got to break a story for that,

428
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:11,742
for the one that I really wanted to do,

429
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,243
with our narrative design lead.

430
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,183
I got to pitch it.

431
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:17,583
I have a pitch session with a contingent

432
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:20,024
of the narrative design team, and it was real.

433
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:22,385
It was like, let's poke some holes in this.

434
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:23,785
How would we fix this?

435
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:25,965
It was a session like I would have gotten

436
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:27,746
if I had been staff already.

437
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,647
I had a collaborative time one-on-one

438
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:32,767
with one of the game designers.

439
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,827
You saw that photo with several game designers.

440
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:37,468
But first we were paired off with a game designer

441
00:23:37,508 --> 00:23:39,629
as if we were the two working on an episode.

442
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:43,469
And we worked through what would the player experience be?

443
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:45,430
All of the things, the questions that are gonna come

444
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,530
from a game designer that a writer's not necessarily

445
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,311
gonna be thinking of, if your background's just writing,

446
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:52,972
it gave me that give and take

447
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:55,012
that I wouldn't have gotten from a book.

448
00:23:56,493 --> 00:24:01,434
So that, and then we had, in addition to being paired

449
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:05,176
with that game designer, we had one of the game designers

450
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,297
pretend to be the game director, and he showed up

451
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:10,498
and was like, well now, let me throw some monkeys

452
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,438
into the wrench, wrenches into the monkey, whatever.

453
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:13,699
I'm making words up.

454
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:14,919
I'm a writer.

455
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,141
So the three things that really come out of that

456
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:20,902
is that you get honest feedback.

457
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:23,963
That is invaluable to someone looking to break in.

458
00:24:25,156 --> 00:24:26,697
You're getting real world scenarios,

459
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:29,400
and you're being challenged.

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,943
And those challenges highlighted for me

461
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:36,446
which skills I had in my backpack that I could utilize

462
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:39,368
and where my weaknesses were and what I needed to learn

463
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:41,090
and really double down on.

464
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:45,434
So, you know, Bobby mentioned support earlier.

465
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,235
Support is a resource.

466
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:51,601
Support is a resource that many underrepresented groups

467
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,082
that we mentioned, they lack.

468
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:56,325
Support and encouragement gave me the confidence

469
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:59,006
and the authority to bring my talents to the table.

470
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,789
More empowered voices are going to elevate

471
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,011
our industry as a whole, in narrative.

472
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:08,093
So.

473
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:10,898
How did it go?

474
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,858
I'll tell you.

475
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,759
So the program actually went for roughly six months.

476
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,560
It sort of formed organically.

477
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,121
And we started looking at creating it in January.

478
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:23,641
But it really didn't get going until about February.

479
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:26,022
It lasted roughly six months until July.

480
00:25:26,562 --> 00:25:29,883
We had six total participants who came in at various stages.

481
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:33,504
About half of them made it through the entire time

482
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,605
or basically performed what we figured was.

483
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,869
completing the major assignment, which was pitching an episode,

484
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:45,011
coming up with an outline, working with a designer

485
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:47,332
on what the narrative design would be,

486
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:51,875
and then doing a draft of the script of The Golden Path.

487
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:55,118
And we made one higher at the end.

488
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:57,899
We just, our success story.

489
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,711
You know, all the mentees who participated were great

490
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:08,652
and definitely brought really wonderful experiences

491
00:26:08,872 --> 00:26:10,773
to the program and hopefully walked away with them.

492
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:15,015
But Novera, I think from her work in television

493
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:19,937
and also in, what was it, AR and VR development,

494
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:24,178
was able to pick up on a lot of these things pretty quickly.

495
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:25,098
So she was-

496
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:26,019
It's because I'm old.

497
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:26,579
Yeah.

498
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:27,159
Yeah.

499
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:27,519
Yeah.

500
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:28,140
Yeah.

501
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:31,396
Moving on.

502
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,057
Moving on.

503
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:35,420
Sorry.

504
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,662
So what next?

505
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:42,507
So we actually think that the program was a success,

506
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:44,970
even though only half of the participants

507
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,111
actually made it through to the end.

508
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:49,995
So what we want to do is learn from our experiences

509
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:52,197
and try and revise it and try it again.

510
00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:58,427
So the first thing that we actually did was we looked inward and we started doing an internal

511
00:26:58,467 --> 00:26:59,308
version of the program.

512
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:04,356
So if there were folks who were already working at the company in either in adjacent disciplines

513
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,341
or just elsewhere in the company but not in narrative.

514
00:27:08,182 --> 00:27:10,782
we would encourage them to come to these sessions.

515
00:27:11,182 --> 00:27:15,403
Sometimes they had the desire or expectation or goal

516
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:17,264
of actually moving into narrative at some point,

517
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:19,044
and others just actually wanted to be,

518
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,825
to understand more about the discipline

519
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:24,085
so that if we were partnered together,

520
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:26,806
it would be a much smoother process.

521
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:28,966
So we had a lot of game designers who actually would come,

522
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,127
learn a lot more about breaking story

523
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:34,388
for serialized or episodic content,

524
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:37,348
and basically kind of involve them in things

525
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:37,628
so that...

526
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:40,831
they would learn more about our discipline.

527
00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:44,054
And the great side effect is we would learn more

528
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:45,835
about their discipline, so we would end up

529
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,096
being better partners with each other.

530
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:50,019
And we also decided to add networking

531
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,080
to the career development.

532
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,101
A lot of times people, you know,

533
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,643
either are naturally good networkers or they're not.

534
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:58,986
We figured that since it was so important for people's

535
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,909
employment future forward.

536
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,430
Especially in games.

537
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:06,291
Yeah, exactly.

538
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:07,072
More so than a lot of other industries.

539
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:08,473
A lot of times people will get work

540
00:28:08,873 --> 00:28:10,214
through the people who they know.

541
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:12,456
So we decided to add that in.

542
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,978
We also wanted to make sure that we were

543
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:18,060
supporting people outside the group sessions.

544
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,381
So we did group sessions only because

545
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,043
we didn't have enough people who could dedicate

546
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:24,544
one on one time to everybody who wanted to participate.

547
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,328
And when we actually brought the program in internally,

548
00:28:29,348 --> 00:28:33,031
it was even more lopsided.

549
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,853
Basically, we only had a few people who were able

550
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,734
to dedicate any of their time to the program

551
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:38,035
and a lot of people interested.

552
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:41,218
So we would typically have conversations

553
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:44,020
where it was myself and maybe one other person

554
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,502
from the narrative team and like.

555
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:48,303
15 people from adjacent disciplines showing up,

556
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:50,423
so there's just no way we can devote

557
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:52,104
a significant amount of time to everybody.

558
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:54,465
But outside of those sessions,

559
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:57,966
if people had 15 minutes or a half hour to just talk,

560
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,307
or if they just sent us a link,

561
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:01,327
hey listen, I wrote this,

562
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:02,628
would you mind giving me some feedback?

563
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:04,588
Well then if we had free time in our day,

564
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:08,430
we would look at that and give them a little bit of our time.

565
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,990
Another thing, sorry.

566
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:10,695
Yeah, no, go ahead.

567
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:11,997
Another thing we're gonna be doing

568
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,618
is partnering with outside studios.

569
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:15,801
So calling back to what I said

570
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:17,863
about how every studio does narrative design

571
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:18,744
and writing differently,

572
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:23,589
exposing mentees to a range of positions

573
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,171
and mentorship will actually, again,

574
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,674
help them become better candidates

575
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:30,056
and elevate the industry.

576
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:30,856
Yeah.

577
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:46,843
So if actually you are working at a studio and you're interested in learning more about our experiences or developing a program for yourself or if you're in the Seattle area and you want to partner with us, one of the things we had talked about is maybe mentees spending.

578
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:53,010
a few days at our studio and then maybe going to a different studio to see how the

579
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:58,897
writer narrative designer job is different from place to place and a lot of that will be dependent on the project of the job

580
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:03,863
But we feel that it could be a very good opportunity for people to kind of broaden their horizons

581
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:08,818
So thank you for coming, and we'd

582
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:12,619
like to give a special thanks to the folks listed over here.

583
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,700
They either participated in the program,

584
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,981
or they helped us develop it.

585
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,602
And without their help, we wouldn't be up here today.

586
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:22,623
So special thanks to them.

587
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:26,464
And if you would like to contact us outside of this,

588
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:27,685
there's our information.

589
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:28,825
So thank you very much.

590
00:30:28,845 --> 00:30:29,325
Thanks.

591
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,182
If you, we don't have to vacate this room,

592
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,207
so if you do have questions, we have a few more minutes.

593
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:40,688
Yeah.

594
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:41,409
To chat.

595
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:43,232
No questions?

596
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,113
Any questions?

597
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:45,876
And if you know you're shy,

598
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:47,399
we could always talk about it out in the hall.

599
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:48,080
Don't be shy!

600
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,382
We won't bite, we promise.

601
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:58,424
Hi, so I guess I am a more general designer that's not actually working in narrative at

602
00:30:58,464 --> 00:30:59,846
the moment, but I would like to be.

603
00:31:01,607 --> 00:31:06,332
My studio doesn't offer as many opportunities to do that.

604
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:13,639
What are things that I should be doing to be able to work more towards that direction?

605
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:28,201
Sure. OK. So you're a game designer and you're interested in learning more about narrative. So to open up career opportunities and also partner with narrative. Is that correct. Yes. Sure. Well one of the things that I would recommend.

606
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:32,727
I mean there's a lot of ways you could do it right. I think.

607
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:38,470
Probably talking to some folks and networking would be a good place to start because depending on

608
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:44,854
specifically what you're looking to learn, it might actually, you might get different advice

609
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:50,897
depending on who you're talking to. There are a few books we can recommend. I guess my question

610
00:31:50,937 --> 00:31:55,880
is are you looking at developing like serialized story or something that's very cinematic in nature

611
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,622
or are you looking at something that's more like gameplay focused? Probably more gameplay focused.

612
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:01,122
Okay.

613
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,099
Let's talk after this, because I'd

614
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,980
like to learn a little bit more about your situation.

615
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,822
But I think probably the easiest take, sorry,

616
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:12,243
the simplest takeaway from this is

617
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:15,525
talk to some people who might work at studios with projects

618
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:17,986
that might align with what you're looking to learn.

619
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:20,087
And we could probably get you paired up with somebody

620
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:22,529
who might be able to shed a little bit more light.

621
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:27,814
on that. I know some people who are a bit more systems focused in narrative versus other people

622
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:32,458
who are a little bit more screenwriting focused and depending on what you're looking for,

623
00:32:32,478 --> 00:32:36,621
we can make a different recommendation for you. All right, thank you. You're welcome.

624
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:39,204
Go ahead.

625
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:41,896
Hi, thanks for this talk.

626
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:43,697
I have the obvious question.

627
00:32:43,857 --> 00:32:47,559
If I or someone I know would be interested in participating

628
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,720
in the next round of the mentorship program,

629
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,841
what would be the appropriate channel

630
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:53,702
to get involved in that?

631
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,403
OK, so you're asking if you want to participate

632
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,624
in our mentorship program, how you would go about that.

633
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:04,307
So the initial plan was to actually have an application

634
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:07,448
process ready to go today so that we could announce it.

635
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:08,529
And it would have been grand.

636
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:09,549
And happy and.

637
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:11,672
Unfortunately, we did not.

638
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:13,354
So that didn't come together.

639
00:33:13,654 --> 00:33:15,777
So I can't point you to a website to apply.

640
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:20,201
But what I'm hoping to do is once we finish the internal

641
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:23,325
mentorship program that we're running right now, start up

642
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:24,446
another external one.

643
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,847
And what we would likely do.

644
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:30,251
is post it on the same website where we would post our jobs.

645
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:32,693
And it would just be, the reason we would do it that way

646
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:34,494
is just because we already have an established system

647
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:35,915
for fielding applications.

648
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:38,117
And then this way people could submit

649
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:40,799
not only their resume or a cover letter.

650
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,640
And by the way, for something like this,

651
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,182
it's very important that you have a cover letter

652
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:47,604
because just seeing the things that you've done

653
00:33:47,644 --> 00:33:49,585
doesn't really tell us anything about who you are.

654
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:51,567
We really wanna know what.

655
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:54,400
a little bit more about you and your outlook on narrative,

656
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,861
but then also what you're looking for.

657
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:59,102
We would also want to look at a portfolio

658
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:02,044
so that we could kind of gauge what your strengths were.

659
00:34:02,444 --> 00:34:04,105
And then if it was a good match,

660
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:05,606
then we could continue the conversation.

661
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:09,589
I would also say following Bobby on Twitter

662
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:14,592
is a really good way to find out about anything

663
00:34:14,872 --> 00:34:16,693
that we're doing in terms of mentorship

664
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:18,274
or job openings in narrative.

665
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:20,695
You're really good at.

666
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,605
sharing that information and also free advice like constantly so I'm just gonna throw that out there.

667
00:34:26,645 --> 00:34:29,848
It might not be good advice but it is free so thank you for what it's worth.

668
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:30,849
Excellent, thank you.

669
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:33,011
Hey guys, great chat.

670
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:40,197
I'm Blair Leggett with One More Story Games and the question I have for you guys is the kind of technology you're using

671
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,313
to assess these candidates or work with them

672
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,414
or iterate through that.

673
00:34:45,894 --> 00:34:49,657
Were you using particularly in-house tools with ArenaNet?

674
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:53,000
Was it paper mock-ups or maybe twine

675
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,021
or something else like that?

676
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:56,723
How did you find that and how effective that was?

677
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:57,504
Okay, cool.

678
00:34:57,524 --> 00:35:00,446
So you're asking if there were any tools or processes

679
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,348
that we were using in the mentorship program

680
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:04,710
to help with the coaching process.

681
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,191
Yeah.

682
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:05,651
Okay.

683
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,213
So it was a lot of paper, to be honest.

684
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:11,155
There were some things like showing us

685
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:13,597
what the narrative design docs looked like internally

686
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:16,039
that Bobby would often put up on a screen.

687
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,563
But because every studio might have different tools,

688
00:35:21,263 --> 00:35:24,526
the sessions weren't about learning that set of tools.

689
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:26,267
It was more about, you know, these

690
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,108
are some of the things that you might need to think about.

691
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:32,137
depending on your studio, might need to learn.

692
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:33,898
You'll have to learn a tool, et cetera.

693
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:40,060
So the paper works a lot better, especially in conversations

694
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,361
about what is in your narrative design,

695
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:44,662
what's supposed to happen next, what is the gameplay,

696
00:35:45,162 --> 00:35:47,063
and just kind of walking through it that way.

697
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:49,163
And just even being able to assess it,

698
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:52,045
because sometimes you can have something on paper

699
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:54,025
which can be very effective, but.

700
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:59,926
as a review tool that doesn't always necessarily work, so just wondering what you found with that.

701
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:04,646
Yeah, so we, I mean, internally when we're developing an episode,

702
00:36:04,686 --> 00:36:08,487
we'll use a combination of off-the-shelf stuff

703
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:10,168
and then proprietary things, right?

704
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:11,989
But, like, so for example,

705
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,909
when the writers are writing a draft of the script,

706
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:15,430
they're usually going to do it in final draft

707
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,511
or they might do something in Word.

708
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:19,231
But we have a template that we use in Word

709
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:21,072
that emulates screenplay format.

710
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:23,833
So that's usually a good, quick way

711
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,374
to write a golden path for review.

712
00:36:26,995 --> 00:36:27,935
As far as what ...

713
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:31,059
we would expect from a narrative design document,

714
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,445
we have kind of a loose template that we would share with people

715
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,848
and just say, hey, try and give us something that

716
00:36:36,868 --> 00:36:37,709
looked roughly like this.

717
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:39,532
And really, it was more about, we

718
00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:41,635
need to see this kind of information being conveyed.

719
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:43,918
And often what happened was we would get.

720
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:47,001
documents that were overly detailed in the wrong spots.

721
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,462
So we would ask them to start very high level,

722
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,643
summarize things, use log lines,

723
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:53,164
get good with an elevator pitch.

724
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:56,226
Because when you're pitching an idea to a game director

725
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,527
or a narrative director, the last thing you want to do

726
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:00,528
is overwhelm them with detail.

727
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:02,329
You really need to keep it very simple.

728
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,931
So that was kind of the overriding message

729
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:06,852
that we were trying to impart.

730
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:10,046
I would also say that the game designers at ArenaNet

731
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:12,469
are surprisingly narrative savvy.

732
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,333
So if it's, this would go back to our idea

733
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:17,915
of partnering with other studios.

734
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:22,079
If it's a studio where the tool is important to learn,

735
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,902
that's something that mentees should be exposed to as well.

736
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:26,284
Yeah, thank you.

737
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:28,447
Thanks.

738
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:32,731
When we talk about inclusion, especially in game narrative,

739
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,875
we always talk about culture and age and gender.

740
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:38,456
But what about language?

741
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:43,200
Is that still a big barrier, not to be a native English speaker?

742
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:46,123
I don't know if it's.

743
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,348
I would say that anything that is outside of normal

744
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:53,510
is always something of a barrier, right?

745
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,305
I would also say that the inclusion of localization,

746
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,726
and if you have a global audience,

747
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:06,890
how we're localizing an English script for Guild Wars 2,

748
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,792
we're constantly talking to our German translation team

749
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:12,614
and our folks who are doing Chinese

750
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:13,675
and our folks who are doing Spanish

751
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:16,317
and trying to see if this, does this concept translate?

752
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:18,358
So I would say that there is something.

753
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:24,326
extraordinarily beneficial about having someone on a narrative team who is not a native English

754
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:27,990
speaker. English is their second or third or fourth language. The way that you think,

755
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,095
the way that you come at story is really impacted by your first language as well.

756
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:38,180
So I would highlight it as a pro, not a con.

757
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:39,522
Great.

758
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:40,483
Yeah, we have a

759
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:45,018
I think we localize in five languages.

760
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,804
And actually, I think folks who come up through localization

761
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:51,086
and move over to narrative, I think

762
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:53,449
that's probably a pretty good training ground.

763
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:55,732
Because the way that we work with our localization team,

764
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:56,673
they're in-house.

765
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:00,137
And what we started doing is including them in table reads.

766
00:39:00,177 --> 00:39:03,721
We started writing up episode summaries

767
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,804
and giving it to them, character bios, things like that.

768
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:09,287
Because what we found was it would cut down

769
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:12,150
on the questions that they would ask us later in development

770
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,732
or when they would go to the studio

771
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:15,074
and record in other languages.

772
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:19,018
were involved in the story development earlier,

773
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:21,541
it just meant that they were more connected to it.

774
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:26,205
And I think if, yeah, if your goal is ultimately

775
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:29,529
to tell stories, even if English isn't your first language,

776
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:32,692
but you're a competent writer, I think that could work

777
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:34,234
to your advantage depending on the scenario.

778
00:39:34,514 --> 00:39:34,875
Absolutely.

779
00:39:36,695 --> 00:39:41,098
Novera, you had to come in to handle an established IP.

780
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,539
How did you prepare for this?

781
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,763
Or if it was covered during the mentorship, what did you learn?

782
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:52,467
So because I was coming in so many weeks late, I doubled down on the research.

783
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:58,932
The beauty of Guild Wars 2 is that the fans put together a wiki that is ridiculous.

784
00:39:59,472 --> 00:40:01,574
So I spent like, I don't know, like...

785
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,392
36 consecutive hours, something like that.

786
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:06,733
I was like, OK, I'm going to be up.

787
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:09,294
I'm just going to read about all the things, and sort of got

788
00:40:09,314 --> 00:40:12,377
a feeling for the game, and also for the characters

789
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:14,138
and the types of stories that I could tell.

790
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:19,121
But because it was going to be a spec script that was never

791
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:21,483
actually going to be in the game, there was a bit of leeway.

792
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:24,005
What we were really trying to do is get to the point

793
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:27,748
where it was a cohesive, strong game story.

794
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:30,289
So I could use research to give myself

795
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:32,211
enough of the landscape of the world.

796
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,912
and then populate it with a bunch of original characters.

797
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:35,433
Cool.

798
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:36,814
Thank you.

799
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:39,116
I have three questions.

800
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,120
Firstly, did you do this with the support of your company?

801
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:46,503
And how was that for you, either way?

802
00:40:47,424 --> 00:40:50,928
Are you the only mentorship program at the company?

803
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,170
Or are there disciplines involved in this?

804
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,071
And then, have you given any thought

805
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:58,495
to how a remote-based mentorship program would work?

806
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:00,037
Sure, those are all great questions.

807
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:02,600
So I may ask for a reminder.

808
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,763
I got like a goldfish memory, so apologies.

809
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:08,525
Let's see, so the first question was?

810
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:09,526
Did we have support?

811
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:10,387
Did we have support?

812
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:14,811
Yes, I had kind of the blessing in as much

813
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:16,112
as I just went and did it.

814
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:22,149
My boss was supportive of it, and a lot of people said,

815
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:22,890
oh, that sounds neat.

816
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,131
And then that was about it.

817
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:27,976
So I kind of just kept pushing on it.

818
00:41:28,596 --> 00:41:31,399
And thankfully, I think we were, at that time,

819
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,383
fully staffed to where I could actually dedicate a few hours

820
00:41:34,443 --> 00:41:36,545
every week to developing the program.

821
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,268
I mean, I don't come from a teaching background.

822
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:43,872
So even though this is not a school,

823
00:41:43,992 --> 00:41:45,594
it's not meant to emulate a classroom,

824
00:41:45,674 --> 00:41:49,257
I definitely wanted to look at educational course planning

825
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:50,759
as kind of a starting point.

826
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:51,659
So yeah.

827
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:57,242
As long as this didn't get in the way of my regular work,

828
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:58,743
nobody bothered me about it.

829
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,964
And I think once people started seeing the value of it,

830
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:04,246
they started getting more supportive in that sometimes

831
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:06,508
people would actually start volunteering to help.

832
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:08,128
They would come to some sessions.

833
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:10,750
And like Novir was saying before,

834
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,592
when it came time to partnering with game designers

835
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:17,934
to kind of simulate the pitch process or the narrative design

836
00:42:18,214 --> 00:42:19,755
process or the story breaking process,

837
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:21,436
we actually had other professionals

838
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:23,157
in adjacent disciplines who were helping us with it.

839
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:30,624
Currently, I don't believe there is another mentorship program in our building.

840
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:36,069
I have been approached by people in a couple of different departments, like in design and

841
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:36,669
in programming.

842
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:42,575
So there is definitely interest, but it is up to the leads or directors in those departments

843
00:42:42,615 --> 00:42:43,295
to develop them.

844
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:48,280
But I wouldn't be surprised if more of the departments started doing it, because I think

845
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:48,380
they...

846
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:54,122
they've seen enough benefit to feel like it's a worthwhile endeavor.

847
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:56,563
And lastly, I guess the question was-

848
00:42:56,823 --> 00:42:57,623
A remote base.

849
00:42:57,643 --> 00:43:00,704
Remote, yeah, that's actually something we've thought about a bit.

850
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:05,545
We didn't do it for the first class only because we felt that it was hard enough

851
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:09,246
just to get a program going that trying to also juggle remote

852
00:43:09,726 --> 00:43:12,667
was going to be an additional layer of challenge to it.

853
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,688
Totally open to it, and I think we probably would have to do.

854
00:43:18,423 --> 00:43:21,104
you know, if not a fully remote program,

855
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:24,786
but at least accommodate for people who are not on site.

856
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:26,726
So we're looking into it.

857
00:43:26,766 --> 00:43:28,607
We just haven't really done much with that yet.

858
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:32,108
And I do think that if we can grow programs like this

859
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:33,729
and partner with other companies.

860
00:43:34,149 --> 00:43:35,911
that there's gonna come a time where,

861
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,852
when we're partnering with other companies,

862
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,934
if one of the companies is in Seattle

863
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:41,816
and some of the mentees are in Seattle

864
00:43:41,896 --> 00:43:45,379
and then they have remote in LA or vice versa

865
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:46,059
or something like that,

866
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,903
I think it's a natural and very organic progression

867
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:54,186
for a program like this to become remote.

868
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:55,127
Yeah, thank you.

869
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:55,528
But not yet.

870
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:57,089
Soon.

871
00:43:57,289 --> 00:43:57,569
Soon.

872
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,910
That's a threat.

873
00:43:59,571 --> 00:43:59,831
Hi.

874
00:44:00,132 --> 00:44:00,212
Hi.

875
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:06,334
I just have a quick question when it comes to portfolio pieces and examples.

876
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:13,916
I have applied to a lot of different places and some ask for prose examples, some ask

877
00:44:13,996 --> 00:44:19,858
for screenwriting examples, although just in your opinion, which is kind of the better

878
00:44:20,078 --> 00:44:22,599
sample to have, is screenwriting or prose?

879
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:27,812
So the answer to that question will depend on what company

880
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,253
you're applying to and what game they're making.

881
00:44:29,614 --> 00:44:32,236
The reason that I clarify it that way is we always like to

882
00:44:32,276 --> 00:44:33,016
see teleplays.

883
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:36,399
I personally like to see a teleplay because they're a

884
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:37,100
fixed length.

885
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,842
Usually I like to see something that's like, hey,

886
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:41,904
this is a spec episode for a 30 minute show.

887
00:44:42,324 --> 00:44:44,846
It's going to be 23 to 30 pages, right?

888
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:46,888
So I can probably get through that in a half hour, 45

889
00:44:47,408 --> 00:44:49,590
minutes, and I can see.

890
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:54,252
somebody's thought process in terms of setting up and paying off a story.

891
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,152
They'll break it into three acts.

892
00:44:56,252 --> 00:45:01,353
You know, it's very structured and I can get a good sense of what a person's chops are, right?

893
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,954
Sure, we'll read longer samples.

894
00:45:05,014 --> 00:45:08,895
I'll read screenplays and sometimes people will send, you know, excerpts from their books.

895
00:45:09,355 --> 00:45:12,496
But there's no way I'm going to read like a 300-page novel.

896
00:45:12,816 --> 00:45:17,557
And even if I only just read a section of it, unless that section actually was an entire act,

897
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:19,918
I'm not going to get what I need to see out of it.

898
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,402
Some companies may really be looking for that though, right?

899
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:25,205
So that's why I don't tell anybody,

900
00:45:25,485 --> 00:45:26,847
oh, don't do this or don't do that,

901
00:45:26,887 --> 00:45:29,151
or make sure you have an Excel spreadsheet

902
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:30,232
with barks in it or something.

903
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:31,915
Like, it's gonna be very different.

904
00:45:31,975 --> 00:45:33,577
So I think what's important,

905
00:45:33,718 --> 00:45:35,340
and this actually falls on the employers

906
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,221
who are looking for people.

907
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:38,786
they should clarify what they're looking for.

908
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:43,313
One thing that I realized after the last time we had a job

909
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,938
posting was we were kind of opaque about what we were

910
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:46,399
looking for.

911
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:49,304
And it wasn't until we would request samples that we might

912
00:45:49,785 --> 00:45:50,806
be a little more specific.

913
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:55,054
we should just put it on the job description

914
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:58,956
and be like, we would like to see this of this length.

915
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:00,177
And it doesn't have to be something,

916
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,758
like for us, we don't need to see something

917
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:02,698
in the Guild Wars universe.

918
00:46:02,738 --> 00:46:04,259
In fact, I'd prefer to not see that

919
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:05,780
because I just wanna get a sense

920
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,721
of your storytelling techniques.

921
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:10,862
And a lot of people, when they are applying

922
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:13,964
for a job at a studio that does a fantasy game,

923
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:15,864
they get all fake spear on you

924
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:18,006
and they're sending this thing in

925
00:46:18,046 --> 00:46:19,746
that is just kind of really hard to read

926
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:21,167
and not at all what we're looking for.

927
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:26,088
So find out what the studio is looking for,

928
00:46:26,228 --> 00:46:27,889
either try and write something toward

929
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:30,069
a game that you already know they've developed,

930
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:31,549
or just ask and say,

931
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:33,630
hey listen, I can write something up for you,

932
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,570
or I have samples in a variety of genres.

933
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:36,971
What would you like to see?

934
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,711
Then tailor it for them because you're probably not going to

935
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:42,772
send the same batch of content to every company,

936
00:46:42,872 --> 00:46:45,493
and it's better to give them what they want than to guess.

937
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,573
Yeah, I'm going to speak a little bit to that because

938
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,373
my portfolio was kind of like.

939
00:46:51,198 --> 00:46:52,899
I don't know, I don't want to say a hot mess,

940
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:54,099
but there was a lot of stuff in there.

941
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:57,780
And every informational interview I was having,

942
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,380
they were saying something different

943
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,321
about what they would like to see.

944
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,041
I heard Twine, do a Twine.

945
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:03,801
I heard, you know, tell a play,

946
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:06,162
say that you finished your novel.

947
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:07,942
You know, all of these kinds of things.

948
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:13,764
So my advice would be, instead of posting your portfolio

949
00:47:13,804 --> 00:47:15,824
with all of your different kinds of samples,

950
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:19,568
have a bucket of a few different things that you've done

951
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:22,410
that you're proud of so that, to Bobby's point,

952
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:26,435
when you find out what that particular job posting wants,

953
00:47:26,815 --> 00:47:29,838
you can pull out the best samples and show it to them

954
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:32,360
because every single group is a little bit different.

955
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:34,002
Thank you.

956
00:47:34,202 --> 00:47:34,563
Thank you.

957
00:47:34,963 --> 00:47:35,724
Thank you, guys.

958
00:47:35,844 --> 00:47:36,385
Yeah, thank you.

959
00:47:41,688 --> 00:47:43,329
I've got to make up for the people who aren't here.

960
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:43,829
Come on.

961
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:44,370
Right, right.

962
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,330
Get rowdy.

963
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,411
This is the party room.

964
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:51,615
I'm going to be participating in a mentorship thing this week.

965
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:53,916
I don't know who actually sponsors it.

966
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,758
I don't know if it's IGDA or something.

967
00:47:55,818 --> 00:47:59,300
But I was asked to participate in some Q&A sessions.

968
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,523
So if you look, I believe there are some sign-ups still left.

969
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,865
I think there's like Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday in the afternoon,

970
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:09,127
like four to five or two to three or something like that.

971
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:12,469
So if you're interested in attending and asking more questions, that's fine,

972
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:17,032
or you can just hit me up on Twitter or LinkedIn or whatnot.

973
00:48:17,432 --> 00:48:18,573
Anyway, thank you so much for coming.

974
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:19,533
Thanks for staying guys.
