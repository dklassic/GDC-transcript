00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,412
Hi, I'm Lauralyn, and this is the Side Project Ritual.

2
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,954
So I'm not gonna do a lot of bio

3
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:15,996
because I have a lot to go over during the talk,

4
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:20,139
but I'll just say briefly that I've worked in games

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,680
for about 26 years now,

6
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,703
across a whole bunch of different platforms,

7
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:28,366
game styles, audiences for a lot of different companies.

8
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:30,888
And over the years,

9
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:33,786
I've almost always had a side project going.

10
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:36,348
In fact, most of my friends kind of consider

11
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:39,810
my side projects to be my ever-present companion

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,692
as I go through game development.

13
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:45,134
And that's largely what I'm gonna be talking about today,

14
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:46,615
what I've learned about that process

15
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:48,917
and how it's helped me stay in the industry

16
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:50,178
for as many years as I have.

17
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:53,180
I've also spoken quite a bit at conferences

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,521
and initially it was about design topics,

19
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:59,024
but recently I found myself at a niche

20
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:00,065
between

21
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,673
wellness and game development.

22
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:06,035
And so this talk today is also squarely

23
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:07,476
in between those two subjects.

24
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:10,759
So a little bit of an overview

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,120
about what I'm gonna be talking about

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,441
just to help us stay oriented.

27
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:15,363
I'm gonna spend a little bit of time

28
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:16,844
talking about burnout and its toll.

29
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:18,545
Not a lot of time, but a little bit

30
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:20,547
just to make sure we're operating

31
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,589
from the same assumptions about burnout.

32
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,611
Then I'm gonna be talking about the power of ritual

33
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:28,694
and other mental tools that you can use to succeed.

34
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:32,765
and then I'll actually be giving you the eight steps

35
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,406
in the side project ritual.

36
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,647
So let's get started by talking about burnout.

37
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:41,128
So everyone's familiar with the topic of burnout

38
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,909
if you've worked in game development at any time,

39
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,730
for any time length at all, you've probably encountered it,

40
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,191
if not in yourself, then in others.

41
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,552
The World Health Organization actually considers it

42
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:54,573
a disorder or syndrome, and they describe it as being

43
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:59,115
a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress.

44
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:01,744
that has not been successfully managed.

45
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:04,886
I'm not a big fan of that passive language.

46
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:06,728
I would almost call it passive aggressive language there,

47
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:10,771
because it implies that the person on the receiving

48
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,252
end of burnout has to be the one to manage it.

49
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,733
I don't necessarily think that's the case.

50
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:17,728
But I do agree with the dimensions.

51
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:18,828
I'm going to mention a couple more,

52
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:20,470
but the dimensions that they say here

53
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,991
that it's really characterized by a feeling of

54
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:27,434
exhaustion and feeling negative or cynical about your job,

55
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:30,356
and then reduced efficiency and effectiveness at your job.

56
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:33,719
We actually live in a time and work in

57
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:36,761
an industry with inevitable stress.

58
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,583
I don't know what possibly could be happening right now in

59
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:41,964
the world that would cause any of us to have any stress.

60
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:46,747
But on top of that, our industry is its own source of stress.

61
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:49,748
It's a creative work environment.

62
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:53,069
And what that means is that people are always

63
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,909
critiquing your work, and you're always

64
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,250
putting yourself and your skills and your talent

65
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,731
and what you believe out there for other people to critique.

66
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:02,971
And that inherently creates stress.

67
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:07,173
Where it's also an industry of constant change.

68
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,993
So whether it's moving on to a new game,

69
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,234
whether it's new people on the team, people leaving the team,

70
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:15,448
We're always, even when we make sequels,

71
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:18,831
we're always having to create new features

72
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,673
and new elements that have never been seen before in games.

73
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:25,355
It's just the constant flood of change can be overwhelming.

74
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,758
There's also a lot of loss and grief

75
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,279
we don't really discuss.

76
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,442
Even shipping a game that you're proud of

77
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,464
has a certain amount of loss and grief associated with it

78
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:39,625
because you spent a lot of time with that game.

79
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:46,000
and having it suddenly out of your life can be something that's hard to deal with. But even more

80
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:52,144
so, having games canceled and companies close and people leave the team or the industry altogether,

81
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:59,790
it's definitely cycles of loss and grief mixed in between the joy and creation.

82
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:06,555
And then most important, I think, in terms of adding stress, we have a silence

83
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:09,718
endurance culture. And what I mean by that is,

84
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:18,658
you're expected to endure. You're expected to find ways to cope by yourself. And you're expected

85
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:22,519
not to complain about it and not to try to make changes. And in fact, trying to make changes is

86
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:28,220
often seen as complaining. It's seen as a lack of passion. It's seen as you just not being strong

87
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,442
enough for this industry. And that is unfortunate because what that means is we don't fix the

88
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,503
problems that are causing people to feel so much stress. So

89
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:43,750
The stress that creates burnout and burnout itself often go unrecognized.

90
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,751
So here's some of the ways that you can recognize it in yourself and in others.

91
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,313
There's what everybody looks for, which is that intense anger.

92
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,993
I can't take this anymore.

93
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:56,975
But there are also other signs like the thousand mile pain stare

94
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:00,316
that you see from someone who's been crunching for six months now.

95
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:04,918
There's a frustration and an inability to focus,

96
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,719
and the two really are a self-feeding cycle.

97
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,050
between those two factors.

98
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,852
And there are feelings of worthless and incompetence.

99
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,554
And I want to make sure to separate this out

100
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:17,714
from imposter syndrome.

101
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,336
Imposter syndrome is when you feel

102
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:23,497
like you're not good at something you're actually

103
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:28,020
good at, a specific task or activity or thing

104
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,060
that you're actually good at.

105
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,582
This is feeling worthless and incompetent at everything.

106
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:36,744
You feel like you just are not worth anything as a person,

107
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,205
not just about the task.

108
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:44,250
It causes us to disconnect from friends and family and things that we enjoy.

109
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:49,714
And it also causes physical illness, heart illness, heart disease.

110
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:55,798
And stress itself can just cause a variety of effects,

111
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,160
including autoimmune disorders on your body.

112
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,163
And that's not to mention, of course, heartburn and ulcer.

113
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:06,419
So there are a ton of ways to recognize

114
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,420
when burnout is happening,

115
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,682
but usually we discover it way too late.

116
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:13,206
We figure it out at the point where you

117
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,989
or the person involved just wants to leave the team

118
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:16,910
or leave the company,

119
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,252
or maybe even leave the whole industry.

120
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,295
And this comes at a really high cost.

121
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:25,999
In a Deloitte survey, 91%...

122
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:34,467
of the people they surveyed. This is just about people in general, not about game development.

123
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:40,132
91% said that they have an unmanageable amount of stress. When they do, it negatively impacts

124
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:45,876
the quality of their work. 83% said burnout from work negatively impacts their personal

125
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,558
relationships. And here's the important point.

126
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,722
87% say they're passionate about their current job,

127
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:55,984
but 64% say they're still frequently stressed.

128
00:06:56,525 --> 00:07:01,508
Passion does not exclude or make impossible getting burned out

129
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,389
and getting stressed.

130
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,851
So that is a fiction in game development

131
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,012
that if you're passionate about it, you'll never burn out.

132
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,174
And in fact, in game development,

133
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:11,675
there's also a very high cost.

134
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,737
So game development as a career, as a way to make a living,

135
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:16,178
has been around for at least 30 years.

136
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:17,639
I know because when I started.

137
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,386
people had already been in it for five or ten years.

138
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:24,747
And yet, when you look at the stats, there's this huge cliff

139
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:29,789
where 82% of game developers have been in the industry less than 15 years. It's

140
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,171
the 15-year cliff, which means, of course, the flip side,

141
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:37,373
only 16% of game developers have been in the industry for 15 or more years.

142
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:41,634
So that includes me. I'm in that category,

143
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:45,396
and I've actually watched a lot of the people that I knew and were friends with

144
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:46,716
who had as many years as I have.

145
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,115
get frustrated and burned out and leave.

146
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:54,279
So what can we do to start to take control over this

147
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:55,480
and to really battle burnout?

148
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,201
There's some standard things that are always suggested

149
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:59,122
when this topic comes up.

150
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,344
Mindfulness, which you'll see as a part of my presentation

151
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:02,704
as well.

152
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:04,726
They always recommend, of course,

153
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:07,528
that you take your breaks and schedule your vacations

154
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,629
and use up your PTO every year.

155
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,951
Although in most jobs, it's really difficult

156
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,553
to do that in many game jobs because you're always

157
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:16,934
a critical person.

158
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:21,205
and often told that you can't take your vacation this year,

159
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:22,566
you need to save it for next year.

160
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,129
Take advantage of mental health resources.

161
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:27,930
TakeThis is a great organization.

162
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,212
I encourage you to check it out

163
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:32,673
and avail yourself of their resources.

164
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:36,556
Cultural change, lots of movements

165
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,038
about changing our culture to be less abrasive

166
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:43,601
and to be less demanding in terms of crunch.

167
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,492
and in terms of expected ordinary overtime.

168
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:51,395
So those are all good ways to see the signs

169
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:53,276
and interrupt the process and try

170
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:57,018
to improve overall our industry so that there's less burnout.

171
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,920
But what would really be better is

172
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,722
to avoid that in the first place and to focus

173
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:04,063
on the kind of growth and resilience

174
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:07,385
that helps us not get burned out.

175
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:09,847
And I'm not saying that companies don't need to improve

176
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,308
because they definitely do.

177
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:14,646
But you as a person also can become more resilient.

178
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,748
The process, though, of becoming more resilient

179
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,811
requires an intent to do that.

180
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,372
It requires a sense of purpose.

181
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:25,294
And it also requires some plans and consistency.

182
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,716
It's not something that happens by accident.

183
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,779
But when you can manage to do that, you can really heal.

184
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,082
So this is a plan, the side project ritual,

185
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:36,944
is eight science back steps.

186
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,546
And I'll use the power of ritual for mental and emotional reset.

187
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:48,327
So when I say that I'm going to recommend you recover from the burnout of game development

188
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:53,433
with more game development, I anticipate the reaction is probably going to be,

189
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:59,360
really? You know, and I understand why this guy and you might be skeptical.

190
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,803
So let's just get into it and I'll talk about.

191
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:06,058
why I think this is valuable and why you shouldn't be skeptical about it.

192
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:10,180
The side project ritual is a purpose-driven plan to battle burnout,

193
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,940
and it does use the power of ritual.

194
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,882
And when I say the power of ritual, a lot of people get this image in their head.

195
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,964
And I understand that it has certain connotations,

196
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:24,525
but I do want to make the point upfront that that's not the case here.

197
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,187
If you're into crystals and incense, cool, good for you, you can totally use that.

198
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,588
But ritual does not have to be about.

199
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:36,333
those sorts of things. It doesn't have to be tied to any religion or even any spirituality.

200
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:43,056
In fact, this is going to be very pragmatic and very practical, and it includes a lot of

201
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:49,498
scientific data and studies and tips. So don't go into this expecting that it's going to be

202
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:54,720
kind of a new religion or anything like that. It's really a set of mental tools and tricks.

203
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,822
We're going to use cognitive science and reboot and build resilience in your brain.

204
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:00,703
So,

205
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,831
What do I mean when I say ritual?

206
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,514
This is my definition of ritual for the purpose of this talk.

207
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:09,556
A ritual involves words, signs, and actions

208
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:11,157
that take you away from the mundane,

209
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:14,058
crafting an intentional space for creative work

210
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:15,199
and free thought.

211
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,962
Some of the mental techniques involved around ritual

212
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:22,044
can vary depending on what the ritual is.

213
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:26,166
But there's a reason that it's so successful in human culture

214
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,027
across the world.

215
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,389
Almost every human society has elements of ritual.

216
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:32,933
embedded in various aspects of their life.

217
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,333
And they all have certain things in common.

218
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:37,874
One of them is visualization,

219
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,734
where you're picturing an outcome

220
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,255
of the work that you're doing.

221
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,035
Studies have shown that thoughts produce

222
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:48,416
the same mental instructions and effects as actions do.

223
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:53,257
And in fact, visualization, visualizing success,

224
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,317
visualizing things being better,

225
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:57,018
visualizing completing something.

226
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,842
is actually, can actually enhance motivation,

227
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:03,804
increase confidence and increase your efficiency.

228
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:05,265
It improves your motor performance.

229
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,286
It can increase the flow state.

230
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:10,207
Visualization is actually a profound way

231
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:12,148
to improve your success.

232
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,110
And some studies, for example,

233
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,211
showed that basketball players, this is the classic study,

234
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,333
basketball players were split into two groups.

235
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,614
One group practiced free throws

236
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:26,377
and the other group visualized making free throws

237
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,377
and didn't practice at all.

238
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:30,337
And when they actually played the next day,

239
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:33,840
those who visualized saw a slightly greater

240
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,122
performance increase over those that practiced.

241
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,703
It's that effective.

242
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:42,127
Superstition is another element of ritual.

243
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,472
And most people have a negative connotation to superstition,

244
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:50,375
but I'd like to invite you to change your mind about that.

245
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:55,647
An example of superstition is there was an experiment,

246
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:57,969
actually two experiments around golf.

247
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,633
In one experiment, people before they made a shot in golf

248
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:05,435
were told that they had a lucky ball

249
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:06,917
or that they had an ordinary ball.

250
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:10,800
In the other experiment, before someone took their shot,

251
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,261
either the moderator said nothing

252
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:14,743
or said, I'm crossing my fingers for you.

253
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:19,848
In both cases involving luck, performance increased.

254
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,472
And in fact, we as human beings and all animals, really,

255
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,513
are wired for superstition.

256
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:31,495
The probably most famous behavioral researcher,

257
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:35,117
B.F. Skinner, started researching pigeons.

258
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:40,620
And he set up something to feed the birds at regular intervals.

259
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,882
And what happened was the birds didn't

260
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:46,123
develop a sense of time and all cluster

261
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:47,864
around the feeding mechanism at a certain time.

262
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,004
they started acting in a particular way

263
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,965
and started believing that the way they were acting

264
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,486
influenced the arrival of food.

265
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:58,508
So by the end of the study, 3 quarters of the pigeons

266
00:13:58,608 --> 00:13:59,749
became superstitious.

267
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,011
And for example, one pigeon believed

268
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,353
that turning around in a circle two or three times

269
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:07,273
was what brought the food.

270
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:09,875
And most interestingly, it wasn't

271
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,036
turning in any direction.

272
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:13,677
It was always counterclockwise, that he

273
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:16,199
would turn counterclockwise two or three times,

274
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:17,039
and then the food would come.

275
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:23,730
So if birds can become superstitious without any prompting from us, any really teaching that

276
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,875
behavior, that tells you how effective it is and how well it works. And in fact, many successful

277
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:35,260
creators have used lucky rituals. For example, Mary Shelley had a boa constrictor around her

278
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,384
neck while she wrote, and she would interpret how the boa constrictor was acting and moving

279
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,406
to determine whether she was done writing for the day.

280
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:46,230
Charles Dickens actually had a compass with him

281
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,311
that he carried all the time.

282
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:51,274
And he always slept with him and facing north.

283
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:55,657
So there's tremendous use of superstition as a tool,

284
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:57,078
as a mental tool.

285
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,100
And we want to use it to leverage

286
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,982
those internal mechanisms to build self-confidence

287
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,142
and self-esteem.

288
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:09,387
And then finally, creative therapy actually works too.

289
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,301
Creative exercises have been shown to reduce pain, anxiety,

290
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:16,443
and depression and stress while increasing self-esteem

291
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,624
and improving the quality of life.

292
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:22,686
Creativity itself has that effect.

293
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:25,187
It doesn't matter how good you are at it

294
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,788
or what you produce at the end of it.

295
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,030
It's the act of creativity that has the therapeutic effects.

296
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:35,219
And so I say all of these things knowing that inherently,

297
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,902
most people in game development are skeptics of science

298
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:40,163
when it comes to things like this.

299
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:43,265
We're absolutely believers in science and everything else,

300
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:46,086
but we tend to dismiss things like superstition

301
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:48,448
and visualization and even ritual itself

302
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,690
because it's sometimes easier to dismiss those

303
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,331
than to see them as tools.

304
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,833
And so I understand that sense.

305
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:57,974
I understand that sentiment.

306
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,482
but somehow ritual and visualization and superstition

307
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,223
and creativity and game dev just don't belong

308
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:08,125
in the same process together.

309
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:09,465
But I can tell you they do.

310
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,946
And I can tell you that game development

311
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:14,248
is the answer for burnout in game development.

312
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,329
And that's not just because it's the hair

313
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:17,249
of the dog that bit you.

314
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:22,471
So here's some reasons that you can use a solo game project

315
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,132
to battle your burnout.

316
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:28,548
First is that one thing that causes a lot of workplace stress

317
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,429
and game development is that you are constantly in,

318
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,291
for most people, under deadline, under stress,

319
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:36,872
trying to get things done,

320
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:39,173
trying to make sure those things coordinate

321
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:40,634
with what the rest of the team is doing.

322
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,116
And you have somebody who's telling you what to create.

323
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:46,697
And that's true for almost everybody.

324
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:49,018
Even if you're an executive at a game company,

325
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,119
I can say from experience,

326
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:52,480
I still had a boss who was telling me what to do.

327
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:56,460
So in my side projects though, no one could tell me what to do.

328
00:16:57,181 --> 00:17:02,385
And that was when I especially was under stress during a project at any given time.

329
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:07,168
Or if I felt like I didn't agree with the decisions that were being made,

330
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,171
it was tremendously helpful for me to come home and work on something where no one could tell me

331
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:16,795
what to do. It also means you can focus on variety, make something new and exciting,

332
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,017
learn new skills, do things you haven't done before.

333
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,292
it gives you tremendous freedom to express yourself.

334
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:27,314
Most of us don't get to actually express everything

335
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:29,535
in who we are as a part of the games that we're making,

336
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:31,896
usually because we're making those in collaboration

337
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,556
with other people.

338
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,118
But it also lets you express yourself in other ways.

339
00:17:37,178 --> 00:17:39,799
It doesn't mean every game you make has to be a message

340
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,939
game with a capital M.

341
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:47,079
It can let you express yourself in terms of making that game you voice that sounded fun,

342
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:51,741
but maybe three other people besides you would want to play. That's expressing yourself too.

343
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:57,384
But the bottom line and the thing that I found ultimately most helpful about having a game dev

344
00:17:57,424 --> 00:18:02,046
side project is I can make whatever the hell I want and nobody could tell me any differently.

345
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:08,090
And that freedom of just being my own boss really made a difference to me.

346
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:14,682
So here's how all of these puzzle pieces fit together into the side project ritual.

347
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:18,825
It is eight steps and we're going to start with step one which is the opening.

348
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:27,573
So the opening of any ritual has a purpose. Every step has a purpose,

349
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:32,758
but the opening is particularly important. It triggers our superstitions.

350
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:35,860
And it tells your brain that you're switching modes,

351
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,461
that this thing that's about to come up,

352
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,283
you understand what it is, and you know what you're

353
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:43,365
going to be doing, and that it's important.

354
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,228
So before you start envisioning wind chimes and whale song,

355
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:49,790
it's about what's important to you.

356
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:53,873
So you want to collect inspirational items, images,

357
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:56,215
music, practices, because again, you're

358
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:57,456
triggering your brain that you're

359
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:58,517
getting ready to do the work.

360
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,800
You definitely want to give some thought to superstition.

361
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,882
And look, if you don't have things that you will consider lucky now,

362
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:09,546
start to try to build those superstitions. Think about, you know, if I have

363
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:15,670
green tea while I'm working, it's going to help me work faster or it's

364
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,412
going to help me work better. Try to build those links for yourself.

365
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:23,055
And again, so you don't think it has to be a whale song.

366
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:24,916
Let's look at an example.

367
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:29,159
Dad! Dad!

368
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:33,314
It's important!

369
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,035
Then wait, count to twenty.

370
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:36,256
No, Dad! Do you listen?

371
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:36,777
Junior!

372
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:39,378
One, two, three, four...

373
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:40,259
In Greek.

374
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,140
Ena...

375
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,980
...dio...

376
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:43,261
...dia.

377
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:44,922
Tessera...

378
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:45,202
...dente...

379
00:20:04,457 --> 00:20:05,238
So did you catch it?

380
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:09,220
Henry Jones Jr. has a focusing phrase

381
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,562
that he would use in his opening when he gets distracted.

382
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:16,865
May he who illuminated this illuminate me.

383
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:20,748
And that's a good example of the kind of thing

384
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:23,910
that you would use as a focus during your opening.

385
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:26,191
A couple other examples.

386
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:30,297
I'll refer to Steven Pressfield in his book, The War of Art,

387
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:33,259
a little bit later again in this presentation.

388
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,520
It's an awesome book, though.

389
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,763
And he opens it or has in it what he does every day

390
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:39,683
as a part of his work.

391
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,585
He says, I put on my lucky work boots

392
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:45,907
and stitch them up with the lucky laces

393
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:47,188
that my niece Meredith gave me.

394
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,030
I head back to my office, crank up the computer.

395
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,852
My lucky hooded sweatshirt is draped over the chair with the lucky charm I got in St. Marie de la Mer

396
00:20:56,352 --> 00:21:03,254
for only eight bucks. With my lucky Largo name tag that came from a dream I once had, I put it on.

397
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:10,596
On my thesaurus is my lucky cannon that my friend Bob Forsandy gave me. I point it toward my chair

398
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:15,757
so it can fire inspiration into me. I say my prayer which is the invocation of the muse from

399
00:21:15,797 --> 00:21:19,318
Homer's Odyssey. And it sits next to my shelf.

400
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:25,536
with the cufflinks that belong to my father and my lucky acorn from the battlefield at Thermopylae.

401
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:32,679
It's about 10 30 now. I sit down and plunge in. And similarly from Stephen King.

402
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,902
I have a glass of water or a cup of tea. There's a certain time I sit down from 8 to 8 30 somewhere

403
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:47,425
within a half hour every morning. I have my vitamin pill and my music. I sit in the same seat

404
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,461
and the papers are all arranged in the same places.

405
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,463
The cumulative purpose of doing these things

406
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:57,844
the same way every day seems to be a way of saying to the mind,

407
00:21:57,864 --> 00:21:59,685
you're going to be dreaming soon.

408
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:02,446
And that's really what the opening does.

409
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,647
It sets a space in your mind.

410
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:06,768
It creates that space.

411
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,768
It frames your work, and it gives it purpose.

412
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:11,959
But you need to figure out what matters to you.

413
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,039
You need to choose something that reflects you

414
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,039
as a unique person.

415
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,260
It can be things that inspired you in the past

416
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,500
or something that's inspiring you to create a new future.

417
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:21,861
So some examples.

418
00:22:23,361 --> 00:22:29,022
If I were going to create, if my side project was an action

419
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:34,063
game or a stealth game or had a certain tone to it,

420
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,884
I might choose for my opening focus this quote from Thief.

421
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,039
wisdom and balance lay in knowing your own nature over time.

422
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,242
If during the process, if I wanted to be instead inspired

423
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,244
while working on my side project from the fact that

424
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,806
I've survived an immense amount of time

425
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:50,927
with incurable lung cancer,

426
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,670
I might quote, I feel fantastic and I'm still alive

427
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,952
from the ending theme song to Portal

428
00:22:57,552 --> 00:22:59,834
and have a screenshot from Portal 2 along with it.

429
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:04,798
But my focus right now is actually built upon the fact that

430
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:08,553
I'm making an interactive narrative game.

431
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:11,634
It's a paranormal romance for Choice of Games

432
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:13,094
and their new Hearts Choice label.

433
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:16,655
So because it's writing, this is my opening focus.

434
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:20,256
I've been to another world and come back, listen to me.

435
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,617
That's from Mark Halprin's Winter's Tale,

436
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:24,437
which is a book that always inspired me

437
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:27,258
to write better than I do.

438
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:30,119
And I chose that focus intentionally

439
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,979
because I feel like as,

440
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:35,970
the writer and creator of this game,

441
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,554
I am seeing and experiencing this different world.

442
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:44,937
And now I have to come back and relay it

443
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:48,039
to people playing the game in a way that makes them

444
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,141
feel like they're experiencing it too.

445
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,842
So that's my opening focus.

446
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:54,244
But whatever you come up with,

447
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,787
it should be and will be as unique as you are.

448
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:00,429
So step two.

449
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:03,695
and the side ritual is the sacred space and time.

450
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:05,895
Now, when I say sacred, I don't mean religious.

451
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:10,217
I mean, for example, sacrosanct or regarded with great respect

452
00:24:10,337 --> 00:24:10,918
and reverence.

453
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:14,319
So when you set up your space, you

454
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:16,140
want to have a dedicated space.

455
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,101
You're in the same spot every day if you can be.

456
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:20,002
And it can be really small.

457
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,162
It can be the corner of a kitchen.

458
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:24,924
You just want to have room to display some objects that

459
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:25,944
are inspirational to you.

460
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,725
And they don't have to be, again, religious or mystical.

461
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:30,046
They can be whatever.

462
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:31,883
It has meaning to you.

463
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:34,866
You do need to be left alone, though.

464
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,268
So noise-canceling headphones can

465
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,589
help when you're in a shared space,

466
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:41,932
but also just letting the people that you share your home with

467
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:48,238
know that when at a certain time of day or night,

468
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,981
you need to be left alone for a certain period of time,

469
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:54,604
like an hour or two hours, because that's

470
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:55,365
your focus time.

471
00:24:56,884 --> 00:24:59,346
You also want to gather your tools together into this space.

472
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:01,588
Most people, of course, think of hardware and software

473
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:02,869
because we're talking about game development,

474
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,732
but it can also be things like timers.

475
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:09,695
If you are a big fan of things like the Pomodoro technique,

476
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:13,679
it can be timers to plan different work sessions.

477
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:15,901
It can include music themed

478
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,342
for whatever it is that you're working on,

479
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:20,164
but it can also include things like scent or light.

480
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:20,885
So it could be,

481
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:27,747
a candle that smells like evergreens if you're working on something that takes place in a forest,

482
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:33,453
or light that imitates sunlight to help you feel better during that time, or dim lighting that

483
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:37,637
makes you feel like it's an escape from the rest of your day, whatever works for you.

484
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,663
And the time is sacred too, so you want to decide how much time you're going to spend

485
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,385
and then you're going to commit to that time.

486
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,237
Committing means you're going to block out distractions.

487
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:52,238
You're not going to spend that time surfing the web, answering emails.

488
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,519
You're not going to do things that are unrelated to what you're working on.

489
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,360
You're also going to persist even when it's frustrating.

490
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,281
What I mean by that is,

491
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,542
you're going to use that time for something creative,

492
00:26:02,702 --> 00:26:04,802
even if it means switching tasks.

493
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:07,683
If you are working on your game and you're working on code,

494
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:10,044
and you feel completely stuck and you just can't do it today,

495
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:13,625
switch to drawing, switch to making music,

496
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:14,806
switch to working on audio.

497
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:19,139
It can even be not related to the project if you have to, like adult coloring books,

498
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:22,922
things like that. Just do something creative for that space of time.

499
00:26:25,304 --> 00:26:29,707
And always remind yourself that this is your time. It's not an obligation. It's a gift that

500
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:34,671
you're making to yourself. And over time, as you do the ritual more and more, you'll start

501
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:39,074
to look forward to it and actually really jealously guard your ritual time.

502
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:43,739
So step three is mindfulness.

503
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,000
Now, everybody thinks of meditation first when you mention mindfulness.

504
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,562
And yes, meditation is good.

505
00:26:49,582 --> 00:26:51,823
A couple of different things that you can try,

506
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,004
because we're only going to meditate for two to three minutes.

507
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:55,104
It's a very short session.

508
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:59,767
You can do three minutes of breathing where you spend those three minutes

509
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,468
being aware of each breath you take.

510
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:07,310
You try to breathe in a certain rhythm and you try to be aware

511
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,212
of how the breath feels going in and out of your body.

512
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:14,489
There's something else called visualize the river.

513
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:18,352
And this is what I used when I was trying

514
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:21,474
to cope with cancer diagnosis.

515
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:25,497
So I would envision myself laying on my back,

516
00:27:25,817 --> 00:27:26,858
floating in a river.

517
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:30,820
And for about 30 seconds, I'll just float in the river

518
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,002
and really even play sound effects

519
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:35,163
and really immerse myself in that sense

520
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:36,004
of floating in the river.

521
00:27:36,943 --> 00:27:39,864
And then whatever it is that is distracting me or bothering me,

522
00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:44,025
I'll picture myself actually bundling it up in my head,

523
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:46,105
like reaching into my head and taking it out.

524
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:49,126
And I feel it in my hand for a second.

525
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,506
And then I set it in the river beside me.

526
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:53,946
And now I watch it float along with me.

527
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:56,187
And after about a minute of that,

528
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,487
I make the decision to let it go.

529
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,088
It's going to be floating in the river with me.

530
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:03,048
When the time comes, it will still be there.

531
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:05,808
I just don't need to carry it along with me right now.

532
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:11,876
You can also repeat a mantra and it doesn't have to be OM or anything like official.

533
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:17,699
It can be things like I'm here, I'm present or my favorite mantra from a guided meditation that

534
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:25,382
I used to love. In this moment, everything is okay. But mindfulness doesn't have to be meditation.

535
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:31,885
There are other ways that you can be mindful. So attentive listening is one way and that is

536
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:37,087
finding a sound that you find interesting or intriguing.

537
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:44,515
like a sound of a forest and spending three minutes actually paying attention to it,

538
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:49,958
really listening to it, trying to pick apart all of the different sounds in it and how often do

539
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:57,681
you hear them and what do you think they mean. Then there is the raisin exercise which is as

540
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:03,544
fun as it sounds. You take a small piece of food and you act like you're from another planet and

541
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:04,544
you've never seen it before.

542
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:11,681
and you spend the three minutes just looking at it and marveling at it and feeling the texture of it

543
00:29:11,942 --> 00:29:18,226
and smelling it and tasting a little bit of it. Really paying attention to that thing as if you've

544
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,047
never seen it before.

545
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:21,993
And then mindful seeing.

546
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:24,214
So mindful seeing is similar to attentive listening.

547
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:25,635
It's just visual instead.

548
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:28,117
So you take, you know, you can look out your own window

549
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:31,619
or for example, on Netflix, there are videos of,

550
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,901
for example, a train going through Sweden for an hour.

551
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:35,682
So you can take those videos

552
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:39,324
and just spend three minutes watching it carefully

553
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,146
and just being very mindful about everything

554
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,287
that you're seeing happening, every dust moat,

555
00:29:44,787 --> 00:29:47,429
the wind moving leaves of grass, right?

556
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,211
Very specifically looking at that carefully.

557
00:29:51,562 --> 00:29:54,803
And there are also sound effects and other gadgets

558
00:29:55,343 --> 00:29:58,564
that you can use to help you focus during these sessions,

559
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,145
like singing bowls.

560
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:08,047
Bonsai.

561
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:11,409
Taking three to four to five minutes

562
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:16,310
and trimming and really lovingly caring for a bonsai tree

563
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,331
is one of the most meditative things that you can do.

564
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:23,091
There are various applications that can help you.

565
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,953
It's Buddhify over there on the left.

566
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:28,114
Buddhify is super great with short session,

567
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,977
especially for short session meditations that

568
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,157
happen while you're doing something else,

569
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:35,699
like walking to work or taking a break at work

570
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,881
or about to go to sleep.

571
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,423
I use Headspace myself and very much like it,

572
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:43,244
but I've also heard really good things about Calm.

573
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:46,827
And there are actually gadgets that

574
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:49,669
help with meditation, specifically with coherence,

575
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:50,229
most of them.

576
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:54,524
I haven't used the Muse, but I've used the technology in Unite,

577
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,605
which that company used to be called Wild Divine.

578
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,066
I've also used HeartMath,

579
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:00,046
that's what I have right now.

580
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:07,529
Coherence is when your breathing and heart rate are in coherence, they're aligned.

581
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:11,730
In that state, that's the state that naturally occurs with meditation.

582
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:15,312
In that state, you have enhanced.

583
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:18,907
senses and enhanced sense of well-being as well.

584
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:21,747
What the gadgets can do is they can help you

585
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:24,568
understand the feeling of when you're in that state.

586
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:27,789
You can achieve that state without the gadgets as well.

587
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,531
Then after the mindfulness, you're going to spend

588
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:34,211
a few minutes on your focused goals.

589
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:37,792
You're going to review the work you did in

590
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,433
the last session for about five minutes

591
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:41,393
and make note of any revisions you have,

592
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:42,553
but that's getting your head back in

593
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:44,554
the space of what you were working on.

594
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:49,709
And taking dedicated time to do that means you're not spending your actual work time,

595
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:54,151
getting a little bit of the ways down the road and then saying, wait, what was I doing again?

596
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:57,433
So you're going to take the time to review and get that all in your head first.

597
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:02,335
And then you're going to look at the focus goals that you had at the end of your last session.

598
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:06,017
So since those are created at the end of the last session, I'm going to talk about those a little

599
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:13,121
bit later. And then it's time to do the work. And I use the phrase do the work intentionally.

600
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:16,654
because that's the phrase that Stephen Pressfield uses in The War of Art.

601
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:26,841
He also talks about something called resistance. Resistance is the invisible force that stops you

602
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:31,904
from doing your work. And I think we've all experienced it in one form or another.

603
00:32:31,924 --> 00:32:34,386
And he always says it's the if

604
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:38,699
It's the thing that stops you from actually working out because working out is good for you.

605
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:42,943
It's the thing that stops you from eating the healthy stuff instead of the unhealthy stuff

606
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:49,529
because the healthy stuff is good for you. So he says there's a secret that real writers know

607
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:53,993
that wannabe writers don't and the secret is this. It's not the writing part that's hard.

608
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:58,898
What's hard is sitting down to write. What keeps us from sitting down is resistance.

609
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:06,476
And he goes on to say, most of us have two lives, the life we live and the unlived life within us.

610
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:08,897
Between the two stands resistance.

611
00:33:09,817 --> 00:33:14,138
Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard or smelled, but it can be felt.

612
00:33:14,938 --> 00:33:19,879
We all experience it as an energy field radiating from a work in potential.

613
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,860
It's a repelling force.

614
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,900
It's negative.

615
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,462
Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, to prevent us from doing our work.

616
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:38,191
And I say all of that because you need to focus on doing the work and you need to end resistance and understand when it's happening.

617
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,152
So of course first you'll need to choose a project.

618
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:46,353
Whatever you choose, it doesn't have to be your final answer. It just needs to be something that you plan to ship.

619
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:48,894
It can be really small, but you need to plan to ship it.

620
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:54,603
The act of knowing you're going to complete something changes the tone of your work.

621
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:59,004
And I think that's an important part of this process is belief that you're going to ship it

622
00:33:59,024 --> 00:34:04,386
when you're done. Then, of course, you need to choose your weapon as well, which is, you know,

623
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:08,207
kind of for game development, hand in hand with the project that you want to undertake.

624
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:13,469
So it can be physical games. If you want to get away from working in the digital, which you do

625
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:13,789
all day.

626
00:34:14,883 --> 00:34:16,744
There's some great narrative game tools out there.

627
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:19,365
This is actually a screenshot from my narrative game,

628
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:22,606
which I'm building in ChoiceScript for choice of games.

629
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:25,307
But there are things like Twine and Inform

630
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:26,027
that are great too.

631
00:34:28,308 --> 00:34:29,488
There's some really simple game tools

632
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:31,208
that focus just on the act of creation

633
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:32,329
and not on the tool itself.

634
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:34,950
Things like Game Maker, RPG Maker, and Pico 8.

635
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:39,438
And of course, Unity and Unreal are always available.

636
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,559
So a little bit of a practical note,

637
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,079
a lot of people in game development

638
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,001
work under IP agreements and or restrictions

639
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:49,502
from mood lighting or commercial side projects.

640
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:53,243
Those suck and are often, and I'm not saying,

641
00:34:53,344 --> 00:34:54,384
this is not legal advice,

642
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:56,925
but they're often unenforceable anyway.

643
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:58,866
But even if they're unenforceable,

644
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:01,827
it's got a chilling effect because no one wants to

645
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:07,087
be the person that sounds like you're distracted from your main game that you're working on for

646
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:11,871
work by this side game. I know personally I was never distracted by my side project,

647
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:18,476
but it still I felt odd even bringing it up when I had permission when I had to get permission for

648
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:23,520
a side project. So if you're in that situation and I'm not saying to be a secret squirrel

649
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:28,024
and work on it secretly, it's a terrible idea. What I am saying is you can do things like game mods.

650
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:33,440
Game mods are things that avoid the IP issues

651
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,921
because they're always owned by the company

652
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:36,021
that released the original game.

653
00:35:36,682 --> 00:35:38,603
So things like Skyrim or Fallout, for example,

654
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:40,685
have creator kits and so do other games.

655
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:43,187
You can participate in game jams

656
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:44,648
that starts with your spark,

657
00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:48,011
and then you can finish that small project

658
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:49,872
and release it for free as a part of the game jam.

659
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:55,374
Or if you feel completely blocked by your IP agreements,

660
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,255
there are always things like woodworking and papercraft

661
00:35:58,335 --> 00:35:58,855
and knitting.

662
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:00,615
And often some of those can become games,

663
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:02,576
can become releasable games.

664
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:04,696
It's interesting to think about physical games

665
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,096
from glassmaking, for example.

666
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:09,017
But it's just another way to express yourself.

667
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,798
You want to think about your key skills

668
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:14,278
and make sure whatever you're working on,

669
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:16,538
you have at least one key skill that's

670
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:17,418
going to contribute to it.

671
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,048
You don't want to try something that's all new for you

672
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:22,150
because you'll feel like you're constantly failing.

673
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,151
But you do want a little bit of new,

674
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:25,792
a little bit of something you don't do in

675
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:27,434
your day job because you want this to feel like

676
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:29,835
an opportunity to do something different.

677
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:32,738
Ultimately, of course, you'll find

678
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:34,539
yourself staring at this blank page.

679
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,040
Blank page is my nemesis.

680
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,722
I'm actually terrible at dealing with the blank page.

681
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:44,319
So one of the things that I've learned to do is in whatever form I'm documenting or writing down

682
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:50,241
ideas for this game, whether it's a physical notebook or Google Docs or whatever, I make a

683
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:56,184
page called Scratch. And on the Scratch page, I can type in any idea I have, any thought I have,

684
00:36:56,224 --> 00:37:00,325
any link I have, anything that I think is useful. And the fact that it's not

685
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:06,376
intended to be final, it's just intended to be a space to collect things, means I feel safe

686
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:10,618
typing in there. And a lot of times when I'm stuck on the blank page, I'll go to my scratch page and

687
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:15,841
just start typing stream of consciousness. And over time, I'll end up in a place where I feel

688
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:21,203
like, okay, I can work now. And also a lot of good ideas will come from it. You also need to

689
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:27,786
teach yourself to let go. We work in an industry where it's important that all of us know what

690
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:30,427
we're building and what to do now and how it all.

691
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:36,490
ladders up to the same goal and how it all works together. And that can feel really inhibiting

692
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,134
when you're working on a solo project. I know personally, it was one of the hardest things that

693
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:47,220
I had to get over was feeling like I can't work because I don't know everything that I need to

694
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,425
build. But in this, you don't have to plan for everything. That's a part of the joy with a side

695
00:37:51,465 --> 00:37:56,509
project is that you actually can let go. But you absolutely do need to commit.

696
00:37:57,456 --> 00:38:00,978
even if that means you're going to whittle until you uncover the shape of your game.

697
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:06,141
You're going to commit to spending that time. Something else that you should do as a part of

698
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:10,684
doing the work is to find a way to talk about it. You want a direct connection between people

699
00:38:11,565 --> 00:38:16,167
and your personal work. And the reason that you want that is because it's going to keep

700
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:22,091
you accountable and engaged and purposeful. Being under contract for my side project right now

701
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:25,253
means I'm going to finish it because people are expecting it.

702
00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:30,386
So you can stream your development on Twitch or Facebook, for example, but find a way to

703
00:38:30,987 --> 00:38:35,090
build some anticipation, even if it's just with friends, because that will keep you accountable.

704
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:42,455
So then we're going to have a moment of purposeful goals.

705
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:46,978
You're going to save your work. Super important, obviously.

706
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:50,360
Didn't want to not mention that and have that not be a part of the process.

707
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,722
We all do it routinely, but certainly do it at the end of your session.

708
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,320
you're going to make your to-dos.

709
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,402
And what you're going to do in the process of making

710
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,844
those to-dos is you're going to add a context.

711
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:03,506
So this is something that I learned

712
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:07,089
as a part of the getting things done approach to productivity.

713
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,332
A context means the place where you can actually

714
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:13,354
do the thing in question.

715
00:39:13,995 --> 00:39:15,756
And the reason I set different contexts

716
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:20,580
is because I learned that there are different mental spaces

717
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,041
where I can do different things.

718
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,691
Like, if it's complex code that I need to write, I need to be at my desk 100%.

719
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:30,232
Can't do it anywhere else. If it's something I need to think through,

720
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:33,792
a problem I need to solve, like, how can you find out about this thing before this other

721
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:37,493
thing has happened in this story? A lot of times I can do that while I'm walking,

722
00:39:37,553 --> 00:39:43,135
while I'm using an exercise bike. I will find a time that is sort of action-oriented

723
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,916
where I'm not trying to write or do anything else at the same time.

724
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:51,377
So I'll make it to do walking task for that.

725
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:56,088
On my phone, there are certain things I can do from a narrative perspective. There's certain

726
00:39:56,128 --> 00:40:00,612
writing things I can do on my phone. Lots of things I can't, but some I can. So the ones

727
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:04,435
that can't be done on my phone, I will make a note of that. So when I'm waiting at the doctor's

728
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:10,219
office or killing 15 minutes in bed before I try to fall asleep, I will actually pull up my phone

729
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,120
and start working on those.

730
00:40:15,765 --> 00:40:18,045
And then we're going to have a moment of gratitude.

731
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:20,046
And this may seem like it's out of place,

732
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:21,407
but it's actually really important.

733
00:40:21,527 --> 00:40:25,028
It's just one minute to press pause and reflect.

734
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:29,249
It's important to think of something

735
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:30,850
that you're sincerely grateful for.

736
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,211
It doesn't have to be anything that happened in your session.

737
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:35,711
It could be anything in your day, anything in your life.

738
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:39,188
And when you have that and you've thought about it for a minute,

739
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:42,150
you want to write it at the top of your notes section for your next session.

740
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,752
So the next time you start a session,

741
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:47,753
you're going to read that thing that you're grateful for again.

742
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:49,975
And here's why it's important.

743
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:54,217
Gratitude has been shown in studies, many studies, actually,

744
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:56,939
to improve physical and psychological health,

745
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:59,800
your ability to sleep, your self-esteem, your mental strength.

746
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:02,215
It enhances your empathy,

747
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:04,116
reduces your aggression, it reduces stress.

748
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:07,017
It can be one of the best burnout busters

749
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,778
around is having that moment of gratitude.

750
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:11,099
It's a part of your daily ritual.

751
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,680
Then finally, the closing.

752
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,781
Of course, the closing is the bookend to

753
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:17,842
the opening that you had

754
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:19,002
at the beginning of your ritual.

755
00:41:19,682 --> 00:41:20,963
You're going to remind yourself of what you

756
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:23,744
accomplished and clean and prep your sacred space.

757
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:26,565
Blow out any candles and have this sense of finishing.

758
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:29,290
And then you're going to have your ending focus.

759
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,992
You want to choose something that emphasizes why you just

760
00:41:33,052 --> 00:41:34,033
did the work that you did.

761
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,574
So for me, again, because this is primarily

762
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:40,996
a writing task or writing-driven game that I'm working on,

763
00:41:41,737 --> 00:41:45,759
mine is also, again, from Winter's Tale, Mark Halperin.

764
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,760
All great discoveries are products

765
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,621
as much of doubt as of certainty.

766
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:52,963
And the two in opposition clear the air

767
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,223
from marvelous accidents.

768
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:59,436
So that those are the eight steps in the side project ritual.

769
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:04,319
And the beginning steps only take about seven, eight minutes.

770
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,542
The closing steps take about two, three minutes, maybe five,

771
00:42:08,582 --> 00:42:10,223
if you have a lot of goals that you want to write down.

772
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:14,927
The bulk of it isn't doing the work, but in having it in this ritual format,

773
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,369
you're doing all of the things that will trigger your brain to

774
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:26,245
work in that space of time in a way that is creative and freeing and healing for yourself.

775
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:31,408
And this can actually become an evergreen process that gives you a sense of purpose and growth.

776
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:37,272
And again, it's true that most of my friends are aware of my constant side projects the entire

777
00:42:37,332 --> 00:42:41,796
time I was in game development. I honestly believe it's what helped keep me whole and sane.

778
00:42:42,676 --> 00:42:43,797
And over the course of

779
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:49,967
doing this ritual over days and then months and then years, you'll find that you're creating a

780
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:54,690
series of guiding lights for yourself. So you always have your way back to mental clarity

781
00:42:55,271 --> 00:43:02,536
and you always have a way to keep burnout at bay. So that's the side project ritual. Thanks for

782
00:43:02,696 --> 00:43:07,640
taking time to watch this today. If you have any feedback or questions, you can always find me on

783
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:13,304
Twitter at laralyn and I've also got a website laralynmcwilliams.com that has contact information

784
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:13,904
there as well.

785
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:15,397
So, thank you.
