1
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:09,784
Today, we're going to be talking about what is desirability as we define it in our research lab,

2
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:14,706
how specifically we study it, and go over some familiar examples,

3
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:19,787
and then look at how we put this theory into practice in creating a new game

4
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:24,329
that's called Chef League that's launching very soon. It's exciting.

5
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:28,050
All right, so what is desirability?

6
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:31,911
Look at this can.

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,791
Oh, what's that sound?

8
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:43,675
Desirability is, oh, we've got to listen to it one more time.

9
00:00:44,996 --> 00:00:47,497
It's about expectation and anticipation

10
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:50,099
that an experience will be all that we hope,

11
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:53,340
or at least what we hope, and maybe even exceed

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,401
those expectations.

13
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:58,596
And if you saw this can after hearing that sound,

14
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:03,638
maybe your desire for that can, whatever the beverage is,

15
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:04,758
might go down a little bit.

16
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,300
That's followed by an emotional appraisal

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,160
of reality, of the real experience

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,761
that we encounter after that moment of anticipation.

19
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:18,684
So if the liquid that you find after you hear this sound

20
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,444
and open a can is this chick beer,

21
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,025
maybe that's what you were really looking for.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,124
you evaluate and appraise that as positively. But maybe you were pretty excited to get

23
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:32,768
fat tire beer or something like that. You'd be more excited if that's what you get.

24
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:38,233
Or maybe that sound was making you think of soda and Coca-Cola might be what you want.

25
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:42,356
So a simple model that we can use is along the

26
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:48,882
the y-axis there is a person's point of view. So that's their sensory anticipation

27
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:53,164
their values-driven or signaling anticipation

28
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:54,845
and their emotional anticipation.

29
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:59,486
And we can have that first sound that we hear of the can,

30
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,847
and then we see, yep, it's a can.

31
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:04,008
So if you were thinking of something that comes in a bottle,

32
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:06,049
maybe the can changes that.

33
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,990
And so, depending on which one of these people you are,

34
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,471
hoping for fat tire, hoping for chipped beer,

35
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,552
or hoping for Coke,

36
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:17,213
this is going to play out differently for you.

37
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:19,919
All right, the people who got fat tire in the can

38
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,359
are the people who, at the top of this,

39
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,320
are going to appraise that experience most positively

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,121
of the others.

41
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:30,881
All right, but the reality is that desirability and studying

42
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:32,142
it is complex.

43
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:33,422
So it differs by people.

44
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:36,163
It differs from novice to expert.

45
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:37,983
It's always changing.

46
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:42,764
Brands often get blindsided because of confirmation bias

47
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:47,965
and under-invest in listening to how it is changing over time.

48
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:51,136
I don't know if you're a fan of the Dos Equis ads,

49
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:55,620
but this says, he gave his father the talk,

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,921
and it says, can you get Facebook on this thing?

51
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:01,384
And I thought they were clever ads.

52
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:05,147
So how do we study desirability conceptually?

53
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:08,989
From our point of view, we're looking at it related

54
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:10,651
to language and related to learning.

55
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:13,413
So I want you all to think of a song

56
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,175
that you recently came across that you heard and you liked.

57
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,416
Just get a song in your head.

58
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:22,094
Everybody has one?

59
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,414
Something?

60
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:23,814
All right.

61
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,635
And then I want you to try to articulate again in your head

62
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:32,216
why you like that song specifically.

63
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:37,898
So for most of us, we notice things that we like or dislike,

64
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,819
but we actually kind of struggle to describe them

65
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,899
very effectively.

66
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,800
So you might be, I don't know, you might be into Cardi B

67
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,501
or this latest Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper song.

68
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:53,396
any of these, but we're trying an experience,

69
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,299
we're noticing, we're liking it,

70
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,201
but we're not doing this next step,

71
00:03:57,241 --> 00:04:00,185
which is being able to know all of the labels

72
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:03,670
that effectively describe why we like that thing

73
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,876
and enable us to find more of that thing efficiently.

74
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,455
I'm interested in this for a second reason, which

75
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:15,436
is related to how people advance in creativity.

76
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,876
So at the bottom of this triangle,

77
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,956
we have a little mini creativity.

78
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:22,857
That's when you're able to be creative for you.

79
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:26,038
So maybe you put coconut milk in your coffee.

80
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,618
That's the first time you've ever done that.

81
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,218
That's creative for you, but it's not actually

82
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:32,099
that creative, broadly speaking.

83
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,859
Middle creativity is when you're creative in your domain.

84
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:40,729
And big creativity is really often what we're talking about

85
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,150
when we talk about innovation and groundbreaking products.

86
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,812
I'm really interested in empowering more people

87
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:53,976
to get to big C, but it really starts with empowering them

88
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:54,996
to get to little c.

89
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:57,558
And that's related to whether they ever develop

90
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:01,640
that language to categorize and find experiences

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,500
that they might enjoy.

92
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:04,854
So most of us really instinctively

93
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:09,318
evaluate what we like or dislike without learning

94
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:10,419
to articulate why.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,723
And I study what people mean when

96
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:18,125
they like or dislike something, even when

97
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:21,288
they lack the language of describing what they mean.

98
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,010
And part of how I do this is by looking at people

99
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,131
who go further than that.

100
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,752
So there are some people who go further,

101
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:29,515
and they develop a desirability point of view

102
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:31,076
that they can articulate.

103
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,921
So we go back to the song that you're thinking

104
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:36,241
and how you tried to describe it in your head.

105
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:43,022
This is what experts use to describe whether they

106
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:44,483
like or dislike a song.

107
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,403
A specific type of expert.

108
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:49,443
This is like a sensory evaluation type of expert.

109
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,624
So they can analyze in their minds

110
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,945
the tempo, the tertiary time signature,

111
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:57,305
and a lot of other things that most of us

112
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,525
lack the language to even really.

113
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:04,898
differentiate our experiences based on that.

114
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,901
So this is more what that full cycle looks like.

115
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,523
So up in the blue corner, you have noticing the songs you

116
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,906
like or dislike, and then learning the labels

117
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,327
to describe why you like or dislike them.

118
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:22,210
And then getting to the point where you have clear criteria

119
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,592
to structure those experiences, getting feedback.

120
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,473
This is where products come in.

121
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:30,155
Do products allow you to get that kind of feedback or not?

122
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:35,599
on your successes and failures and trying to find new music that you like,

123
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,502
learning to get to the point where you can critique effectively

124
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:42,745
music that you don't like, and learning to get

125
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:46,808
a differentiated point of view. That point of view helps you

126
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:49,110
more efficiently find new things.

127
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:53,010
So some of the benefits of being able to have this full cycle

128
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,671
are that you are faster at analysis,

129
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:57,372
you're faster at search,

130
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,533
you can be more experimental, possibly even more creative,

131
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:06,355
you spend less time sorting through experiences

132
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:08,756
that you really aren't going to like,

133
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:13,238
and you also, because you can articulate your voice,

134
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:15,419
your voice is heard more by designers.

135
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,920
So you are more of a participant in...

136
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:21,335
the design of the things that you might later enjoy.

137
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:24,396
All right, this applies to a wide range of fields.

138
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,277
Some of you might know this scene from The Devil Wears

139
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:27,797
Prada.

140
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:31,718
I don't know if we have people who have seen it.

141
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:34,599
And so she's looking at these two turquoise belts.

142
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,680
She says, oh, they look, they're so different.

143
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,660
And she's making a joke.

144
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,540
She thinks they look exactly the same.

145
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:43,101
And then she gets schooled by Miranda Kerr, who's

146
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:48,624
who is the Anna Wintour character in this movie.

147
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:51,546
But anyway, I'm not going to go into it today,

148
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:54,607
but you can apply this across a wide range of fields,

149
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:58,590
beyond flavor, beyond music, beyond games,

150
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,451
many different types of products.

151
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,473
And I'm happy to answer questions about those

152
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,073
later if you have them.

153
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:08,035
So next, how do we study desirability

154
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:09,216
practically speaking?

155
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:12,378
So we've gone over what it is, conceptually

156
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:13,498
how we think about it.

157
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,139
But.

158
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:16,858
How do we do it?

159
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:20,460
So we start by analyzing qualitative and quantitative

160
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,060
reviews of experiences.

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,501
We start with small data sets, and then we

162
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,042
build much larger data sets.

163
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,623
We distinguish experts from novices.

164
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:32,424
And so we look at where they are on that circle

165
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:33,584
that I just showed you.

166
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:35,785
We turn distinct patterns.

167
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,526
Once we have distinct patterns, we

168
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:40,647
turn them into algorithms that we can run and eventually

169
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:45,288
create little simulations, sort of AI that can make choices.

170
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,615
in our system.

171
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:49,615
I'll explain this a little bit more in a moment.

172
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:53,297
And then we also develop ways for us to continue listening

173
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:56,178
so that we can avoid the trap of confirmation bias.

174
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,199
And then most importantly,

175
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,440
and this is a thing that I hope you'll take away

176
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,240
from this talk,

177
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,861
we also try to build into these products

178
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:06,462
ways to help users develop that,

179
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:09,023
their ability, their own ability to articulate

180
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:10,864
and understand their point of view.

181
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,585
Because that also makes them better at signaling

182
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:15,966
how we could improve products for them.

183
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:20,967
So we're also, in this case, not just researchers.

184
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,208
So the game Chef League that's coming out,

185
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,570
this gives you a little overview of what it is.

186
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,210
Hit it.

187
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,191
That's what I'm talking about.

188
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:30,792
Wait.

189
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:31,452
OK, now.

190
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:31,892
From the beginning.

191
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:33,193
Hit it, boys.

192
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:33,933
Hit it.

193
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:34,073
Hit it.

194
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:34,653
Hit it.

195
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:35,114
Hit it.

196
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:38,015
Hit it.

197
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:38,675
Hit it.

198
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:40,596
Hit it.

199
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:41,057
Hit it.

200
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:42,097
Hit it.

201
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:42,697
Hit it.

202
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:45,159
Hit it.

203
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:46,579
Hit it.

204
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:46,839
Hit it.

205
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:47,100
Hit it.

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,360
Hit it.

207
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:56,762
So in this case, this game is meant to be fun first,

208
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,124
but the more that you play it,

209
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,867
you also learn from the chefs

210
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:01,730
that we have built into the game.

211
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,695
There are real chefs, and there are little chef AIs

212
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,320
that are based on the data that I'll walk you through here.

213
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:14,361
So this game is also very personal to me in the sense that this is not funded by grants or anything else.

214
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,042
It's taken me three years to build it.

215
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,945
It's been brutal, but it's so fun.

216
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:25,211
And three years in, we're on pre-order in the App Store right now, and I still play it.

217
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:30,496
And I think that is kind of amazing, because you all know how exhausting it is to make a game.

218
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:37,103
I really love reality chef shows, but I'm also a pretty introverted, shy person, and

219
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:38,703
I don't want to be on reality TV.

220
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:45,306
So I thought that it could be sort of interesting to learn from these in a game, and like, could

221
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:48,887
you beat Bobby Flay every day, you know, on your phone sort of privately?

222
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:53,329
And so it took the first couple of years to build the data for this, and then it took

223
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:54,769
the last year to build the game.

224
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:58,864
So it starts back in 2015 with this Flavor Genome Project.

225
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:03,766
And so we started categorizing how food tastes to humans,

226
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:07,207
which is actually the poorest data that we have on flavor.

227
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:12,529
So we have a lot of data on distribution of food and beverage items.

228
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:17,650
We have a lot of and very rapidly accelerating scientific data

229
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,891
on flavor compounds that are in different things.

230
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:23,352
But we don't have a lot of data on how food tastes to people.

231
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:26,957
and the diversity of palates that we have.

232
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:29,238
And so we started looking into that

233
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,521
and linking it to emotion and culture,

234
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,524
cultural associations that people have.

235
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:42,127
And then we went into the small-scale data development.

236
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:44,429
So this is qualitative and quantitative reviews

237
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:45,350
with real chefs.

238
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,012
We were really focused on how they,

239
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,913
like did they like something or not

240
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:50,974
and how they described it.

241
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:52,995
So let me give you an example of what I,

242
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,771
helpful articulation versus a non-helpful one.

243
00:11:56,811 --> 00:12:00,432
So a non-helpful review is that was gross.

244
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,414
Like it doesn't give us very much information about what is wrong

245
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:07,115
with the item or how it might be improved.

246
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:12,657
A helpful review is that this is bland, it needs salt,

247
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:17,819
and experts know that salt can come in the form of salt, but it can also come in

248
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:22,821
functionally, it can come in the form of feta cheese or something that is salty.

249
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:27,535
and brings other properties to the item.

250
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:31,657
So that's what we're talking about when we talk about the difference of someone who has

251
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:33,497
this language versus doesn't have this language.

252
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:37,399
And then we move to much bigger data sets.

253
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:41,961
So at this stage we're looking at about 1.5 million different reviews from real chefs

254
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,041
of real recipes.

255
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,222
We begin to be able to differentiate

256
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,922
people just based on the language that they use,

257
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,125
by expertise and by degree of experimentation.

258
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,846
So we also know, did they make a thing?

259
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,528
So the experimentation is being done that way.

260
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,372
So this is an example of an expert palette

261
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:05,834
versus a novice palette that we were able

262
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:08,215
to ascertain from the data.

263
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:11,718
So we can then build, as I said before,

264
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,219
we can turn this into algorithms

265
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,940
that we can begin to move through.

266
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:22,244
new recipes with these algorithms and see, go back and forth between real chefs and this

267
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,805
data to see how that matches up.

268
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,307
So there was a show, it's not on the air anymore, it's called The Taste.

269
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:38,135
It had Anthony Bourdain, bless him, Nigella Lawson, Ludo, and it's had some other celebrity

270
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:38,676
guest chefs.

271
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:39,256
So we look.

272
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,488
we analyzed the history of that show.

273
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:43,828
The show is really focused on one bite of food.

274
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:47,629
And then they don't see, they're blind to who made it.

275
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,289
And they talk about it.

276
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,610
And they give it an evaluation of this person

277
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,531
moves forward or not.

278
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,531
And so we looked at the raw data for each of these.

279
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:01,972
And then we could also simplify that eventually

280
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:06,553
to see that there are distinct patterns in how these chefs are

281
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,673
voting on this reality show.

282
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:13,982
And because this show is blind to the personality of who made the food,

283
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:16,883
it's particularly interesting from an analysis point of view.

284
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:20,723
We did a bunch of other experiments.

285
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:25,364
We looked at chefs primarily in the Boston area and learned how they think

286
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:29,945
through flavors and particularly how they invent new dishes and what that

287
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:33,106
process looks like so that we could modify our

288
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,787
AI chefs in this game.

289
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,928
And we've collaborated with MIT and Harvard

290
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:42,049
on some different things.

291
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,550
This delightfully paired feelings for dinner

292
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,551
was looking at, this was an emotional menu.

293
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:52,432
There was no food or beverage item listed on the menu.

294
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,953
The menu items were things like a slap in the face.

295
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:59,395
And then that got interpreted by the chef

296
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:00,475
and the sommelier team.

297
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:04,257
And then we built the first version of our software.

298
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,760
And we hosted a dinner where it was

299
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,343
sommeliers versus software for pairing foods and beverages.

300
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:16,405
And then the audience decided what they liked better.

301
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:19,627
And the software did pretty well.

302
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:23,629
It did about equal to the sommeliers, which was better

303
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:25,110
than we had hoped at this point.

304
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:29,580
So this is an example of what that early software looked like.

305
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,901
You could go through it and you could look up any food,

306
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:38,624
any beverage, and it would tell you critical factors related to it,

307
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:44,047
and it would also tell you what chefs think this goes best with.

308
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:51,430
This was interesting. It was interesting for a very nerdy person like

309
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,572
me, but I don't really think it's a product that other people really

310
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:55,312
wanted. So this...

311
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:58,314
We hadn't yet turned this into a game,

312
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,816
but it was a critical step along the way.

313
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:03,138
So then we got to the point where

314
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:05,821
we could turn these algorithms into AI chefs that

315
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,762
can make choices.

316
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:11,947
So we could, with a new recipe data set,

317
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:16,691
we could see how Nigella Lawson would likely vote

318
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:19,554
on new items that would come up.

319
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,716
And we could differentiate across these three.

320
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,893
And then the next step was, in terms of making it into a game,

321
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:32,277
is how can we make you versus Nigella or one of our other six

322
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:34,258
AI chefs possible?

323
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:36,940
And then that comes back to our language question.

324
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,282
How can we build this game in a way that

325
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:42,524
capacitates you to get savvier about the language

326
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,105
that you use?

327
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:44,446
And so

328
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,981
Takeaways from this before we open it up to a question.

329
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:52,123
In the products that you're building,

330
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:56,827
thinking about how you might model the sensory expectations,

331
00:16:56,887 --> 00:17:01,090
the emotional expectations, and the signaling expectations

332
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:04,673
of your users and the key moments over time

333
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:08,055
and see what that path might look like.

334
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:11,418
And how might you add feedback loops,

335
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:15,861
particularly if I go all the way back here to this diagram.

336
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:24,716
Where along this circle might you be able to add feedback loops that would capacitate your users to not only

337
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:28,418
get smarter for their own benefit, but also to

338
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,942
communicate more effectively with you about how you might improve your products.

339
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:36,383
Thank you.

340
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:48,540
Happy to take questions if people have questions.

341
00:17:58,863 --> 00:17:59,063
Yes?

342
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:05,586
Could you maybe describe the overall thesis and kind

343
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,986
of premises of the desirability lab

344
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:10,827
and what the main kind of like mandate and thesis is?

345
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:12,228
Sure.

346
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:12,448
So.

347
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:15,745
That's a big question.

348
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:19,227
We are primarily about education.

349
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:25,089
When I showed this diagram here, this

350
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,250
is a big part of who we are as a lab.

351
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,631
I do a lot of work with companies for products,

352
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,712
and then it's not always about education.

353
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:34,954
But first and foremost in my lab,

354
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:38,875
I'm looking at how do we empower our students to move up

355
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,557
this diagram to become.

356
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:48,261
really effective creators from their point of view.

357
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,464
And surprisingly, one of the things that shocks me the most

358
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:53,385
about Harvard students, they're super smart.

359
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,446
That's not surprising.

360
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,388
But many of them haven't, you know,

361
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,230
they're really good at following the rules,

362
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,232
but they haven't done a lot of the work

363
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:02,873
of developing their own point of view

364
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,614
that they're going to design from.

365
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:07,597
And so that's the thing that I personally care the most about

366
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:11,600
and that my lab has embedded in everything that we do.

367
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:18,830
And then I think to do that effectively, it takes us into some of these other spaces that we

368
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:27,515
talked about. Like, I need to be able to take them through this cycle for themselves,

369
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,198
and it needs to be open to being around their interests.

370
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:36,080
I also, from a broader market thesis point of view,

371
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,341
I think people are going to get a little bit tired

372
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,742
of products that are sort of addictive

373
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:44,283
and not designed in their best interest.

374
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:46,204
And, you know, call me an optimist,

375
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:50,225
but I think that they will really appreciate products

376
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:52,106
that are also designed to help them

377
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:53,827
develop their own point of view

378
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,687
and become smarter in different ways.

379
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,609
And I'm really interested in experimenting in that.

380
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:00,709
I could be totally wrong.

381
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,660
But that's the experiment I want to do.

382
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,041
I hope that answers your question.

383
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:10,164
Yeah.

384
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,125
Oh, yeah.

385
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:11,405
Hi.

386
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:14,567
One of the things that your talk made me think about,

387
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:17,849
and one of the really important things as a game designer,

388
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:20,872
is getting user feedback, doing play testing, things like that.

389
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,149
And I think one of the biggest challenges there

390
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:26,271
is getting good feedback because oftentimes people

391
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:27,412
don't know what they want.

392
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,894
And so that's what this sounds exactly like.

393
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:32,015
But it also sounds like this is something

394
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,736
that's kind of built up over time

395
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,859
and working with someone over a large period.

396
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:40,542
So if you do just have like an afternoon with someone

397
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:43,944
or even a couple hours, do you have any kind of methods

398
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:46,326
for getting that better feedback and getting them

399
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:49,308
kind of up to speed on the language quickly?

400
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:55,090
Yeah, I guess, I mean, you're talking about a little experiment design, right?

401
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,112
So you would have your upfront explanation of what the key terms that we're going to

402
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:02,873
be looking at in this period of time might be, right?

403
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:08,303
Yeah, or just, you know, you put your game in front of them and you say, like, you know,

404
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:12,704
what's your favorite part? Or like, you know, it's hard for them to kind of answer that because

405
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:16,486
they don't really know necessarily what goes into making a game. They might just say, you know,

406
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:22,168
I don't know, I like Halo. Make it more like Halo when, you know, that's not exactly what

407
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:26,569
you're going for. Yeah, it's a hard problem, especially in the time frame that you're

408
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:29,690
talking about. I empathize with that. I think, so some...

409
00:21:30,612 --> 00:21:34,395
Because you also want the unadulterated feedback, right?

410
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:36,597
So the way that we would usually do that,

411
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:38,818
we don't do a lot of specifically the frame

412
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:41,981
that you're talking about, but we would

413
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:45,403
do the normal first part.

414
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:48,386
And then we would have probably some worksheets

415
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:51,928
that have terms on them that are key terms that we're

416
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:52,789
trying to like.

417
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,371
So you're saying you want it to be like Halo,

418
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:57,292
but which of these terms would really

419
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,797
is what you mean. And I think people would be pretty good at that.

420
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:04,659
It does mean more work for your team to set that up.

421
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,121
But you're also gonna... You'll get more valuable data from it.

422
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:12,043
Cool. Thank you. Yeah. And then the broader picture, how do we

423
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:18,528
educate them in school maybe even so that they're coming out with those

424
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:24,411
better terminology? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how this goes. Yes, please.

425
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:31,128
Hi, I wanted to say, as a Ravenclaw, I'm incredibly delighted that you would work towards making

426
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,088
games to help people learn, because that is totally up my alley.

427
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:41,690
But my question was, a lot of times when I talk colloquially, informally to people, co-workers,

428
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,450
about games, as a designer, it really interests me what they like about it.

429
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:51,191
But they have a tendency to sort of poach vocabulary from reviews and things like that

430
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:54,172
in a way that doesn't genuinely express their own idea.

431
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:55,292
They're just sort of...

432
00:22:56,253 --> 00:23:01,035
mimicking what they read or heard through YouTube or Metacritic or things like that.

433
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:07,298
Would you have any way to approach that so that you could get more personal and authentic

434
00:23:07,478 --> 00:23:08,599
feedback from them?

435
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:12,020
And these are users or designers on your team?

436
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,400
Users.

437
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:20,544
I mean, I think it's probably a little bit of a similar answer to the last question.

438
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:25,444
First of all, it's very common that people do that, and what he was

439
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:28,886
talking about as well, that that is normal. The people who manage to

440
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:32,409
get this full cycle are not normal, they're very, very rare.

441
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,113
But that's why these two brown bits, those are the bits that I

442
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:44,138
think are realistically achievable where people could, over time, learn more

443
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:48,262
of the terms and that we could be building products that give some

444
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:50,543
feedback loops that give them the terms.

445
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:55,370
for what they're experiencing and evaluating.

446
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:59,293
So some of this I think you can do inside of a game.

447
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:02,015
So I don't have it showing up here,

448
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:03,997
but inside Chef League,

449
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:05,778
there are these ingredient challenges.

450
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:06,959
And so it's like,

451
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,721
do you know what a strawberry really tastes like?

452
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,083
And most people don't.

453
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:14,926
You know, they're up in the notice things you like.

454
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,807
They know if they like or dislike strawberries.

455
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:21,407
But we then give them this little quiz where they have to move

456
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:27,171
along sliders, how acidic is it? How bitter is it? And the reason we're

457
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:31,314
doing that is to give them the vocabulary and to get them to pay

458
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:35,357
attention to those differences. So I don't know if you have the opportunity

459
00:24:35,377 --> 00:24:38,260
to build a little bit of that into your game in some way.

460
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,383
I'll see if I can. Yeah, and if not, I would give the same

461
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:45,145
answer as before. How can you, in your user testing...

462
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:51,035
expose them to the terms that might more effectively describe their experience.

463
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,296
No, I appreciate it.

464
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:52,597
Thank you.

465
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:53,437
Yeah, thank you.

466
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:56,380
Some of this also you can do automatically.

467
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,483
So like in songs, you know that they like or dislike the song.

468
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:02,425
You don't need to ask them about the tempo.

469
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:05,067
You can figure all of that out on your own.

470
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:08,710
Which is what Echo Nest did.

471
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,112
Echo Nest was bought by Spotify for $100 million.

472
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,085
So there's some value to getting this right.

473
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:17,046
Yes.

474
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:18,206
Cool, yeah.

475
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,107
Thanks for giving this talk.

476
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,688
So in the trailer for Chef League,

477
00:25:21,768 --> 00:25:24,950
it looks like you are asking potential users in the future

478
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,232
to parse a lot of data and assign a lot of variables.

479
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:29,353
And there are a bunch of sliders I

480
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:31,114
saw that they're going to match up with acidity and things.

481
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:33,676
I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about the UX

482
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,637
that went into not overwhelming your users with all the stuff

483
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:38,078
that you're asking them to consider when they're

484
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:39,279
sort of playing through these challenges.

485
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:46,575
Sure, I mean that video is like on ultra speed, right, to get into the 30 second window that the app store requires, but

486
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:50,768
Yeah, they're all voluntary challenges.

487
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:54,550
So the ingredient challenges where you're moving sliders are really kind of practice

488
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,110
challenges.

489
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,592
So that's only the users who want to do that, that are going to do that.

490
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:05,476
The really fun challenges are where you're competing against chefs and our little chef

491
00:26:05,516 --> 00:26:05,977
AIs.

492
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:08,058
And those are to fix recipes.

493
00:26:08,838 --> 00:26:11,680
And all you do is pick a flavor to fix it.

494
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:15,571
There's no you don't have to move any sliders or anything

495
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,835
But it's a really good point. So how do you make it really easy?

496
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,117
for for people to pick

497
00:26:22,937 --> 00:26:25,480
To pick up the game and we've tried our best to do that

498
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,544
I mean, you know the market will tell us soon when we when we when we drop it

499
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:32,225
Sure. Okay. Thank you

500
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:34,414
Please.

501
00:26:34,654 --> 00:26:34,814
Hi.

502
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:39,837
So I had a question more about on the disliking end of it.

503
00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:42,698
How do you educate people that might

504
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:46,740
be on the undesirability scale of things?

505
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:50,842
So basically, the concrete example that I was thinking of

506
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:54,104
is often gamers are reacting to things in games

507
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:56,225
without being educated about the issues that

508
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:57,466
prepared those changes.

509
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,647
So things like social issues, or representation,

510
00:26:59,707 --> 00:27:00,347
or things like that.

511
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,488
When gamers are reacting to things and like.

512
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:05,651
They're not educated about why those choices were made,

513
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,512
and they see it at a very surface level,

514
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,493
and they feel like it's,

515
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:10,334
I don't know what their problem is.

516
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:15,398
But, so, how do you educate?

517
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:17,439
Are there any techniques for breaking the barrier

518
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:19,981
of dislike into education?

519
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:23,544
Yeah, I wanna spend a little bit more time

520
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:24,184
with your question.

521
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:26,186
Let me go back to this diagram here.

522
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:27,587
So, I mean,

523
00:27:31,014 --> 00:27:33,135
I think there's a difference between educating a user

524
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:38,556
and empowering them to use the more accurate description

525
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:41,096
of their experience.

526
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:46,678
And on that far side, you have, what are their expectations?

527
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:48,998
So it's key for you to get a sense of,

528
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:50,999
what is the expectation of this user

529
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,439
that you are then presenting something to them

530
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:54,760
that they're disliking?

531
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,991
And it's violating their expectation somehow.

532
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:00,953
The value is in really getting to that expectation,

533
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:05,956
because it may be that their expectation can be aligned

534
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:07,297
with what you're trying to do.

535
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:12,460
But the way it's happening, it's like they're not giving,

536
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:15,643
you're assuming what they're saying,

537
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:20,106
and they don't have the language to more,

538
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,761
effectively articulate what they're saying.

539
00:28:25,262 --> 00:28:27,283
So this is hard to fill in,

540
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:29,205
but I think that is ultimately your goal,

541
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:31,827
is to see what are these people hoping for

542
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:34,109
in terms of the sensory experience,

543
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:37,492
in terms of the, when I say signaling experience,

544
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:40,715
what that really is, it's related to meaning and value.

545
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:44,118
So they might have a fundamental belief

546
00:28:44,218 --> 00:28:47,060
about what a type of game should allow them to do,

547
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:50,623
and that's a value that is coming into this.

548
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:57,357
this simple diagram and you're somehow violating that.

549
00:28:57,477 --> 00:28:59,337
And as long as that is still happening,

550
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:01,878
you're still going to have tension there.

551
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:04,059
But it may be that there's a way to unlock that.

552
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,499
I hope that's helpful.

553
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,580
Feel free to follow up after if you want

554
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,180
more detail for that.

555
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:10,901
Thanks so much.

556
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:11,421
Yes.

557
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:14,102
Hello and thank you for the talk.

558
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:21,088
I want to ask a little bit about your method of validating the quality of the software you've built.

559
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:24,550
So presumably you'll give it to some people before release,

560
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:30,133
you'll try to figure out if this is going to satisfy them to a certain extent.

561
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:35,896
What is your approach to testing if what you have is...

562
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:41,957
Sure. So, I mean, it's an indie project, so we are a little bit limited in what we're doing,

563
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:52,062
but we first tested with friends and family, and then we have, you know, QA remote testers

564
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:56,145
that we sorted out a lot of bugs with, and then we've done load testing,

565
00:29:56,165 --> 00:30:00,727
and then we've come back to, you know, mechanics testing at this stage.

566
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:07,013
I'm talking more about not the not the bugs side of it, but the satisfaction side of it

567
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:12,156
So you mentioned how difficult it is to get the truth out of people?

568
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:17,079
Yeah, so somebody says, you know, did you have fun with this app or do you did you like this game? Yeah

569
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:25,363
Yeah, I mean we can see whether they continue to play it I think that's a that's a that's a meaningful one

570
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,144
I don't know. I mean

571
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,936
I don't think I'm going to surprise you with my answer here.

572
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:33,378
We're doing our best to do what you all try to do.

573
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:41,664
I explicitly send them a little simple survey

574
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:46,347
after they test it on like, is it fun?

575
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:47,368
Would you play it again?

576
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,149
Would you recommend it to others?

577
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,951
And then I look at, do they continue

578
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:55,274
to play on their own when we're not looking over their shoulder?

579
00:30:56,014 --> 00:30:57,295
They're not expecting a survey.

580
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,211
People have been pretty brutally honest.

581
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:02,731
So at least so far.

582
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:05,792
Because I also say to them, I want to fail now.

583
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:10,333
So I want you to be as brutally honest as you can now.

584
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,913
That's the biggest favor you can do for me right now.

585
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:15,054
And then we'll see.

586
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,654
I don't know.

587
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:20,515
There isn't really a game that's quite like this on the App Store.

588
00:31:20,555 --> 00:31:21,615
There are cooking games.

589
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:24,295
And they're animated.

590
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:26,756
They're often managing a kitchen kind of games.

591
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,557
And then there's the Food Network.

592
00:31:28,797 --> 00:31:34,280
And so I don't think this game is going to be for everybody,

593
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,982
but I think there are probably a few other people out there

594
00:31:37,502 --> 00:31:38,743
who want this.

595
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:39,664
We will see.

596
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:42,085
And even if they don't, I'll keep playing it.

597
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:45,507
It'll be an expensive game for one.

598
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:47,269
Yes?

599
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,750
We're getting cut off.

600
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:49,990
Yeah.

601
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,491
What I called dibbing.

602
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:51,871
Yep.

603
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:52,412
OK, thanks.

604
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:55,794
If people have more questions, I'll just be outside.

605
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:56,494
Thank you.
