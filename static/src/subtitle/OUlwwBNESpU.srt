1
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:10,392
I'm Hannah Nicklin and I'm really delighted to be part of this narrative design panel.

2
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:14,014
Really well curated thanks to Clara and everyone involved.

3
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:22,200
I'm the narrative designer and writer for Mutazione, which is a mutant soap opera where small town gossip meets the supernatural.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,121
That's our tagline.

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:27,370
and it was released in September 2019 on Apple Arcade, PS4 and PC.

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,154
I've also been CEO and Studio Lead of Degood Fabric since GDC last year.

7
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,477
Just to give you a quick overview of the game,

8
00:00:35,217 --> 00:00:39,361
we call it a mutant soap opera because it's very definitely, formally a soap opera.

9
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:42,965
Some people push back on that a little bit, which is interesting.

10
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,669
As a writer, I have to look at form and genre as quite neutral.

11
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,470
I wouldn't say that...

12
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:52,909
action movies are always bad, I wouldn't say that soap operas are always bad, you know, they have

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,613
qualities which you might expect from them in terms of storytelling and Mettetione is very much

14
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:03,037
considered with both the dramatic and the domestic and it's an ensemble cast story so it's very much

15
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:08,901
a soap opera in those terms and the mutant bit is fairly clear from this cast picture which you can

16
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:14,705
see here. It's a 2D adventure game mostly focused on exploration, conversations,

17
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:19,143
and with this really beautiful, magical, musical gardening mechanic folded into the story.

18
00:01:19,823 --> 00:01:27,470
So in Matasiona you explore a community as a 15 year old girl called Kai. Kai sets out

19
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,294
at the beginning of the game to head to the community in order to care for her dying grandfather.

20
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:36,798
He thinks that he's bringing her there to train as a replacement spiritual leader for

21
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:39,160
his strange and isolated town of Park Mutants.

22
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:43,613
And by the end, both of them discover that it's all a bit more complicated than that.

23
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:46,315
And the answers are in the community itself.

24
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:51,738
So Mitassione is this world of weird and wonderful flora and fauna and a community

25
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:54,459
cast of characters of many different shapes, sizes and colours.

26
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:59,041
There are really beautiful landscapes to explore and this magical musical gardening

27
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:02,643
mechanic where you can create gardens which are procedural music engines, essentially.

28
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:06,236
where every seed that you plant adds to the procedural composition

29
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:10,500
and where each garden represents a step towards healing a fractured community.

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,524
It's also, as I said, a soap opera. It's interested in the mundane as much as the

31
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:19,287
sublime. It's about a community of people who

32
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,188
live alongside the consequences of the past

33
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:25,692
as well as the action of the present. There are love triangles and old wounds,

34
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:30,756
bands nights and communal barbecues. There are big life-changing events and

35
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:30,876
small

36
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:39,577
inconsequential ones. So that aside, I'd like to talk particularly about one aspect of the

37
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:44,540
narrative design with you today, something which I took to calling in conversations with the team

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,823
and in the press as I've talked more about the game in public as multiple middles. So

39
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:56,745
let me go to the next slide. Some nice gifts for you all.

40
00:02:57,397 --> 00:03:01,821
Multiple Middles is how I'm articulating the narrative design structure that I used in

41
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:09,367
Mitassi and I to support that soap opera ensemble cast community-driven dramatic story. So at the

42
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:13,810
same time as providing a linear structure and experience which chimed with the more sort of

43
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,535
conventional tv and film intentions of the creative lead Nils Denneken, i.e. that there's

44
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:23,758
one single story that every player experienced, one history which you're going through,

45
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:29,984
whilst giving the player lots more room to discover more besides that main history.

46
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:34,767
So how they encounter and build their sense of that history, of what's gone before and what's

47
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:40,770
being written now, is very much down to their agency through exploration. The more that they

48
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,534
explore, the more they're rewarded with more time in the community which helps them understand it

49
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:50,816
better. One of the first things that you're often asked when you're working in interactive narrative

50
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:53,738
is how important are the choices or do they matter?

51
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:57,643
And I'd like to think that all the choices characters make in a well-written game matter,

52
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:01,844
but the amount of control you have over them as a player, and what in turn

53
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:06,505
that effect is on the rest of the game, is often seen as the sum of how complex or

54
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:11,487
accomplished a piece of narrative design is. So a lot of games discourse can tend towards

55
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:14,748
judging the accomplishment of games and how close they get to the real world

56
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:20,210
of choice and consequence. But sometimes abstraction rather than simulation or linearity

57
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:27,313
is useful. Sometimes things don't have to be branching in order to be rewarding as a piece

58
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:32,415
of narrative design. We have to think of these things as tools that we use. In my opinion,

59
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:36,917
when working with any form or set of expectations, the craft is to consider the quality of the

60
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:41,479
materials that you're working with. In this case, writing for interaction, like working with or

61
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,361
against the grain of a piece of wood. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you do it

62
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:49,902
with intentionality. You can work with it or against it.

63
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:54,835
but neither of those approaches is wrong if you understand the quality of that decision and why you're doing it.

64
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:59,038
So when I'm asked this question about choice with regards to Mitasiyene,

65
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:06,123
I've taken to describing the decisions I made in the narrative design as the game having multiple middles rather than multiple endings.

66
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:12,747
So in the individual conversations in the game, I very much use the Kentucky Route Zero model of choice,

67
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:17,190
colouring how the character plays the situation, but not really letting you choose who the character is.

68
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,932
So are you Kai attempting to be articulate?

69
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:23,247
Are you Kai trying to diffuse the situation with a joke?

70
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:25,028
Either way, you're still Kai.

71
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:26,788
You're still a version of Kai,

72
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,849
depending on whether she might be in a good mood

73
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,050
or a bad mood that day.

74
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,931
The conversations branch,

75
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,892
but they do always close down to pretty much the same result

76
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:36,233
at the end of a conversation.

77
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,674
You might have accessed different reactions,

78
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:39,755
memories and stories,

79
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:42,016
but they do come to the same place in the end.

80
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:46,578
So the player agency is instead found in exploration.

81
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:49,626
Let me go to the next slide.

82
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,749
So why did I design it like this?

83
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,292
Well, as a writer and narrative designer,

84
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:58,173
coming to the project of Metassione,

85
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:02,377
which was, you know, I came to about four years ago,

86
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:04,418
but the game and the story world itself

87
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,240
had been in Nils' head and been developed for,

88
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,822
you know, five or so years

89
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,744
before the point at which I came to it.

90
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,826
As I came to it, I said, what is the story?

91
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:15,607
What is it to you?

92
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:20,438
Ann Nils said it was important that it was driven by this ensemble cast of characters.

93
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,744
People were using the term soap opera to talk about it, so I did my homework, I made sure I

94
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:31,989
understood what that meant formally, and it was centred around a theme of looking at a community

95
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:37,454
that was a little bit differently aligned with nature. So they'd had this disaster in the past

96
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:38,715
that had changed them.

97
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,178
and they'd built their world a little bit differently.

98
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,100
So I wanted to show what that meant domestically

99
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,840
as well as dramatically.

100
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,882
And it was also built on this really clearly defined

101
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:53,883
pre-existing story world and plot.

102
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:56,404
So I had those things to work with.

103
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,344
And the decisions that I therefore made

104
00:06:58,404 --> 00:07:00,965
about player choice were driven by these considerations,

105
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:04,947
which could be translated as needing room

106
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,308
to develop many characters journeys in tandem.

107
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:14,199
drama-driven, slice-of-life setting, that's how I define soap opera in this context,

108
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,342
able to examine the interplay of community because that was very much,

109
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:22,564
there are so many stories in there, the only way to tell them was to give an

110
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:26,406
ensemble cast approach. And I really wanted to contrast usefully with this

111
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:32,610
sort of fantasy tinged setting that Nils had so beautifully built in order to

112
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,434
to give a depth of storytelling that belied their sort of cartoonish appearances.

113
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:43,559
I said that would give a really interesting contrast and make the world feel really rich and alive.

114
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,883
So for these reasons it made a lot of sense for me not to give the players a different means to

115
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:54,067
affect the outcomes, like multiple endings. I don't want the player to fail because failure

116
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:58,451
means sort of destroying this community or allowing them to continue suffering,

117
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:02,394
which doesn't seem ethical to me when designing a piece of narrative.

118
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:13,719
So to not allow the player agency to exert on the outcome linearly, i.e. to make it branch,

119
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,560
instead I wanted to invite them to shape their experience of the story laterally.

120
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:23,942
I wanted them to explore sideways, multiple middles as opposed to multiple endings.

121
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:37,438
This is something that really opened up a lot of references to TV style storytelling and there is

122
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:42,040
another talk that I have delivered digitally for GDC called Kill the Heroes Save the World about

123
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,802
ensemble cast storytelling and how that those choices that I made in order to tell the story

124
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:53,024
of all of the community well were very much drawn from the influences of long-running TV shows.

125
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:55,505
A, B and C plots.

126
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:01,940
is very much an approach which I took to Mitassione and its multiple middles also.

127
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,302
So the player choice in Mitassione is exploration rather than conversation focused.

128
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:13,503
It's not about branching, it's about whether or not you ever experience this conversation or that conversation

129
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:16,544
or if you move the story forwards and decide to never see those.

130
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:23,125
It meant a lot of careful planning to make sure that those mandatory moments in each time of day

131
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,013
encouraged the player to discover B and C plots,

132
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:31,236
and no matter which kind of pace you took it at,

133
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:34,518
or no matter how much you decided to explore

134
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,980
in one time or another, it still felt rewarding.

135
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,702
And it also gave characters well-shaped journeys.

136
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,724
So it meant that every character had to sort of dip

137
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:45,886
into the mandatory A plot or a plot,

138
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:48,848
as you might call it in a sort of TV series length

139
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:49,949
kind of context.

140
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:56,076
every character that I wanted to develop over the time, they had to dip into the mandatory stuff

141
00:09:56,136 --> 00:10:01,640
in order to bring you out if you wanted to continue following their story. So do check

142
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,165
out that other GDC talk that I gave for more context on that stuff. But just some examples

143
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:13,409
of what like an A plot, B plot, C plot is. As I looked at multiple middles, I considered the A

144
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:17,452
plot as the driving theme or problem of the game.

145
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:22,048
we split it up into chapters, so I would think about this on a chapter by chapter basis,

146
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:29,992
as well as that sort of Ur plot, whole game length context. So for example in Metasianian on day five

147
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:36,515
you have to go on a boat trip with Tung and Miu and discover that you should grow a garden

148
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:41,518
to help Tung with his boat making. And that's really important to move the story forwards,

149
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:44,159
to bring in the gardens for that day, that has to happen.

150
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:50,177
B plots are not a thing that you have to do in Mitassione, but they will be really

151
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:56,039
sort of keyed up in previous episodes, mandatory plot points, or hinted at in

152
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,180
those mandatory plot points in that day particularly. So they are sort of the

153
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,901
secondary story if you're talking in TV terms in an episode, they're often

154
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:08,262
lighter, comedic, and they contrast thematically in a way that reflects on

155
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:12,543
the A plot really usefully, or gives you a different tone to break off into.

156
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:16,556
and then when you return to the A plot it's hopefully more compelling.

157
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:21,118
So in day five of Mitassione, B plots include following up on the events of

158
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,639
the night before when it was revealed that Spike the

159
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:28,660
bartender has had a long-running crush on Tang's mother, Claire. So there are

160
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:32,442
hints of that in the A plot and if you want to you can dig more into

161
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:36,323
it. C plots are the smallest unit and

162
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:40,945
in a more linear form of storytelling where you have a lot of control

163
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:43,025
over outcomes, multiple endings.

164
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:50,129
These kind of C-plot style things, they tend to feel a little bit empty, a little bit like side quests,

165
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,691
without much purpose because they don't move things forward in that real punching linear way,

166
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:58,993
but in a multiple middles kind of explore as much as you like sideways,

167
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:03,975
C-plots become a really nice place to develop characters, to develop light relief,

168
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:08,557
and to just add to your satisfaction with the completeness of the universe.

169
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:14,193
So in day five of Mitassione, a C plot would include the sausage folk plotting a new scheme,

170
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:18,034
which this time will definitely make them all rich. By the way, they live in a non-monetary

171
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:23,516
economy, so that's never going to happen, but that's why it's fun. So the only mandatory path

172
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:29,197
is the A plot. The multiple middles are the choices you make each time of day to dig into

173
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:38,040
B and C plots. Hopefully that makes sense. A big part of making this work was in making time

174
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,820
transparent.

175
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:43,240
because one of the ways which I made it feel like a universe

176
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,100
which is happening whether or not you are there,

177
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,281
which very much chimes with the sense of building

178
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:49,682
a really convincing story world,

179
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,322
was that if you move time forwards,

180
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:53,763
you would never be able to access

181
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:54,943
those conversations again.

182
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:59,504
That meant that I had to work,

183
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:02,065
I co-developed a bunch of narrative design details

184
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:06,227
along with game designers, UI designers, the whole team.

185
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:13,011
in order to really give you a sense of what your decisions meant in terms of time.

186
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:19,913
So we have details such as the journal, which is a diegetic means of setting out which conversations or actions are mandatory.

187
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:29,657
These that you see here, the black text, that's the prompt that you'd get and when you complete an A-plot,

188
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:35,119
when you complete a piece of mandatory plotting or with an action or a conversation, you get a follow-up in purple.

189
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:42,557
So once you've completed all of the mandatory actions or conversations for a time of day,

190
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:49,241
so this is Tuesday night in this picture here, time will move forward. That last action or

191
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:55,946
conversation will have a timer symbol marked above it. So you choose that knowing that it's

192
00:13:55,966 --> 00:14:00,649
going to move time forward. You can choose not to click it and to explore elsewhere if you feel like

193
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:04,771
you've not got enough of that time of day yet. It allows you to make an intentional decision as a

194
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,072
player.

195
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:10,056
They also gave the many characters habits and routines, constructing plots as you progressed,

196
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:15,541
whether or not you'd found the first or second conversation added to the sense of this pre-existing,

197
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,644
alive story world in which you are not the only protagonist,

198
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,947
which was one of the core values of the storytelling.

199
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,630
And the slice-of-life aspect of the soap opera genre.

200
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,644
I was able to serve that by interweaving lots of plot lines and allowing the player to discover

201
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:39,110
histories and participate in different dramas, past and present, and to work that into this

202
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:44,494
ensemble cast to use it to develop them as characters because there's not room in the

203
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:49,318
A-plot for everyone to have meaningful journeys, but in this way the player gets to choose who

204
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:53,281
they like and who they're interested in and to try and intersect with them in most times a day

205
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:54,242
and see how they're doing.

206
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:59,740
It's still player choice, but it's choice through exploration rather than branching pathways.

207
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,923
So this allowed me to build this drama-driven, domestic life characteristic,

208
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,345
which is very much aligned with the soap opera genre.

209
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:13,348
And that soap opera setting of personal dramas and everyday routines,

210
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:17,190
and the choice that I made to draw characters who are very naturalistic,

211
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,552
contrasting with the fantasy setting,

212
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:25,587
I hope that it gave weight to this mutant world that otherwise could have come across as a little bit glib.

213
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:30,571
There were some really big themes in the plot as it was originally presented to me,

214
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:39,157
including the trauma of losing your kids, of being betrayed, of death,

215
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:43,981
and it was very much hanging over the community from all of these past events

216
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,502
which are described to me when I joined the team as a writer.

217
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:49,505
Multiple Middles style storytelling.

218
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:55,225
allowed me to build characterisations which were rich and complex, meaning that the full

219
00:15:55,306 --> 00:16:00,430
ensemble cast felt real and part of the texture of the place, and it gave me room to explore those

220
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:06,275
themes more delicately, more carefully and more naturalistically in a way that did them justice,

221
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:12,220
I hope. And I also worked carefully in the dialogue to imbue each character with a distinct voice,

222
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,582
from cadence, idioms, style and manner of speech, all of those things.

223
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,638
My playwright training very much came in there.

224
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:24,163
The idiom is that you should be able to cover the lines,

225
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,245
the names of every person in a script

226
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,986
and just looking at the way that they talk,

227
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:29,207
tell who they are.

228
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:32,771
I very much used that naturalistic dialogue style approach

229
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,412
to the way that people talked.

230
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:37,795
Again, building characterization, building nuance

231
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:40,517
and building journeys that I hope feel real

232
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:42,179
and rewarding to dig down into.

233
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:49,358
So in being transparent about time and combining this with the freedom to explore Nils's wonderful

234
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:55,320
environment, I hope that the narrative design was able to reflect this theme of this closeness to

235
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,842
nature which was part of the original brief and also build in the main piece of mechanical gameplay,

236
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:05,764
the magical musical gardens so beautifully composed musically and programmatically

237
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:08,125
respectively by Alessandro Coronas and Doug Wilson.

238
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,160
I made narrative decisions that focused on the characters as complex, rich and a little

239
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,962
bit different for the smallness of their community.

240
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:20,225
I wanted getting to know them to feel like coming across a number of new plants you've

241
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:25,168
never seen before, tending to them, watching them grow and allowing them to surprise you.

242
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:29,431
I set out to build a narrative design that would allow the player to choose their own

243
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:34,494
pace, to push at this central plot if they wanted to, but also to meander and wander

244
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,395
and grow their story at their own pace.

245
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,222
because the themes of the story are tough.

246
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:43,284
It deals with trauma, colonialism, infidelity,

247
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:46,926
aging, illness, but actually when you read reviews

248
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:49,207
of the game or people just talking about it,

249
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,749
they often characterize it as gentle.

250
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:55,371
And I think it's because of that multiple middles approach

251
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,013
to the storytelling, which gives you the opportunity

252
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,954
to pace your own experience,

253
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:02,535
your own journey through the story.

254
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:11,105
So when I talk about multiple models, what I mean is exploration focused, lateral narrative design,

255
00:18:11,505 --> 00:18:17,628
which opens up a community of characters rather than linear choice and consequence style storytelling,

256
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:23,191
which focuses only really on that hero's journey and how their weight of agency affects the world.

257
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:29,494
That's a perfectly acceptable way to tell a story, but it's not the way that was going to

258
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:34,377
be best useful in telling this particular story, which I was given a brief of telling.

259
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:41,114
So in this context it enabled me to build characters that had routines and habits in

260
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:46,536
the physical space of the game and that made exploration easier because you sort of knew

261
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:53,879
where people were going to be. I also worked to allow you to choose which characters or subplots

262
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:58,701
you're more interested in, allowing you to find the natural ebb and flow of different times of day

263
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:04,543
and altogether giving you more of a sense of natural pacing of really existing in this world.

264
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:09,915
It was quieter in the evenings when everyone had gone to bed, for example, or some characters

265
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:12,316
were always up early and some didn't get up until later.

266
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:15,877
These things really gives a universal sense of place.

267
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:22,699
I also worked really hard in the narrative design to be transparent around time, really

268
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:30,041
giving the player a sense of control and agency around their own pacing, and that was key

269
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:33,902
to really enabling multiple middles and making it feel rewarding.

270
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:40,281
So that enables characters to feel like they're living full and well-rounded lives,

271
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:47,284
and that the player's presence in the world feels situated and grounded in the context of a quite

272
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:54,528
fantastical setting. This enabled me to talk more effectively about community as well, because the

273
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,490
community was not there to serve the player's journey, rather the player was being rewarded

274
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,051
for exploring and listening to it.

275
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:04,603
tending to the story rather than applying pressure to it.

276
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:08,724
To take general principles from this talk, like as an author

277
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:13,585
of what I learned and what I think people could learn more generally,

278
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:16,986
I'd like to advocate for the consideration of

279
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,967
player agency as a quality and not a virtue

280
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:23,188
of writing for games and of storytelling in games.

281
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:28,229
Restricting agency can be a useful tool in helping you tell your story more

282
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,150
effectively, more intuitively.

283
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:32,233
and in a manner which allows you to explore

284
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,155
maybe more complicated themes more sensitively.

285
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:37,596
Multiple middles, as I've described it here,

286
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:40,958
style design allows for player agency through exploration

287
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:43,299
rather than changing outcomes.

288
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:47,121
And I think that this is a thing that you develop over time

289
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:50,422
is a sense as someone, as you develop your craft

290
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:51,823
as a narrative designer and a writer,

291
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:57,326
you start understanding that genres don't have virtues

292
00:20:57,776 --> 00:21:00,238
They have qualities, the same with form,

293
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:03,701
and the same with this structure of player interaction.

294
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:07,284
They are all tools with which we need to really consider

295
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,626
what will serve our story best.

296
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,968
One of the most meaningful dialogue options

297
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:17,212
I offer in mutazione is often the option, stay quiet.

298
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:20,014
When someone is talking to you of their grief,

299
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:22,396
or their sorrow, or their regrets,

300
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,259
sometimes the most powerful act is not to act, but to listen.

301
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,868
we can build narrative design that supports the telling

302
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:33,169
of that kind of act of listening.

303
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,490
And multiple middles is how I personally attempted it.

304
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:39,911
Thanks very much for listening.

305
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:42,792
And I know that we're all doing this virtually,

306
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:46,853
so I'm really stoked to watch the other contributors

307
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:49,654
to the panel's videos on all of their expertise

308
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,735
and what they've learned from what they've been working on.

309
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:53,656
Thanks very much for listening to me.

310
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:54,436
Take care.
