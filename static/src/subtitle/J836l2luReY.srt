1
00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:11,619
Are we good? Can you hear me? Am I on? Bueller? Bueller? Okay.

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,881
Good day. How do you do, fellow kids?

3
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:23,844
Thank you so much for coming to these Life is Strange, the Blue Age of Storytelling.

4
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:29,307
I feel like my voice is a little extra crispy loud, but that's just my paranoia and nervousness.

5
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:34,390
Thank you for coming to this panel on Life is Strange, what I call the Blue Age of Storytelling.

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,833
My name is Christian Devine. I was the head writer for the game Life is Strange

7
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:43,316
published by Square Enix and produced by the amazing Dontnod Entertainment.

8
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:48,459
I'm giving myself a few get out of UM jail free cards.

9
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,982
So that's just, if you hear an UM, it just means I passed off one of those cards.

10
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:54,063
Um...

11
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:58,826
So let's start, let's start from the beginning.

12
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:01,028
And, uh...

13
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:11,193
Because we're talking about a narrative and dramatic structure, the talk is going to be basically broken down into three acts.

14
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:12,754
Act one is the...

15
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:17,059
Intro where I'll talk about myself, background, how I came to work for Life is Strange.

16
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,961
Act two we're going to go into an actual anatomy of the scene.

17
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:25,144
We're going to take a major scene from Life is Strange and analyze it and show the levels

18
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:31,488
of writing and design and POV that went into it and maybe how all these different characters

19
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:36,111
choreographed creates a really strong emotional scene and a strong narrative scene.

20
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:39,862
And the final act is called the Feel Simulator.

21
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:43,543
And we'll talk a bit about the emotional response to Life is Strange.

22
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:48,424
And the unexpected to us emotional response, even though that's what we hoped for.

23
00:01:49,264 --> 00:01:52,665
And how maybe we did that and maybe how we didn't do that.

24
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:59,187
And so, first off, my dad was, I'll start from the background.

25
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:02,682
This is G-Force, gotcha man.

26
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,305
No, I love these pants here because they're so 70s.

27
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:07,086
It's hilarious.

28
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,968
That's me on the far right.

29
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,031
My dad was in the military, so I'm what's known in America

30
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,713
as a military brat, meaning we moved around constantly

31
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,155
because my dad served in Vietnam.

32
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:22,549
And when he was in Vietnam, we were just at different bases.

33
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,571
I was born in New York, so we'd go from New York to Florida to South Carolina, Wyoming,

34
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:29,171
Columbus, all over Monterey.

35
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:34,794
I was born with one hand, what the doctors at the time called a congenital birth defect.

36
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:35,554
There's no real...

37
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:42,368
Reason or explanation, I don't ask for any sympathy or even barely empathy.

38
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:48,091
Because of course, everybody knows us, everybody's got their own shell on their back.

39
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:51,433
Either it's an exterior shell or it's an interior shell.

40
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,654
And we all carry the shell with us.

41
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:56,156
And mine just happens to be exterior.

42
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:59,778
And early on, I learned that I was different.

43
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:04,560
And I learned early on that I had to be smarter and better.

44
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:08,609
prepared to deal with society because they're always going to be like,

45
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,752
oh, oh, poor baby, oh, you can't do this, oh.

46
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,653
I can do everything but juggle.

47
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,955
And fortunately, it just does not come up.

48
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:18,697
And since Donald Trump is not going to become president,

49
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:20,338
I don't have to worry about juggling.

50
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,000
Just letting you know as an ambassador from America.

51
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,364
And one of the most important things I learned very early on,

52
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:31,266
my brother Scott was a big influence on me because he was a few years older

53
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:34,809
and I was always the, where you going, where you going, where you going,

54
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:35,450
which he loved.

55
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:41,296
But he was the cultural influence on me and so he exposed me to all the cool cultural

56
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:43,758
things that I needed to be exposed to as a kid.

57
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:50,461
And Bruce Lee was one of my early heroes and Bruce Lee's quote, one of my favorite quotes

58
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,202
is make your disadvantage your advantage.

59
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,443
And that's what I learned early on about my arm.

60
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:58,499
you know you you use whatever you have it if it's not

61
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,783
perfect take that and try to apply it

62
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:06,910
to in the system and make it work for example I will use Life is Strange an

63
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:07,371
example

64
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,697
Life is Strange obviously was not a triple-a game didn't have the big budget

65
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,071
but it's very lo-fi and so instead of trying to compete

66
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:17,994
with massive photo realism and incredible graphics

67
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:23,199
they use a totally different art style, a painterly, very beautiful, handcrafted art

68
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:23,559
style

69
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,444
and it's a lo-fi aesthetic but it works and it fits the aesthetic of the

70
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:28,764
game

71
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:29,865
and I think in

72
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:33,629
what's going on right now in gaming is that

73
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:37,355
you're gonna have all these new areas of aesthetic coming in

74
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,695
because it's a very young industry.

75
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:40,896
We're very, it's 30 years old when you look at it.

76
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:43,117
And if you compare that to the film industry

77
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,038
or literature, anything,

78
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,639
you can see what a very small timeline that is.

79
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:50,160
And so, but the acceleration is very rapid of technology.

80
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,081
And I think technologically we're there.

81
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,882
I mean, games, I mean, VR is the next thing,

82
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:56,983
but boy, graphically to go from Pong to WoW

83
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,285
is pretty incredible in only a 30 year period.

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,602
So this is a map of Rockland, California.

85
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:05,702
It's pure suburbia.

86
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,642
Oh, wait a minute.

87
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:09,083
That's actually the back cover of the Rush album, Signals.

88
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:13,725
Because the song Subdivisions was a defining album in my life

89
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:16,866
because one of the lines of the song Subdivisions is,

90
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,787
nowhere is the misfit or the dreamer more alone.

91
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:23,989
And that's a feeling that every artist has, or anybody who wants to go beyond feels.

92
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,090
So culturally, I consider myself a media baby.

93
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,991
And I sponged up everything as a kid.

94
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:35,553
I was a huge Godzilla fan, a huge monster movie fan.

95
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:37,233
When I was a kid, I wanted to be an animator.

96
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:40,795
Ray Harryhausen was one of my heroes, so I dreamed of being a stop-motion animator.

97
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:44,797
And I did a lot of stop motion, but I realized, boy, you really need a lot of discipline.

98
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:49,420
And it's not a field that there's a huge amount of people that I can succeed in.

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,721
And I moved on to drawing and art.

100
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:55,483
Jack Kirby is my new god in terms of artist.

101
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,244
And you can see Kirby's work today.

102
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,626
I mean, the Marvel Universe all came from Jack Kirby.

103
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:02,567
Stan Lee did write it, but Jack Kirby created everything.

104
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:07,230
And the power of that mythos and the power of that myth-making, you know, really influenced me.

105
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,816
Early on my brother gave me Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury that changed my life

106
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,800
I love Bradbury's writing because I was never into hard

107
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,489
I read the hard science fiction, but I was never I didn't really care about how the rocket ship worked and neither did Ray Bradbury

108
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,952
He was like they get in a rocket ship. They fly to Mars

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,981
That's it. That's the science of Ray Bradbury.

110
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:31,164
So there was a poetry to his fantasy, but his bent was more social issues and

111
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:36,388
how people deal with the future with their own morality.

112
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:39,590
Dandelion Wine, romantic, October country,

113
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,652
the darkness of the melancholy of October

114
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:44,913
that Bradbury is so beautiful at.

115
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:49,116
And growing up, Judy Blume was a huge influence on me.

116
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:51,357
She's a very, do you know who Judy Blume is out there?

117
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:55,418
She's the most famous young adult author in America

118
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:56,759
all up until recently.

119
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:57,739
She's still famous.

120
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,600
And she's the first young adult author

121
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,922
to actually present issues of bullying

122
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:06,003
and what you go through, puberty,

123
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:07,524
and in an honest way.

124
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:08,804
Her books are very controversial.

125
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:09,665
They're often banned.

126
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:13,266
Blubber was a very successful, very controversial book

127
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:13,626
about a.

128
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,847
a young girl who's picked on enormously because of her weight.

129
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:18,848
It's an incredibly cruel, mean book.

130
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,448
Not because she's cruel and mean,

131
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:21,769
because kids are cruel and mean.

132
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:22,749
And she just...

133
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:25,790
We love these books because these were our classmates.

134
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,171
And when I was 10 years old,

135
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:31,032
I saw this movie called Star Wars.

136
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:32,752
And Star Wars...

137
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:34,533
You know, I hate to say, yeah, it changed my life,

138
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:35,733
but yeah, Star Wars changed my life.

139
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:41,796
Because when I sat in that theater and the Star Destroyer went overhead, the entire audience cheered.

140
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:46,180
Now one thing we don't quite have anymore in movies is this communal feeling.

141
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,126
Yes, people applaud and they laugh and they cheer, but Star Wars brought back this immense audience involvement.

142
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,689
So the entire time people are cheering and laughing.

143
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:56,650
and literally almost standing on their seat.

144
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,691
And I don't think anybody today can quite imagine

145
00:07:58,891 --> 00:07:59,651
that response.

146
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,972
And it was a very typical audience response.

147
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:04,553
So the moment that Luke Skywalker goes out

148
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,474
and looks out the binary sunset,

149
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:08,755
that is a brilliant myth-making moment.

150
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:11,176
Lucas didn't even really know what he was doing

151
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:13,237
in that moment, because that's the moment that he's saying

152
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:15,718
to every dreamer, every artist that's looking out there,

153
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:16,959
like, where is my place?

154
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:17,559
Where am I going?

155
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,837
And I at that point I said I'm going somewhere. I want to be an artist and I'm heading out towards that future

156
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,873
Now one of my other heroes is Jean Cocteau, who's a French artist, very famous French artist.

157
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:34,836
And he always said that art is a marriage of the unconscious and the conscious.

158
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:37,919
Meaning that when you're creating art, you need to be relying...

159
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,881
You can't be analytical because you just won't get far.

160
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,422
And that's why most people stop writing.

161
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:44,223
They're like, oh, well I was writing but I had to...

162
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,605
I keep editing, which is what I started doing.

163
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,547
But no, you have to let the shit out.

164
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:49,547
You cannot edit it.

165
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:51,449
You wait till afterwards to be analytical.

166
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,475
So you have to be really pure about that.

167
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,736
And my influences are so great.

168
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,697
And when I'm talking about the blue age of storytelling,

169
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:03,838
I'm kind of talking about a cultural change that we had.

170
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:09,719
I was a huge anime fan, obviously Gatchman, big influence, Captain Harlock.

171
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,920
And of course, satire, Mad Magazine.

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,221
For me, Mad Magazine taught me very early on not to trust anything I saw.

173
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,581
And I still don't. It's just how I am.

174
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:23,825
you know that there's a lot of manipulation going and I'm very

175
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:27,490
also as a writer I'm very aware of how things work a bit so I'm very like

176
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,776
I make sure that I'm I'm checking everything. Of course

177
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:35,020
you know I became a huge fan of Monster magazines

178
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,021
H.R. Giger

179
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,985
All these weird influences really created me.

180
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:43,708
Fantasy books, Conan and heavy metal when I started hitting puberty.

181
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:46,971
I'm like, oh, oh, there's some naked bodies in here and violence.

182
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:47,351
Cool.

183
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:49,313
And I also grew up with John Romero.

184
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,255
He was my best friend since 10 years old.

185
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:52,676
And we were.

186
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:57,117
a couple of really mean kids in terms of what we were doing artistically

187
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:58,577
because we start breaking the rules.

188
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:01,798
And National Lampoon Magazine broke all these scary rules.

189
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,199
And this is a page from a story called Boy's Wrath by John Hughes

190
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:08,019
who later created Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles.

191
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,400
But before he was John Hughes, he was writing the most merciless,

192
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,741
terrifying stories about suburban youth.

193
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:16,781
And we kind of all intook that.

194
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:20,104
Ian Fleming, James Bond, huge influence on me.

195
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:22,347
And then, of course, games.

196
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:24,549
Monopoly, for some reason, I was obsessed with as a kid.

197
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:25,330
I don't know why.

198
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,773
I always wanted Baltic Avenue and Mediterranean.

199
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:31,557
I would get hotels on there and go bankrupt within, you know, two plays.

200
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,440
And Donkey Kong really changed my life.

201
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,581
A, I love the name Donkey Kong.

202
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:40,502
It's the two weirdest words put together ever and it fits perfectly.

203
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:43,283
And me and John would spend hours in the arcade.

204
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:45,084
I'd turn the Donkey Kong machine over

205
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:48,305
and I was instantly always huge in arcade games

206
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,626
and always attracted to the visual and even the narrative qualities.

207
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,566
Like, oh, come on, Mario, get up there, get up there.

208
00:10:54,868 --> 00:11:01,272
And then, when I was about 12, I started reading about Dungeons & Dragons and fantasy magazines

209
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:05,775
and the back of counterculture magazines, and I didn't know, wow, this is like a board game,

210
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:10,498
but you get to have narrative, you get to talk and have dialogue and essay characters.

211
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,742
And so Dungeons & Dragons is the biggest storytelling influence on me, and it really taught me...

212
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:19,427
story in a way because when you're sitting at the table you have to

213
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:22,491
really come up with things because it's all built around

214
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,216
players decisions and you don't know what you may have a map you may have a guy

215
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,078
but you don't know what the players are going to do so

216
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:32,324
it really taught me to think about story and narrative and then I could a say all

217
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:33,626
the roles of the characters and

218
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:38,912
It was just a huge influence on me, and even games like Car Wars by Steve Jackson, which I totally adore.

219
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:42,095
This is not a picture of me and my friends, but it sure could be.

220
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:46,700
It's pretty much the archetypal picture of all the kids, you know, playing D&D in the day.

221
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,463
And as a writer, I started...

222
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:51,885
The first script I ever read was Alien.

223
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:53,726
And this is the scene right here.

224
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,828
This is the original description of the alien coming out of Kane's chest.

225
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,830
And I absolutely was fascinated by the writing style.

226
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,191
If you look at it, it's dot, dot, dot, dot.

227
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:06,132
And Walter Hill rewrote Dan O'Bannon's script.

228
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:09,414
And Walter Hill, who wrote The Warriors and Forty Hours and a lot of films,

229
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,975
he had a really amazing screenwriting style.

230
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,036
It's kind of like a haiku.

231
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:18,779
and just a red stain, then a smear of blood blossoms, the fabric of his shirt is ripped open, the crew shouts in panic.

232
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:20,820
You know, it's just, bop bop bop bop.

233
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,761
And Ridley Scott read the script in half an hour.

234
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:27,044
He wanted to do it immediately just because of the way the script was written, so that was a big influence.

235
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:29,445
And of course Stephen King, when I read The Shining...

236
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:34,326
blew me away and terrified me and I was a huge Stephen King fan

237
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:35,827
and I read everything.

238
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:41,408
Harlan Ellison taught me how to question and stand up for myself as a kid

239
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:42,668
because he's a very famous writer.

240
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:44,989
Harlan Ellison wrote the most famous episode of Star Trek,

241
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,069
the original Star Trek called The City on the Edge of Forever,

242
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,570
which is referenced in Life is Strange, of course.

243
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,670
Kirk has to go back in time and he falls in love.

244
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,971
In order to change time, he has to let the woman he loves die.

245
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:59,692
So it's the best episode of Star Trek and it's my favorite.

246
00:12:59,712 --> 00:12:59,992
you

247
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:08,041
Ignore Ayn Rand's politics, but her writing to me was amazing and her writing style changed my life because she had a really beautiful way of

248
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,245
encapsulating ideas and emotion and

249
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:14,195
in a way that I never read anybody do before.

250
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,756
And I highly advise you, if you're interested in just dialogue,

251
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:17,716
just to read her dialogue.

252
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:18,957
Ignore her politics.

253
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,617
But just read what she's writing,

254
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:23,078
because it's truly amazing writing.

255
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,199
William Gibson, huge fan,

256
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,500
because he was the first person to predict the cyberspace,

257
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,720
where we're at now.

258
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:34,345
It's an amazing achievement.

259
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:38,409
My first published, the first time I was ever published in a magazine was Fangoria.

260
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,512
The first time the Evil Dead was ever mentioned in any media.

261
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:45,656
So I'm very proud that my, it was for a Draw the Thing contest from John Carpenter.

262
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:49,219
So I made it to one of the 100 finalists out of 4,000 entries.

263
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:52,662
And that also said, I said, huh, maybe I have something going on here.

264
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:55,965
Maybe I can, maybe there's a, maybe there's a way for me in this world.

265
00:13:57,707 --> 00:14:04,234
I'm a big fan of Marshall McLuhan talking about the media because the media is somewhat of my subtext.

266
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:09,199
And I believe that a lot of my viewpoints are filtered through what goes on in the media.

267
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:13,023
And I also believe it's the most powerful force in the world outside of politics.

268
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:18,109
It does change and transforms people's lives and it hypnotizes them and inspires them.

269
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,075
And so all of these cultural influences, I always say nothing is wasted.

270
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,859
It doesn't hurt to have every arrow in your quiver.

271
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,062
Don't think anything that you do, like, oh, I'm interested in this, but I'm interested in that.

272
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:36,227
You never know where that one thing that you think is not going to mean anything is going to come up and actually mean something.

273
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:41,293
So let's get a bit to what I call the Blue Age.

274
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:51,300
Now the New Age, it was the term from the 60s and 70s, this holistic movement that was a response against Western kind of imperialism and capitalism,

275
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:00,503
and it led to this holistic spiritual movement in the 70s and 80s, and then strangely enough led to Yanni and record stores.

276
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:05,205
Next to Tangerine Dream, where does not Yanni and Tangerine Dream do not belong together, Brian Eno.

277
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:08,737
I'm a huge, huge ambient instrumental music fan, so...

278
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,338
But, to me, we're moving...

279
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,379
I realized quickly, early on...

280
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,740
I mean, blue is the color of cool.

281
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:18,642
It's the color of monitors.

282
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:19,762
It's the color of the screen.

283
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:23,324
The primary color in Blade Runner is blue.

284
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,006
and the first Apple ad, blue.

285
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:30,288
And I got the first Macintosh

286
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:33,250
and it transformed my writing life instantly

287
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,631
because I was writing on typewriters

288
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,653
and I could write on a typewriter but I did not want to.

289
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:40,175
It took forever and to correct something you had to go into it.

290
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:43,498
So when the computer came along, I was all over this.

291
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:45,539
It changed my writing life and I was like,

292
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,200
okay, I can instantly delete and correct

293
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,382
and I got the first screenwriting software

294
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:50,663
and I started writing.

295
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:53,418
I got the first Sony Handycam.

296
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:56,460
And the night that I actually came up with the phrase,

297
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,381
the Blue Age, I was looking through the lens,

298
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,282
I was having an epiphany,

299
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:04,123
maybe under controlled substances or not, I'm not saying,

300
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,824
but you don't question where epiphanies come from.

301
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,565
But I realized that the future

302
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:10,006
was gonna be through monitors.

303
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,627
And when you walk down the street,

304
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,367
what's the color you see from all the rooms?

305
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:16,349
Blue, blue, blue, light, blue, light, blue, light,

306
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:17,749
people looking down, blue, light, blue, light,

307
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,410
blue, light, blue, light.

308
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,671
So we're moving into this POV of screens and mirrors and reflection and refraction.

309
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:26,733
And by the way, this theory is just theory.

310
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:28,733
Theory is theory. It's not canon.

311
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:32,114
You can say this guy's full of shit and that's okay because it's just a theory.

312
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:36,496
I went to Berkeley, so I was saying this is full of shit about all sorts of theories.

313
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,997
But I love learning them because I do think it adds.

314
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:45,121
When I was 25, that was my 64th Cadillac.

315
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:50,466
I needed to change my life because I knew I wanted to be an artist, but I realized that I wasn't going forward.

316
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:53,248
I wasn't moving in the direction that I needed to move into.

317
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:56,090
And so I went back to school. I changed my life completely.

318
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,332
Moved down to Southern California, enrolled back in school.

319
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:03,049
You know, I thought I had some raw talent, but I had no discipline.

320
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:08,814
And I won, I entered it, but the first writing thing I ever entered was a national play contest.

321
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:12,436
And I ended up being one of the 100 finalists out of 5,000 people.

322
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:15,819
And that was literally the sign that I was looking for from the universe, like,

323
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:19,002
okay, I'm, I'm, maybe, maybe this will happen.

324
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:23,567
When I went back to school, it was wonderful. I had great teachers, they inspired me, and they taught me.

325
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:27,131
The best thing I learned about school is the platonic knowledge, is know when you don't know.

326
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:31,697
And I use that rule to this day. Just know when you don't know. It's okay to not know.

327
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,101
There's nothing wrong with that. You'll learn, or you'll figure it out, or you won't. It's okay.

328
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,363
And then, while I was at Berkeley...

329
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:44,046
John Romero, who had already of course become John Romero through Doom, called me up and

330
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,729
said the magic words, hey do you want to come write for my new game?

331
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:49,992
And I said, let me think about it, I'll think about it.

332
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:54,176
And then my apartment burned down and I was in Texas a week later.

333
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:55,757
So life worked out.

334
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,640
We can talk about die katana and ion storm on another lecture

335
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,283
That's a whole other story, but it was an amazing experience

336
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:07,346
I learned a lot about game development working with the team and also

337
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:12,509
it was a very early indicator because the online world was still very early in of how

338
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,973
Very toxic the online world could be when it didn't like something and I never forgot that moment

339
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,454
I still have not forgot that moment

340
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,105
And then at a certain point, Hollywood came a-calling for my scripts, and so I moved to Los Angeles

341
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:30,330
and started selling scripts and optioning scripts and writing for games

342
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,552
and writing for everybody who wanted me to write for them.

343
00:18:32,873 --> 00:18:36,877
And it was wonderful because you're working through this entire system.

344
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:41,241
And this is one of my... Every screenwriter has the dream of being in a variety.

345
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,764
And when I optioned my script, 18 Will Butterfly...

346
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,966
Evan Rachel Wood signed on board to play the lead.

347
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:53,849
And Michael Polish, a director, who happened to go to my same high school in Rockland along with John,

348
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:56,710
ended up attaching himself as a director.

349
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,472
So, from there, I've been thinking, like, God, I really want to get back into games.

350
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:05,074
I've been missing... I kind of left the game world in a way because I thought, like,

351
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,995
it was a little bit stagnant and it needed new blood.

352
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:10,696
It also needed to go through growing pains. It was a little bit too...

353
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:14,199
it was just a little bit too boyish, let's put it that way.

354
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,701
And I was waiting for that changeover to come,

355
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,403
and then when my friend David Calbo, a French writer,

356
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:22,165
who is my... it's always good to have a French cheerleader,

357
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:25,427
he had heard they were looking for a writer for this new game,

358
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,368
and so he recommended me.

359
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:32,332
And I ended up connecting with Michelle, the co-director.

360
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:37,577
and they sent over the menu and some clips from the game.

361
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:39,499
And this is the first thing I saw from Life is Strange,

362
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:42,162
with the menu moving and that little piece of music.

363
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,703
And I knew immediately. I knew immediately.

364
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:46,886
I said, this is awesome. I get it. I get it.

365
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,388
I don't even know what the game's about.

366
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,790
I get what they're doing. I get the tone they're going for.

367
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:55,493
And Brenda Romero, who on the faculty invited me to speak here today,

368
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,695
she said, well you should, you know, for your test, because every game company

369
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:01,777
gives you a test usually, and the tests are not always

370
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:05,700
indicative of what you can do as a writer. It's like, describe the scepter.

371
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,023
Okay. There's only so many ways you can describe a scepter.

372
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,993
But for Twine, anybody using Twine at all?

373
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,494
I highly recommend it.

374
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:18,756
Just in terms of building story blocks.

375
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,537
And when I started using it, I was like, wow,

376
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:23,579
this is like narrative Legos.

377
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,081
What a great phrase, narrative Legos.

378
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:27,062
I was so proud of myself when I watched a GDC lecture

379
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:29,003
with Ken Levine talking about narrative Legos

380
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:29,984
from like two years earlier.

381
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:31,445
That's OK, great minds.

382
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:35,188
And so you can see, this is the branching dialogue

383
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:36,209
of the Twine.

384
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:42,391
and you can see the level, how detailed and how many it goes up.

385
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,432
And that's part of the problem with branching dialogue for people is

386
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:48,636
you have to think not only just one linear, you have to think of all the tangents

387
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:50,878
and that's a trick for some writers.

388
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:54,060
And that's why a lot of screenwriters don't really do well in games

389
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,123
because they don't quite understand the concept of branching dialogue and how to do it.

390
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:01,786
But you can see you just, you know, you can see you keep moving in

391
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:04,268
and it's, you're able to go to...

392
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:10,115
One here and one here and this is the very first mention of the word Hella.

393
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:12,477
This is for the test that I gave them.

394
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:17,201
And they were sold on the word Hella.

395
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:20,364
So I had a Skype interview.

396
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:22,165
They loved what I did for the test.

397
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:23,726
The test was totally not like a test.

398
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:25,568
It simply felt like it was made for me.

399
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:29,391
And then two weeks after I took it, I was in Paris.

400
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,352
And Paris was wonderful.

401
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:36,035
And what's even more amazing, to show you the curve of life,

402
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:40,018
how strange it is, is that this is Rue Emond,

403
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:41,439
say this for me please.

404
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,201
Merci.

405
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:47,623
Who happened to be Jean Cocteau's lover

406
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:48,864
and one of his mentors.

407
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:51,946
So the fact that I was actually working on this street,

408
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:54,428
I just felt like there's no accidents.

409
00:21:55,876 --> 00:22:00,042
And this is just a glimpse of us doing some voice recording in the studio.

410
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:05,768
This is me letting me, I bugged them, I begged them to let me do a cameo voice

411
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:09,308
because even though I'm not an actor, I love to ham it up sometimes.

412
00:22:09,368 --> 00:22:13,969
So they let me say the part of Trust Limbo, the radio talk show host.

413
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,790
Does everyone remember that fantastic scene with Trust Limbo?

414
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,731
Okay, yeah, I thought so.

415
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:23,531
It's right before Nathan has his amazing message.

416
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:27,852
But it was really, it's a great experience because you get to learn once again.

417
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:28,893
Everybody should learn how.

418
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:32,916
voice actors work if you're a writer you need to know you need to be writing for

419
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,557
actors and you need to think about actors and

420
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:37,940
you need to have respect for actors because it's it's an incredibly hard job

421
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:44,006
my very last day in paris after writing life is strange for tears i had to take

422
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:47,729
that famous one last shot in the rain it was sad i

423
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:52,153
was crying i was feeling i had the feels and the game the first episode had

424
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:54,796
already dropped and the first night the first episode dropped

425
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:01,561
Of course I sat down, I was visiting actually my hometown in Rockland where I grew up and I was by myself

426
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:06,163
and I realized like, oh shit, the entire world is about to judge me.

427
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,884
And it's kind of a scary feeling.

428
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:13,806
And then when I started watching it, I just was like, you know, you're watching the Twitches, the Twitch streams

429
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:15,206
and I was...

430
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:18,447
and I could tell by about 10 o'clock that night, I...

431
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:21,629
this is not ego by the way, this is just me saying, I just said,

432
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:22,709
I think it's...

433
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:28,024
And I just felt really good because I could see people responding to it.

434
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:31,547
Even the people, you know, and of course there are people that were responding to it negatively.

435
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:36,871
So the first night I'm watching the chat stream, one of the comments is,

436
00:23:36,891 --> 00:23:40,114
I wish I could go back in time and give the writer's mom an abortion.

437
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,316
Now, you could say that is darkly funny, and I probably would.

438
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,377
It's... I can handle it.

439
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:49,578
But who does that? Who says that? Why do they do that?

440
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:52,699
And it made me think, because the point of Life is Strange

441
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:55,600
is also how the social media bullying affects young people.

442
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,661
And I... of course it would. It's terrible to have to deal with that.

443
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:01,802
And the scope that young people today have to deal with this,

444
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:05,403
you know, it's very powerful, and it's psychologically very damaging.

445
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:09,545
So I was really proud that the game was able to impress upon people,

446
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:12,766
and we were able to move forward in terms of storytelling,

447
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:17,308
and deal with these issues, you know, abortion and suicide,

448
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:21,150
and, you know, just making, busting your friend for weed,

449
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,091
these moral decisions that the game forced you to make.

450
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:28,473
It was just taking games in a direction that I was just always excited to go for,

451
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:30,654
and I was so happy and so humbled that...

452
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:37,440
the fandom and the critical acclaim came next and it was just a really you don't always get that you

453
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,025
don't get that very much and so you're happy if you if you get it at all and we were all overjoyed

454
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:47,430
to get it you know i said early on i really hope we're gonna get some BAFTAs we got uh five BAFTA

455
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:53,456
nominations and we won for story and just getting the awards is fantastic it's just it's just

456
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:55,758
approbation from the community and the fandom

457
00:24:56,634 --> 00:25:01,237
responding to the game and sending us their cosplay and their messages and

458
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:01,998
people saying that

459
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:06,101
I was going to kill myself but I played Life is Strange and I decided not to.

460
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,739
It's powerful, it's powerful.

461
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,400
The fans always blame us for giving them the feels,

462
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,261
but I'm like, no, you give us the feels.

463
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:18,781
That's really what it's all about.

464
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:22,203
And GDC, earliest year we got the Audience Award,

465
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,163
which is really wonderful.

466
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:25,464
And for me, one of the great honors we got

467
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,504
was the Peabody Award.

468
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:29,125
The first Peabody Award for a video game.

469
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,446
The Peabody Award is basically

470
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:33,207
the electronic communication equivalent of the Pulitzer.

471
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,687
Which I kind of said, boy, I really think

472
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:36,708
we should get the Pulitzer.

473
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:38,288
Life is strange.

474
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,630
My ego was not in check at this point.

475
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,392
But we got the Peabody and I got to go to the ceremony and accept it.

476
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:49,097
And it was really wonderful because I got to tell Jon Stewart and Keegan Key about Life is Strange.

477
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:50,158
And they were both shh...

478
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:51,099
Everybody was like,

479
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,060
A video game?

480
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,221
What? Huh? A video game about a Peabody?

481
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:56,483
Like that's really... Huh? A video game?

482
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:59,786
Which shows you the mindset that people have about video games.

483
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:05,969
A couple months ago I got to meet John Carpenter, and he's a huge fan of Don't Nods Remember Me.

484
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:10,450
So I brought a copy of Life is Strange to have him sign for the team and take a photo,

485
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,091
and we talked about Remember Me, and he said he would play Life is Strange.

486
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:21,393
So it just shows you how far I came from this point as a child, just wanting to be involved in media,

487
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,513
to actually being involved.

488
00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:27,374
And the best part of the story is when I went back to school later on,

489
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:29,354
and I was winning some awards for writing,

490
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:30,255
I ended up being a part of the team.

491
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:34,960
what meeting ray bradbury and for a contest i'd one and so they asked to

492
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,581
take a picture for us i said next to a bradbury

493
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:40,162
for some reason he reached out and grab my hand

494
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:41,963
and he squeeze it for the picture

495
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,666
and i really felt like he was blessing me he was saying i'm giving you some

496
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:50,307
energy and i i believe in you know you did it though i just felt so like

497
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:56,610
moved. So that's basically my background and how I came to write for Life is Strange.

498
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:02,232
Let's segue into the clinical part of the discussion, which is anatomy of a scene.

499
00:27:03,052 --> 00:27:06,654
So we're gonna watch a scene here from Life is Strange. It's it's a

500
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:12,496
spoiler alert, by the way. Spoiler. This is not a major spoiler, but so you're okay.

501
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:17,138
But this is a pretty big pivotal scene in the in the third episode.

502
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,700
Hold on, make sure this is okay.

503
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,382
In the third episode, where David Madsen,

504
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:25,204
the overzealous security guard,

505
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:27,025
has come back to his house complaining

506
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:29,567
because two, some punks had broken into the school

507
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:30,128
the night before.

508
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:32,069
Those punks were his stepdaughter, Chloe,

509
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,871
and the lead character, Max,

510
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:35,853
who were looking for clues for the mystery.

511
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,375
So this is a scene where all the characters,

512
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,456
they've been very antagonistic,

513
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:42,358
and this is kind of the pivotal moment

514
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:44,680
where Max gets to finally confront David

515
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,661
for being an asshole.

516
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:51,563
And what I love about the game is that, yes, David's an asshole, but maybe he's not.

517
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:55,685
And people can decide for themselves how they feel about him or Chloe.

518
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:59,587
So let's watch the scene and we'll discuss the making of it afterwards.

519
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:01,968
Let's hope this works.

520
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:17,088
What happened?

521
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:20,171
Some little shit-ass punks broke into the swimming pool.

522
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:23,815
This is what happens at these PC bullshit colleges.

523
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:26,617
Entitled students taking over the campus.

524
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:30,320
Do you know for sure it was Blackwell students?

525
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:31,742
Who else would do it?

526
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:33,463
And I'm gonna bust them.

527
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:45,639
Figures you'd be here. Is that your Rachel Amber Halloween costume? You know more about her than me

528
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:50,761
No, you and Chloe think you know more than anybody like all teenagers

529
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:55,202
Leave Max alone David stop threatening students

530
00:28:55,382 --> 00:29:00,744
He threatens them with surveillance cameras so he can spy on everybody like he spies on all of us here

531
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:04,525
Don't start Chloe not now

532
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,916
Yeah, I'm just always starting shit, right?

533
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:08,497
You're a total paranoid, David.

534
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,679
Not now, Chloe.

535
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:13,121
You used to call me a loser for getting kicked out of Blackwell.

536
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:14,703
So who's the loser now, David?

537
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,664
Who haven't you accused or harassed?

538
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,106
Between your investigations into Rachel and Kate,

539
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:20,688
what have you done besides get in trouble?

540
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:26,253
We're siding with, uh, Chloe in this one.

541
00:29:32,348 --> 00:29:37,189
You're a bully, David! I saw you harass Kate Marsh when she was going through hell.

542
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,570
You could have totally helped her.

543
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,151
Everybody at Blackwell is a suspect to you, except for Nathan Prescott.

544
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:48,492
That's why the students and faculty don't like you. You even threatened me.

545
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:52,833
I do respect your service, but you don't respect anybody.

546
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:56,313
Uh, you were smoking pot in Chloe's room. That's illegal.

547
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:59,234
So is spying on people in your family and at your work.

548
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:03,454
Why do you have photos of Kate Marsh and Rachel Amber in your files anyway?

549
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:05,895
What? Is this true, Max?

550
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:11,918
Yes, David. Why do you have these files at all? I find this very disturbing.

551
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,560
I do not have to take this kind of interrogation. Not from you punks.

552
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,381
Maybe you should calm down.

553
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:27,584
Oh, you're turning on me now, huh? Of course. Women always stick together. Well, screw you.

554
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:28,325
David.

555
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:32,188
You better go to a hotel until we figure this out.

556
00:30:32,388 --> 00:30:35,530
You can't kick me out of my own home!

557
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:39,754
It's my home, David. Paid for and in my name.

558
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:41,275
You know the law, right?

559
00:30:41,295 --> 00:30:43,937
Oh, I thought I knew a lot of things.

560
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:46,398
Like when I'm outflanked.

561
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,520
Have a nice day.

562
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,483
Chloe, for once, just please shut up.

563
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,538
I hope Joyce doesn't hate me for tearing into David.

564
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:01,600
I don't want to see or hear you again, Max.

565
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,161
You've hurt me and my family enough.

566
00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:28,779
Okay, so, what I love, this is actually my favorite scene in the game, and I have a lot of favorite scenes in the game, and the team is so amazing, I mean, what they put together is so incredible, and I was always, always amazed at the work they were doing, the artist, and the musicians, and the directors, and Michelle and Raul, and everybody just firing on all cylinders, and it's not often you get to work on a team where you really feel like,

567
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:34,102
you're all on the same page, but I really feel like we were all on the same page and

568
00:31:34,682 --> 00:31:35,583
So what I loved about

569
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:38,344
that scene is

570
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:43,728
It's just the it's just that Joyce who I feel like is kind of like the most underrated character in the game in a way

571
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,828
And one of my favorite characters

572
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:49,314
She just doesn't she never really gets the good end of the stick, but she finally gets to tell David

573
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:53,739
What's what I really love that and I love Mac saying to David I respect your service

574
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,242
But you don't respect anybody because David served in the military

575
00:31:56,643 --> 00:32:00,207
And so that's an important point to make that Chloe does understand that David went through hell

576
00:32:00,247 --> 00:32:03,171
and he's seen horrors that she can't comprehend but

577
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,835
David doesn't mean it gives him the right to hold up his hand to his daughter or anybody.

578
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:10,099
And my favorite, probably my favorite article that anybody

579
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:13,303
wrote about Life is Strange was from a lieutenant in Afghanistan

580
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:16,686
and he said that David Mattson is the best veteran character in the history of video games.

581
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,536
Let's take that. I'll take that as a compliment.

582
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:24,698
So, as a writer, what I love doing is entering different POVs.

583
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:27,679
And one of my big writing epiphanies was when I wrote my first script called,

584
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,340
not my first script, but my fourth script called Little Girl Lost.

585
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,881
And it was the first time that I decided to not be Christian Divine.

586
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:35,222
I was always Christian Divine.

587
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:38,063
And I was like, God, I'm kind of bored of being Christian Divine.

588
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,784
I'm tired of hearing myself think and talk the same way.

589
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:43,005
So I thought, let's write from a different point of view.

590
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:44,806
It's two sisters, two females on the run.

591
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:48,168
And as a writer, you do write all sorts of different characters.

592
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:51,672
You know, somebody, you know, I met, I went for a meeting one time

593
00:32:51,732 --> 00:32:53,473
and they said, well, what do you know about writing?

594
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:57,664
you know, female truck driver. I said, well, I probably know as much as J.K. Rowling does

595
00:32:57,724 --> 00:33:02,386
about a boy wizard. You know, I know as much as Shakespeare knows about two lovers in eternal

596
00:33:02,426 --> 00:33:07,728
love. You know, it's a kind of a silly question because when you're writing, you're, it's

597
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:11,329
up to the, I mean, you have to convince the viewer, the reader, the audience that you're

598
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,751
convincing them. So, you know, that's the trick. It doesn't mean you can, you can try it,

599
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:18,652
you can do it. But when you're writing different points of view.

600
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:22,571
you know I put myself in that character's mindset when I'm writing

601
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:28,014
David Madsen I'm like you PC entitled college punks and then on a max I'm like

602
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:32,476
you asshole you don't know anything about the world you know so you you have

603
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:35,137
to be I like to be fair to all the characters and that point of life is

604
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:39,059
strange is in fact this kind of empathy for people to look at what they're going

605
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:42,141
through it doesn't mean you have to say approve of them but you look at what

606
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:42,741
they're going through

607
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:48,763
So, that's just an example of how you kind of, you know, put these characters together

608
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:50,963
and have them, you know, kind of dance around.

609
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:55,684
Let's go on to this section, the Field Simulator.

610
00:33:57,025 --> 00:34:01,666
So probably the most amazing thing about the game for all of us, I can probably say, is

611
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:06,827
just the level of emotional response that the players, you know, gave us.

612
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:10,088
And watching people on Let's Plays and Twitches crying.

613
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:15,799
I mean, we were writing, we were hoping to give them those emotions, but we, it was hard to believe that,

614
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:20,842
I don't think anybody knew that we would tap into this, and I'm not sure, I'm still not sure why,

615
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:25,665
but I think as part of this Blue Age, I think it's because, A, you're, you are involved in Max's

616
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:29,808
personality, you're playing Max, so you're within that world, so of course you, you, there's a

617
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:34,851
bonding there within that screen, there's a bonding going on, so I think that's what, what gives you

618
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,213
this kind of emotional connection to the characters.

619
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:42,938
And so, you know, just once again, just a small example of the outpouring of amazing fan art.

620
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:50,584
And once again, to me, the greatest tribute for Life is Strange for me is when somebody sends me a picture of them drawing a character in class,

621
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:53,727
ignoring the teacher, which is exactly what I did.

622
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:57,831
And John Romero's in front of me coding when I was 15 and I was drawing comics.

623
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:03,696
And they're drawing Helen, Chloe, so she's got a great future ahead of her, I can already see.

624
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:13,585
So for this section I want to quickly go through a couple, some clips just to show you maybe how we layer emotional weight within characters.

625
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:21,813
And they're tangents, they're not necessarily big pivotal emotional scenes, but they're like emotional building blocks and they build up to how you respond to the character.

626
00:35:22,393 --> 00:35:25,116
So this is the introduction of Warren.

627
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:35,976
So you saw that he reached in for the hug there and he didn't get the hug.

628
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:37,017
He got the flash drive.

629
00:35:37,697 --> 00:35:42,338
And originally the script just called for Warren to, you know, lean in and kiss

630
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,300
Max on the cheek, but culturally that's, we don't do that in America so common.

631
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,881
And so based on Warren's kind of cringy clinging character.

632
00:35:51,762 --> 00:35:57,685
you know, I thought it's much funnier to do this go for the hug thing and they just nailed the style of it.

633
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:03,268
So great. But that really, that moment defines Warren for so many people because people are like friendzone.

634
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:05,549
Okay, now we know friendzone.

635
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,431
So, poor Warren.

636
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:11,932
And there is a lot of people that really don't like Warren.

637
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:17,214
And I tend to think some of it is they can certainly not like Warren because of the writing, that's fine.

638
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:25,777
Or in some ways I think Warren reminds some people too much of themselves, you know, a bit, including me.

639
00:36:26,337 --> 00:36:30,139
But it's okay because, you know, Warren's a teenager and that's how teenagers are sometimes.

640
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:36,044
So this is what another section this is what they called it what michelle and raul called the z moments where max would sit down

641
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:39,286
And have these little contemplative moments to think about what's going on

642
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:42,729
The lighthouse looks so mysterious

643
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,472
I wish I could stay in this moment forever

644
00:36:45,492 --> 00:36:48,394
I guess I actually can now

645
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:51,877
But then it wouldn't be a moment

646
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:55,086
I really like that line.

647
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:58,811
I mean, as a writer, you're your worst critic.

648
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:02,174
And trust me, I can read Criticism of Life is Strange.

649
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:03,075
We all do.

650
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:05,018
And so you're your own worst critic.

651
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,980
And you know what works and what doesn't work for you.

652
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,624
And there are moments that you're writing things that you should be happy for and proud of

653
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:11,725
because that's kind of what you're doing.

654
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:12,786
You should like what you're doing.

655
00:37:12,826 --> 00:37:14,909
Hopefully you enjoy whatever you're designing.

656
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:19,211
writing or drawing. Hopefully you do love what you're doing and you and you pat

657
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:22,153
yourself on the back once in a while because the world is not going to that

658
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:25,435
often as an artist. That's just a that's the cautionary and I tell people that.

659
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:28,918
Get ready. You know you better develop a very thick skin if you're gonna be an

660
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:32,680
artist because the world doesn't care. They don't care if you write or draw or

661
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,642
paint or design. They just don't care. You have to make them care. That's your job.

662
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:40,345
And then hopefully they will care. This is another little moment that I really

663
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:40,665
like.

664
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:43,967
Why look! An otter in my water.

665
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,653
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

666
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:47,934
You are so obvious.

667
00:37:48,555 --> 00:37:50,838
And I still get freaked out by that movie, so stop.

668
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:53,201
I can't even watch any of those shark shows.

669
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:57,466
Now in the script, Michelle and Raul really wanted this.

670
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:00,650
This is the last moment between Max and Chloe that's really quiet and bonding.

671
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,272
And Michelle and Raul, the directors...

672
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:05,855
you know, they were very specific about the intent of the scene and what they,

673
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:08,318
and the emotional level they wanted to create.

674
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:12,022
And Michelle was like, you know, we want to have them splashing water, you know.

675
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:15,266
And it's what kids do, everybody does when they jump in the pool.

676
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:18,349
And I thought, you know, every, there's probably not anybody who doesn't jump

677
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,853
into a pool that doesn't start going dun dun dun dun dun dun.

678
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:24,436
I mean, it's just, it's, Jaws might be the most.

679
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,658
recognizable musical theme of all time.

680
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:29,560
There could be an argument made for that.

681
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,002
And it's just a little moment, and then she goes,

682
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:33,964
I'd only even like to watch those shark shows,

683
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:36,986
which is a reference to all these endless shark shows

684
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:39,488
they seem to have on TV in America and I'm sure around the world.

685
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:45,013
So it's just a cultural, you know, part of the layering of Life is Strange emotionally

686
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:46,114
is the cultural references.

687
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:49,076
And just to, it makes people identify.

688
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:50,617
It helps people like, oh, I know that.

689
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:51,277
I see that.

690
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:51,837
I get that.

691
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:53,318
And not to overdo it.

692
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,720
In a way, because Life is Strange is set in art college,

693
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,561
they are purposely overdone,

694
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:00,482
because I went to UC Berkeley,

695
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:01,703
and that's all you do.

696
00:39:01,743 --> 00:39:03,184
You're dropping names all day long.

697
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:04,724
You're talking pop culture, everything.

698
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:10,387
So this clip is a moment in an alternate universe

699
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:12,048
when Chloe is actually in a wheelchair,

700
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:12,949
and she's talking with Max.

701
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:13,169
Max.

702
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,662
Thanks for coming out to see me.

703
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:22,163
You're doing awesome.

704
00:39:22,423 --> 00:39:23,123
I don't think so.

705
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:25,684
My nose is getting cold.

706
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:28,165
Maybe we should get back to my place?

707
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:30,806
It is hella cold out here.

708
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:31,826
Hella?

709
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:34,547
I hate that word. No offense.

710
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,228
None taken.

711
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,530
Nobody says hella.

712
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,771
This is something that comes up in the game.

713
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,072
And part of what I was really excited about writing

714
00:39:57,112 --> 00:39:58,712
Life is Strange for, I'm very familiar with

715
00:39:58,772 --> 00:39:59,673
in Pacific Northwest.

716
00:39:59,713 --> 00:40:01,753
I go up to Oregon, Portland, Seattle all the time,

717
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:02,974
and I'm there all the time.

718
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:04,534
And as a Northern California boy,

719
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:06,515
the word hella is probably one of the most

720
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:08,815
indigenous expressions you'll hear.

721
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:10,736
And it's been around forever and ever.

722
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:13,877
And around 2013, I noticed that young people around me

723
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:14,717
were saying it again.

724
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:15,237
It was so funny.

725
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:16,717
I was like, wow, people are saying hella again.

726
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:17,898
You know, I haven't heard that in a while.

727
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:22,121
And then when Life is Strange came along, I thought, well, this is perfect for Chloe,

728
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:26,125
because what you're trying to do when you're writing characters from a certain region,

729
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:31,029
you can do some research, or if you know, you can put that information in there

730
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:38,135
and develop and give a kind of realism to the characters, or verisimilitude of realism.

731
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:42,058
Little did I know that nobody says hella. I had no idea.

732
00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:46,576
And I found the response interesting because I would see in comments say,

733
00:40:46,716 --> 00:40:48,316
well, yes, nobody says hella.

734
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:52,357
And it's from somebody in London.

735
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:56,278
I would never assume to tell somebody in London, like, nobody says sus.

736
00:40:56,658 --> 00:40:57,278
Nobody says that.

737
00:40:57,598 --> 00:40:58,419
Nobody says brilliant.

738
00:40:58,699 --> 00:40:59,419
You know, I wouldn't know.

739
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:00,419
I could research.

740
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,179
I could find out.

741
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:05,900
But I can't honestly say that I would know how somebody talks elsewhere in the world.

742
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,161
And I certainly don't think teenagers talk in one way.

743
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:08,801
I know they don't.

744
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:09,601
I know they don't.

745
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:12,662
And part of what was fun for writing Life is Strange is to...

746
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:17,143
And, you know, I think the dialogue, whether you like it or you don't,

747
00:41:17,263 --> 00:41:18,423
it's its own... it's different.

748
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:22,584
It's stylistically... it's true to what the game is.

749
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:26,285
And so I think in this new blue age of storytelling,

750
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:28,826
we're going to move towards more and more dialogue that's

751
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:31,587
more and more like films and literature, which has a whole...

752
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:34,107
Nobody talks like they do in Reservoir Dogs.

753
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:37,168
Nobody talks like a Quentin Tarantino character in real life.

754
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:37,508
Nobody.

755
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:41,993
But we love the dialogue because it seems true in some ways, and it's clever.

756
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:47,378
And that's why we go see movies, to see people talking better than we do, or talking in a wittier way than we do.

757
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:51,463
And if we want naturalism, which I love writing that too, then that depends.

758
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:54,226
It's the medium, it's the form follows function.

759
00:41:55,147 --> 00:41:59,972
And so I felt very, very satisfied a year later when...

760
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,514
Somehow Merriam-Webster's dictionary added this word,

761
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:06,515
even though nobody says it.

762
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:08,055
But they do now.

763
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:10,876
And I love the fact that around the world,

764
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:13,377
people are saying hella because of Life is Strange.

765
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:16,277
That's the best revenge possible.

766
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:17,278
There's nothing better than that.

767
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:20,479
And I want to skip this one.

768
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:24,620
Yeah, I'm going to skip that other one because that's a major spoiler

769
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,940
and I actually don't want to give it away.

770
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,521
And we're coming down to the wire here and I do want to take some questions.

771
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,801
So I'm sorry I rushed through all this.

772
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:35,423
So it seemed like when Brenda asked me to speak and she said,

773
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:37,945
you have 45 minutes, I'm like, oh my god, how am I going to fill up that time?

774
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:40,467
And when I was doing it, I'm like, oh, wait a minute.

775
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:42,608
I need two hours just to do this.

776
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:48,412
But so hopefully I've given you just a little insight into what goes into the dialogue writing.

777
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,254
And please, you can contact me on Twitter, online, and talk to me.

778
00:42:51,294 --> 00:42:54,276
I'm always available for questions, and I love answering questions, and I love talking too.

779
00:42:55,257 --> 00:43:02,119
to people. So to sum up briefly, the best gift for me from Life is Strange is not only

780
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:09,682
the satisfaction of it responding with people around the world, it's just seeing people

781
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:13,704
trying to take the high road when they make these choices. They don't make fun of Victoria.

782
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:14,764
They try to get along with her.

783
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:17,910
they want to always take the high road.

784
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:18,930
And I was always shocked,

785
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,650
because I would often take the low road.

786
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,211
And so I was very impressed,

787
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:26,692
and I'm being very genuine here,

788
00:43:26,832 --> 00:43:29,873
is that Life is Strange gives me hope for the future

789
00:43:30,713 --> 00:43:31,893
of young people, it really does.

790
00:43:32,473 --> 00:43:35,434
And people, because I just love seeing people

791
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:38,855
open up emotionally, as I'm trying not to do right now.

792
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:40,595
And many people have told me,

793
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:42,436
and the director of the Peabody said,

794
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,136
you know, Life is Strange is not a game.

795
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:45,596
You know?

796
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:52,998
It's it's a photo. That's not even me. It's another thing. I don't know what what's going on with that

797
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:56,339
Can I could I put that back up there?

798
00:43:59,440 --> 00:43:59,821
Okay

799
00:44:04,062 --> 00:44:07,103
I'm not clicking anything. I'm clicking but nothing's going on

800
00:44:10,885 --> 00:44:13,266
That's fine, you know what it's actually fun because that's the last slide

801
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:19,435
But basically somebody wrote thank you for the game and the experience.

802
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:21,597
And of course it's a game.

803
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:25,122
But the idea that it's so emotionally involving with people

804
00:44:25,222 --> 00:44:29,968
and it seems to take the interactivity of games to this whole other emotional level.

805
00:44:31,347 --> 00:44:36,551
you know, always kind of blew my mind and that to me is the greatest gift of the game.

806
00:44:36,611 --> 00:44:41,554
And when I say the Blue Age, once again, it's just a theory, you know, but I really feel

807
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:47,738
like we're moving towards this era of reflection, refraction, watching, watching, watching,

808
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:48,439
experiencing.

809
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:49,400
I don't know where it's all going.

810
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,721
I'm a writer, so I'm a cautionary writer too.

811
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:54,203
So I never say everything is all good.

812
00:44:54,523 --> 00:44:57,485
I always say there's a flip side to everything and people should be aware of the flip side

813
00:44:57,505 --> 00:44:57,965
to everything.

814
00:44:57,985 --> 00:44:59,346
Because you have to be aware.

815
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:00,287
You have to really be aware.

816
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:08,520
But I'm very aware of the game's success and I'm very grateful for it and I'm really grateful for all you coming today.

817
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:16,064
So, thank you very much for listening and I love answering questions because then I can riff and not have to look down at all this bullshit.

818
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:19,286
So, any questions? Please.

819
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:24,128
I know everybody hates to be the first person. I love the first person to answer. Yeah.

820
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:27,466
I'm not afraid of that.

821
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,349
First of all, let me just put on that I love,

822
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:31,510
absolutely love the game.

823
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,991
It was a fantastic experience.

824
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:33,611
Thank you.

825
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:36,434
But I was getting into the right in the middle of the game.

826
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:39,116
So I think the first two or three episodes have been out

827
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,318
and I was still waiting for the next one, next one.

828
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:44,020
And I felt the fifth one was very different to the rest.

829
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:49,432
It felt more scripted, very slow work, and very little interactive.

830
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:53,914
At the end, it made sense, but did you feel the fifth one was kind of different than the rest?

831
00:45:54,274 --> 00:45:56,834
Well, I mean, there's, you know, people talk about this.

832
00:45:57,214 --> 00:45:59,175
Everything was scripted, I mean, nothing was changed.

833
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:03,076
I mean, everything, when I got the original episodes,

834
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:06,017
Jean-Luc Canot, by the way, wrote the original story for Life is Strange,

835
00:46:06,717 --> 00:46:10,458
a brilliant writer, and that was built into the...

836
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,432
into the story and when Michelle and Raul and the team put it together

837
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:18,475
that fifth episode was that's what it was. It was always two choices, it was

838
00:46:18,515 --> 00:46:22,077
always built around you know these things. Now of course you

839
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:24,879
always wish you had more time and more money to do more things but

840
00:46:25,379 --> 00:46:29,162
what they wanted to do was what was in episode five so I can only speak for

841
00:46:30,303 --> 00:46:33,245
and I and I and it's a it's a different episode because you're kind of wrapping

842
00:46:33,285 --> 00:46:35,627
everything up and you've got to make these amazing decisions so

843
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:39,689
you know that's all I can say is that it's it's it's exactly what the team intended.

844
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:42,811
Thank you for asking that question.

845
00:46:53,354 --> 00:46:53,694
Hello.

846
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:54,254
Hello.

847
00:46:55,255 --> 00:46:58,175
I wanted to know what was the design intention for the anting?

848
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:00,196
One was longer than the other.

849
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:01,856
Was there a preference for one?

850
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:08,846
No, no, I mean seriously, we all thought, you know, there's no canon.

851
00:47:08,986 --> 00:47:10,707
It's the players, it's your choice.

852
00:47:10,988 --> 00:47:12,149
You decide the canon.

853
00:47:12,669 --> 00:47:16,172
And once again, if, you know, one ending is short because that's the way they wanted it.

854
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,634
You know, it's simply the way it worked out.

855
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:21,978
And I, you know, that's it.

856
00:47:22,038 --> 00:47:22,538
That's the end.

857
00:47:22,558 --> 00:47:24,100
All right, thank you.

858
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:24,520
Thank you.

859
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:40,905
Hi. So I love this game and actually I was really amazed by how I really felt that I made a

860
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:47,509
relationship with Chloe. Like I really felt that I had this strong friendship with her.

861
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:56,274
and I want to ask you if you have any advice of how to create this kind of emotional attachment

862
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:01,016
with the, I mean, for games in players.

863
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:03,338
Well, first have every character say hella.

864
00:48:03,618 --> 00:48:05,178
That's the number one thing, just have them say hella.

865
00:48:05,538 --> 00:48:05,918
Obviously.

866
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,060
I mean, like I said, you have to give credit to Jean-Luc Canut who wrote the original story

867
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,800
because their relationship was, you know, built in and

868
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:17,882
and then when the script was handed over to me, the story, to start, you know,

869
00:48:18,242 --> 00:48:20,383
drawing it out and giving it more an American idiom.

870
00:48:21,263 --> 00:48:23,845
You know, I always watched my sister's friends growing up,

871
00:48:23,925 --> 00:48:25,685
and I thought they always had such, you know,

872
00:48:25,846 --> 00:48:27,607
different relationships than my male friends,

873
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,008
who, you know, who we don't, you know,

874
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:32,389
men are expected in America to be a lot more, like,

875
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:35,091
emotionally secluded and not to be like,

876
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:36,531
not to share their emotions.

877
00:48:36,591 --> 00:48:39,953
So I was always envious and jealous of my female friends,

878
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:41,534
my sister's friends, because they could kind of,

879
00:48:42,114 --> 00:48:43,295
I don't know, they could hold hands,

880
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:45,036
they could goof around, and it didn't mean anything.

881
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:46,837
It wasn't a thing, but they seemed to have

882
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,638
this emotional connection.

883
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:49,398
I can't say how.

884
00:48:50,254 --> 00:48:51,876
We do that and I can only speak...

885
00:48:52,357 --> 00:48:54,820
I approach the characters honestly just as characters first.

886
00:48:54,861 --> 00:48:55,582
Who are these people?

887
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:59,567
I try not to look at them as anything else but who is the character?

888
00:48:59,888 --> 00:49:01,410
And then you start from there.

889
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:04,234
And you also treat the characters fairly and objectively,

890
00:49:04,294 --> 00:49:06,357
which means if they do something that's wrong...

891
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,882
Let it you know work that into your story it max is not right to the game

892
00:49:10,902 --> 00:49:16,486
There's tons of moments where max fucks up, and she doesn't always do the right thing, but that's very human

893
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:19,708
That's and I think that's why people respond to the game

894
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:25,532
And I was I was someone expecting people to say well, you know okay dude writing these female characters. You know but

895
00:49:26,324 --> 00:49:31,486
As a writer, once again, your job is to go into all these different worlds and make people believe that.

896
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:33,406
But that's research. I believe strongly in research.

897
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:35,967
But that's what I'm talking about, this cultural layering.

898
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:40,128
Is all these things kind of add, you know, to the characters.

899
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:43,929
Their setting, the environment, the artist, the way they drew the characters tells you so much.

900
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:48,773
about the characters. I mean, immediately you look at Chloe, you know who Chloe is based on her look.

901
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:55,579
You know who Max is somewhat based on her look. So it's not just voice and dialogue, it's how they

902
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:59,803
look, it's in its perception, how they view the world, maybe the kind of music they listen to

903
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:03,146
tells you a lot about a character, their politics, you know, things like that.

904
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,584
I grew up with a military dad and he was not at all like David Matz, not brusque like that,

905
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:11,946
but had certain similarities.

906
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:15,249
But I was not going to write a character that was a typical military asshole.

907
00:50:15,289 --> 00:50:16,490
That's an easy character to write.

908
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,191
I really try to make things not easy.

909
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:19,592
Don't write the easy character.

910
00:50:20,613 --> 00:50:21,874
Don't write the glib character.

911
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:23,355
Write the complicated character.

912
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:24,616
Even if it's just one little line.

913
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:27,458
Every script I write, I give every minor character a name.

914
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:31,021
I never write Man 1, which you see in a lot of scripts.

915
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:31,381
Woman 2.

916
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:31,681
Child 3.

917
00:50:32,522 --> 00:50:32,942
Child 4.

918
00:50:34,149 --> 00:50:37,592
give him a name, give him one moment to have a little beat.

919
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:40,154
And there's, you know, Tarantino does that well.

920
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:42,196
I think Edgar Wright actually does that beautifully

921
00:50:42,236 --> 00:50:42,896
in Shaun of the Dead.

922
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:44,437
That's a great example of a film

923
00:50:44,457 --> 00:50:46,139
where it gives characters you might not like.

924
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,841
I was like, suddenly I was watching Shaun of the Dead,

925
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:49,381
I'm crying.

926
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,022
I'm like, what?

927
00:50:50,582 --> 00:50:52,644
It's, you know, so, you know, things like that.

928
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:54,766
Just always looking for outside of the character

929
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:57,988
and what you can bring in to just give them more weight,

930
00:50:58,129 --> 00:51:00,631
more spiritual weight, more, you know, aesthetic weight.

931
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:02,152
If that helps.

932
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:10,770
It's gonna be a technical question.

933
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:19,857
Was it difficult or very different from other games to work on Life is Strange because of the time mechanic?

934
00:51:20,117 --> 00:51:22,599
Like going back in time to change your things.

935
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:24,700
Was it different from a writing point of view?

936
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:28,103
Well, I mean, in terms of... It means more writing.

937
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:30,925
I mean, there's 13,000 lines in Life is Strange about.

938
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:33,617
and only eight are hella, by the way.

939
00:51:34,517 --> 00:51:36,698
So that's a massive amount of writing,

940
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:39,079
and so much of that is rewriting,

941
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,340
having to write all new dialogue when you go back.

942
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:42,861
And we were all doing this,

943
00:51:42,881 --> 00:51:45,282
we're all learning on the same learning curve, the team,

944
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:46,643
because we'd never done this before,

945
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:48,044
and we'd never made a game like this before.

946
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:51,185
Although, Remember Me had this brilliant memory mix,

947
00:51:51,265 --> 00:51:52,966
is what they pulled into Life is Strange.

948
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:54,947
So, I mean, it was easy in the sense of,

949
00:51:55,907 --> 00:52:01,133
And once I got in the groove of it, I was like, oh yeah, okay, complete opposite, complete opposite,

950
00:52:01,353 --> 00:52:06,019
complete opposite. That really helped because then I knew it, you know, and the team knew,

951
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,744
we all knew like, when we're going to veer off in these two choices, let's really veer off.

952
00:52:11,636 --> 00:52:14,599
into these two choices, even if there's no right choice,

953
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,142
the more opposite you go,

954
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:19,224
the more interesting the writing became

955
00:52:19,324 --> 00:52:23,028
and the more kind of narratively dramatic it became.

956
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:24,810
So yeah, it was difficult, but in the end,

957
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:27,492
it became really second nature to what we were doing.

958
00:52:28,113 --> 00:52:28,714
Thanks for the question.

959
00:52:28,894 --> 00:52:29,494
You have nothing to say?

960
00:52:29,574 --> 00:52:29,715
Okay.

961
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:42,319
Hi, first I'd like to say that I'm just really glad to have experienced the game.

962
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,541
Thank you.

963
00:52:43,922 --> 00:52:46,847
The first feeling I had about it is like, I'm just glad.

964
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:49,231
My question is...

965
00:52:50,672 --> 00:53:01,916
Since, as I understood, you came into the project when a lot of things were already set, like the broad story and everything, did you ever feel limited?

966
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:09,278
Were there any moments where you felt like you want to do things that might not be possible? How did you deal with it? How did the team deal with your wishes?

967
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:12,224
Well I said I'm an American so we do what we want.

968
00:53:12,244 --> 00:53:15,507
So they had to listen to me.

969
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:16,227
It was so...

970
00:53:16,247 --> 00:53:18,489
It was the most freedom I've ever had writing.

971
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:23,254
And like I said, I've never been on a team where everybody was so much on the same page.

972
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:26,036
When I interviewed Michelle and Raul and Luke

973
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:29,039
and they said they wanted the game to be subtle, I was like,

974
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,620
what did you just say?

975
00:53:30,981 --> 00:53:32,022
Did you just say the word subtle?

976
00:53:32,762 --> 00:53:34,504
That is a word you will never hear in Hollywood.

977
00:53:34,827 --> 00:53:39,128
you will never hear maybe... it's very... it's not a word that people like to use because it means

978
00:53:40,028 --> 00:53:44,310
quiet and not obvious and not explosive. So when they said that we want this to be subtle

979
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,411
and then they were saying... they were thinking, well, you know, because this... because Max has got these

980
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:51,232
powers, the game has got to be like... and I said,

981
00:53:51,832 --> 00:53:53,873
like magical realism? And they go, yes!

982
00:53:54,653 --> 00:53:56,614
And I... that's actually when I knew I was going to get the game.

983
00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:03,621
Because magical realism is in a way what the story is about and the experience is about.

984
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:04,902
But no, I always felt like...

985
00:54:05,762 --> 00:54:08,363
I felt... and Michelle would always say,

986
00:54:08,784 --> 00:54:10,485
Feel free to... feel free, feel free.

987
00:54:10,565 --> 00:54:11,485
I heard that more than anything.

988
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:13,806
Feel free, feel free to do this, feel free to do this.

989
00:54:13,846 --> 00:54:14,787
And they really trusted me.

990
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:18,649
Because, you know, I'm bringing a lot of America and they trusted me to do that.

991
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:19,049
So...

992
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:25,872
And there are times when, trust me, there are times when you have debates.

993
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:28,953
And as a writer, you're working for the designers.

994
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:29,793
I mean, that's your job.

995
00:54:30,274 --> 00:54:32,895
They have the vision, and you share the vision,

996
00:54:32,975 --> 00:54:36,276
and you're making sure that you're putting their vision into the game.

997
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:40,658
So I never felt limited because I believed in what they were doing,

998
00:54:40,738 --> 00:54:42,879
and I was very happy to be part of that engine.

999
00:54:44,023 --> 00:54:48,085
The only thing, the big fight we had is, I can't even tell you,

1000
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:51,907
spoiler alert, but fortunately the French do like to debate,

1001
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:54,688
which is fantastic, so do I, but they're not mad debates,

1002
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,789
they're just like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, like, okay.

1003
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:00,770
And then it goes on. So no, I felt amazing freedom,

1004
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,091
so much so that I'm scared for the future.

1005
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:17,742
You mentioned the future. I don't know too much about your career. I haven't played Life is Strange, although it's on my to-do list.

1006
00:55:18,022 --> 00:55:18,483
I hope so.

1007
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:19,704
Oh, I've got it.

1008
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:20,124
Good.

1009
00:55:20,605 --> 00:55:23,667
Limited edition box set. Bought it brand new. First day, still sealed.

1010
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:28,811
But that's not the point. The point is, you said it's how you want to get back into games.

1011
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:31,674
Obviously, Life is Strange was one of your first projects.

1012
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:33,515
What did you learn from your...

1013
00:55:36,428 --> 00:55:42,699
gaming, writing related experience that you can take on board with regards to your future projects?

1014
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,568
And at the same time, what advice would you give to aspiring writers who also want to break into the gaming field?

1015
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:55,495
Well, I guess what I learned from writing Life is Strange is I learned that you can write this kind of game.

1016
00:55:55,695 --> 00:55:57,637
I wanted to write this kind of game in the 90s.

1017
00:55:57,717 --> 00:56:00,319
I wanted to do this kind of... not necessarily exactly this game,

1018
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:06,044
but I wanted to have characters have conversations that were more naturalistic and tangential,

1019
00:56:06,124 --> 00:56:09,587
and not have cartoony voices, which really bugs me to this day.

1020
00:56:09,607 --> 00:56:12,509
It's why I can't stand watching... I don't watch any anime dubs, because...

1021
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:19,022
Americans always like, oh, and the Japanese are always like soft and they speak naturally

1022
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:22,365
But Americans always have this car Saturday morning cartoon sense not so much anymore

1023
00:56:22,405 --> 00:56:27,989
Obviously, it's changed much but there's still this air of like actors have to always go over the top

1024
00:56:28,029 --> 00:56:31,271
So I just learned that you can actually put together

1025
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:38,096
You know everything that you actually believe in and feel like you're skilled at into a game and have it work now

1026
00:56:38,356 --> 00:56:42,018
That's just my own that's my own story. And what I love about writing as far as advice for writers

1027
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,340
The most amazing thing, and I lived in LA for 10 years and I wrote for non-fiction magazines for years,

1028
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:52,182
and I still do because I love non-fiction. I teach about genres in film and I do film presentations.

1029
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:57,964
And when I came to LA, my small writing group, which is a group of us,

1030
00:56:59,344 --> 00:57:03,966
And then within five years, ten years, my friend Kirker is a producer on The Family Guy.

1031
00:57:04,526 --> 00:57:07,447
My friend Matt, who started the group, creates the show Burn Notice.

1032
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,128
My friend Jen writes a book called How to Be a Badass.

1033
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:12,128
It's on the New York Times Best Seller list today.

1034
00:57:12,749 --> 00:57:15,069
My other friend Chris Rossi writes a movie called Meadowland.

1035
00:57:15,129 --> 00:57:18,510
My friend Anna Kaja is in Silicon Valley in TV shows.

1036
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:22,452
So the most, the biggest advice that I have for writers is A, write.

1037
00:57:23,332 --> 00:57:23,852
You have to write.

1038
00:57:24,256 --> 00:57:27,864
You have to write. You have to put the work in. Don't half-ass it, because you're not going to get far.

1039
00:57:27,884 --> 00:57:32,255
Because there's ten other people that are going to be writing a lot more than you if you think you're going to just do it like...

1040
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:34,828
I mean, you have to be passionate about it.

1041
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,089
And I tell people all the time, like,

1042
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:38,649
you know what? If you're going to be an artist,

1043
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:40,030
you're not going to listen to me.

1044
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,490
And that's going to make you an artist.

1045
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,390
You're not going to listen to anybody tell you no.

1046
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,891
You're going to believe in it.

1047
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:45,711
And you can't be like,

1048
00:57:46,011 --> 00:57:47,151
oh, maybe I want to...

1049
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:48,232
I just say, you know what?

1050
00:57:48,252 --> 00:57:48,952
If you have that feeling,

1051
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:50,392
you better stop now.

1052
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,313
Because you're going to give up at some point.

1053
00:57:53,493 --> 00:57:55,613
And the cruelty of the universe,

1054
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:56,954
of this aesthetic universe,

1055
00:57:56,994 --> 00:57:57,914
is that you will be crushed.

1056
00:57:58,454 --> 00:58:02,297
you know, by a lot of rejection. You have to deal with rejection and you have to embrace it.

1057
00:58:03,077 --> 00:58:04,278
Because what I learned when I got the...

1058
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:07,240
I'm glad you asked that because when I got Life is Strange,

1059
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:13,325
I felt like, wow, this came at a time when I didn't think it was coming and I can't believe it came,

1060
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,906
but I realized that my entire life built up to that moment.

1061
00:58:16,427 --> 00:58:19,909
all my acceptances, all my rejections, all my triumphs, all my tragedies,

1062
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:23,510
everything led to me getting the game at that moment.

1063
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,311
And I wouldn't change a thing.

1064
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,153
If I could go back in time and be born with another hand, I wouldn't do it.

1065
00:58:29,794 --> 00:58:31,074
Because I may not be up here today.

1066
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:35,216
That may be the thing that gives me a certain objectivity as a writer,

1067
00:58:35,317 --> 00:58:38,178
that I can look into other people's viewpoints and empathize.

1068
00:58:38,878 --> 00:58:42,360
So, you know, I think passion is the main thing to have.

1069
00:58:45,961 --> 00:58:46,111
Yeah.

1070
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:27,654
Well, the game community is very open. They're changing too. They want these games too.

1071
00:59:27,714 --> 00:59:32,057
And I'm so happy with where games are going. I mean, look at her story in The Last of Us.

1072
00:59:32,097 --> 00:59:37,161
I mean, it's just... and No Man's Sky. That's my jam.

1073
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:41,784
Like, 70's style science fiction looking paperback covers as a game. Yeah, sign me up. It's cool.

1074
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:45,307
You know, I love the fact that all these new aesthetics are coming and that's really important.

1075
00:59:45,367 --> 00:59:47,669
Don't, like, make your disadvantage your advantage.

1076
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:48,750
Don't worry about the big budget.

1077
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:50,152
Focus on what you can do.

1078
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:52,594
And every, I tell a writer, once again,

1079
00:59:52,834 --> 00:59:54,135
your point of view is your gift.

1080
00:59:54,555 --> 00:59:57,758
Nobody sees the world like you and that is your biggest gift.

1081
00:59:58,078 --> 00:59:59,840
And so don't worry about what they're doing.

1082
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,122
Don't, and yes, you can copy people early on.

1083
01:00:02,162 --> 01:00:02,822
That's what you do.

1084
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:03,823
You copy and you...

1085
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:09,665
You intake it, and then you put it out, and then you start merging with your own personality, hopefully.

1086
01:00:09,745 --> 01:00:13,886
So, you know, always, you know, believe in your POV because that's really, you know,

1087
01:00:14,826 --> 01:00:18,747
you know, how you'll change things. In terms of the, you know, game community,

1088
01:00:18,767 --> 01:00:24,188
they embrace the game immediately. As far as, you know, other people play the game, you can go online and

1089
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,349
find both points of view, so.

1090
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:32,370
Anybody else? We're done. Thank you so much, and I'll talk to you out there.
