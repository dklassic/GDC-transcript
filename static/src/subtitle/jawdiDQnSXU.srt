00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:10,006
Hi everybody, my name is Brenda Romero

2
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,548
and this is my talk called Hidden Histories.

3
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:15,951
So I'm gonna tell you five stories.

4
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:18,513
And for me, these were stories of discovery

5
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:20,916
and something that fundamentally changed

6
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:23,017
how I see the role of women in this industry

7
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:24,979
and the broader tech community.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,843
So the first story is called Usual Suspects.

9
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:33,707
and when we're talking about the role of women in tech, we will often bring out what I refer to

10
00:00:33,787 --> 00:00:38,771
as the usual suspects, and we already know who these are. They are, of course, Ada Lovelace.

11
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:46,018
So she invents the very idea of code in 1843. And then we have Grace Hopper, who invented COBOL,

12
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,640
and she also coined the term compiler.

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,095
So she also coined the first computer bug, quite literally.

14
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:55,857
We're looking at that bug here.

15
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,360
And we also often talk about Hedy Lamarr.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,502
So Hedy Lamarr creates Wi-Fi.

17
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,506
And these women are absolutely, don't get me wrong,

18
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:07,648
they are absolutely worthy of celebration

19
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:10,111
and their contributions to code and technology

20
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,333
obviously cannot be understated.

21
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:20,050
However, I often find in articles talking about tech or women in games that are attempting

22
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,455
to be inclusive, it's the same one or two or three people that are mentioned as if that's

23
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:25,296
all there were.

24
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:31,102
When, in reality, if I said, let's talk about men in tech and important male figures in

25
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:31,343
tech.

26
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:34,223
we could fill this page and several more pages.

27
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:37,764
And the reason that I think this is important,

28
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:41,225
critically important, is because they form the stereotypes

29
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:43,085
of what we see in our heads,

30
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,426
what everyone sees in their heads

31
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:46,866
when they think of what that person is.

32
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:50,647
And they shape the opinions about what people want to become.

33
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:53,268
So, for instance, what is a surgeon?

34
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,068
And what is a teacher?

35
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:57,849
What's a nurse?

36
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:01,370
What's a CEO?

37
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:09,772
what's a lead programmer? And I saw this take place in my own home when I was going to this

38
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:14,735
kids coding event. And my daughter, like, mind you, this is my daughter, right? And she says to

39
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:20,139
me, it's all going to be boys. And she didn't want to go. And so, you can see, like, in her head,

40
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,262
the whole place was just filled with a bunch of little boys. And the reality was that wasn't even

41
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:30,726
true. It was an event called Coder Dojos, the greatest projects that happens in Dublin.

42
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,148
And there were tons of girls there.

43
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:35,430
So in fact, I would say to me, it

44
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,392
looked like there were overwhelmingly girls there.

45
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:40,514
So these ideas, these perceptions,

46
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,797
shape people's opinions.

47
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:45,299
So usual suspects is what most people know.

48
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,502
And they make career decisions based on those things.

49
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:55,296
My next story is called impetus. So first I'll tell you a little bit about me and what got me

50
00:02:55,356 --> 00:03:00,701
into the industry and what got me into this in the first place. So I get my start when I'm five,

51
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:05,826
that's that's when I start making games. And I grew up in northern New York and my family

52
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,908
had little money and so my mother would take me to yard sales.

53
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:15,695
and I would go around the place and she would give me often a dime and with that dime I could

54
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:20,899
buy whatever I wanted. So I would usually buy games. Most of the times those games were missing

55
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:26,722
pieces. So I would gather them all up and I would make my own games and absolutely loved that.

56
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:31,285
And it really led to a lifelong passion and fascination with games.

57
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:37,229
When I'm 11, my mother gets me the most amazing thing in the universe. She gets me Dungeons and

58
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:43,094
Dragons. And it is impossible to understate the love affair that I had with this game.

59
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:50,299
I could create worlds and I no longer needed to go outside. And I think that's why I felt when I

60
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:57,165
saw Stranger Things, I was like, oh my God, all of those people are me. It was just absolutely

61
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:57,745
incredible.

62
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:04,429
So, I gravitate toward Rolemaster by the time I'm around 14, and I end up rewriting the

63
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,611
rules for encumbrance, which to me looked like this, but actually weren't this.

64
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:13,854
It ended up being that I had to rewrite the entire thing, which I did, and we played it

65
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:14,894
for a couple of years.

66
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:20,095
So in 1981, in a location that at least looked like this,

67
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:23,016
I got my job at SirTech Software.

68
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:25,777
I happened to meet another person who worked there.

69
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:28,999
They were looking for somebody to man the helplines

70
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,380
when this is prior to the internet.

71
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,181
So I memorized a game.

72
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,982
When people called, I would answer the questions

73
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:37,122
that they had about that game.

74
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,062
So that's how I got into the industry and just worked my way up from there.

75
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:46,207
The first game I worked on was Wizardry 1, Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord,

76
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:53,013
and there is a screenshot of it now. And my mom, she was incredibly proud of me. She felt like I

77
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:56,937
was really on the cusp of technology, and it certainly wasn't something we could afford,

78
00:04:57,357 --> 00:05:01,340
and it gave me such a head start. It's also where I met my first husband.

79
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,623
We fell deeply in love, and I still, we're still together.

80
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,365
We're still together to this day.

81
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:08,967
So just again, it was 1981.

82
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,830
I couldn't get enough of computers.

83
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,812
And really working at this company

84
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,695
gave me an opportunity I would not have had access to.

85
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:19,537
What it also gave me a chance to see was code.

86
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:24,761
So the first code I actually saw would have been assembly language there,

87
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:28,824
but I fell head first into Basic,

88
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:30,445
which I was taking at high school.

89
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:35,349
So for me, code felt and still feels like Legos.

90
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:36,850
It feels like digital Legos.

91
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,533
Whatever you understand, you can build something with whatever knowledge you have.

92
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:46,337
So I begged our high school to continue to offer coding classes, which I took.

93
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:50,400
And then unbelievably, I left early because I did get that gig at Surtec.

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,082
And during that time, we put out a lot of games.

95
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:58,305
And I continued to work for Surtec as I put myself through college.

96
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:03,349
So during this time, I never saw myself as a woman in a man's world.

97
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,130
In fact, my world at the time was mostly women.

98
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,972
So this picture, Surtec.

99
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,624
You can see here that there are four women and five men.

100
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:15,188
I join just after this picture is taken.

101
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,953
And so it was parody, and it felt normal to me.

102
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:21,638
So if we fast forward many years, up until 2015,

103
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:23,441
I'm now teaching at a college.

104
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,313
And so I've been in the game industry for 30 years.

105
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,995
I'm also teaching, 30 years, actually,

106
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,377
I've been in the game industry longer than that,

107
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:33,401
but at this point in time, it's 30 years ahead

108
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,543
and I'm making games, but I'm also teaching.

109
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:37,386
And as a woman in the university,

110
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,449
I am put in charge of their diversity initiative.

111
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,715
So I actually thought this was a pretty great initiative. It asked us to look at lots of

112
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:54,201
different things that might impede making a more diverse candidate pool, more diverse PhD applicant

113
00:06:54,241 --> 00:07:00,166
pool. So I was actually pretty excited about it. And it asked us to look at challenges people face.

114
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:05,749
So, you know, for instance, you know, during childbearing years, access to nursing, sometimes

115
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,210
no maternity policy.

116
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:11,173
So anyway, I put all this together and I was super charged up to do this.

117
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:16,696
The first email I get back has the following word in it, that this is half-baked populist

118
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:17,197
jargon.

119
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:21,619
And that research into diverse teams and diversity was just...

120
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,362
whatever. And further, the nutshell of it was that women just were not interested in tech,

121
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:34,924
and there really was nothing you could do to make women interested. So needless to say,

122
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:42,186
this caught me by massive surprise. And so I decided to ask a question about this.

123
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:45,983
So I forwarded this email to the head of department

124
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:48,704
and I said, you know, like I'm offended by this.

125
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:51,806
It's, this doesn't seem to make any sense.

126
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:54,987
And the response that I got was this,

127
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,028
this is a direct quote.

128
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,989
There's little point in taking offense.

129
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,210
In fact, if anything, I wasn't taking enough offense.

130
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,671
And so I set out to prove them wrong.

131
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:07,153
The fact that women have no interest in technology

132
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,294
and have never really had any interest in tech.

133
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:14,909
So now this moves into the next story, which is archaeology.

134
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,153
What you are looking at here are the first computers.

135
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:23,058
Women literally were the first computers. That's what this job is called.

136
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,459
And programming jobs were advertised to women

137
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,581
specifically because they required

138
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,943
menial, detail-oriented labor.

139
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:34,885
And those words are from the advertisements.

140
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:38,028
And at the time, people deemed that women were a perfect fit.

141
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:41,391
And in fact, up until the late 60s,

142
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:45,514
IBM in the UK measured code in girl hours.

143
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:50,329
I'm finding loads of evidence that at one point in time,

144
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,110
here and there, women were definitely not the minority,

145
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,990
and in some cases, were the overwhelming majority.

146
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,791
It was really deemed that the labor perfectly suited women.

147
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:01,371
And if you can think about it for a second,

148
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:03,132
think about a typewriter.

149
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:05,792
This is a heavy machine, and somebody else

150
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,013
will build the heavy machine.

151
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,153
But who types into the heavy machine?

152
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,574
Well, traditionally, that would have been women.

153
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:16,435
This menial, detail-oriented mindset

154
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:21,397
was at the time frightened so that this would be a perfect job for women.

155
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:26,139
We actually see an amazing case in Dundee.

156
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,939
There's a big study done on this as well.

157
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,181
It was primarily women who built the ZX Spectrum,

158
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:35,923
and this is one of the most important computers in early European coding.

159
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:42,026
But these women were made to feel just as if they were sort of the assembly line workers,

160
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:51,730
not really part of this technological movement that truly defined an entire area in many, many genres.

161
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,233
So, same thing, Cray computer women were often the people who were putting these things together as well.

162
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,955
And so at some point in time, putting these things together

163
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:02,056
isn't enough.

164
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,418
So women need to learn how to code these things.

165
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,060
And how did they code?

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,402
Well, they coded it with 6502 assembly.

167
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:11,124
It was just the language that the computers understood.

168
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,986
And at this time, there's not a lot,

169
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,509
there's not a tremendous amount of value put onto this, per se.

170
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,892
And what's interesting to me is this

171
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,854
is around the point in time when I am in college.

172
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:29,257
And I don't remember being the only woman in my college program. In fact, there were loads of women.

173
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:34,779
There were advertisements in the 70s that actually talked about the computer girls.

174
00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:36,260
A trainee gets 8,000 a year, a girl senior.

175
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:41,859
Senior systems analyst gets $20,000 up.

176
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,585
And it was really a job that was heavily promoted toward women.

177
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,409
So as the importance of this goes up,

178
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,174
because computers are obviously not going to be a fad,

179
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,738
this is going to keep happening, the pay goes up.

180
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:57,313
And as the pay goes up, men start to come in.

181
00:10:57,713 --> 00:11:00,895
Now, I'm not saying this to make men go, oh, here we go.

182
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,237
This is the point at which she starts saying

183
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:04,317
things that make us upset.

184
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:05,238
No, absolutely not.

185
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,859
I mean, if you are listening to this talk,

186
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,800
I already know that that isn't you.

187
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,942
And in fact, culturally, there were people, in fact,

188
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:15,623
there were countries where women could not even work if they

189
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:17,284
were married at this point in time.

190
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:19,406
Men were the traditional breadwinners,

191
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,946
and therefore, it made sense.

192
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:26,091
that as the pay is going up, men are going to start coming in looking for that bread that they're hoping to win.

193
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:27,652
It was just the culture of the time.

194
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:32,636
And also there was another problem, that as there's more men entering the field,

195
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:36,419
they didn't necessarily want to be trained by a woman.

196
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,108
Out goes the woman.

197
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,508
It just wasn't going to work.

198
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:43,110
And so we start seeing a lot of women leave.

199
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,931
Now, culturally, things were not ready

200
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,992
for a women-led tech revolution.

201
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:50,393
And I think it's helpful to take a look

202
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,114
at the advertisements of the time.

203
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:53,655
So for instance.

204
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:59,041
Here's it's a lifesaver. You can get a range by Brown sift with a soil free oven.

205
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,846
And let's take a look at this one. This is from 1974.

206
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:05,189
And I mind you that we're talking about the same time period. Right.

207
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:10,455
So just you can see like if these advertisements in just mainstream media were OK.

208
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:16,538
you know, what would you expect it to look like in other places? So here's another ad from legs in

209
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:21,820
1970. It's nice to have a girl around the house and I guess step on her head. There's another one

210
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,661
where a husband spanking his wife, or I guess not getting, you know, that she didn't, she didn't

211
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:30,943
store test their fresh coffee. It's just, it's obviously absolutely ridiculous, but it gives you

212
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,763
an idea of where we're at the time.

213
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:39,496
So we were really on the verge of a female ed tech revolution, but our culture was not ready for it.

214
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:40,316
It was a mismatch.

215
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:44,459
And so this period we're in now could just be an aberration.

216
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,342
And if you're interested in more on this, there is a fantastic book that I highly recommend.

217
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,864
And it's all really well detailed.

218
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,585
It's called Programmed Inequality.

219
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,146
So I encourage you to check that out.

220
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,548
So the next story is the Unicorn Anomaly.

221
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:03,820
People often view female coders as a bit of an anomaly,

222
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,642
so much so that we actually have the term female coder,

223
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:09,623
which sounds weird.

224
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:12,865
And so I sometimes hear questions like this,

225
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:15,046
like, what's it like to be a female programmer?

226
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,747
what's it like to be a female game designer?

227
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:19,768
Or what's it like to be a woman in tech?

228
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:22,589
As if there's one answer to that question.

229
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,690
Like for all of the women watching this,

230
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,590
I'm sure that if we were in a big room,

231
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,011
which we would be, obviously,

232
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,652
but if we were in a big room and I said,

233
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,993
okay, everybody, I'm gonna answer on your behalf.

234
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:33,974
There's at least.

235
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:40,397
There's at least 20 people who would say, no, that's okay, Brenda, thanks so much,

236
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:44,240
but I would like to express my own opinion. And clearly there's not one answer to that question.

237
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,083
I've talked to multiple women in the industry, and I've talked to many women in the industry,

238
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:54,306
but some will say, you know what, I really haven't had any issue. And then I will talk

239
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:55,987
to other women and they have had...

240
00:13:57,048 --> 00:14:03,993
the shocking issues. For me, I've largely had a great experience, but I've certainly had my

241
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:11,338
fair share of weird things, things that I consider unacceptable. Probably the biggest of which was,

242
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:18,102
this was, oh geez, probably 15 years ago now, if not longer, I was talking to this guy who was an

243
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:22,345
absolute giant in the industry. This picture is quite obviously not to scale. But I,

244
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,243
I massively admired this guy.

245
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,769
And we were having this completely professional work

246
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:29,531
conversation.

247
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:32,357
And like 20 minutes in, he moves his coat over.

248
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:38,179
And he's sporting quite obviously an erection.

249
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,040
And he asked me if I want to do something about it.

250
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,621
Now I'm a game developer,

251
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:44,202
I've spent my life behind screens.

252
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:45,483
I don't even know what to say.

253
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,744
I don't even remember what I finally did say.

254
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:51,306
I felt I was surprised, I was offended.

255
00:14:51,326 --> 00:14:53,988
I was scared by the oddity of the situation.

256
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:55,048
I couldn't believe it was happening.

257
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:58,670
And I just didn't know what to do.

258
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,590
So I just, I left.

259
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:07,073
This is probably the most dirty, non-dirty picture ever in the history of the GDC talk.

260
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:12,815
So as we're walking away, as we're walking away, I'm just like, you know, he's obviously

261
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,935
still whatever.

262
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:15,956
And I just want to clear people out of the way.

263
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:22,581
you know, just, ah, just what a, what a disgusting situation. So there's other questions, though,

264
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,845
that I get, like, what would you say to other women who want to be in tech or in games? And

265
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:32,630
would you join our women panel in games? Or would you be our diversity speaker? And then there's

266
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,793
the statements that need to be debunked, right? Like, and I'm sure you've heard many of them.

267
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:40,576
And all of it ends up coming down to my gender.

268
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:44,053
and being so much more about my gender.

269
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,974
And even if we take gender aside from that, right,

270
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,694
it's this experience of being othered, right?

271
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:52,615
Anybody who doesn't fit into the standard envelope

272
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:54,495
is automatically made an other,

273
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,555
and that otherness is highlighted

274
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:58,476
so much more than their work is.

275
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:03,537
And probably to me, the biggest case was when Amal Clooney,

276
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:05,537
she's an international human rights lawyer,

277
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:07,657
and she was arguing a case

278
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:09,478
before the European Court of Human Rights.

279
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:14,402
challenging an appeal on the genocide of 1.5 million people.

280
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:18,425
And a reporter, unbelievably, asked what she was wearing.

281
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,288
I mean, this is a woman quite literally changing the world.

282
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:23,890
Like, what if we asked her this question instead?

283
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,691
And there's a repeat of it.

284
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:26,872
Time, here she is.

285
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:29,054
She is, again, she's talking about ISIS

286
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,155
at the United Nations.

287
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:31,576
What does time highlight?

288
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:32,477
Her baby bump.

289
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:38,607
So I'm not saying that these incredibly necessary efforts

290
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,309
to diversify companies, conferences and events

291
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:44,290
are not necessary, but it would be fantastic

292
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,452
if we actually asked these people to talk about their work

293
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:49,473
at mainstream conferences as well,

294
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,595
and not just their gender, their sexuality

295
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,496
or the color of their skin,

296
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:56,017
because we quite obviously are so much more

297
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:56,818
than these things.

298
00:16:57,838 --> 00:17:04,081
In 2008, I actually did an article on women in games, and I was given free rein to go

299
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:06,022
the angle I wanted to go with it.

300
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:07,383
So this is the angle that I went.

301
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:12,406
I contacted a bunch of my friends, and I asked them what it was like to be a male game designer.

302
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,847
And these are the actual answers I got.

303
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:15,567
What?

304
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,149
That doesn't make any sense, Brenda.

305
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:22,105
Wow, that's a pretty niche topic there.

306
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,586
So I decided to double down.

307
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,987
Now mind you, these are questions women get all the time.

308
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,348
So what advice do you have for men

309
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:32,149
looking to break into tech?

310
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:35,820
The answers I got, wait, you're actually being serious?

311
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,861
Is this a joke?

312
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:41,085
So just as a spoiler alert, to the best of my knowledge,

313
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:44,208
my reproductive organs have never made a game

314
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:45,689
or technical decision.

315
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,034
I never said I wanna grow up in design or code as a woman.

316
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:52,796
I never said I wanna play games as a woman.

317
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:55,679
In fact, I don't even really know

318
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,881
that I have any gender-based goals.

319
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:04,603
So I never said I want to be like the best birth giver ever in the history of the world,

320
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:09,264
and nor have I ever said I want to have the best menopause ever, though now at 53

321
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:14,846
I am actually rethinking this slide because I think the best menopause ever would be pretty fantastic.

322
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:22,247
Now that's not to say that I'm not grateful. I do know that things like this are incredibly important.

323
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,368
We were at QuakeCon

324
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:32,980
in 2014. And there was a guy here, shown here, dressed as a hot dog. And he was really excited

325
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,461
to meet my husband so much so that he kept like he would walk up and he'd walk away.

326
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:40,703
And so we had a conversation. I was asking him, you know, are you a fan of his games?

327
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:41,143
And he's like,

328
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,724
No, yeah, no, but that's not it.

329
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:45,787
So eventually I sort of coaxed it out of him.

330
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,849
Like, what was what was it?

331
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:48,970
What was the thing?

332
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,332
And the thing was this.

333
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:53,976
It was that he could see that John was Mexican.

334
00:18:54,156 --> 00:18:56,819
And he said to me that John was his hero,

335
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,923
not because of the games he made, but because he made them as a Mexican.

336
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:03,786
And that identification was important to him.

337
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:06,207
And it's also important to me.

338
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:08,590
I mean, when I was first getting into games,

339
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,592
people like Carol Shaw were my heroes.

340
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,176
And we all need role models

341
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:15,118
and we need their stories to inspire us,

342
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:18,423
whether that's in real life, tech, games, whatever.

343
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:21,525
And so that's why it's so incredibly important

344
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:23,585
not to comment women out of history,

345
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,545
but rather to include women.

346
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:27,906
Women say, like Margaret Hamilton.

347
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:30,947
So Margaret was the director of software engineering at MIT.

348
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,707
And she literally wrote the code that put men on the moon.

349
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:38,108
And she did it with her daughter in the office many times.

350
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:40,129
Her daughter, in fact, even pointed out

351
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:42,709
an error that was highlighted to NASA.

352
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,750
And they said, well, our astronauts

353
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,570
wouldn't make errors.

354
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,831
Well, they did, and there's a movie about that.

355
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:51,052
So there's also Lois Mitchell.

356
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:54,013
So Lois Mitchell is instrumental to Fortran.

357
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,215
And sometimes I hear people say, well, yeah,

358
00:19:56,235 --> 00:19:59,416
but did women do anything like actually hardcore in games

359
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:00,577
or in tech?

360
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,878
Well, how about an optimizing compiler?

361
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:04,459
I think that's pretty hardcore.

362
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,321
Frances Allen wrote the first one and for it she won the Turing Award.

363
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,083
There's also Kateryna Yashchenko.

364
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,725
So she created pointers in 1955

365
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,667
with the development of the address programming language.

366
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:21,429
So this work was actually not well known outside of the Soviet Union.

367
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:21,929
And so in 1964...

368
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,813
Somebody in the US did the same, and for it, they won the Computer Pioneer Award.

369
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:32,116
And it's absolutely a great achievement. They did these two things separately.

370
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:39,240
But Katerina did it first in 1955, and I think that's incredible. So yet another super wonderful,

371
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,903
hardcore thing. Here's Kathleen Booth, who created the first assembly language,

372
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:49,887
and also designed the assembler. And then we have Melba Roy, who was NASA's computer.

373
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:52,209
And then a personal favorite of mine,

374
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,931
because I loved BASIC so much,

375
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:56,294
we have Sister Mary Kenneth Keller.

376
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:57,755
Sister Mary Kenneth Keller,

377
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:00,138
her work was instrumental to BASIC.

378
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,200
And we also have Kay McNulty.

379
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,102
So Kay McNulty, she's originally from

380
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:05,824
County Donegal in Ireland.

381
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:12,769
And she was the one of an all-female team on the ENIAC, all-female coding team.

382
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,154
And a lot of these facts, like a lot of this is just lost today as if women have never been in tech,

383
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:22,117
which is just simply not true. We have always been here.

384
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:29,263
So there's also Alexandra Forsythe. So she co-founded the Stanford CS program and wrote

385
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:33,827
the first textbook. And interestingly enough, when she was going to Brown,

386
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,890
She was doing her PhD in mathematics,

387
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,631
and she was an exceptional student.

388
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,113
However, she didn't get to continue in the program

389
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:44,734
because the dean didn't approve of female mathematicians.

390
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,775
So out she went and cut her support.

391
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:50,838
And those challenges were not uncommon for women at the time.

392
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:53,159
And again, I don't think anybody watching this

393
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,421
was part of that time or was part of the decisions that

394
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,602
were made at that time.

395
00:21:58,022 --> 00:22:00,304
It's the way cultures evolve.

396
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:04,605
But back then as well, in games, we had people like Donna Bailey,

397
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:07,266
who's responsible for Centipede, or Roberta Williams,

398
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,547
who is one of the co-founders of Sierra.

399
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:13,868
And maybe you've seen this famous picture of EAs, you know,

400
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:16,849
We Think Farther, and showing like, here's all of our rock stars.

401
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:20,590
A lot of people overlook that Anne Westfall is in that image.

402
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,311
Anne Westfall was an absolute rock star coder,

403
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,432
created many games, and was instrumental.

404
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:28,593
You know, here we have Carol Shaw, who,

405
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:32,736
Prior, a lot of people think that games begin in the 80s.

406
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:34,717
No, Carol Shaw was at Activision.

407
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:36,059
She created River Raid.

408
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:41,623
And then in 1978, she was the first woman

409
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:45,166
to program and design a video game for the Atari 2600.

410
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:48,189
So seeing people like her was important to me.

411
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:51,551
And then we have Mabel Addis, who created the Sumerian game.

412
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:52,572
And this goes back to 1962.

413
00:22:54,354 --> 00:22:58,758
So this notion that women are interested in tech,

414
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:00,839
you know, man, we have always been here.

415
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,263
And percentage-wise, there had to have been many of us,

416
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:07,645
because it strikes, it just doesn't make sense

417
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:09,327
that there'll be so many women involved

418
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,528
in such important spots

419
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,930
if there were like five of us that were there.

420
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:15,953
In fact, the year that I go to college,

421
00:23:17,694 --> 00:23:20,497
37.1% of computer science applicants are actually women.

422
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:25,655
And so now the next story I want to talk about is the viewing room.

423
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:29,038
So if we look at the broader tech industry overall,

424
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:32,281
we can see that there are literally millions of women in tech.

425
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:36,504
And we are half the population, but less than a third of tech workers.

426
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:39,867
And of those, only a fifth of us are in leadership positions.

427
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,489
And so the reality is, is that means influence,

428
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:47,271
women's influence on product development

429
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,213
and company strategy is not at all

430
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:50,313
what we'd hope it would be.

431
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:53,696
And the results of this are non-trivial to our health,

432
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,458
our wellbeing, our education,

433
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:58,000
and our enjoyment and our success.

434
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,881
So if we take something like,

435
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,723
say the original Xbox controller,

436
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:04,025
it was nicknamed the fatty and then the Duke

437
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:05,786
in all territories except Japan.

438
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:08,729
So here it is in a normal man's hands

439
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,570
and here's a photo of it in mine.

440
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,912
So it was given Blunder of the Year, it was just way too big.

441
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:19,234
And eventually the Japanese controller was released in all markets.

442
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:24,176
And then outside of games, on June 3rd in 2019,

443
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:26,917
Apple introduced cycle tracking, which...

444
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:29,578
It seems like, obviously, that's a great thing

445
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:30,458
to be in the health app.

446
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,059
And so it just talked about fertility windows

447
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,720
and letting women know when their periods are coming.

448
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:40,222
And my bigger question is, why did this take five years?

449
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:43,783
Like, there are 2 billion women in this age group.

450
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:45,704
HealthCare had been out for five years.

451
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:48,965
I mean, even Disney released a film on it in 1946.

452
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:50,165
It's a thing.

453
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:51,146
It's a normal thing.

454
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:54,947
And incidentally, this was the first documented use

455
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:56,408
of the word vagina in a film.

456
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:00,983
random trivia now you know. And it's also gotten into our AI.

457
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:06,624
So in 2017, a group of academics decided to review bias

458
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:08,025
in open source computing.

459
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:10,307
And here's some good news.

460
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:13,729
So women's contributions were actually rated higher

461
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,590
and accepted more often than men.

462
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,392
So that was heartening to hear,

463
00:25:19,193 --> 00:25:20,473
unless their gender was known,

464
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:22,615
and if it was known, then it dropped by 20%.

465
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,477
So obviously, you know, that's,

466
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,920
well, it's endemic and it's scary

467
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,621
and it's wrong and it's bullshit.

468
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:35,442
The good news, however, is that it's also engineered.

469
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:38,963
And if it's engineered, it's a created problem,

470
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:41,144
and it means that it can be changed.

471
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:45,126
So as we look at the overall history of computing,

472
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:47,566
women have gradually been pushed out.

473
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,508
and we tend to view it as, say, a man's field.

474
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:53,910
And then I hear, this is when we hear things like,

475
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,390
you know, the women aren't there,

476
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,311
so I guess women just aren't interested in coding,

477
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,732
except that's not true, right?

478
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:02,033
It's women are interested in coding,

479
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,934
and there are ways to bring them back.

480
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:07,376
I deeply believe that it was a temporary aberration

481
00:26:07,556 --> 00:26:10,678
that was engineered, and I believe we can reach parity.

482
00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:12,198
Well, how can we do that?

483
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,900
Well, first, I think we need to clear away the myths.

484
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,621
and one of the big myths I often hear is that girls are not good at maths and IT,

485
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,801
and that is simply not true.

486
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:25,662
In fact, many studies show that girls are good at maths and IT,

487
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:28,142
and unless they're told that they're not,

488
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:30,503
and then they'll live down to it,

489
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,843
and that works the same with boys, by the way.

490
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:38,704
There was also a fantastic study done by Science Foundation Ireland

491
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:42,685
that talked about how important the message is coming from parents.

492
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:43,165
In fact...

493
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:48,369
A kid's mother is the most important influencer

494
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:50,890
of their children's future career choices.

495
00:26:51,351 --> 00:26:53,832
So if mothers say, absolutely, you would be great at this,

496
00:26:54,132 --> 00:26:55,393
kids tend to follow that.

497
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:59,516
And so educating parents as well is incredibly important

498
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:03,098
because they can influence their children's decisions

499
00:27:03,158 --> 00:27:04,239
more than anything else.

500
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,341
And we all know that it must change.

501
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:11,323
Women were the original computers, quite literally.

502
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:13,064
We created code.

503
00:27:13,524 --> 00:27:15,364
We created programming languages.

504
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:16,905
We built the machines.

505
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:20,106
We put a man on the moon, for God's sakes,

506
00:27:20,226 --> 00:27:23,848
and just to be petty, we also built the man

507
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:25,448
who got put on the moon as well.

508
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:30,652
And as much as I'm saying this, this is about diversity and it is not at all about exclusion.

509
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:37,837
It's important for us to get to equal because there are loads of studies that show

510
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:43,981
that diverse teams make better games and diverse teams make for better educational environments.

511
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:48,645
So we need to clear away the barriers for what's keeping people out of, let's say,

512
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:51,827
the other side of the room. And it's also the business case.

513
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,790
Even more than that, companies need to have more workers.

514
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,331
Like this might be fine now, but as an industry,

515
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:03,133
we are growing and we need to fill many more chairs.

516
00:28:03,373 --> 00:28:04,554
And in part to do this,

517
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:06,975
I also think we need to change the marketing.

518
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,877
So I decided to get in my,

519
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:13,578
this free time that I fantasize that I sometimes have,

520
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:16,079
I decided to get back into seed.

521
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,960
And so I found a C programming tutorial.

522
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,281
And this was the first and most recommended one.

523
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,782
And this is the very first thing I see.

524
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:25,882
So I imagine just rocking this thing up to my daughters

525
00:28:25,942 --> 00:28:27,563
and them looking at this guy going like,

526
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,864
I'm old and I'm white.

527
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:33,165
And don't you wanna be like me, right?

528
00:28:33,265 --> 00:28:35,925
You know, like if we're looking for equality and diversity,

529
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,606
I think that there's way better ways to sell it.

530
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:39,747
Like, why not having Margaret Hamilton there?

531
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:41,027
Like, I love this.

532
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:42,787
You know, here's a woman who put man on the moon.

533
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:43,548
Like, let's do it.

534
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:47,732
And then I remember this advertisement, which is currently my all-time favorite.

535
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:50,856
This comes from 2011. So this is a company that was looking for programmers.

536
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:56,642
And this was their ad campaign. So you would be, if you, if you signed up and you were hired,

537
00:28:56,682 --> 00:29:00,987
you would get a tux, which I thought maybe I could rock the tux, but then you would also get

538
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,970
cologne, which was sex panther cologne.

539
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:05,880
Which, okay.

540
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:08,183
And then this is the one where I drew the line,

541
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:10,165
like, I don't want their beard grooming oil.

542
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:10,986
That's what that was.

543
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:14,790
Cigars, whiskey, bacon-wrapped money, fine.

544
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,231
Beard grooming oil, no.

545
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:19,214
Right, like it just, it doesn't say that you belong.

546
00:29:19,354 --> 00:29:22,077
And so I think it's important that we change the message.

547
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:25,401
I sometimes think about doing something like having

548
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:27,122
an exceptional summer camp

549
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:29,665
or summer camp for exceptional coders,

550
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,387
and just constantly telling girls that,

551
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:35,010
girls are natural coders and IT is for girls,

552
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,452
and overwhelming them with this message.

553
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:40,455
Not because I just want to say it and hammer it home,

554
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,897
but actually because it's true,

555
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:44,278
it is really true.

556
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,124
There were times in my life where I was told that I was no good.

557
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,467
I was told by a teacher that I wouldn't amount to anything.

558
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:54,050
I was told that I would live in the worst part of town.

559
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,474
I was told I had no chance of getting into a college of my choice.

560
00:29:58,034 --> 00:29:58,715
And I was told

561
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,310
not to make the games that ended up being part of the reason that I won a BAFTA.

562
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:09,052
And what if I believed all that, right? Like, you know, the good news is, is that I'm a fighter.

563
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:14,034
And I wrote three books and I made those games and I got into that college and I live in Galway,

564
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:17,975
which is a long way from where I thought those people, those people thought I would end up.

565
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:22,357
And I'm grateful for my life and I'm grateful that I didn't listen. You know, but it's sometimes

566
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:28,419
like I'm not a fighter. And sometimes I believe the shit that I hear. And I wonder how many girls

567
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:35,592
we've lost to those messages that are just obviously not true. I mean, ultimately, game dev is for everyone.

568
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:42,439
and code is for everyone. And I want anybody who wants in these doors to come on in and see people

569
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:46,622
who look like them, you know, whether they're school kids or just entry level into the job

570
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:51,866
or they're lead coders or, you know, they've gone up to the CTO level. Like, I want to build the

571
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:56,909
ladder for those who come after us to show them where to go so that when we look at an image like

572
00:30:56,949 --> 00:31:02,273
this, you know, we don't think like, oh, my goodness, it's girls coding. You know, we look

573
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:06,476
at this as just a completely normal thing. Like, yeah, there's some kids making some games.

574
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:10,146
I want everybody to feel welcome in this industry.

575
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:10,830
Thank you.
