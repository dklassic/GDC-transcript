1
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:11,256
Good morning from an atypically sunny London.

2
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:13,136
My name's Steve Bailey.

3
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:15,957
I'm an analyst with a company called Omdia.

4
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:20,118
And today I'm going to be taking you through a presentation

5
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:22,718
about the defining themes of the console market.

6
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:27,319
Now, consoles are a somewhat unique hardware group

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,079
in the games landscape,

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,900
in that they are specialist devices

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,620
dedicated primarily to the act of playing games.

10
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:37,140
and have been active for over 30 years now.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,741
And in that time, people would often claim

12
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:41,642
that the days of consoles are numbered,

13
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,663
the consoles are dinosaurs due to die out

14
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:48,124
and be replaced by smartphones, tablets, whatever.

15
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:50,345
But that hasn't happened.

16
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:54,626
Instead, we have Nintendo Switch setting new sales records

17
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:56,487
and the new Xbox and PlayStation machines

18
00:00:56,487 --> 00:00:59,068
can't be manufactured quickly enough to meet demand.

19
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:09,129
So we're going to talk about the value and appeal of consoles through the lens of several key topics.

20
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:11,250
And those topics will be split into two groups.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,232
The first group looks at the outgoing generation of hardware, that is the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

22
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:25,195
These released in 2013 and as is typical for consoles, their sales start to decline about

23
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:30,877
five years or so after launch, at which point they are replaced by an incoming generation of consoles.

24
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:32,497
In this instance, the PS5.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,282
and the new Xbox Series S and X.

26
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:38,264
It's this incoming generation

27
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:42,627
which will then define our second group of topics.

28
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:46,770
So as we said, let's begin by looking

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,531
at the outgoing generation.

30
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:52,834
And our first topic is about the industrious use

31
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:53,654
of back catalogs.

32
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:57,117
Sales of back catalog games have become

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,639
increasingly important for publishers in the past 10 years.

34
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,160
And the number of mid-size publishers

35
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,732
have seen record results on the back of making greater use

36
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:06,793
of their older games.

37
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,556
And some publishers now even employ legacy portfolio

38
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:13,057
managers purely to take care of this function,

39
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,298
this side of the business.

40
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:17,661
On the screen, what you see here is the share

41
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:19,903
of each platform's game catalog that

42
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:23,285
was being sold at a discount via the first party download

43
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:25,647
stores around the end of December last year.

44
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:29,510
So on PS4, for example, around 1,000 games and bundles.

45
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,712
That's about one fifth of the catalog.

46
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,488
was being sold via discount.

47
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:36,769
And that share is even higher on Xbox and Switch.

48
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,170
This is now very common for consoles.

49
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,311
In the space of a generation,

50
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,872
we've seen digital discounting go from an occasional thing

51
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,612
to a constant and pronounced part of the offering.

52
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:52,794
Some of this discounting is now quite extreme,

53
00:02:52,794 --> 00:02:55,375
up to 98 or 99% of the resting price,

54
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,816
often making these games cheaper

55
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:01,277
than the equivalent of those being sold on a disc.

56
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:08,226
in a box. But it's not just about discounting, it's about making full use of that old catalogue

57
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:13,190
of games. Publishers have become much less protective of the launch value of content

58
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,234
within certain series and franchises, and instead understand that it's perhaps worth

59
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:24,559
giving older content away for free if it acquires customers for your newer titles and brings

60
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,021
players into your ecosystem.

61
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,902
In the olden days...

62
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:32,855
let's say pre 2010 or so, launching a game console was almost a fire and

63
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:37,758
forget experience. You would launch a game for $50, $60, whatever, and there

64
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:43,022
will be this intense, narrow window of sales. And after that window closed,

65
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:47,265
with the exception of certain franchises, commercial activity would drop off a

66
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:52,949
cliff. It was really kind of do or die, uh, incredibly front loaded, but thanks

67
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,231
to digital, the current console marketplace has a longer tail to it.

68
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,852
And with that

69
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,767
a broader and healthier sense of opportunity.

70
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:08,470
Our second topic is that of digital only hardware and by that

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,392
I mean consoles that can only play games downloaded via an internet connection

72
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:17,814
and won't take any discs or physical media.

73
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:23,717
2019 saw the launch of the first mainstream digital only tv console

74
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:28,098
the Xbox One S all digital edition and it's a hardware tier.

75
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:29,862
that we expect to become a standard part

76
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,544
of the console offering from sure on out.

77
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:35,486
But here's the thing with that.

78
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:38,769
Console started implementing digital only game catalogs

79
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,691
as far back as 2004, starting with Xbox Live Arcade,

80
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:45,374
and then expanding to include digital versions

81
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:47,856
of packaged games in around 2009 onward.

82
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:50,758
Indeed, this idea of digital only game content

83
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,881
is now very common on all console formats.

84
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:57,623
So why was there such a large gap between this?

85
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:00,903
and the launch of digital-only machines.

86
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:07,286
Part of the reason is that Xbox attempted

87
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:10,707
to introduce something similar to a digital-only console

88
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:14,469
as far back as 2013 with the launch of the Xbox One.

89
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:17,290
The console was unveiled at a pre-launch event

90
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,890
in around May of that year,

91
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,191
and it pitched the device

92
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:22,392
as requiring an internet connection

93
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:25,373
and for games discs to activate licenses

94
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:27,894
rather than represent any traditional sense of ownership.

95
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,048
effectively positioning it as an all-digital device.

96
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:37,552
But the problem with that is that Xbox tried to pitch this as compulsory

97
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:42,997
and did so to an early adopter audience and both of those things backfired

98
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,519
meaning there was a cooling period before the topic

99
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,242
could be visited again. Now this illustrates the care with which you have

100
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:53,585
to approach the console audience especially your enthusiast users.

101
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:56,625
This is an audience that you need to appease

102
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,007
in order to give your new console its earliest momentum.

103
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,509
And you can do that by changing the proposition significantly

104
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,911
and telling them it's compulsory.

105
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:08,113
No matter the wider technological trends,

106
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:10,614
you have to balance any such progression

107
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,716
with the needs of this highly engaged

108
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:16,058
and well-established audience of players

109
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:19,580
who've been playing console games possibly for decades.

110
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,703
So digital-only consoles could have happened

111
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:23,943
quite some time before 2019.

112
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:28,287
but they needed to be offered as an option alongside consoles

113
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,649
with disk drives, rather than lumped onto the player base

114
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,610
as a sudden obligation.

115
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,112
This is a really good example of the kinds of balancing acts

116
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:39,734
that consoles need to be constantly thinking about.

117
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:43,316
And in this example, it's a case of balancing progression

118
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:47,779
with tradition.

119
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:50,841
Our third topic is the rise and fall of Mixer.

120
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:55,539
You might remember that Mixer was a user-driven

121
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:59,562
video streaming platform similar to something like Twitch

122
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:01,283
that was bought by Microsoft in 2017

123
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:04,966
and was symbolic of its intentions to develop itself

124
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,827
as a competitor in the game space.

125
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,809
These kinds of platforms define a lot

126
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,770
of the modern opportunity around marketing

127
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,611
and community in games.

128
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,873
And Microsoft's ownership of Mixer would mean

129
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:17,434
that it could be integrated more closely

130
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:21,337
into its own platforms, especially Xbox One and Xbox Live.

131
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:24,835
More than that, I presume that Mixer was planned

132
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:25,996
to become a jumping off point

133
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:28,417
for Microsoft's cloud gaming platform,

134
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,638
in the same way that YouTube and Twitch

135
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:33,520
could be used for Google Stadia

136
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,521
and Amazon's Luna, respectively.

137
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,482
However, despite the opportunity,

138
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:40,303
running such a platform can be a deceptively complex act,

139
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:43,605
as you can see from this diagram on the screen.

140
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:47,286
On the surface, enabling video streaming coverage for games

141
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:49,588
might seem like a simple end point,

142
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,408
but actually implementing that kind of thing

143
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:55,498
involves a great number of stakeholders and a lot of layers.

144
00:07:55,498 --> 00:08:00,961
It also involves hitting a certain scale of audience in order to offer the kind

145
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:06,544
of return needed to drive such a platform when it comes to appealing to the

146
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:09,346
brands and star influences that you have to have on board.

147
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:14,309
So Microsoft closed Mixer in 2020 and then decided instead to partner with

148
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:19,392
Facebook gaming in the hope that Facebook could provide both the needed scale.

149
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,511
and the influx of new users into Xbox's ecosystem.

150
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:26,072
What this illustrates is that consoles

151
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,452
can't do everything in-house.

152
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:29,853
They can't do everything by themselves.

153
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,734
Sure, on the one hand,

154
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:37,336
there's a way they can operate outside of certain trends,

155
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:39,076
but on the other, there are certain regards

156
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:40,777
in which they need to embrace

157
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:43,198
the wider technological landscape.

158
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:45,138
Again, it's another great example

159
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:46,379
of the kind of balancing act

160
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,020
that goes into operating a console.

161
00:08:54,398 --> 00:09:01,745
Our fourth topic, excuse me, is about the maturing

162
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:04,307
of a hybridized approach to how publishers

163
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:05,909
make money from games.

164
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:09,072
And by that, I mean it's become less and less common for games

165
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:12,054
to focus on a single business model,

166
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:15,037
certainly in terms of how, say, AAA games and free-to-play

167
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,359
games sell themselves on console.

168
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:20,221
So this maturing has been happening for quite some time

169
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:21,082
and means that even.

170
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:24,154
Traditional single-player games like Delta May Cry 5,

171
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:27,155
as you can see from this slide here,

172
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:29,456
now have very complicated life cycles

173
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:32,298
where the publisher switches from one approach to another

174
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:35,319
and back again, as befits the opportunity.

175
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:39,161
This is an important facet of game consoles, right?

176
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,182
You have an audience that is used

177
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,703
to using multiple business models

178
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:46,004
and distribution methods.

179
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,485
That gives publishers room to create all kinds

180
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:49,665
of different approaches to their games.

181
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:57,156
So just to labor that point, we have some further examples

182
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:58,757
of this complexity on the screen here.

183
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:02,479
So on the left, you have GTA V and Overwatch,

184
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,501
games that even after years on the market

185
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,423
can still charge a premium entry point.

186
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,144
Even though they both still monetize,

187
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:11,205
they direct multiplayer experiences

188
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:12,546
via microtransactions.

189
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,988
In the middle, you have two games that were premium

190
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:17,729
for a good number of years

191
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,250
and have now switched to free-to-play.

192
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:24,065
and monetization via expansion content and season passes.

193
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:27,387
And on the right, you have the two of the biggest

194
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:29,328
free-to-play experiences on console,

195
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,070
Apex Legends and Fortnite,

196
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,512
both of which have released package special editions

197
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,853
to capitalize on a certain section of the audience

198
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:39,035
that likes to buy content in such a format.

199
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:41,576
A lot of free-to-play games these days

200
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:44,118
indeed launch with premium adjacent offerings

201
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:46,500
in the form of special editions,

202
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,461
founders editions, and so on.

203
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,424
Part of the issue with free-to-play is that it's often seen as a business model, and it's not.

204
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:58,347
It's a way of accessing games that can have profound implications for game design,

205
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:01,650
for marketing, for distribution, and monetization,

206
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,572
but it is not in itself a business model.

207
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:07,815
It's, in fact, a collection of business models,

208
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:09,456
and the same applies to premium games.

209
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:13,179
That's why the picture is more complicated than it first appears,

210
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,182
and helps explain why consoles, despite being very old,

211
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:19,224
are actually quite stable and adaptable.

212
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,627
Now, as we can see from this chart here,

213
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,988
which covers most of the past decade,

214
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,049
this is spend on console content and services,

215
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:35,230
premium spend in light blue, subscriptions in pink,

216
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,431
and expansions, premium DLC, et cetera, in purple.

217
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:43,812
Subs and DLC have been part of the landscape for years now,

218
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:46,793
exhibiting gradual rather than explosive growth.

219
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:49,554
And that's gonna remain the case for the future.

220
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:51,014
What you'll see is a marketplace

221
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,575
that offers a balanced approach

222
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:54,115
to how console players are monetized.

223
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:59,279
where subscription will become a significant and complementary

224
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,360
part, a net positive, but doesn't obliterate

225
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,300
the rest of the landscape.

226
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:16,243
So with that in mind, let's move on to the incoming generation

227
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:18,683
and the topics that we feel will define the next few years

228
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:22,404
for consoles, such as PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch,

229
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:23,484
and the Xbox series.

230
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:30,799
First, let's look at the topic of generations.

231
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,700
By generation, we mean that there is a cycle at work.

232
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,481
A games console launches and gains momentum

233
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,501
across the space of four or five years,

234
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,482
and then hits a peak, and then goes into decline,

235
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,203
and sells fewer units each year

236
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,723
until it's eventually succeeded by a follow-up console.

237
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:51,284
This idea of generations is still very important,

238
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,124
but seems to be poorly represented.

239
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:56,365
Over the past 10 years, we've shared time and again

240
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:58,644
the generations are ending,

241
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,786
that console hardware will no longer progress in jumps.

242
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:04,688
But that's how it stayed,

243
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:06,929
and that's how it's likely to stay

244
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:08,530
for most of the coming decade.

245
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,254
This chart here shows the annual sales volume for console

246
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:16,216
from PlayStation, from Nintendo, and from Xbox,

247
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:18,057
and covers a 25-year period.

248
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:20,959
And you can see over the past 20 years

249
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,361
some very obvious cycles in effect.

250
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:26,563
There's definitely a strong pattern at work here.

251
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:30,165
Nintendo is where the pattern is least obvious.

252
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:33,488
Thanks to the impact of the Wii U,

253
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,810
that was its 2012 console that struggled to sell.

254
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,933
And it essentially curtailed the typical duration

255
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:44,797
of the generation, meaning that the Switch launched in 2017

256
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:47,118
instead of hitting, say, 2019 or 2020,

257
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,461
like the most recent installments of PlayStation and Xbox.

258
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:53,083
People are once again saying

259
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,324
that this generational transition is gonna be slower,

260
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:56,465
more protracted.

261
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:59,275
because players have less reason or desire to upgrade.

262
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:02,417
And I would disagree and say that if it wasn't

263
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,578
for the hardware shortages and the impact

264
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,079
of an unprecedented event like the COVID pandemic,

265
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,860
we'd actually see a transition happening

266
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,081
at a similar rate to periods in the past.

267
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:16,003
Thinking back to 2013, excuse me,

268
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:22,166
which is when the PS4 and the Xbox One launched,

269
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:26,705
there was a lot of talk about how the transition would be a lot slower,

270
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:31,546
about how the improvements in new consoles were less tangible and less

271
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:36,488
important. And to help facilitate that more gradual transition,

272
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:39,528
major titles like Call of Duty, Battlefield, et cetera,

273
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:42,869
offered cross-generational upgrades.

274
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:47,770
PlayStation 2 launched its own cross-play, cross-save, cross-buy initiatives.

275
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,951
But if you fast forward from that point to 2015,

276
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:56,771
every publisher we talked to was taken aback with how quickly the generation had transitioned.

277
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:02,895
So this expected slowing didn't really happen. So it's not outrageous to suggest that the same

278
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:09,118
thing would happen again. And from that perspective, I think something like the Xbox Series S variant,

279
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:17,003
a cheaper stepping stone into the next generation, is arguably more of an experiment than a necessity

280
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,324
at this phase in the generation.

281
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,612
Now, this next chart shows just how many years consoles

282
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:28,834
continue to sell after they've been succeeded.

283
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,796
The blue shows how many years each console

284
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:32,936
was the primary offering.

285
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:35,478
That is, it was the latest and best machine

286
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:37,819
available from that manufacturer.

287
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:42,302
And the pink shows how many years after it was succeeded

288
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:45,104
that it continued to sell over 100,000 units per year.

289
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:48,005
Once it sells less than 100,000 per year,

290
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,807
we consider it discontinued for the sake of this graph.

291
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,968
And I think people tend to be surprised by this

292
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:57,111
in how quickly consoles fade from sales activity.

293
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:00,893
The PS2 had a lot of time in the sun,

294
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,116
thanks to the console discovering a long tail of activity

295
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:06,517
in emerging territories around the world.

296
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:07,818
But apart from that,

297
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:11,361
I wouldn't say there's a huge change over the years

298
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:14,203
in that ratio of the pink to the blue.

299
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:17,045
Perhaps the pink portion is becoming slightly larger

300
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,806
over time, but this is a 25 year picture.

301
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:20,648
And what we're seeing here.

302
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:25,364
I think goes against this idea that hardware generations are

303
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:25,644
dying out.

304
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:31,028
So a question that follows on from that

305
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:34,250
is, what share of unit sales happens

306
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,252
when a console is the primary offering, which is in the blue,

307
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:39,794
versus what happens when it's been succeeded,

308
00:16:39,794 --> 00:16:40,515
which is in the pink?

309
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,796
And I think the picture is even starker,

310
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:46,459
here, illustrating just how much of the console buying

311
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,181
tends to taper off once a new machine enters the picture.

312
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,973
Now with the PS5 and the Xbox Series X console selling for $500,

313
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:58,255
there is the possibility of this picture changing for them because they could

314
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:02,377
enact a much greater extent of price drop later in their life cycle, in their

315
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:07,060
twilight, extending that pink area towards something more akin to the PlayStation

316
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,922
2 than the PS3 or the PS4.

317
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:17,967
So this idea of generation.

318
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,562
doesn't just apply to hardware of course,

319
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:23,624
but also to content and to services.

320
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:24,545
And when we say content,

321
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,987
we just talk about the games themselves.

322
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:29,529
How much distinction is there on the content front

323
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:31,231
between generations?

324
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:32,992
And this is a part of the picture

325
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:35,094
that's becoming more fluid.

326
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:37,256
On screen, what you have here is a measure of content

327
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,938
overlap between hardware generations.

328
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,019
So we can see that for Xbox,

329
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,161
the overwhelming majority of the available game catalog

330
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:46,363
works on both old and new consoles.

331
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:47,444
But for PlayStation...

332
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:54,817
overlap is much smaller. Now this data is based on store listings so the PlayStation figure is

333
00:17:54,817 --> 00:18:01,220
actually going to be a bit higher as there are a number of PS4 games that also work on PS5 that

334
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,662
are not listed as such on the stores themselves. But I think what you see here is still an effective

335
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:12,685
indicator as it illustrates the respective intentions of the manufacturers. This overlap

336
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:16,267
is something that Xbox has been deliberately working towards for the past five years.

337
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:19,765
Whereas for PlayStation, it's a more recent endeavor.

338
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,847
We often get asked whether this idea

339
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,529
of cross-generational functionality

340
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:26,731
will cause the hardware transition to slow down

341
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,351
or to speed up.

342
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:30,694
And I think it does neither of those things.

343
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,757
What it does offer is protection.

344
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:36,319
It keeps people in your ecosystem.

345
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,741
It keeps players on your machines.

346
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:40,282
That's the important thing with backwards

347
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:42,864
and cross-generational compatibility.

348
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,586
If new hardware is in short supply,

349
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:48,169
it means your old platform still has a strong content supply.

350
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,492
And if someone buys the new hardware,

351
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:54,094
but new exclusive content isn't ready yet,

352
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:56,596
then updated versions of fan favorite games,

353
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:59,659
keep them active on your new hardware.

354
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:01,320
It's about the ecosystem play basically.

355
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,045
And that brings us neatly to our second topic

356
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,946
for the incoming consoles.

357
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,108
And we'll start.

358
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:13,475
by talking about something we've referred to plenty of times

359
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:15,516
already, which is balancing acts.

360
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:22,061
Over the years, it's been very easy to dismiss consoles

361
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,603
as outdated, to call them dinosaurs,

362
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:26,745
say that they're about to die out, but they are still here

363
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,967
and they are still going strong.

364
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,590
And that's because they are this deceptively complex collection

365
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,253
of balancing acts and quite adaptable with it.

366
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:39,155
10 years ago, people were saying that cloud gaming

367
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:39,936
would kill consoles.

368
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:42,610
But now, consoles are one of the best places

369
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,233
to explore the potential of cloud gaming.

370
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:48,816
Apple TV was supposed to kill consoles, but didn't.

371
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:52,119
Steam boxes were supposed to kill consoles, but didn't.

372
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,181
Likely because the manufacturers realized

373
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:56,022
how difficult it was to pull off the right balance

374
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:59,065
between price, performance, evolution,

375
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,827
accessibility, and so on.

376
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:04,730
Now, consoles are not invincible, of course.

377
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,292
They are always ripe for disruption.

378
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:10,468
but their ability to represent multiple forms of distribution

379
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:13,890
and business model can make them resistant,

380
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,071
along with an audience that is highly engaged and happy

381
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:20,952
to spend a lot of money.

382
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,313
Next, we look at how the messaging has changed

383
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:25,033
in recent years by manufacturers when

384
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:28,194
it comes to how they approach facets

385
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,035
of their respective ecosystem.

386
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,575
PlayStation remains the most balanced,

387
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:34,817
and I don't think there's much to be said there.

388
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:39,285
On that front, at least not compared to Xbox and Nintendo.

389
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,366
So let's start with Xbox.

390
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:43,207
Xbox has been putting great emphasis

391
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,908
on its content library subscriptions,

392
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:47,349
Game Pass and Xbox Live Ultimate in recent years.

393
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,731
Drawing that conversation away from hardware,

394
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:55,353
somewhat and signaling a change of emphasis for the company.

395
00:20:55,353 --> 00:21:00,076
Now this change makes sense for Xbox.

396
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:03,357
What we have here is the total number of consoles

397
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:04,498
sold over the past 20 years.

398
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:06,439
by a manufacturer.

399
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,820
And this is not to disparage Xbox, you understand.

400
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,782
Launching a console takes billions of dollars

401
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,883
and a staggering amount of effort.

402
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,544
And to sell this many machines,

403
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:18,425
it's an enormous achievement indeed.

404
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:22,547
But it's an area where Xbox is unlikely to see much growth.

405
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,029
And this helps explain its change of emphasis

406
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:30,231
into a services-driven arena as a company.

407
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:34,117
It's an area where it has much greater experience

408
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:36,838
and potential, and it's attempting to get a head start

409
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,059
on the future and aiming to arrive there

410
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,580
before its rivals do.

411
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,821
So Xbox's Game Pass strategy has three distinct phases.

412
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:49,363
The first is the short-term phase,

413
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:52,044
which was between launch in 2016 and 2020,

414
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,485
where the object was to reframe the conversation

415
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:57,707
around Xbox, in which I think it has been very successful.

416
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,809
Then you have the long-term goal from 2025 onward,

417
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:05,411
where Game Pass and Ultimate aim to drive the bulk

418
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,732
of Xbox's console business.

419
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:09,713
It's a vision that's coherent

420
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:13,434
and to which the company has made a huge, huge commitment.

421
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:16,135
However, we still have this middle phase

422
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:16,916
between now and 2024.

423
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,717
And in that phase, the company has to continue

424
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:23,138
selling hardware and really start delivering

425
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:24,739
on its first-party software

426
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,500
in order to scale up the audience

427
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,781
for Game Pass and Xbox Live Ultimate.

428
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:31,771
Anyway, if you want to know more about subscription and cloud,

429
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:34,914
a colleague of mine named George G.G. Ashfordly

430
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:39,157
is running a separate talk at GDC on those very topics.

431
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:46,423
Next up, we'll take a look at Nintendo,

432
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:48,945
whose strategy, by its own admission,

433
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:51,347
has become hardware-focused again.

434
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:52,809
For my money, that is a shift away

435
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,910
from when the console launched, and it

436
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,253
seemed to be shifting more emphasis onto Nintendo Switch

437
00:22:58,253 --> 00:22:58,473
online.

438
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:01,425
But when it comes to the use of Switch Online,

439
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:04,367
people are asking, why is Nintendo not putting more

440
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:07,068
and more weight behind the online service?

441
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:10,250
But first of all, it's typical of Nintendo

442
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,712
doing its own thing at its own pace.

443
00:23:12,712 --> 00:23:16,174
Few companies have the strength of IP that Nintendo does,

444
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:18,275
and it's preferring to exercise control

445
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:21,618
over its ecosystem while it still can.

446
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:24,139
For now, that means prioritizing getting people

447
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:26,841
onto Switch hardware first and foremost.

448
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:28,022
Arguably, this is gonna change.

449
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:31,044
especially towards the latter half of the hardware cycle,

450
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:34,466
when the successor to Switch is lining up for release.

451
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:37,228
And I think at that point, it will become a priority

452
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:40,650
to shift people into an online ecosystem,

453
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,471
as that makes it easier then to migrate

454
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,152
them between generations of hardware.

455
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:49,415
Now, there's an interesting thing happening

456
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:51,436
when it comes to this idea of ecosystems.

457
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:57,620
And it's the more seamless things become for consumers.

458
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,264
the more complicated they become behind the scenes.

459
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:04,186
Subscription and cloud may simplify the offering

460
00:24:04,186 --> 00:24:06,428
for consumers, but behind the scenes,

461
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,209
things actually get much more difficult

462
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:10,030
to track and to implement.

463
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,272
It's why this ideal of people being able to play

464
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:15,554
whatever they want, whenever they want,

465
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,335
on whatever device they want,

466
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,056
is a long-term challenge that's gonna take

467
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:19,997
many years to solve.

468
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:23,820
And so, one big part of the problem there is,

469
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,160
where is a player acquired?

470
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,641
Where are they retained?

471
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:27,722
Where are they monetized?

472
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:31,480
And these potentially now become very fragmented questions

473
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,141
that make things a lot more difficult

474
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,181
from an operational standpoint.

475
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:40,103
To put it more generally, across the next decade,

476
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,905
the business is entering its third wave of complexity.

477
00:24:43,905 --> 00:24:47,646
Not just console, but I think the entire market.

478
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:50,828
I'm not really sure if we're really ready for it.

479
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:52,808
It's obviously nice to talk about this unified,

480
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,469
seamless offering for consumers.

481
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:57,537
But the tensions between companies and platforms

482
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,080
in terms of who owns the IP, who owns the user experience,

483
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,922
who owns the infrastructure, is only just beginning.

484
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:07,304
There are gonna be lots of clashes and fights

485
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:08,605
over this in the coming decade.

486
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:12,588
And I think Apple versus Epic is just the beginning.

487
00:25:12,588 --> 00:25:14,810
Anyway, we're not gonna dig into that too much further here.

488
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,312
We're gonna move on to the third topic,

489
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,933
which is Heartland.

490
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:29,743
Now, there are some very interesting battles taking place

491
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:32,925
when it comes to the key regions in the console marketplace,

492
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:35,267
such as in the US between Xbox and PlayStation.

493
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,450
As you can see here, we have the install base,

494
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,193
which is the number of consoles sold by generation

495
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:44,494
across the past 20 years,

496
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:47,397
and how PlayStation weighs off against Xbox there.

497
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:51,820
Now, the US is the biggest console market in the world.

498
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,682
It's also the main stronghold for Xbox.

499
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:59,027
It's where Xbox 360 pushed ahead some 10 years ago,

500
00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:02,110
and it's where Xbox One held the most steady,

501
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,612
despite the challenges that the format faced.

502
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:07,474
So the question is, what's gonna happen next?

503
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:09,956
We're currently forecasting PlayStation and Xbox

504
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:12,078
as neck and neck, but there's obviously

505
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:14,700
a major, major tussle taking place here.

506
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,222
PlayStation is now headquartered in the US,

507
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:20,464
and is aligning itself with big Western brands,

508
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,306
such as Spider-Man.

509
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:23,887
If PlayStation can hurt Xbox here...

510
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:31,043
could limit the growth that Xbox has ahead of it for the next three or four years. Conversely,

511
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:37,588
of course, Xbox has shored up its position in the US via acquisitions, like when Xbox bought

512
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:43,854
Bethesda recently for many billions of dollars. All the headlines were about Xbox bulking out

513
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:48,678
Game Pass, which is completely true, but there's also this matter of re-reinforcing

514
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:51,160
its position in the US. We should not overlook that.

515
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:56,511
On a similar note, let's look at Europe,

516
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:59,273
which remains a challenge for Xbox

517
00:26:59,273 --> 00:27:04,017
because both historically and arguably in the near future,

518
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:07,460
the cachet of PlayStation remains just too strong for it

519
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,001
to make much of a dent in things.

520
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:12,464
But again, this could explain the value

521
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,246
of a services-first approach from Xbox.

522
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:17,889
A different tech might end up giving it

523
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:20,011
the kind of traction in Europe

524
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:23,053
that hardware is failing to generate for it.

525
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,747
Finally, we have Japan.

526
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,928
And this time we're looking at PlayStation versus Nintendo.

527
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:34,229
And we're also including handheld here

528
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:36,490
because Japan is very mobile oriented.

529
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,171
One thing to keep in mind here is that

530
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:42,512
since we don't have a full cycle picture for PS5,

531
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:45,152
we've used the PS4 as a lifetime install base.

532
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:49,754
And it tells us that even if PS5 sells as well as PS4,

533
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:54,335
this encroachment from Nintendo will still continue.

534
00:27:54,335 --> 00:27:55,616
So could we,

535
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,551
Perhaps see a future where Japan,

536
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,152
one of the biggest console markets in the world,

537
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:02,593
becomes the exclusive playground of Nintendo.

538
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:08,716
And finally, we touch on the topic

539
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:10,697
of curation and discoverability.

540
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:16,039
Excuse me.

541
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:19,161
Here on the screen, we have a three-year picture

542
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:22,622
of what's been happening on Nintendo Switch.

543
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:25,463
In terms of content released digitally onto the platform.

544
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,783
The blue bar shows how many games have been released on the platform,

545
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:34,164
which was around 700 games in May, 2018.

546
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:38,446
Also, that was just one year after release.

547
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:42,508
I thought this unprecedented volume would slow down,

548
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:46,690
but it's just kept that release rate ever since.

549
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,592
Recently hitting 5,000 titles, which is a record for a games console.

550
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,040
We also have the pink line, which

551
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,141
shows the percentage of the game catalog that's under $20

552
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,081
at any given moment.

553
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:59,622
So at any given time in the past three years,

554
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:00,843
around 80% of the Switch's catalog

555
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:02,043
is selling for under $20.

556
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:07,285
It's a lot to have to compete with in terms of visibility

557
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:10,586
if you're releasing a game onto the platform.

558
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:13,167
The topic of discoverability remains critical for consoles

559
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,788
because the manufacturers have to be

560
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,989
able to demonstrate value to content partners.

561
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,756
If you were going to release a game onto my machine,

562
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:23,218
what return is there for you?

563
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:24,339
What value?

564
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,840
Why should you bother?

565
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,562
Primarily, this is done via establishing

566
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:30,444
an install base of hardware,

567
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:32,386
which represents an audience of potential users

568
00:29:32,386 --> 00:29:35,068
and therefore buyers.

569
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:38,631
But increasingly, with digital and connectivity

570
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,713
facilitating so much game-related content,

571
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:43,895
what's the point of releasing your game onto a platform

572
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:45,997
if it just gets lost in the crowd?

573
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:46,798
And it's not as if...

574
00:29:47,057 --> 00:29:50,158
there aren't a growing number of alternative platforms

575
00:29:50,158 --> 00:29:53,520
out there to release your games onto.

576
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,921
Again, it's one of many, many balancing acts

577
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:01,622
that console manufacturers have to perform.

578
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:03,803
Anyway, that brings this presentation to its end.

579
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,104
Thank you for tuning in.

580
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:08,145
I hope you found it enjoyable, or at least interesting.

581
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:09,885
Have yourself a good GDC,

582
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:14,227
and take care of yourselves out there in these crazy times.

583
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:14,747
Bye-bye.
