00:00:00,108 --> 00:00:08,911
Hi everyone, my name is Brian Francis. I'm a contributing editor at GammaStructure.com and a community manager for GDC.

2
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:11,132
I am also today... oh no, I am in trouble.

3
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:14,793
I am in deep trouble.

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:22,315
I am playing The Church in the Darkness. This is a game that comes from Paranoid Productions, which is Richard Rouse 3's...

5
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:25,916
Richard Rouse 3. Richard Rouse the 3rd's game studio.

6
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:27,236
You don't have to say the 3rd out loud.

7
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:29,957
Yeah, just written.

8
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:30,657
Just written.

9
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:35,120
Richard Rouse is also the person who is in the lower left hand corner of the screen.

10
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:40,403
He is a veteran game designer who we have seen a lot on the GDC show floor.

11
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:42,465
We are here today.

12
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:44,406
Church in the Dark just finally came out.

13
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:48,389
We streamed this when we were doing this on the Gamma Sutra Twitch channel a while back.

14
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,010
We streamed this with him then.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,332
You might have read about the game, you might have seen some stuff about the game,

16
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:55,913
and now we're here to play the game and talk about its development.

17
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:59,115
Richard, how are you doing? And how are the other two Richard Rouses?

18
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:05,519
Oh, right. The other two Richard Rouses are not with us anymore, as it happens.

19
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,482
It's been a while, so it's okay to say that, I guess.

21
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:18,527
But yeah, no, we're still, you know, we just shipped something like three weeks ago,

22
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:21,088
feels like. They're looking at the calendar. Maybe it's four weeks ago.

23
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,570
Not quite four weeks. And we're still...

24
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:26,065
Working on patches, stuff like that.

25
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:30,467
Also, getting ready for a panel at PAX that we're doing with the voice actors.

26
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:31,227
Oh yeah.

27
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:35,408
There's some, I don't know if you'll, folks let me know if you can hear or not hear the

28
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:36,568
voice actors in question.

29
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,070
John Patrick Lowery and Ellen McClain have lent their voices for this game.

30
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,912
Who you may know with them better as the Sniper from Team Fortress 2 and GLaDOS from Portal.

31
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:53,253
Yes, and they're lovely people at trade shows.

32
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:58,236
You know, if you're ever putting together a panel, you know, this being the GDC channel, you can talk about this.

33
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:03,119
You know, when you're putting together a group of speakers, you know, you want to get people with good content,

34
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:07,302
but also people who are, you know, charismatic, can talk on stage, that sort of thing.

35
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:09,624
And the great thing about actors is that's what they do.

36
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:16,249
You know, so there's no... they will outclass the most famous developer, given the chance.

37
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:16,969
Right on.

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,672
Richard, I could introduce your game for you, but why don't you do it?

39
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,774
What is The Church in the Darkness, and why did you make it?

40
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:39,754
Yeah, so as we can see from Bryant here, desperately trying not to be detected, it's a bit of an infiltration game with a top-down perspective, inspired by some games I loved before I was in the industry.

41
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:46,060
And it's set inside a religious cult in the 1970s, which you are infiltrating to look for your nephew, Alex.

42
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:50,711
And it does a lot of sort of dynamic story stuff.

43
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,972
So there's a ton of different endings you can get.

44
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,733
We can talk more about those later.

45
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:57,954
Because I could clarify some of the intention there,

46
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,756
which is a little bit different than how I've seen people taking it now that the game's out.

47
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,298
But there's a ton of different endings you can get based on choices you make.

48
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:08,900
But we also change up the personalities of the preachers each time.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,102
So you're making choices based on different personalities to the cult leaders.

50
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:16,123
And that sort of makes it a...

51
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:18,926
Procedural story-ish sort of thing.

52
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:21,327
It is also, it's got roguelike qualities.

53
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:25,429
I believe you said you've been playing for a while and have been captured twice already.

54
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:30,652
So if you get shot again, oh yeah, you're running into the hornet's nest here.

55
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:36,474
But you're also, you know, been playing this long enough that you know that if you keep

56
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,115
moving you can get out of many scrapes.

57
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,276
Not all, but many.

58
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:44,699
I can't tell if the alarm is going off right now.

59
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,639
I would imagine it would be.

60
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,562
I believe it was, I think we got clear.

61
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:50,842
Yeah, cool.

62
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,283
So now I'm going to try to find Charles.

63
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:54,904
Not Charles Xavier, but just Charles.

64
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:55,824
Yeah, anyway, you were saying.

65
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,164
Not Charles Xavier.

66
00:03:58,165 --> 00:03:59,025
That would be a different game.

67
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:03,447
But yeah, so it's you're infiltrating this group, trying to find your nephew.

68
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:06,968
You know, if you play your cards right, you may want to go confront the cult leaders.

69
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,690
There are scenarios where you may agree with what the cult leaders are doing and not think

70
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,670
they're so bad after all.

71
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:19,109
You know, when we hear about cults, we hear about, you know, the worst of them.

72
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:25,393
And groups that still would be described as a cult might, you know, not be dangerous.

73
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:28,095
You know, they might just really be earnest about whatever they're doing.

74
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:32,638
I've often joked that software companies are often like cults, particularly small ones,

75
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:35,379
or particularly ones that have a really strong leader at the center.

76
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,662
You know, that when that person shows up in the room, everyone quiets down and does what they say.

77
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:42,464
And that's kind of like, you know, what we would call a cult to be.

78
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:43,605
Yeah.

79
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:49,644
So it's an interesting sort of, obviously this is not a software company, you know,

80
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:54,427
it's a very different situation in a lot of ways, but whenever people would say,

81
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:58,289
have you had any experience with cults, I say, well not exactly, but yes, sort of.

82
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,145
Yeah, right on.

83
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:04,948
Um, what, um, uh, we talked about this, so you and I've had a couple conversations about this game.

84
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:18,436
Um, the first thing, Drew, we can loop back to is, um, I think what's striking about designing a systemic game around, uh, cults and cult compounds is, um, there's a direct inspiration of real life behavior, real life instances.

85
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:27,161
Uh, it's quickly comparable to Jonestown, um, uh, uh, and the tragedy that went down there in South America.

86
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:36,630
What was sort of your first instinct for systemizing the sort of the cult of like

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,174
the the central personality of the paranoia, the backstabbing, like what was sort of your

88
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:47,980
first instinct for taking that and making it playable? Yeah, the thing that, I mean there's

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,603
two things. Like I like the idea of a game that would...

90
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:56,630
have a narrative that was inherently different every time. It wasn't just your choices making

91
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,832
it different, but also just the story had different elements that you would have to

92
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:03,796
figure out, sort of like a murder, like a game, I often compare it to Clue, the board

93
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:07,759
game, you know, where, who did the murders different every time, and that's why you can

94
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,784
play it more than once. And so I just like the idea of exploring that. I don't think

95
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:16,867
the game is as replayable as Clue, but it's, you know, it's got some of those elements

96
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:17,088
to it.

97
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,211
So I've been fascinated by that.

98
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:26,154
And then looking at cults, you know, I've been fascinated by cults as a really interesting game topic

99
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:29,296
because it's a scary, dangerous place.

100
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:34,219
Like that note you just saw has some overtones of danger to it, you know,

101
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,861
that they're down in the, you know, how long was Chuck in the cage?

102
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:39,642
And that sort of thing.

103
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:49,336
It's an interesting place to set a game because I think people like to go to sort of taboo locations and explore them in the safe environment of a game.

104
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:58,538
But also because as I was sort of looking more at cults, it was interesting to me that they often start out with very altruistic intentions.

105
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:03,359
Like they're trying to improve society by building their own society.

106
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,880
Or they're trying to make something more equal.

107
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,941
Or their worried society is terrible in some way and they're going to finally...

108
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,219
You know, build the right version of society.

109
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:17,381
Or, you know, their people might have drug problems, or they might have other...

110
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,603
A lot of cults promise sort of self-improvement things.

111
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:28,066
So it was interesting to me that these groups that we think of as so bad can start out, you know,

112
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:31,888
in a really positive way, or at least so everybody thinks.

113
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:39,272
And then, by the time it has drifted into darker territory, people are too trapped to realize it even, let alone to leave.

114
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,080
So I just thought that was an interesting thing to explore, and then that dovetailed with the

115
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,782
how do you know if a cult is bad or not?

116
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:51,004
Because a lot of cult groups in the world won't end in a tragedy.

117
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:55,026
They'll just end in their people doing stuff until they run out of money, and then they'll go home or something like that.

118
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,267
Or they'll survive for decades, which happens as well.

119
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:00,968
Certain communes in the US are still going decades later.

120
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,310
So I just thought it was interesting to put you as a player into it.

121
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:09,623
Let you realize, like here you're talking to Charles, you know, why did he join the

122
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:09,943
group?

123
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,944
He has some pretty good reasons for wanting to join the group.

124
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:15,586
Pretty good reasons for not liking the US, or at least that's the intention that people

125
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:19,068
could, whether they agree with him, they can at least sympathize with why he's there.

126
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:25,032
And then make you think, you know, I like, I definitely like in all my media sort of

127
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:28,714
challenging expectations of what you expect.

128
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,104
To happen isn't necessarily what happens.

129
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,665
So often people think, oh, cult, they're going to be so crazy.

130
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:36,147
And then you get in, it's like, no, they're just people trying to do something

131
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,388
different and maybe it's going wrong and maybe it's not going wrong.

132
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:45,051
And you get to, to try to decide, you know, is it, is it, uh, as bad as, as

133
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,412
everyone in the outside world says it is.

134
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,030
Right on.

135
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:53,172
Um, uh, at Charles is talking about the Walkers, that is the two cult leaders who show up in

136
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,132
every run of the game that you make.

137
00:08:55,772 --> 00:09:02,094
Um, the Walkers have kind of a top-down personality that informs your run, which is, um, uh, that

138
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:05,235
depending on what their moods are, and this one I can clearly specify because I've been

139
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,976
died a couple times in the scene, it seems like, um, the husband Walker is, uh,

140
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:13,378
pretty intent on getting apocalyptic with this.

141
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:20,024
Um, and, uh, um, uh, but his, but his wife, uh, I'm forgetting the first name.

142
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:20,504
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:26,209
Isaac and Rebecca, she's, she's made clear that, um, uh, she's a little nervous

144
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:27,750
about this and she doesn't want this to go down.

145
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,594
Um, could you break down from the top level, like where, how the, the procedural

146
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,197
design of this sort of works, um, and how like their transitions every time

147
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:37,418
change with the player experiences.

148
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:38,799
Yeah.

149
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,940
So, um,

150
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,023
You've laid it out pretty well so far, and I will say before going into that, that it's always interesting

151
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,005
when people are playing where they're like, I think this is happening because I saw this, you know,

152
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:54,727
I think I'm dealing with this version and and they're they're wrong as often as they're right,

153
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,588
particularly if they're just starting to play it. So

154
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,369
I feel good that it's like

155
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:04,512
slightly complex enough that people are not always guessing exactly what version they're dealing with each time.

156
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:08,234
But yeah, basically the the cult leaders

157
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:09,174
um

158
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:12,403
You know, the thing we change up is not their dogma.

159
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:16,504
So some people sort of expect, you know, when I say, oh, the story's different,

160
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,245
they expect like, well, this time it's a UFO cult.

161
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:22,966
And this time it's, uh, you know, some, some other wildly different thing.

162
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:26,967
It's like, well, no, they're basically always the same Christians with a

163
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:32,528
socialist message, um, thing that that's sort of inspired by some, some family

164
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:34,368
members who, who believe that sort of thing.

165
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:38,049
Um, and of mine, it's close to people's temple, right?

166
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:45,551
I mean, so the, uh, you know, obviously people's temple was an inspiration, but sort of one

167
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:50,094
of many and the, the cult leaders are, are pretty different than, than Jim Jones.

168
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:54,776
You know, by the time Jim Jones was in the jungle, he was, you know, he was no longer

169
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:55,697
a Christian really.

170
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:59,979
He was calling himself God and said the Bible was used to keep people down and stuff, which

171
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,862
is, you know, that's, I'm not going to say whether, you know, I agree with that statement

172
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:07,103
or not, but, uh, the, the walkers here.

173
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:11,672
The cult leader is here. Well, first of all, there's a man and a woman doing it, not just one guy.

174
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:18,698
But they're very much still Christians, and sort of interpreting the Bible, how they, you know,

175
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,762
how they see it leads to them building this compound in the jungle.

176
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:29,188
But like, the architecture and stuff like that is probably the closest to what you would expect out of a Jonestown.

177
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:34,737
Yeah, to get us back on topic, the architecture of the design was something I was asking about before.

178
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:36,857
If you're able to... Sorry, I'll get us back on track.

179
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:38,118
Yeah, no problem.

180
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:47,980
Yeah, so basically the cult leaders have a lot of the same dogma each time, but it's just how dangerous they are that we change up.

181
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:53,522
And it's not just they're both dangerous or both not, there's some differences beyond that.

182
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:55,002
So it's not just like...

183
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:55,462
to

184
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,903
what he said early on was something you could a lot of people could believe in.

185
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:26,928
seems sincere and seemed like it was addressing real problems in the world

186
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:30,371
and it's just he went too far with it but imagine another group where

187
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:36,617
he didn't go to these these too far uh reaches with it and and and really

188
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:40,000
brought the group in the the track leading to the tragedy

189
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,624
that that eventually that eventually happened um but you

190
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:46,607
could imagine someone having the same dogma not ending in tragedy and that's

191
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:47,528
sort of what we're doing here

192
00:12:48,782 --> 00:13:03,185
Right on. So how do from the top down, how does that change? Like, how does the game sort of play out behind the scenes, like without giving away everything that was spoiled? Right, right. What's the what's the design? pin holding this whole thing together?

193
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:17,488
Yeah, so basically, once we've decided, you know, from from a collection of personality states that the game can start with for the cult leaders, then that impacts the game in a ton of different ways. So there's the voiceover that you're hearing over the PA system.

194
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:23,350
He won't talk to you until you get the alarm reset, by the way.

195
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,092
If you've got the permalarm going on because you've murdered too many people, you have to go reset it by hand.

196
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,513
Yes, if you can find an alarm box, you can go reset it now.

197
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:36,875
As long as that... uh oh. Yep, watch out.

198
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:43,758
But, what was I saying before we got into what you're doing on screen?

199
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,941
Oh, right, it manifests itself in a lot of different ways.

200
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:52,162
Like the voiceover you're hearing, that can change up in subtle ways

201
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,463
based on which version of the cult you're dealing with.

202
00:13:56,224 --> 00:14:01,325
That can, you know, there's also those notes and documents you were finding.

203
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:09,387
Those can definitely change depending on which version of the cult you're dealing with that time.

204
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:11,828
Um, and then also the, uh...

205
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,405
Did you get it? Did you buy it?

206
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:16,046
I bought it.

207
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,186
Oh, yeah.

208
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:20,849
And since you've already been captured twice, it's all over.

209
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,970
So now we'll get to see how the restart works.

210
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:26,892
Anyway, so we change up the notes.

211
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:29,734
We change up the voiceover you hear on the PA system.

212
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:32,915
There's different scenes in the game that will change.

213
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:38,238
And it's not again, it's like there's there's always some dark elements to the cult.

214
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,521
where you'd say, oh, that looks really bad,

215
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:43,483
but maybe that's not as bad as another version of it that you might see.

216
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:47,205
And as, as you play it, the game is designed obviously to be played multiple times.

217
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:51,588
You see some of these differences and, uh, has a shorter play time for that reason.

218
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,850
I really hope that people play it like four or five times.

219
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,251
I feel is a pretty good, if you get four or five endings, you've,

220
00:14:57,511 --> 00:15:00,753
you've experienced a lot of what, what is in there.

221
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:04,095
Obviously you can go on and try to be a completionist and collect even more

222
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:05,556
endings, but, um,

223
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:09,528
So we change up those things, that friendly character you saw earlier, Charles,

224
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:13,430
like he'll say different things based on which version of the cult you're dealing with.

225
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,532
And obviously the cult leaders themselves will say different things when they capture you,

226
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:19,573
or when you try to confront them later in the game.

227
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,575
Right on. Moving on down, we can talk about...

228
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:27,777
This is kind of a solo dev project, right? It's you, the voice actors,

229
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:30,898
and I assume you must have had some contracted help, right?

230
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,460
No, yeah, there were a bunch of people who worked on it.

231
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:38,929
Primarily in art, because I don't do art, so all the art you're seeing here was done by someone who is not me.

232
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,552
But I did the design and the writing and most of the gameplay programming.

233
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:51,196
I also had a couple of programmers doing the console versions and load-save system and stuff that was more technical.

234
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:57,272
But yeah, mostly I was the full-time guy on this for most of its development.

235
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:03,758
Yeah, let's talk about life as a solo developer because this is something our audience can relate to a lot because there's a lot of indie folks who write in.

236
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:10,323
How was it sort of like, how was your personal process for trying to wrangle your...

237
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:20,069
Your design intentions and also being the kind of the programmer who had to

238
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,471
figure out and implement them, right?

239
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:24,353
Cause it's one thing to go, Oh, here's a great idea for the F then clauses.

240
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:28,137
And then you dive into your own tools that you've made or you've borrowed or

241
00:16:28,357 --> 00:16:31,120
gotten, uh, from the, from whatever tool store you're working with.

242
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,243
And then you're like, Oh no, this is, this is, uh, not what I intended.

243
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:42,696
Yeah. No, I hadn't programmed. I programmed games early on when I started in the industry.

244
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:46,677
And I sort of actually started with a project, a couple of projects very much like this,

245
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:52,680
where I was the lead programmer, lead designer, and leading the project. And then I went to work

246
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,321
at bigger projects where I mostly focused on design, but still did programming here and there.

247
00:16:56,941 --> 00:17:00,763
And here getting back into doing programming was actually a lot of fun for me, just from a,

248
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:04,124
it's like a muscle I hadn't been using for a while that I enjoy.

249
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:09,237
I'm not someone who you want to have write your graphics engine or something like that.

250
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:14,802
But I think I'm persistent enough at the gameplay stuff.

251
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:20,447
Plus, there is a lot of advantage to being the designer as well,

252
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:22,369
where you can make those trade-offs.

253
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,311
I think as anyone who's done small projects know,

254
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:27,814
you don't have to spend as much time on documentation and meetings and stuff like that.

255
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:29,936
So the communication is a lot more seamless.

256
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:30,596
On the other hand...

257
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:36,507
You know, I did miss some of the push and pull and variety of ideas you get,

258
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:38,349
like collaborating with a programmer or something,

259
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,412
can definitely make things better in a lot of ways.

260
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:44,754
So I'm not discounting that or saying that's bad,

261
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,437
and would probably like to do that again in the future.

262
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:53,901
But for this one, it was just a very specific project that was very personal to me,

263
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:57,083
and I wanted to get my hands fully dirty on.

264
00:17:58,004 --> 00:17:59,866
So it was fun to do.

265
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,086
It's definitely, I think,

266
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:14,169
I guess going back to having more of a team that's a team that's full-time there with you can really help with keeping the project balanced and helping prioritize things.

267
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:21,171
And of course everyone's going to have their own opinions on that, but then you discuss it and come to some sort of consensus and that can be very valuable.

268
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:26,500
So there are advantages in terms of communication to a small team and that you don't have to

269
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,881
communicate as much because you're right there, but you don't get the variety of viewpoints

270
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:33,262
and stuff that can be really cool on a larger project.

271
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:34,322
Right on.

272
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:40,604
My next question as I read this document, is there anything you've sort of like you

273
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:47,166
went into this project thinking this kind of design was going to work one way and then

274
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:48,326
it wound up working another way?

275
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,787
Do you have any examples of that you could point to?

276
00:18:52,111 --> 00:19:00,955
Yeah, the biggest change probably from what I initially hoped for or thought of for the

277
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:06,098
game was it was less about the friendly characters who you meet at the beginning.

278
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:10,160
I think the early design, they didn't even exist.

279
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,721
It was going to be purely the voiceover and the notes and documents you found.

280
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:17,263
And there was just enough people who were saying, I wish I could talk to some of the

281
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:17,843
cult members.

282
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,172
that made me say, okay, we can add some cult members.

283
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:24,233
They're still fully voiced, so that sort of limited how many we could do,

284
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:27,234
just in terms of budget and stuff.

285
00:19:28,154 --> 00:19:33,156
But we got enough of them in there that I think it provides a little flavor of who you're meeting in the group.

286
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:38,458
And we actually didn't add the conversation system that's in there was added really late,

287
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,940
where before when you went and talked to them, they would just sort of talk at you for a while,

288
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,701
and you weren't interacting with them.

289
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:48,978
Because I'm not a huge fan of conversation trees.

290
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:55,121
They're just kind of like making me press a bunch of buttons to read all the stuff sometimes.

291
00:19:55,201 --> 00:20:04,325
But I decided in the end after getting feedback from some people that having them felt better

292
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:05,245
than not having them.

293
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:09,247
Having some control over what you're navigating in this conversation felt better than having

294
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:12,849
none, even if it's sort of fake control, if you know what I mean.

295
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,910
So that was a pretty big change from what we originally planned.

296
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:17,426
Yeah, let's dig into that.

297
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:23,427
You do a lot of great GDC panels about like sort of theoretical design, hypothetical design,

298
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:25,428
and tips for design.

299
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,488
So what do you think about dialog trees like?

300
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:30,149
Because it's a very commonly used mechanic.

301
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:34,450
As a designer, what do you think is their sort of strength?

302
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,511
Because you eventually just implement them, so there's some kind of strength.

303
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:41,372
What do you think are the strengths and weaknesses developers need to consider when creating

304
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:41,552
them?

305
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:44,113
Yeah, I mean, I think they're fundamentally...

306
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:51,744
Not as interesting as other mechanics that you can do because dialogue trees are basically

307
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:58,469
often and you can do more complex things with them than this. So I applaud those. But the most

308
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:03,253
basic implementation is, you know, here's four options. Press one of each one and you'll eventually

309
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:09,517
hear all this stuff, right? And it's just and it feels very canned. It doesn't feel like I can ask

310
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:11,599
them anything, you know, which is kind of what I want to do.

311
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:16,639
Like when you're wandering around this world right now as a player, you can go anywhere you want.

312
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:17,579
You can go to this building, you can go to this...

313
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,680
So there's just a ton of choices all the time about what you're doing.

314
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:25,062
On the conversation tree, we limit it down to like a pretty small number of choices.

315
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:30,145
And that's like less interesting to me, fundamentally.

316
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:35,767
But on the other hand, if you're having conversations with people, it's kind of the best thing we have right now.

317
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:52,367
And I think there are definitely conversation systems that have been done where that was more of a focus of the game, where they would have, you know, trust levels and like a wider swath of dialogue possibilities and more of a simulation element to the dialogue.

318
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:57,110
And that can be great, but was not something we had enough time.

319
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,773
But that can be a very time consuming thing to implement and not something we sort of had the time to do here.

320
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:05,935
So I think it's something to think about.

321
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:11,613
That I guess the takeaway I had why they ended up getting implemented was it just felt better than not having them.

322
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:22,615
Even though it is winnowing the choices down to this very small thing at that time, and it doesn't feel as robust as the rest of the gameplay in terms of, you know, choices per second that the player is making.

323
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:34,198
It's still choices and people still like them. So, you know, you do the thing people like, even if it's not like your best possible version of a feature.

324
00:22:34,594 --> 00:22:41,376
I like choices per second as a phrase because it just feels like a speed, like how many

325
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:43,156
choices per second is the player making?

326
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,196
Oh no, there's a speed limit.

327
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:47,057
We have to limit the choices per second.

328
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:53,818
I've used that to talk about, you know, games that have really long cut scenes, like there's

329
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:57,459
zero choices per second going on during a cut scene off of right.

330
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,400
And that's...

331
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:07,278
You know, makes you not want to replay it as much because you're kind of watching the same thing or the same, you know, you're just not doing that much when you replay.

332
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:20,522
That was something we did in a patch actually that is coming out for the PlayStation version later this week but isn't up there yet so you're not seeing it in the Steam version and soon in the PlayStation version and the other console versions.

333
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:24,783
You can skip the dialogue on replays so you might come up to Teresa on another replay.

334
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:30,011
She's saying slightly different things, but maybe you just want to read the subtitle and go through it faster because you've done this before.

335
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:32,994
You now can do that in the newer, with the patch.

336
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:38,501
So that's an example of we implemented it, but we didn't implement the ability to skip.

337
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:42,005
It was on the wish list, and then a lot of people asked for it after we shipped.

338
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:45,849
So the option to skip is an interaction per second in a way as well.

339
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,841
Yeah, no, I think about that with games.

340
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:49,742
God, what was I just playing?

341
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:50,483
Oh yeah, Fire Emblem.

342
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:55,090
I'm playing Fire Emblem Three Houses and the choice to skip or not skip or like let, like

343
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,811
what am I observing?

344
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:56,472
What is this part?

345
00:23:56,492 --> 00:24:00,638
Like am I getting anything by watching this full animated scene versus blazing through

346
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:01,980
the conversation getting the points?

347
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:07,864
The final prompt states that this is a game development transcript.

348
00:24:28,456 --> 00:24:32,658
The dialogue was just so much like it was good. It was really good dialogue.

349
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:35,319
What I was like, I want to get back to hunting, jumping, climbing.

350
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,640
And skipping through it helped me get through it fast.

351
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,341
So the design implications are certainly, they're subtle.

352
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:44,383
If not, they're kind of quality of life, I guess.

353
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:46,144
Yeah, yeah.

354
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:46,384
I know.

355
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:53,207
And it's that trick where if, yeah, once you have a part of the game that you really like.

356
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:56,767
And then it shifts gears into what feels like you're just in another game.

357
00:24:57,187 --> 00:25:00,370
You run that peril of either they want to get back to the first game,

358
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,472
or the new game you've put them in is the one they want to stick with.

359
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:04,534
And then when that ends, you're like, oh, but I like that other thing.

360
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:08,358
It is a sweet, there's a sweet science to figuring out,

361
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:12,382
you know, how to balance

362
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:16,325
how to balance those things so it doesn't feel like,

363
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,227
you know, two games grafted together or something.

364
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,061
We are coming up at our 30 minute mark.

365
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:24,444
We are, I should have mentioned a lot sooner, we are happy to take questions from folks

366
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:25,544
who are watching.

367
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:29,227
If there's anyone out there, feel free to give us a shout.

368
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:33,090
Richard, making games is hard, selling games is hard.

369
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:39,955
That should be, I said it like it's somehow profound, but it's...

370
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:44,518
Blindingly obvious, I think, to everyone who spends time in games.

371
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:48,940
How have you felt about communicating this game's existence to the world?

372
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,921
How have you felt? What do you think is done right?

373
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:53,542
What do you think you could have done differently?

374
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:55,823
I'm curious to know what your thoughts are about this.

375
00:25:55,943 --> 00:25:59,905
Because this is a cool little game, and it's definitely just doing something different than what a lot of other games are doing out there.

376
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:01,085
But that's a lot of games.

377
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:05,167
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a few things that...

378
00:26:07,462 --> 00:26:12,827
It's among the like, well, we knew about this, but we didn't have time to get to it, that have come up.

379
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:17,351
Like the skipping dialogue thing, like that was on a wish list, but we hadn't done and then

380
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:20,133
enough people asked for it. Just like, great, let's do that.

381
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:25,538
And I think that's always the case that you've got your list of things and things that I thought

382
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:29,261
were like, oh, this is the first thing I should patch where totally nobody complains about it

383
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:34,925
at all. So, you know, we're not doing it. Definitely something we're focusing on is

384
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:41,798
Getting people's replays of the game to be more different every time to guarantee that,

385
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:47,482
and sort of the randomness, say for example in the dialogue that plays over the PA system,

386
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:53,807
right now it is random within the game you're playing, but if you start a new game it's only

387
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:57,869
random within that game. So if you played a game and died within five minutes and start a new game

388
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:02,533
there's a chance you might hear the same dialogue again pretty quickly and that sucks. So...

389
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:10,656
We've implemented a system where that won't happen anymore. That's a patch I'm sort of in testing right now and hoping to get out later this week.

390
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:18,278
That's one thing. There's definitely some stuff where I was so close to the controls on the game that they felt...

391
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:24,259
I mean, I sort of knew the controls weren't as good as I wanted and again, that was a thing on the feature list, but...

392
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,160
It was...

393
00:27:29,184 --> 00:27:35,128
It's the person's first time experience with it is not what I hoped, often, with some of the control things, particularly firing the gun.

394
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:41,653
It's something that I think needs some work, so we've got that on the to-do list for a future patch as well.

395
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:53,021
So some control stuff, some of the repetitive stuff, and then maybe just, you know, we're looking at ways to like vary up some of the gameplay on repeat plays too, so it's a little bit more different than it is right now.

396
00:27:54,345 --> 00:28:02,893
Right on, uh I think um uh I appreciate the way you're talking about, you know, like uh sometimes you just gotta um you just gotta

397
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:09,599
It's time to say go like uh, you gotta cut you can't work on it forever. Yeah, cut, beat and run

398
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:15,224
What was your thought process? Like this is kind of a producer brain question is what is your thought process for?

399
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,508
Um, this music's very nice by the way. Um, what is your thought process for?

400
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:26,895
Making sure you're not bogged down in those like on your that magical list and versus being able to look at something and say hey

401
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:31,119
This is great. We'll work on it after launch, but it's time to go or after a milestone or something

402
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,564
Yeah, I mean that's the million-dollar question right is how when is it done enough?

403
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:40,328
And I don't know that I have the perfect answer for that

404
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:45,293
I think you know when you have a bigger like the perfect answer for that at a bigger

405
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:50,207
company that has money to spend on things like that is doing a lot of usability testing

406
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:54,129
and doing it with people who can actually play the game for an extended amount of time.

407
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:59,612
Because some of the repetitiveness stuff is not something that people complained about

408
00:28:59,652 --> 00:29:02,473
before we launched because most people who played it would play it for a couple of hours

409
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:04,054
and you don't really notice it.

410
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:08,516
It's when you get to the sixth or seventh hour or something and you're like, hey, why

411
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:09,357
am I hearing this again?

412
00:29:10,297 --> 00:29:12,998
We have plenty of voiceover that you shouldn't be feeling that way,

413
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:15,519
but it's just making sure it happens.

414
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:21,781
So, like in a larger company that had budget for people to play it for 10 hours each or something,

415
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:24,482
that stuff would have come up and we could have addressed it.

416
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:29,143
But here we were, you know, having smaller resources, we did have people playing it,

417
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:30,664
but just not for that long period of time.

418
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:34,785
And that's just something, you know, next time I would definitely figure out

419
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:38,707
how to make sure that happens before shipping, just to catch some of those easy fixes.

420
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:41,147
that you can do to make things a lot better.

421
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,394
Richard, do you have any opinions on that?

422
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:18,797
Yeah, that's a good question for sure.

423
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,520
There's two types of replayability in this game in particular.

424
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:29,706
There's the narrative replayability and there's the core gameplay replayability.

425
00:30:30,107 --> 00:30:34,790
And I think just having enough...

426
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:43,346
I think you have to have enough variety to the mechanics and the sort of challenge types that you face

427
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:50,212
that can lead to pretty good replayability, and that I think is something, again, we're going to be working on in the future.

428
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:55,656
So there's like, just having enough depth there and enough...

429
00:30:56,455 --> 00:31:00,717
It's a combination of authored and random, depending on the nature of your game.

430
00:31:00,757 --> 00:31:06,858
If your game is meant to be roguelike, you need to have enough variety to how it generates each time that you feel it.

431
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,099
And that's, again, something we're working on.

432
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:14,020
In terms of narrative, I feel like we probably do a better job at that,

433
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,442
other than those easy wins that I was just talking about, in terms of dialogue repeating when it shouldn't and stuff.

434
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:21,502
Things that are almost bugs, they're so annoying.

435
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:25,163
But, you know, in terms of replayability...

436
00:31:25,537 --> 00:31:29,140
I think you have to have, when you're looking at a narrative,

437
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,005
you know, I like to say that in a lot of games that want you to replay for the narrative,

438
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:36,447
because you can make choices, get different endings,

439
00:31:36,588 --> 00:31:41,833
often you're playing, you know, it's less common for games to have a story that changes every time as we do.

440
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:44,175
And so often you'll play the game once.

441
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,682
The way you want to play it, make the narrative choices you want to make,

442
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:51,184
and then the second time you'll basically play the game how you don't want to play it,

443
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:54,246
and you'll be, oh, you got captured again.

444
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:59,248
And you'll make the opposite of the choices you made before, which is kind of not as fun, I think.

445
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:01,109
But you want to see the content, so you do that.

446
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,731
Here we're actually changing the reason for you to make the choices,

447
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:07,553
so you'll actually see the different content because the world has changed,

448
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,915
and people have complimented the game for that.

449
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:13,630
for that type of replayability.

450
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:21,455
And I think having, you know, another thing that, you know, how the game presents narrative is not as...

451
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:28,439
how to say, it's not in a conventional way as much.

452
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:32,141
Like, you get little scenes like that one you just saw with Isaac capturing you, and that's...

453
00:32:33,282 --> 00:32:37,064
not... you've been captured by an antagonist in a video game before,

454
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:40,526
and he talks to you, and then you get a chance to break out, and it's not like...

455
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,007
Oh my god, how is this narrative...

456
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,928
This is a very conventional, almost like a cutscene.

457
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:55,973
But a lot of the way the narrative is told in this game is just through the environmental storytelling and being in the world with these people, living their lives and hearing the PA and finding those documents and things.

458
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:57,794
This is what happens to me a lot when I get captured.

459
00:32:57,854 --> 00:32:59,015
Yeah, it's you.

460
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:02,036
You're not super good at breaking out, sir.

461
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,838
The key is, let me tell you, the key here is to break out when he's not looking.

462
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,580
And now I'll tell you, this is the hardest one to break out of.

463
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:16,322
I'll give you some tips, we'll see if we can walk you through it.

464
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:19,183
Nah, it's fine, we gotta talk about it. The game is nice, but...

465
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:29,566
The key here is to, you really have to time it right. So once the guard comes up to talk to you, or look at you, he'll turn his back and that's the time to break out.

466
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:31,806
Then you gotta run up and get him right away from behind.

467
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,847
Keep spinning, spinning, spinning.

468
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:37,248
Yeah, don't do that. That's not gonna...

469
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:38,988
It's just gonna wear out your cardio, man.

470
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:41,130
There's no cardio in the game.

471
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,310
You were very close to putting a cardio system in, weren't you?

472
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,152
It was brought up a couple times.

473
00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:49,013
And someone whose feedback I trusted was like,

474
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,313
nobody likes a sprint meter. Nobody.

475
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:52,994
You just put it in to annoy players.

476
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:55,095
I was like, eh, yeah, I kind of agree.

477
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:59,156
There is a version of this game that has a sprint meter that is okay.

478
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:02,658
It's just a choice we made not to do that.

479
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:05,569
Well it looks like meters, um...

480
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,210
Yeah?

481
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,973
Meters are weird, um, I probably should have killed that guy...

482
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:10,735
Um, whatever, I'm gonna put him in the cage, um...

483
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:11,717
There ya go.

484
00:34:12,598 --> 00:34:14,320
Uh, uh, meters are...

485
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,844
What are the tools that you reach for as a designer when you're trying to create a...

486
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:19,886
Like, this is such a game that speaks to, like...

487
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:21,689
This is something that real people have done...

488
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:24,232
If you go watch, um, there's two great, uh...

489
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:30,336
You can either listen to some of their great podcasts like Last Podcast on the left, it's one of my favorites.

490
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:36,480
There's a Drunk History episode about the Children of Heaven, which is...

491
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,902
Children of God, not Children of Heaven. I'm getting all these cults mixed up in my head.

492
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:43,124
Children of God is a good one.

493
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,065
Real people have done this.

494
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:49,088
How do you think about simulating realistic sensations and experiences in games like this?

495
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:49,849
How do you...

496
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:53,992
Like, the sprint meter represents you get tired when you're running,

497
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:56,493
but sprint meters are there to annoy players.

498
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:57,114
You just said so.

499
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:03,298
Yeah, I mean, it's like a health bar is also an unrealistic thing,

500
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:04,459
but we've got one of those, right?

501
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:08,792
It's an approximation of a real life event, right?

502
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:10,074
Like a sprint meter is.

503
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:13,217
That's not exactly how cardio works, but it's close enough

504
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:14,098
that it feels like it.

505
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,602
It was just one of the ones we decided not to do.

506
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:20,725
And it's interesting that the game definitely has gamey

507
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,328
systems to it, like those sight cones you're seeing.

508
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:27,409
You can't see the health bar.

509
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,912
And some people really don't like that.

510
00:35:30,553 --> 00:35:31,574
I've seen people say,

511
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,396
why can't the people see me in this case?

512
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:34,818
Why can't they do this other thing?

513
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:37,000
And I'm like, well, at the end of the day,

514
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,722
we made choices about

515
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:41,285
how realistic the game was going to be.

516
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:44,589
I think narratively, it feels pretty realistic to me.

517
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:45,931
This is really how you would

518
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:46,171
have a game.

519
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:50,967
Go about going into a cult versus if the game was a shooter or something, right?

520
00:35:50,987 --> 00:35:54,931
And you would just murder everyone in the cult and then you'd find your nephew at the end, right?

521
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:58,695
But here that's impossible because in the real world that's also impossible, right?

522
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:03,099
Here if you get into a gunfight with three people you're in real trouble.

523
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,244
Whereas, uh, you know, in a shooter that would be something that happened every minute.

524
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:09,625
It's hard to incentivize.

525
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:14,944
Right, right. So here it's like we have meters and things that are a little gamey and that it's

526
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:20,546
why can't the guy see me past this point? Well, he can't. And some people can't get over and accept,

527
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:27,448
like some people would accept that in a game that was more like a cartoony setting or just a fantasy

528
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:31,149
setting or something like that. But in a game that's otherwise realistic, that feels dissonant

529
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:36,911
to them. To me, it doesn't. And some people, it certainly doesn't. So it's an interesting reaction

530
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:38,772
that I didn't expect to get quite as much as we did.

531
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:39,697
Interesting.

532
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:44,059
Tender and tender and tender and that's a body.

533
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,761
You found a body but I destroyed the alarm box. Hopefully that works out.

534
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:50,442
Okay. Yeah.

535
00:36:50,562 --> 00:36:54,764
See, that's only each alarm box. So no one can set off that alarm box now, but

536
00:36:54,824 --> 00:36:57,365
if they find another one, they can find another one. Why would they have more

537
00:36:57,405 --> 00:37:00,567
than one alarm box? Yeah, right. People don't have more than one alarm system

538
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:01,067
in their house.

539
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:06,489
Yes, it's also a game like the way the alarm boxes is also a little gamey. And

540
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:07,470
it's certainly like there's

541
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:14,190
You know, I think for me, there's like a limit to how many vectors you can innovate on for sure.

542
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:18,574
And here we were putting it more in the trying to make the narrative replayable stuff.

543
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:26,721
Whereas a lot of the core gameplay here is like, Oh, I kind of remember this from Metal Gear, or I kind of remember this from Castle Wolfenstein, the very original Castle Wolfenstein.

544
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:29,664
That was a game I liked a lot a billion years ago.

545
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:32,006
Um, and still like, but.

546
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,589
It was just a choice to not innovate in that space, but we could have.

547
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:39,311
We could have said, well, we're trying to make the whole thing realistic,

548
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:43,653
so how would a really interesting health model work here, and what could we do with that?

549
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:46,935
And again, that would just have been, well, we're going to spend time on that

550
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:50,117
instead of spending time on making more narrative choices or something.

551
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:55,300
So usually we bias towards the narrative stuff when we came to those forks.

552
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:59,166
Right on. As I continue to migrate this world...

553
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:02,727
Um, Richard, let's talk about more fun game design things, I think.

554
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:06,849
Uh, let's talk about morality as a game design tool.

555
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,112
Um, we're all familiar with, I am a big fan of KOTOR, we're all a fan of light side and dark side bars.

556
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:16,014
Um, in this game, I had the option to, I was just mulling over the kill don't kill

557
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:18,795
of, uh, of what I was just dealing with.

558
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:24,478
Um, uh, I tend to play games like this less killy, I'm kind of of the opinion of a game.

559
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,905
If a game gives me the option to not kill, I am bound for the most part to do it.

560
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:32,870
I don't know quite why, it's not like a super great moral code.

561
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,597
I love shooting things in other games. If the game is only shooting and killing, I'm all about that.

562
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:40,160
I see my Apex Legends obsession.

563
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:51,805
But, uh, how is it you as a game designer, as your players have sorta, it's definitely made clear over the years, they want interesting games, they want interesting systems, they want to make tough moral choices.

564
00:38:51,865 --> 00:39:05,248
What's your thought for designing them? There's like kind of a narrative component here, but I wouldn't mind holding off on narrative for a minute, because that has to do with character and relationships and stuff, and just talking about like systems and bars and meters and punishment, etc.

565
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,589
Yeah, well to me, you know, the...

566
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:14,136
I see the morality system as just hopelessly intertwined between narrative and gameplay

567
00:39:14,296 --> 00:39:14,576
both.

568
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:19,198
And you can't really not talk about them both at the same time, to me, the way I think about

569
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:19,298
it.

570
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:27,502
And, you know, it's often like, you know, other games that are lovely but are different

571
00:39:27,522 --> 00:39:32,424
than this one will have like a, you know, there's like a more of a wrist slap for every

572
00:39:32,464 --> 00:39:33,625
bad thing you do, right?

573
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:37,406
And we definitely have, we definitely try to balance that here.

574
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:43,220
If you get captured, uh, you know, if you get shot, you get captured and then you

575
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,283
can break out and keep playing unless you have murdered a lot of people, in

576
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:47,744
which case they just kill you right away.

577
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:52,748
And that's a negative, that's a wrist slap for like a gameplay negative

578
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:55,951
for having made that choice, but it also makes a lot of sense, right?

579
00:39:55,971 --> 00:40:00,414
That they wouldn't take a chance on you if you had not done that.

580
00:40:00,474 --> 00:40:01,555
Whereas there are other.

581
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:07,389
You know, there's a, there's like, if you do non-lethal takedowns, people get back up again in this game.

582
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:07,930
Yeah.

583
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,931
Um, which is more, yeah.

584
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,632
Which is, go ahead.

585
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:15,714
That's an interesting one because like, for me, that system always frustrates me.

586
00:40:16,495 --> 00:40:18,116
But you're right, it's very realistic.

587
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:20,697
Like when Metal Gear does it, I was like, oh, I guess this is realistic.

588
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:27,321
Right. And certainly there's other, like Dishonored I like a lot, but I believe in that game if you do a knockout on someone, they're out for the rest of the level, basically.

589
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:27,821
Yeah.

590
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:30,183
And again, that was just a case for me of...

591
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:33,693
Well, A, how does knocking someone out actually work?

592
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:38,795
You know, if you put a sleeper hold on someone, they're not asleep for that long.

593
00:40:39,276 --> 00:40:41,857
Usually they usually wake up pretty quickly, like within a minute.

594
00:40:42,537 --> 00:40:47,520
Um, it's like, doesn't put them into a blissful night slumber, right?

595
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,400
It's, it's, it's a different part of their brain.

596
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:55,023
Um, but so it made sense that they would get up again and I just wanted again to

597
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:55,483
have a.

598
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:58,558
benefit almost to taking the negative route there.

599
00:40:58,598 --> 00:41:02,299
Whereas if you do, you know, actually break their neck and you take them down,

600
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,880
they're not going to get back up again.

601
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,781
And that might encourage you to break their neck. Cause you know,

602
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:12,283
often there is a raw mechanical benefit to doing terrible things,

603
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:13,604
but you're doing terrible things.

604
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:16,105
So then that makes it almost more of an interesting choice.

605
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:20,126
Like if the choice is like things always go badly, if I make negative choices,

606
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,347
then I guess I won't make negative choices. It has to be balanced of like.

607
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:29,925
There are some negative consequences to doing good things, and there are some positive consequences to doing good things.

608
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:32,626
And it's sort of tricky to decide.

609
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:36,587
You know, you have to decide as a player what you're willing to put up with

610
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:40,328
and how important, like, getting an ending where you haven't killed anyone is.

611
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:44,730
Yeah. In this game, I will assure viewers that it's quite difficult.

612
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,771
And that's another interesting thing is how how

613
00:41:49,904 --> 00:41:53,607
The range of how difficult people find this game continues to fascinate me,

614
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:56,869
because some people will like, this game's too easy.

615
00:41:57,069 --> 00:42:00,591
And that's always the case, that some people find it easy and some people find it too hard.

616
00:42:00,611 --> 00:42:05,875
But I think it's worse in this game for, because of the nature of stealth mechanics, maybe.

617
00:42:06,716 --> 00:42:10,638
And just like learning how the, if you figure out how the systems work really well,

618
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:12,460
it becomes a lot easier.

619
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,161
And if you just struggle with them, it stays hard, you know.

620
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:18,003
So there's a little bit more of a hump there than I wish there was.

621
00:42:19,632 --> 00:42:23,995
So that may be something we look at in the future as well, in terms of like, slightly better tutorial for that stuff.

622
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:28,018
Yep, Richard, we're coming towards the end of our hour here, we've only got a little bit of time left with you.

623
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:33,042
I guess I'll just start off by asking, what's next for you as a game designer?

624
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:38,746
You've got a nice story, you've done some really cool games with companies, you've struck out on your own as an independent designer,

625
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:43,250
you've shipped a game that was kind of a passion project, what do you think is next for you on the horizon?

626
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:47,633
Yeah, that's a good question, that I do not have...

627
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:54,028
Um, perfect answer to, I'm sort of right now focused on these things that I wish

628
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:55,228
were in this game that aren't yet.

629
00:42:56,029 --> 00:43:01,351
Um, we've got PAX coming up and the panel we're doing there and, um, things

630
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:02,592
sort of leading up after that.

631
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:07,554
And I, as I said, I see benefits to working on a large team that

632
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:08,795
I really liked and missed.

633
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:12,717
And, you know, working in your office by yourself can be really

634
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:16,398
isolating in a lot of ways, but can also be really rewarding because

635
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:17,899
it's more your personal thing.

636
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:22,721
So I see pluses and minuses and I can't say for sure which I'll do next.

637
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:26,644
It sort of depends what opportunities pop up.

638
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:31,108
But I'm definitely starting to think about that while right now just wishing I had finished

639
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:31,808
this patch already.

640
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:36,572
Yeah, and for those at home, we're just, as Scooby-Doo alluded to a couple times, we are

641
00:43:36,632 --> 00:43:41,295
playing the PS4 version of the game, which is mostly just a, that was my own request

642
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:44,898
because it's how we can basically make the stream happen as we play these games on console.

643
00:43:46,768 --> 00:43:52,069
The game is also on some other systems, Xbox, Switch, and PC, and Mac.

644
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:54,409
How do you feel about the Switch? We've been asking a lot of devs about it.

645
00:43:54,429 --> 00:43:58,130
I mean, it's sort of... It's been a couple years now, so it's not quite as hot new,

646
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,131
but how do you feel about making games for the Switch?

647
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:04,791
Yeah, I mean, it's a delightful device.

648
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:11,093
I mean, my favorite thing about developing for the Switch is I can go play my game on the couch,

649
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:14,333
like literally play, which is the same thing that attracts a lot of people to it.

650
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,960
full featured modern console experience,

651
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,722
if a little less powerful than the other ones.

652
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:23,464
But, you know, when it's time to go do a play through there,

653
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:26,506
I can leave my desk and go relax somewhere while testing something.

654
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,588
So that's fun for as a developer.

655
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:33,511
You know, it's a it's a different system.

656
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,713
So it's like I'm definitely glad Nintendo didn't just make,

657
00:44:37,934 --> 00:44:40,676
you know, a system that was exactly like their competitors.

658
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:44,359
And I think that's always good for the industry and Nintendo's.

659
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,502
I'm going to take us out a little early if you don't mind.

660
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:10,894
That's just fine.

661
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:11,595
Yeah.

662
00:45:11,635 --> 00:45:14,895
Richard, if they've got questions for you about making games or about the great GDC

663
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:18,036
talks that you've been a part of, where should they ask them?

664
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:24,718
Yeah, so I'm on Twitter at RichardRouseIII, and you can come find me there.

665
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:29,399
I try to respond to as many people as possible, though it doesn't always happen, so you can

666
00:45:29,419 --> 00:45:30,260
always hit me back.

667
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,181
Usually not in my DMs unless I already know you.

668
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,411
Sometimes the question is better there, that's fine too.

669
00:45:39,032 --> 00:45:44,074
You can also, you know, the game has a website at paranoidproductions.com slash church.

670
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:45,434
We got a mailing list there.

671
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:48,936
There's also a Discord run by the game's publisher.

672
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:55,458
The game is published by Fellow Traveler, a lovely publisher of a variety of narrative indie games.

673
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:58,640
They have a Discord that you can find on their website.

674
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,000
So if you go to Fellow Traveler...

675
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:06,080
.games is their URL up on there, the community button and that'll take you to the discord.

676
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,621
And I try to get in there and answer. I'm not on there constantly.

677
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:17,244
Definitely had some really fun chats with fans and other developers on there. So come by there if you've got questions.

678
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:18,244
That's a good place for it.

679
00:46:18,624 --> 00:46:21,125
Probably slightly better than Twitter, but Twitter is good too.

680
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:27,607
And you know those are the main places or you know come to a talk at GDC or just come up to me in the hall

681
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:28,768
at GDC if you happen to see me.

682
00:46:29,678 --> 00:46:33,860
Right on. With that, I'm going to take us out.

683
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,461
If you're new to this channel, we'd appreciate it if you tossed the follow our way.

684
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:40,702
And if you are not new to this channel,

685
00:46:41,243 --> 00:46:45,004
you know, you can join us at XRDC later this year if you're interested in VR content,

686
00:46:45,504 --> 00:46:47,705
or if you are VR, AR, and beyond,

687
00:46:48,386 --> 00:46:52,147
or if you're a game developer, please join us at the Game Developers Conference next year in March.

688
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:54,908
With that, have a good day everyone!

689
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:57,374
I'm glad you got to the pigs right at the end.

690
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:58,036
Yeah, I found the pigs.

691
00:46:58,056 --> 00:46:59,118
One of my favorite things in the game.

692
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:00,021
They're very important.

693
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:00,622
Love the pigs.

694
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:01,905
Pigs are very important.

695
00:47:02,467 --> 00:47:03,068
Bye, everybody.
