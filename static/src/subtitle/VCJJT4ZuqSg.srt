1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:09,657
Check? Can you guys hear me?

2
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:14,581
Alright, before we forget here, Tiny Panther...

3
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:19,164
...de-clawed.

4
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:23,106
Any more before we begin?

5
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:26,428
Is that a sick pet idea?

6
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:29,210
Hold on, we gotta amp it up a little bit.

7
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:33,753
Turtle with...

8
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:38,296
Yeah, double turtle?

9
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:41,438
Double turtle.

10
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:43,238
It's like a double Dracula,

11
00:00:43,278 --> 00:00:45,940
like whenever a Dracula bites another Dracula.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,561
Weird shit happens.

13
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,102
Anyway, so, guys,

14
00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:52,003
thank you so much for being here,

15
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:54,144
and I'm Matt Pearsall,

16
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:56,385
I'm going to kind of show you guys

17
00:00:57,586 --> 00:00:58,526
my process,

18
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:00,647
and I don't use it exclusively, but...

19
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:05,288
I'm working on a game right now for the last few years called Prey,

20
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:11,009
and 98% of all the sound effects were created more or less in this fashion.

21
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:20,971
As some more seasoned veterans in here will know that the world of editing-based sound design

22
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:28,593
can be really fatiguing and uninspiring after, say, I don't know, 5, 10 years of your career.

23
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:34,952
And what I found is I found my job at one point became a job.

24
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,433
And what I wanted to do, well,

25
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:40,195
backstory, my Pro Tools rig crashed.

26
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:44,477
And my computer crashed, and so I had,

27
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:47,018
and I wanted to travel, and I realized one day,

28
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:48,839
I'm like, I'm a contractor.

29
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,240
I don't have to go,

30
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,341
don't have to be tied down to my studio.

31
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:57,183
And so I grabbed this, and this, and this, and this,

32
00:01:57,907 --> 00:02:01,130
And I went to Europe for a few months and just worked remotely.

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,714
And it was really a great way to sort of re-evaluate

34
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:08,676
what I find important about game audio.

35
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:10,057
And it made me fall in love with it again.

36
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:13,480
So the process that I'm going to describe today, who am I?

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,683
I'm going to talk about myself for probably 22 more minutes.

38
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,446
And then we can get into heavy stuff.

39
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:21,186
I'm just kidding.

40
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:22,447
You know what?

41
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:24,809
Like, I'm whatever.

42
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:25,230
I'm Matt.

43
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,150
I make video games.

44
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,888
you can ask me my credit list afterwards.

45
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:30,869
Backstory, computer crashed.

46
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:32,990
Really, really annoying Pro Tools update.

47
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,911
I'm sure many of you experienced that.

48
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:37,493
Yeah, many crashes.

49
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:39,554
Anyway, so let's just get started.

50
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:45,177
So I have prepared, I was gonna do something today.

51
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:48,199
I was thinking like something that would demonstrate

52
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,960
this process really well.

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,061
And there's really two phases to this.

54
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,322
There's a source creation phase.

55
00:02:54,897 --> 00:02:57,998
and then there's what I would consider the compositional phase.

56
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,981
Today our focus is going to be on creating ice magic,

57
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:06,083
so that could just sort of riff on that concept.

58
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:08,384
And a lot of what I do is,

59
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:13,707
I tend to stay, like I tend to look at the visual once or twice,

60
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:19,770
try to look at it in game, but I don't actually vidcap it to begin.

61
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,891
I wait to do that and I just sort of...

62
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:29,188
riff on a general concept and then sort of piece those elements together in the game.

63
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,089
So we have some source here.

64
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,131
I want to start here.

65
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,233
This is a way that I would gather source material.

66
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:45,318
Right here we have some, this is just a synth, but this is the Aztec death whistle.

67
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:48,199
And a whale.

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,321
Because I was thinking like whales.

69
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:54,997
kind of, to me, like I just go like stream of consciousness.

70
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:58,838
So for some reason, the clicky whale thing spoke ice to me.

71
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:01,639
Plus, I think a few of them live in Antarctica

72
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,020
where there's still ice for the next couple of years.

73
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,180
Anyway.

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,240
Ah!

75
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:05,300
Ah!

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,761
I wanna start there, something nice and gentle.

77
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:08,981
Say cheese.

78
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:09,461
Everyone say cheese.

79
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:09,801
I love to cheese.

80
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:09,941
Cheese.

81
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:10,081
Cheese.

82
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:10,221
Cheese.

83
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:10,361
Cheese.

84
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:10,501
Cheese.

85
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:10,641
Cheese.

86
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:10,781
Cheese.

87
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:10,921
Cheese.

88
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:11,061
Cheese.

89
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:11,201
Cheese.

90
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,422
A quesadilla?

91
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:14,202
Feel like a quesadilla?

92
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:14,822
Spread it on the court?

93
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:15,682
I'll do it on the court.

94
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:17,363
You wanna put it on the court too,

95
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,903
Just something that you could, you know,

96
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,384
when you're talking to your mom,

97
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:26,465
you could just sort of say,

98
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:29,126
hey mom, this is how I feel about this.

99
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,068
I'm an individual mom, you don't understand me.

100
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,752
That's dope, I don't care.

101
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,572
That's dope.

102
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:45,035
Okay, so from there, I put these into a drum rack

103
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:46,236
and you guys can see this here.

104
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,417
I'll lift up the screen a bit.

105
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,187
and we'll focus on this aspect of it.

106
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:52,289
Ah, fuck, I can't.

107
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,531
Anyway, um...

108
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:58,439
So, we've got this sample in the bank now,

109
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:02,365
and let's see what we can do with it.

110
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:08,540
So my process right now, this is what I would consider to be on the top layer here you can see

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,383
what I have is I would say that's my grounding source, that's actual ice. But I don't start

112
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:18,325
there and the reason I don't start there is I feel like it's best to explore the abstract

113
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:23,768
before you explore the reality. Reality is easy. When you're fatigued you can always base your

114
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:28,671
sound in reality. But when your brain is fresh, when your brain is creative, you can handle the

115
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,392
abstract in a much more efficient way.

116
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:32,284
So I'm going to set a loop point here.

117
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,867
Now I have basically a running loop,

118
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:37,470
and I'm just going to start fucking around.

119
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:44,557
So this is some of my source I created about 10 minutes ago.

120
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:46,980
All right, so.

121
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,364
Okay, so what I like about this process,

122
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:08,085
so we have this, and this is just a general concept.

123
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:11,006
Now from here, I'm gonna actually switch to

124
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,707
what I would consider a more traditional editing mode.

125
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:16,868
And let's just take a look at kind of what we have here.

126
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:20,289
So I've got this,

127
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:25,211
and we're gonna furl down to what I have built.

128
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:26,291
This is my template.

129
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:30,792
So I always have like a set SFX,

130
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:31,933
what I call SFX group.

131
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,173
And I like that because I can just open the session

132
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:37,554
and it's always ready to go with no questions.

133
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:41,175
So we're just gonna see kind of what we have here.

134
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:44,095
And like, you know, it's weird.

135
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:49,597
But you know, maybe we could do something interesting

136
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:55,418
with a few of these.

137
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:00,920
Great.

138
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:09,526
I don't think that's recording properly.

139
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:38,058
I'm going to take that over here.

140
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:43,362
and we're going to pull it back to our drum rack.

141
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,508
So now we can begin there.

142
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:53,513
So in a more clear fashion, I'm going to set one loop.

143
00:08:57,898 --> 00:08:59,079
Okay, so we got this.

144
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,851
Okay, so I kind of like that.

145
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:46,794
So we start there, now we have this again.

146
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,935
We're gonna pull this back into our more arrangement view.

147
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:56,497
And we've got that going on, right?

148
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,699
Okay, so something that I really love doing,

149
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,420
and maybe you cats are hip to it.

150
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:06,976
I'm going to like just, I feel really naked and vulnerable right now

151
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:10,137
because I'm going to show you guys something that I use

152
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:11,698
and it's a little hacky.

153
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:14,400
Anyway, let's jump right in.

154
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,301
So, kick.

155
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:21,463
This is my favorite kick of all time.

156
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:24,125
This is a sound morph kick.

157
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:26,626
Those of you that are familiar.

158
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,408
Yeah, that's it.

159
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,969
Okay, so...

160
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:40,220
I take this, and so for now, I'm going to just slice this tiny bit and then leave the

161
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:48,845
rest. Okay? And I think spiritually and emotionally we can agree that's a decent idea. So we're

162
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:59,110
going to give it another step here. Right? Okay. Now remember the thing we recorded earlier.

163
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:05,447
So I'm thinking like I'm just riffing here, but I'm thinking about that, that screamy

164
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:10,431
thing, you know, the whole mom thing, and that was a journey that we went through together

165
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:15,576
and I fucking feel so close to you guys.

166
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:21,541
So I want to bring that back, I want to find that again somewhere in all of this madness.

167
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:41,287
That's it.

168
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,548
Okay, cool.

169
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:49,849
And what's beautiful about this is like these things can like

170
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,050
fairly seamlessly work together

171
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,711
when you're not mildly nervous.

172
00:11:58,011 --> 00:11:59,372
Let's see. You know what guys?

173
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:03,913
I thought about it and I thought about, you know, like how far we've come

174
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:05,793
and I'm just going to re-record it.

175
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:07,153
It's that easy.

176
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:23,214
Cool. All right, let's drag this back into our concept here.

177
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:27,158
And...

178
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:31,362
Cool, we've got this.

179
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:35,686
We'll call this the Mom, You Don't Understand Me sound.

180
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:38,969
We're going to pop this here. Yeah.

181
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:52,588
Okay, I like that.

182
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:55,409
So I kinda wanna add a little bit more

183
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,950
sort of high frequency content.

184
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,671
So to do that, I'm going to pull up

185
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:09,933
an operator.

186
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:13,554
And what's great about operator is, again,

187
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:15,995
this is all kind of on the fly here.

188
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:20,557
We can go into operator and we're gonna select white noise.

189
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:25,465
That's what white noise sounds like in my heart.

190
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:27,406
OK.

191
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,011
Filter.

192
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:41,993
Let's do.

193
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:44,434
Cool.

194
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:47,436
All right, so we'll grab that.

195
00:13:54,175 --> 00:14:01,300
Okay, cool. So once I have this, I'm just going to drag it as MIDI into the sound right now.

196
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:16,649
And that's obviously not working very well for timing, so we're just going to record it and make an audio file.

197
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,410
Cool. Okay.

198
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,450
There's a tool that I like to use a lot. It's called PsyQ.

199
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,292
Are you guys familiar with this? It's a Sound Toys plug-in.

200
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:47,294
And what it allows you to do is distort or use harmonic distortion only on certain frequencies.

201
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:53,936
So we're going to add harmonic distortion in the 900 range.

202
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:59,639
Cool. There's something else that's kind of exciting,

203
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:02,640
that's sort of off-topic, on-topic that I've been into.

204
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:10,636
And that is this, I built this, it's like a granulator.

205
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:13,618
I don't know if you guys know granulator, but you can take any sound source

206
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,801
and essentially loop it, it's a very simple granular tool.

207
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:20,164
Now, if you notice, see how the EQ is going wild right now?

208
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:26,008
What I've done is add a Max for Live plug-in on this called Randomize.

209
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:29,411
And it just takes your whatever plug-in you want

210
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,473
and just literally randomizes it.

211
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:33,256
like a crazy person.

212
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:34,837
Now when you first launch it,

213
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:38,200
the preset is sort of set to dude on speed.

214
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:42,484
But this is like dude kind of coming down from speed.

215
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,386
So let's see how this sounds.

216
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:48,169
And it's kind of a cool way to create

217
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:49,950
some interesting source material.

218
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:52,412
Let's get off that.

219
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,454
So yeah.

220
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:59,078
So just one button has a lot of movement.

221
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:07,340
But now when you add in the file positioning in Granulator, as well as this Diffuse EQ,

222
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,002
which is essentially like a dub style spring reverb.

223
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:22,044
So let's record a few of those and try those in the mix.

224
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:28,546
You know, it sounded really easy to do sound design in front of people.

225
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,538
Self-destruct.

226
00:16:44,598 --> 00:16:45,138
Defeat.

227
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:47,359
Break.

228
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,239
Destroy.

229
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:50,999
Break.

230
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,780
Destroy.

231
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,701
Alright, I like that last one.

232
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:57,941
That has a nice flow to it.

233
00:16:59,202 --> 00:16:59,742
I thought that

234
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:01,262
again

235
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:03,823
seeing as how we've been through so much

236
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:05,923
together, that one sort of is more representative

237
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,064
of us as a couple.

238
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:10,124
Oh, by the way,

239
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:10,925
side note,

240
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:18,059
pet peeve, people that overprove how happy they are in their relationship on Facebook.

241
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,723
They're like, I had a friend and it was, he's the funniest thing I've ever seen. Never mind,

242
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:31,148
maybe I should tell this story not here. It's really good though. Trust me, it does involve

243
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,150
nudity. And social media.

244
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:10,188
Ok, so for now we're going to leave that.

245
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,629
But the cool thing about this is that we can go

246
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:16,889
riff on this and absolutely make

247
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,970
hundreds of iterations. The reason that I like the drum rack

248
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,691
is because once I have this, so for example I'll title this

249
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:27,851
Ice Magic, I can save this rack

250
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,872
and instantly pull it up. So for things like

251
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,973
sounds that you make like

252
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,113
consistently

253
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:38,377
you can have basically like a little drum rack library

254
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:42,038
of quick, quickly accessible things.

255
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:43,799
And I think I have a few in here.

256
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,821
My laptop crashed recently,

257
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:47,961
so I might have lost some of them.

258
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,802
But within my user library,

259
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:53,924
I've got these patches here.

260
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:57,526
Can you guys still hear me?

261
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,006
Okay.

262
00:18:59,407 --> 00:18:59,887
Presets.

263
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:03,188
Instruments.

264
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:07,609
Transcribe, okay.

265
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,917
Drum rack, click.

266
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:17,141
Okay, yeah, this is stuff I've made quite a long time ago.

267
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:19,383
Let's see.

268
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,607
This is called 30 Seconds Left.

269
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:23,508
I have no idea what this is.

270
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:39,102
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

271
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:45,786
This is all stuff I live recorded actually.

272
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:50,289
Trying to... making some sort of stinger things.

273
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,314
So it's stuff like, you know, like really simple stuff but...

274
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:04,578
But what's cool is like, you know, I could just pull that up

275
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:06,720
and just have that instantly to mess with.

276
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:10,703
So I wanted to show you guys one other thing that I really enjoy doing.

277
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:17,806
So first we're going to create some source and then we're going to try a quick concepted creature sound.

278
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:22,869
So this could go like this is I want you guys to know this could go really wrong.

279
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:25,850
But we're going to give it a go. We're going to be better friends.

280
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,192
OK. All right. So let's begin.

281
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:34,655
Let's let's say we're doing some kind of I don't know some typical space Satan type shit.

282
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:42,883
So for now, that's not really space satan-y enough,

283
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:44,005
but we're going to bring the evil.

284
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,018
Okay, we've got this loop going.

285
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:25,839
There's a reason for this.

286
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:30,499
And the reason is, I'm sure you guys already got it,

287
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,280
but this is our core tone.

288
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,361
Now, let's take that core tone, we're going to mute it for right now,

289
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:43,042
and this is going to be the mic channel.

290
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:48,883
So, yeah, this is fucking terrifying.

291
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:49,543
Real.

292
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:50,343
Yeah.

293
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:53,843
Let's see.

294
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:55,623
All right.

295
00:21:57,964 --> 00:21:59,184
This is going to be our mic channel now,

296
00:21:59,204 --> 00:22:00,865
because the other ones are not working, gang.

297
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,105
Right?

298
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:04,386
I mean, that's pretty space satany.

299
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:26,005
All right.

300
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:32,527
So you take this, and we definitely don't do that.

301
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:34,007
We're gonna pop it here.

302
00:22:34,668 --> 00:22:40,449
Okay, so we're gonna pull up our old friend, the vocoder,

303
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,191
and we're going to use the space Satan's tone

304
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:52,012
as our carrier tone, or one or the other, I don't know.

305
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:53,692
I'm not a fucking scientist, dudes.

306
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:55,393
I'm a.

307
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:57,209
I'm a barely functioning adult.

308
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:58,510
Anyway.

309
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,031
So, audio from, and that's SFX 1.

310
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:08,692
So let's just see, it's not going to sound great just yet, but we'll just see.

311
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:14,974
Cool.

312
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:17,275
That's not as bad as I thought it would be.

313
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:24,257
It's a little on the digital tip tip, but it's, you know, I don't hate it.

314
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:28,243
That's another thing that can help you as a sound designer,

315
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:31,004
is just kind of, in general, just like your stuff.

316
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:32,405
You know?

317
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,007
You know, like, I mean, like it pays to be a little cocky,

318
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:39,308
quite honestly, like, I'm just gonna say,

319
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:41,989
pro tip, this goes beyond sound design.

320
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:45,230
If you don't like what you're doing, go fuck yourself.

321
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,131
Seriously, why are you doing it?

322
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,652
Anyway, but I mean that in like a loving,

323
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:51,213
it's like a loving go fuck yourself,

324
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:52,873
not like a go fuck yourself.

325
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:55,782
It's more like, go fuck yourself.

326
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:58,803
Okay.

327
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:02,603
So this is some whale source material that I pulled in.

328
00:24:03,804 --> 00:24:07,344
And we're going to use a trick that I'm sure you guys all know.

329
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:12,125
But I'm just going to show you kind of, this is again, this is my process.

330
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:21,387
We're going to gate this on and off side chain from SFX3, which is our Space Satan voice.

331
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:22,127
Okay.

332
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:37,837
We're going to take the attack up a bit and pull the release, and again, just see what we can get.

333
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:45,240
Okay. Right. Now, here's the issue. What is the issue?

334
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:52,364
The issue is that we're running into that problem where you layer so many things that it sounds like animal choir.

335
00:24:53,303 --> 00:24:54,544
Fuck, that's a great band name.

336
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:56,105
Animal Choir.

337
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,846
I mean, it's already Animal Collective,

338
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,606
but I don't think it could be like a whole different deal.

339
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:02,088
You're welcome.

340
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:04,529
Worth the money, right?

341
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,891
Okay, so I'm gonna pull something in

342
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:12,313
to try and make this more cohesive.

343
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:16,074
And this is tough, you know, because honestly,

344
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,456
this is something that I would sort of sit down and do

345
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:21,797
and like think about and not have to like.

346
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:29,885
Like I did not have diarrhea while trying to speak anyway, um, yeah, it went great mom

347
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:37,529
We're all best friends now, okay, so I'm pulling up

348
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:42,011
Crystallizer and I'm doing this because I find that like when

349
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:49,255
When you have a group that sort of pitches together it stitches together. It just came up with that that down

350
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:51,876
money money, baby

351
00:25:52,497 --> 00:26:00,542
OK, we'll do detune, we'll go doublers on this, and we're going to pull our mix.

352
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:05,925
We'll pitch it.

353
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:15,711
So I want to make up for some of that high-end EQ that we lost, so I'm going to go back to...

354
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:22,979
sound toys here and pull up Psy-Q. I'm really, really into distortion right now.

355
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,303
It's something that I used to stay away from, but I've been able to get some really good results from it.

356
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:31,904
sound effects

357
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:41,809
Ok, I'm going to say, like, for doing that in 7 minutes...

358
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:49,233
It's not the worst thing.

359
00:26:50,393 --> 00:26:55,375
I'm going to do something I wasn't sure that I was going to do, but I really love you guys.

360
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,375
Oh, do you like this?

361
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:01,236
My name in my session is SickGDCPrezi.

362
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,277
Ice magic.

363
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:09,878
A dude recently got a hold of me named Ice Mage and I was like, we've got to be friends.

364
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:14,019
So this is a project I've been working on.

365
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,231
And I'm going to look through here and I'm going to find some of the more,

366
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:21,311
like I'm going to find a sound and kind of run you guys through how I did it.

367
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:22,792
Cool? Yeah?

368
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:23,612
Okay.

369
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:25,032
How much time do you have?

370
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:25,953
I don't know.

371
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:28,553
Oh, I don't, I have two minutes.

372
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:30,094
Never mind, I'm not going to run you through it.

373
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:33,755
Does anyone have any questions?

374
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:38,356
Hey, you know what? Fuck it.

375
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:42,197
I'm going to open a session and just show you guys very briefly.

376
00:27:43,617 --> 00:27:45,017
Oh yeah, okay.

377
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:48,560
This is the into fear state.

378
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:51,882
So basically, big monster comes, you're like,

379
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:55,304
oh man, that monster's really scary.

380
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:57,846
And then you're like, your camera starts shaking

381
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:01,348
and you can't move your character very easily.

382
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:04,611
This is a very simple jam here.

383
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:07,793
And yeah, it's a very similar process.

384
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,414
This is all based on the drum rack

385
00:28:09,774 --> 00:28:10,835
and let's see what we got.

386
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:12,416
Yeah.

387
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:19,994
I must be lost in the dark,

388
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:21,816
seeking the key to the door that I lost.

389
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:24,998
Dude, I must be way into space Satan stuff.

390
00:28:25,658 --> 00:28:27,920
Okay, so I'm gonna just run you guys through my bounces

391
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,783
and it'll kind of like, as you see, from top to bottom,

392
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:35,285
you'll notice that sometimes they're randomized,

393
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,547
but typically it's like idea one, idea two,

394
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:38,908
idea three, idea four.

395
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:40,429
I put those in a random container

396
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:41,670
and see what works best, see what sticks.

397
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,111
So, here's fear in, I think.

398
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:56,239
This is a concept for the loop, the beginning of right before you get feared.

399
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:59,760
It's like to bring tension.

400
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:07,202
That's just my voice being weird.

401
00:29:08,402 --> 00:29:09,522
I don't know what this is.

402
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:12,463
Nevermind, that's dope.

403
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:16,004
It's another element that I layered on.

404
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,820
And that's essentially the final with the additional layers.

405
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,401
I think, you know, in retrospect, now that I'm looking at this,

406
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,522
something... time is the biggest teacher.

407
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:30,944
Something that I didn't do in that final that I wish I would have done

408
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:32,865
is push the two elements.

409
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,425
There's a high-end element and there's a low-end element.

410
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:38,227
And I wish I would have been more ballsy with those elements

411
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:40,047
because I feel like they got buried in the mix.

412
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:43,169
Anyway, thank you guys so much for having me.

413
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,650
We can talk after. And thanks again.

414
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,690
I really appreciate it.
