1
00:00:03,723 --> 00:00:06,345
Thanks for being awake at 10 a.m. on a Tuesday, everybody.

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,128
Don't forget to turn off your cell phones, fill out the

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:12,170
questionnaire at the end, all that good stuff. And also, we

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,052
are hoping to have enough time for a little bit of Q&A at the

5
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:16,574
end, but rather than use the microphones, we are going to ask

6
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,957
you to tweet questions to at Steve Swink as you go along.

7
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:22,834
So keep those questions in mind.

8
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:24,615
And also we'll go to the wrap up room after this.

9
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:25,276
By the way panelists,

10
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:26,497
we're gonna go to the wrap up room after this.

11
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:26,857
Okay.

12
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,299
So right, this panel features five panelists,

13
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:32,240
all of whom have released games into the marketplace.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,961
And those games feature a range of success

15
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,222
to not so success.

16
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:37,363
Embodies different platforms,

17
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:38,544
different approaches to the market,

18
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,225
different backgrounds in indie games.

19
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:41,606
And as Steve mentioned,

20
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,627
our goal is to elevate this discussion with hard data,

21
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:44,828
both from our own businesses,

22
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:46,970
researched from the internet and other places.

23
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,891
And also some speculation and subjective ideas as well.

24
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:52,913
One thing we all agree on is that this word is super crappy.

25
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:54,713
It's very button pushing and reductionist.

26
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,694
It implies things that no one here believes in.

27
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:59,075
So we think of this as like a market phenomenon,

28
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:00,615
maybe a slump or a downturn.

29
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:04,017
And we're hoping to address all of these types of topics.

30
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:05,737
First panelist is Jeff Vogel.

31
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:07,818
He is the president of SpiderWeb Software.

32
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,739
They've been making indie games for 20 years

33
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,579
and because of the consistency in these games,

34
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,920
Jeff has been in a great position to notice market trends

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,461
and this has made him a high profile indiepocalypse blogger

36
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,161
in the past few years.

37
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:22,023
We have Rebecca Saltzman, CEO of Finji. This is a small

38
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:24,323
publisher and developer of recognized indie games who

39
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:27,304
stretches all the way back to cannibals. They recently

40
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:29,964
released panoramical and feist. And they have upcoming releases

41
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:33,185
overland and night in the woods. We have Ayman Ibrajagic who is

42
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:36,686
a game designer and PR manager of coffee stain studios. Best

43
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:39,027
known for the wildly successful goat simulator. But he's also

44
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,267
going to be talking about the sanctum series of games.

45
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:45,490
This is Jordan Thomas, the co-owner of Question who

46
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,014
recently released Magic Circle. He's a recent addition from the

47
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:51,876
mainstream industry where he worked on the BioShock series

48
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,839
among other things. And myself, I'm Randy Smith, co-owner of

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,782
TigerStyle, we're best known for iOS releases. There's two spider

50
00:01:57,802 --> 00:02:00,164
games in Waking Mars and we have a little bit of a foothold in

51
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:01,005
the Steam market as well.

52
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:05,158
So is the indie apocalypse a real thing? We've all read those

53
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,960
blog posts about indies not making as much money these days.

54
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,082
Sometimes lots, lots less money. We've heard scary stories about

55
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:13,323
games that should have been successful but weren't. I've

56
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:15,865
unfortunately heard a couple since I've arrived at GDC this

57
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,607
year. This is usually contextualized as a relationship

58
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,649
of supply versus demand. Supply is going up, demand isn't

59
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:22,149
keeping pace.

60
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,711
One of our biggest market places is obviously steam.

61
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:29,614
And the data we're looking at here and all of our steam data is credited to the steam

62
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:31,895
spy guy who generously provided this stuff.

63
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:35,458
And what we're looking at is how many games were released each year into steam.

64
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:37,519
And you can see obviously it curves up.

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,723
The green light is considered one of the horsemen of the indie apocalypse.

66
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,864
This is where it was launched in August of 2012.

67
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:49,606
about a year later is the first time a batch of 100 games was

68
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:52,787
green lit at once. And by the end of 2014 we have many

69
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:55,948
hundreds of games being green lit in just a few days. So no

70
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:58,208
big surprise here. You open the flood gates there's more supply

71
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:02,489
in the market. Looking at demand we can take a look at owners. So

72
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:05,530
what this is the total number of owners for all those games

73
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,991
released in that year. So for all 86 games released in 2010 if

74
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,232
you add up all their owners it's something like $17.1 million.

75
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,133
Now there's an obvious upward trend here.

76
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,393
and the reason it goes down in 2015 is because those games came

77
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,974
out more recently and they had less time to accrue owners. So

78
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:24,255
it's hard to know exactly where this should be but probably we

79
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,856
can assume it's at least as big as 2014. Now there's a really

80
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:30,116
important disclaimer here that because of the way the steam spy

81
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,977
algorithms work if a game accrues less than 1,000 new

82
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:36,257
owners per month the margin of error for that data is enormous.

83
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,518
So there's a lot of noise in this data. I included the high

84
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:40,838
margin of error noise data.

85
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,049
So we can put both of those sets of data on the same graph and

86
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:50,472
we can even divide total owners by total games. And so the peak

87
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:53,653
here is in 2011 with just shy of like half a million owners per

88
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:56,034
game. But importantly that's just really crude math. There's

89
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:59,636
no mythical average game. But what we do see is this general

90
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:00,436
downward trend.

91
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,877
The reason we use owners as a metric is because valve doesn't

92
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:08,399
make public steam's total sales numbers each year. But steam

93
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,861
spy was able to estimate the size of the market and hot off

94
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:13,483
the presses here for the first time ever thanks to Sergey again

95
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:16,145
the steam spy guy. We have some numbers which estimate the size

96
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:20,388
of indie games market in particular. So there's some

97
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,249
important disclaimers I mentioned below. Most

98
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,811
importantly because Sergey is a lot more rigorous about data

99
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,174
than I am. He refused to include any games that accrue less than

100
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:29,174
1,000 owners per month.

101
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:33,916
that includes a lot of indie games. But basically what we can

102
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:36,677
see here is that valve processes significantly more than $1

103
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:40,178
billion of indie game sales every year and it's right around

104
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:43,179
one third of their overall games market. So that's pretty cool

105
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:46,500
stuff. Turning our attention to the mobile market, this is data

106
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,281
published by statista. Some important disclaimers, this is

107
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:50,881
just Apple, the app store.

108
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:54,182
games. It's not indie games. It's all games. And moreover,

109
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:57,243
only the dark blue part of this bar is games. The rest of it is

110
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,244
like all apps. So what we're looking at is between July 2008

111
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:04,286
and July 2015. This is the number of apps in the app store

112
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:07,467
total in the thousands. So we're approaching 2 million apps by

113
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:07,827
the middle of 2015.

114
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:13,378
And then demand, this is sort of covering the same time frame

115
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,799
and what we're looking at is the number of downloads in the

116
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,201
billions. And so we're approaching 100 billion

117
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:22,243
downloads by 2015. So you can really crudely superimpose these

118
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,945
two graphs in photoshop and see if there's anything worth

119
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,066
noting. It kind of looks like in 2011 and 2012 supply is growing

120
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:27,466
faster than demand.

121
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:33,669
catch back up by 2014. There is a disclaimer here of course

122
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,870
which is that free to play. The freemium apps are only about 11

123
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,051
percent of the apps on the app store but they acquire 92 percent

124
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:45,652
of the revenue. This is the beginning of 2015. So free to

125
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:49,713
play is another one of the horsemen of the indie apocalypse.

126
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:54,774
It was introduced in the middle of 2009. March 2011 is the

127
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:57,235
first time freemium revenue overtook premium revenue and it

128
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:57,715
never went back.

129
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:02,676
want to be clear it's very easy to be misleading with data even

130
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:06,177
if you're not intending to be. As a primary example those prior

131
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:10,378
slides don't prove it's harder to succeed today than it was in

132
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,299
2012. For example I heard a theory that a lot of newcomers

133
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,260
to the market are hobbyists and they're not taking out more

134
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,400
demand than they're putting in.

135
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:23,162
That's a possibility. We did our best to do this 100% properly

136
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:25,382
as a month long research project for each of us. That's not what

137
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,403
we did. But we are going to try to present you with some good

138
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:31,544
information anyway. So here we go. Without further ado. Let's

139
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:42,347
bring up Jeff Vogel. That was terrifying. I just want to go

140
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,768
back to my hotel room and cry. Hi, I'm Jeff.

141
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:50,634
check, check. Okay, who am I? Why am I standing here? I run a

142
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:53,256
little mom and pop shop called spider web software. We're based

143
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:58,439
in Seattle. We are older than the stones and the dirt. There's

144
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,742
my URL, Twitter and a blog upon which I've written a fair amount

145
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:04,923
on this topic, which is why I'm standing here.

146
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,880
And what do we do? We write fantasy role playing games.

147
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,004
Really old school, cheap, retro, Mac, Windows, iPad, Linux and

148
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,425
Android. I can get someone to do the port for me. Very text

149
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:19,327
heavy, very story heavy. Most importantly, all of our games

150
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,749
while not identical are very similar. That will become

151
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,671
relevant when comparing sales later on. Here is a list of our

152
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:28,493
games. Don't be ashamed if you haven't heard any of any of

153
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:28,773
them.

154
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,397
I don't write hits. Don't get me wrong, I love hits, I'd love to

155
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:34,839
have one, but I'm more, I'm in the business of writing

156
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,603
respectable niche titles in order to make a respectable

157
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:43,227
middle class income. Here is a picture of my latest game for

158
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:46,530
the iPad. You can see that, you know, it's fine. It's basic,

159
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,013
it's simple, it's functional. I mean, it's not going to set the

160
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:52,276
world on fire, but I'm also not publicly soiling myself either.

161
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:58,121
So I want to talk about the Indie glut, the Indie boom and

162
00:07:58,181 --> 00:08:02,869
bust, or as it is commonly known, an economic phenomenon I

163
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,735
believe called the business cycle, which is much discussed

164
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:08,119
and I will get back to in more detail in just a minute.

165
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,568
When I wrote about this, I used the term the Indie Bubble,

166
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:14,809
which is a really nice click-baity title.

167
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:15,889
It got me a lot of attention.

168
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,630
It is not technically true.

169
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,611
It is not a classic speculative bubble in any way.

170
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:25,512
I also will not be using the word Indiepocalypse,

171
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:28,752
not because the word is silly, childish, and reductive.

172
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:32,393
I like things that are silly, childish, and reductive.

173
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:36,397
I'm just not really going to use the word because it's basically inaccurate.

174
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,398
There is no apocalypse.

175
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:42,043
Indie games aren't going to go away because we're awesome and people love what we do.

176
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,906
But business circumstances change and we need to pay attention.

177
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,531
So I'm going to tell you a little very brief story about

178
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:51,795
what I think happened that will require proof. And I'm going to

179
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:54,858
be chipping in some of my sales figures just to point in the

180
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:57,160
direction of what might be going on. This is just going to be a

181
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,183
few points of data. It's not going to prove anything, but it

182
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:03,267
is a start towards accumulating data and telling stories. So

183
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:03,768
what's the story?

184
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,007
Around 2008, there was an influence of three big events.

185
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:11,168
First of all, AAA development could arguably be called

186
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:13,390
very stagnant with not a lot of innovation.

187
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,710
A lot of people were getting kind of tired

188
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,491
of what they were doing.

189
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,672
At the same time, a bunch of indie developers

190
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:19,073
showed that they could really bring it,

191
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,354
could really bring really compelling,

192
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,275
awesome, high-quality products to market.

193
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:27,117
While at the same time, indie-friendly stores like

194
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:30,478
Xbox Live, like iTunes, like Steam became available.

195
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:33,859
And as someone who's scrambled for individual sales

196
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,360
on CompuServe in the 1990s can tell you,

197
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,541
Steam is an infinite bag of miracles.

198
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,901
Indie games became really hot all of a sudden. There was a big

199
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:49,542
demand for them. People like me who had a back catalog that went

200
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,402
on for days were able to make far more money than we deserved.

201
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:55,703
Demand became really high. Oh, my God, indie games are cool. A

202
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,484
lot of people flooded into the market. A lot of indie games

203
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:01,264
started being written because people wanted to follow their

204
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:05,945
dreams. Demand is really high. Supply goes up to meet demand.

205
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,026
So what happened was...

206
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:16,003
First, and this happens all the time in all sorts of businesses, there's a growth period,

207
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:19,724
a new market with a lot of demand appears. People see that there's money to be made,

208
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:25,645
they flood in, supply goes up to meet demand, but the supply keeps coming in. That's when

209
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:28,626
you pass the peak and you enter what I believe we have been in for a while now, which is

210
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:33,727
the recession period, which is the long, gruesome, agonizing, bloody process where the supply,

211
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:39,028
also known as human beings following their dreams, goes down until it meets demand.

212
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,727
There are some hard realities. Human beings only own finite

213
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,988
money. There's only a finite number of gaming websites. They

214
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:53,351
only have a finite number of space to put new articles. If

215
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:56,754
titles keep flooding in, there's just not enough. And that's what

216
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,456
leads to the painful recession process that I believe is

217
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:02,839
happening. But there is no apocalypse. Indie games aren't

218
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,781
going anywhere. We're a thing. We're a billion-dollar-a-year

219
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:08,824
business. That's amazing. There's just going to be the

220
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:11,366
occasional adjustment and the occasional necessary shrinkage.

221
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,766
Was anything I just said true, really?

222
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:21,429
I'm going to tell you sales from my last four games and you can

223
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:24,469
see my story and make your judgments from there. I'm going

224
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,710
to be talking about my last four retro role-playing games.

225
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,831
There's Avedon and Avedon 2, which are new IP, and Avernum and

226
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:34,832
Avernum 2, which are remasters of older games. For comparing,

227
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:37,453
it's better to compare games from like series. You can see

228
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:40,153
the years they came out. Earlier was very much when indie games

229
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:42,574
were go, go, hooray, and the last one came out last year when

230
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,695
maybe not so much. I had to raise the price for the fourth

231
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:47,235
game because I had to.

232
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:48,996
so my business wouldn't explode.

233
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:52,258
It's hard to do research on this topic,

234
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,900
because it's hard to compare two games,

235
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,861
because comparing sales of two games is really

236
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:58,162
apples and oranges, which is why I think I can be useful,

237
00:11:58,543 --> 00:11:59,984
because my games are really similar.

238
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:01,785
They all have the same style.

239
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,746
They're all the same sort of game.

240
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:05,227
They're all for the same platform.

241
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,169
They all get most of their sales from the same place.

242
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:10,591
They all do their PR in the usual

243
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:13,193
word-of-mouth bargain basement kind of way.

244
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:18,443
There's just a couple differences I'll point out for the sake of intellectual rigor.

245
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:22,684
The earlier games got a lot more press and a lot more bundle coverage, although I think

246
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:26,925
that's more of a factor of it being early in the indie boom before the glut happened.

247
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:30,826
And also obviously the earlier games have been out longer so they've had more time to

248
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:31,286
get sales.

249
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:34,607
But all of these games are well past their initial sales surge.

250
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,628
All of these games are in long tail territory.

251
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:43,862
I'm going to tell you two things. I'm going to tell you the number of copies sold on Steam and the amount of earnings on Steam.

252
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:50,287
The key difference here is that number of sales on Steam will include Humble Bundle and other bundles.

253
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:53,189
But it will not include the money from Humble Bundle.

254
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,930
So the sales numbers are going to be really high but a lot of

255
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,291
those sales were for a dime each because yay 2015. There is a

256
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:04,392
lot of inexactness. It's hard to do economics research sometimes

257
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:07,832
so I'm going to need to ask for a certain amount of forgiveness.

258
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,473
So here are the actual numbers. I'm going to draw your attention

259
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:16,094
to Avidon and Avidon 2 first. So you can see that in between

260
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:19,695
2010 and 2013 there was a fair amount of drop in numbers of

261
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:20,235
sales.

262
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,584
there was less interest. There was still some, still getting

263
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:31,746
bundle interest in Avedon 2 which is why the number is

264
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:34,467
fairly high. But you can see that the actual amount of cash

265
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,888
made was a lot lower because everyone was waiting, at that

266
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:40,710
point everyone had learned just wait for the bundle. Avernum 2

267
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:43,792
very much the same thing. Avernum got a fair amount of

268
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:46,774
bundle interest. Avernum 2 has gotten basically no bundle

269
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:47,134
interest.

270
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:51,497
But, you know, maybe I'll offer one of the humble bundle guys a car or something.

271
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,719
The number of sales, therefore, went way down.

272
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:57,601
And, of course, the earnings went down quite a lot as well.

273
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:02,324
I'm going to have to ask you to take my word for it that the quality of these games is roughly similar.

274
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:05,626
The user reception among the people who actually bought it was roughly similar.

275
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,928
You can verify that somewhat by looking at Steam reviews if you want.

276
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:13,790
All of my other games on other platforms have followed the same

277
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,872
pattern. I don't really have time to go into that and also a

278
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:19,453
lot of those figures I just don't have access to it anymore.

279
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:23,255
So this is again another take my word for it and maybe sometime

280
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:24,055
I'll do a longer talk.

281
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:29,604
The big story, the big lesson from this story is that the game

282
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:33,948
business is hard. And it's a tough, competitive, miserable

283
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:36,590
blood sport kind of business. And there was a time when a lot

284
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:39,373
of people were making a lot of money and it became possible to

285
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:42,556
forget that. But now people have to remember in the games

286
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:46,279
business, success should always surprise you. Failure should

287
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,382
never surprise you. That's the cost you pay for living your

288
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:52,044
dreams. That's my story.

289
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,988
Unfortunately there are a certain number of people who

290
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:58,669
are going out of business and that will continue until life

291
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:03,610
becomes tolerable for those few who survive. Have a great day,

292
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:03,910
kids!

293
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:17,973
That was awesome. Thank you, Jeff.

294
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:23,641
So please welcome to the podium Rebecca Saltzman, CEO and

295
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:36,633
cofounder of Fingy. I have to push a start button for you. I'm

296
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:43,599
looking at a spinning pin wheel. Okay. Cool. We got it. Okay.

297
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:43,839
You're on.

298
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,624
Hey, my name is Becca Saltzman.

299
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:48,045
I'm the CEO and co-founder of Finji.

300
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:51,488
I run the studio in Austin, Texas with Adam Atomic Saltzman.

301
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:54,770
We've been doing this since 2006.

302
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,472
That's about how long the studio's been around,

303
00:15:57,532 --> 00:15:58,572
under various names.

304
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,375
I handle the business, legal, financial aspects

305
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:03,476
of the entire studio.

306
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,197
I also basically take care of our publishing branch.

307
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:08,219
I also do writing and design on our games,

308
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,079
which people don't know.

309
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,421
So yeah, I do a lot of things.

310
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:14,103
I'm also a mom of two kids, and they're crazy.

311
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:16,965
So that's me, that's my youngest, and that's where you can find me.

312
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:23,271
So I'm going to talk a little bit about first year revenue for our games, and these are

313
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,432
like actual legit numbers.

314
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:26,714
And you're looking and I'm thinking, holy crap.

315
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,950
That's really high. But it's not. Most people think

316
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,732
Canabalt made us like millions of dollars and like that is

317
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:37,855
legit not the case. Right now that number you're looking at is

318
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,716
715,000. That's like our lifetime revenue on Canabalt.

319
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:43,878
Which came out like what, six years ago? The first year, that

320
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,099
273, that's what we made in the first year.

321
00:16:46,224 --> 00:16:48,287
These are some of our other titles that we've had.

322
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:52,073
Gravity Hook, First Year, 46,000, Lifetime, 54.

323
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:55,418
Hundreds, 437 in the first year.

324
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:57,261
It seemed really awesome.

325
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:58,203
Look at our lifetime.

326
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:00,947
Likewise, Capsule.

327
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,732
about 6 grand so far, or 14 grand total.

328
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,473
And then our two most recent titles

329
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,815
that were released last year, both of which

330
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,316
are IGF-nominated games.

331
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:13,758
Feist is currently at about 105.

332
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:16,700
Panoramical is at 33.

333
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,561
All of these numbers are pre-platform holder cuts.

334
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:23,604
So yeah, this next one's kind of interesting,

335
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:25,265
because you're like, that's a lot of money.

336
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:25,846
Nice job.

337
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:31,796
How do we actually work in this industry? We're all on rev share. This says how many rev share

338
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:35,559
owners are on each of these projects and about the average or the yearly average. But you have to

339
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,783
understand most of our income has been made in the first year. I want to point out specifically

340
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:47,268
hundreds, which looks like it's done great, but it made all of its money in the first year. It

341
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:48,509
didn't actually pay itself back.

342
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:53,315
So yeah, our highest revenue shareholder

343
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:56,079
would have averaged like $44,000 a year on Canabalt.

344
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,001
We've had three rev shareholders.

345
00:17:58,462 --> 00:17:59,484
Panoramical has nine.

346
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:02,708
And that's how it works.

347
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,853
It doesn't actually come out to be much money when you start

348
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:06,975
cutting everything away.

349
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:13,866
So just for numbers sake or whatever, this is where the

350
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,826
majority of our income actually comes from. Obviously for

351
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,007
Feist and Panoramical the majority is from steam. We have

352
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:26,449
another category which would be weird deals that we've made with

353
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,630
various companies. GOG, itch.io.

354
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:33,756
So that's like our most recent PC release money.

355
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:35,377
And then our mobile games.

356
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:39,821
We've always done premium games on iOS.

357
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:42,764
We sell mostly on iOS.

358
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:43,344
That's where we've been.

359
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:45,406
We've had a really great partner with iOS.

360
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:47,928
But yeah, we've always been premium games.

361
00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:48,809
We've never done freemium.

362
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,692
So our Android market's very little.

363
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,634
Now I'm going to talk a little bit about what

364
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:56,556
our expectations were before we released a lot of our games.

365
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:03,420
Cannibalt, we didn't have any. No expectations. Cannibalt went viral as a non-monetized

366
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,523
flash game. We didn't even have an ad on that. Hit like 10 million people in the first month.

367
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:12,885
We didn't even put an ad on it. We ported the game to IOS in under three weeks. What did it

368
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:16,908
have though? It was novelty. It was the first. It was an auto runner. It's like a whole genre

369
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,969
now. Added Wikipedia page. It's hilarious.

370
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,175
We had this weird media integration on twitter. Twitter was sort of a new thing at that

371
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:28,262
point. We also used the hardware properly. In 2009 people were still sticking virtual

372
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:32,087
d-pads. Which just kills me that that was like a thing.

373
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,745
Our next game gravity hook, why were the expectations so bad?

374
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:39,188
We've only made like 55,000 on this particular game.

375
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,630
And it took six months too long.

376
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,092
And we totally had a clone.

377
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:42,913
We were beat to market.

378
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:45,016
And we were late to market.

379
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:46,357
And the game was actually broken.

380
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:47,419
We didn't figure that out for a year.

381
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,860
There weren't enough things to grapple.

382
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,022
So good job us.

383
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:55,250
Hundreds took 18 months, it was 12 months late.

384
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,492
We thought it was gonna take six, it took 18.

385
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:00,475
We expected, because we were grownups at this point,

386
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:01,656
300,000 in the first year,

387
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:03,117
which we totally hit with Apple backing.

388
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,039
But that was our worst case number.

389
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,502
This paid back development for four people.

390
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:12,324
So it did not pay for our next project at all.

391
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:16,825
We only had about $100,000 maybe to go forward

392
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,186
to space out over four people.

393
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,347
We expected a long tail after a high launch,

394
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,928
and it dropped off significantly after the first 14 months.

395
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:25,829
And the Apple store, like the store started to change.

396
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,810
There's a race to the bottom.

397
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,850
People didn't want to pay that much for a premium game,

398
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:34,213
and they didn't want to pay money at all on games.

399
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:35,153
Capsule.

400
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:41,731
the game is about a fix this affix fixation for heaven's sakes like it's

401
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:48,396
slightly niche like if you don't get PTSD from playing this game like I don't

402
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:53,639
know who you are like are you a human are you a robot I we had no expectations

403
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:56,781
for this like it was a passion project Adam like sort of dives in on these

404
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:58,022
things he's like I got to do this

405
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:02,859
Feist, we just missed the F in boat entirely.

406
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,480
And I'm going to talk a little bit more about this.

407
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,381
But our worst case, like mine and Adam's absolute worst case

408
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:08,481
number on Feist was 100,000.

409
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:09,902
And we hit that.

410
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:12,422
So people are like, only 100,000 on Feist.

411
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,883
I'm like, dude, we hit our worst case number.

412
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:19,104
It's not a failure when you hit the number you expect.

413
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,125
And we hit that in four months.

414
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:27,870
panoramical. What the F. How do you market a game. Worst case

415
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,552
in revenue was 20,000 on that and we hit that in about four

416
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:36,237
months. So why? Why did we not make our Scrooge McDuck money?

417
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:39,980
What went wrong? We have had cloning problems. That's a

418
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,063
legit thing. We made a game about asphyxiation. Not exactly

419
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:47,045
like high popular title. Remember limbo?

420
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:51,047
like that awesome beautiful game that was in development at the

421
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:53,208
same time as Vice. Vice just took seven years too late. And

422
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:57,250
we underestimated the impact that that would have on the

423
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,231
market. We don't watch streamers. We're like old

424
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:03,533
people. We didn't realize that that was like a legit thing and

425
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:07,174
we undervalued that. And we didn't have the vocabulary

426
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:09,635
really to explain what panoramical was. How do you talk

427
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:10,476
to people about this?

428
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,152
We also have perceived clone ripoff problems with feist. Short

429
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,853
awareness build up. It was priced too high at $15. There's

430
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:25,096
things we just missed that we could have changed if we had had

431
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:29,218
a little bit more foresight, which now we have. Because we're

432
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,019
doing two new things. We have overland and night in the woods

433
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,441
coming out this year. Really, really awesome things. So what

434
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:35,422
are we doing now?

435
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:38,649
We're streamer friendly.

436
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:40,692
It's been from the ground up on Overland.

437
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:42,535
This is a game for streamers.

438
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:46,461
We're building in features that are for streamers specifically.

439
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:48,384
We're talking to streamers and asking what they want.

440
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:54,887
We have replay value. Feist is an incredibly beautiful

441
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:57,388
experience but it's like a two to three hour experience. How

442
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:59,848
much replay value is actually there? We didn't even put in

443
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:03,689
speed runs. That wasn't even a thing. We didn't have an

444
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:05,930
achievement for that or anything. You played feist and

445
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,151
you're like, that was nice but why would I ever play it again?

446
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:14,432
It's so ludicrously stupid looking back at it that we miss

447
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:17,733
that. So replay value. It's procedurally generated with

448
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:18,233
overland.

449
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:23,779
basically infinite. Art tokenism is just like people say your

450
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:27,483
games are so beautiful. We look for things and design for

451
00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:30,546
iconic. We don't want someone to go like, oh, your game looks

452
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:37,714
like X, Y and Z. So we give a lot of like leeway for our art

453
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:40,478
designers to like do it, man. Own it. It's yours.

454
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:46,844
We have multiple releases scheduled, as many press bumps as possible. We're providing the

455
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:51,747
words for players to describe. We really hone down on exactly how we want people to talk

456
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:58,289
about our game. We have 100% team online presence and we push people. Our art designer for

457
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:02,771
Overland has like, you know, 100,000 plus Tumblr followers. And we sometimes end up on the

458
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:06,953
front page of Tumblr. And that's not because of us. It's because Heather's awesome. And

459
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:11,155
we're utilizing Heather to push the game forward. We're not shy about that.

460
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:14,577
We think project vulnerability is an asset.

461
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:15,938
We talk about our funding problems.

462
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,020
We talk about our crazy kids and our insane schedule

463
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,442
and how we budget and like we're real people

464
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:22,623
with real problems and we're in this industry

465
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:25,606
so we're humans and like that's a legit thing.

466
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,547
We want to be that.

467
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:31,472
so people can talk about us in a lot of different ways.

468
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:33,273
We also have cross-media appeal.

469
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:34,634
And we have mailing lists.

470
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:37,095
We talk to people outside of the traditional gaming press.

471
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:39,076
Like board game press, especially for Overland,

472
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:39,977
kind of a big deal.

473
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:41,618
There's a lot of cross-pollination there.

474
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:43,159
I can't believe I just used that word.

475
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:43,679
I'm sorry.

476
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,875
with night in the woods. What are we doing for this? It's

477
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:49,997
super style driven. Nothing looks like night in the woods.

478
00:24:50,017 --> 00:24:54,320
This is Scott Benson. This is what he looks like. Kickstarter

479
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,442
the supplemental free stories. Direct email marketing. I mean,

480
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,004
I could go on forever. Creative marketing. The game size and

481
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:01,465
team story. These are things that are

482
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:04,992
directly correlated with this particular game when we talk

483
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:08,214
about this. And conventions, be not here, be at a convention.

484
00:25:08,254 --> 00:25:11,236
It shows really, really well. So the pool is getting really,

485
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:13,618
really crowded. This isn't an apocalypse. It's an overcrowded

486
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:16,620
market. I told you I got kids and dogs. Because the barrier

487
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,261
to entry has been democratized. This is basic economics. You

488
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:22,103
have to step up your game. So don't go swimming without your

489
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,385
flotation device. Hedge your bets and hedge those bets and

490
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:27,447
hedge those bets because that's what we're doing and we have to.

491
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:31,009
Have a backup way to make money. You have to eat.

492
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,942
I'm going to be in the wrap up room afterwards.

493
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:43,628
Thank you Rebecca.

494
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:44,189
Okay.

495
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,993
And please welcome to the stage Armin whose last name I'll allow him to pronounce.

496
00:25:55,808 --> 00:26:02,030
Thanks. Hi everyone. I'm Armin Ibrisagic. I work as a game designer and PR manager at Coffee Scene Studios.

497
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,470
And I'm going to talk a bit about our experience with the so-called indiepocalypse.

498
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:13,092
We've released actually not only Goat Simulator, we released a couple of other games on Steam as well.

499
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:18,773
I'm going to talk about Goat Simulator, but I'm also going to talk a lot about Sanctum 1 and Sanctum 2.

500
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:23,433
Because Sanctum 1 came out, you know, in the golden days of indies.

501
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:29,739
Sanctum 2 came out a little bit after that and six months after Sanctum 2 came out people

502
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:35,525
started whispering in the apocalypse. So I think they are really interesting games to look

503
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:41,591
at. When we released Sanctum 2 I noticed that it was a little bit different than when we

504
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:42,812
released Sanctum 1.

505
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:50,579
we, there was some loss in discoverability. My gut feeling was that people were a little bit

506
00:26:50,639 --> 00:27:00,192
more reserved in 2013 and of course green light hit steam sometime after Sanctum 2 came out and

507
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:01,433
that was quite a big deal.

508
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:08,754
we've all been to steam spy. We've all looked at the numbers.

509
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:13,015
But what I think is really interesting is I did a quick

510
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:18,936
search at the words steam sale, steam holiday sale. And as you

511
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:21,256
can see it's not really big in 2011 but sometime around 2012,

512
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:23,617
2013 it just goes crazy. And if you've seen that meme with the

513
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:38,723
Gaben with the crown and dollar signs behind him. It has like a couple million views on

514
00:27:38,763 --> 00:27:43,627
YouTube now. That's when people started talking a lot about the steam sales.

515
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,632
And so when we released Sanktum 2, those early award-winning games like, you know,

516
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:57,074
Braid, Limbo, Fez, if you've seen Indie Game, the movie, all those games from that movie

517
00:27:57,855 --> 00:28:02,436
started going on 75% off. So what we noticed was that we're not just competing with the games that

518
00:28:02,456 --> 00:28:07,739
are releasing right now, we're competing with the games that had like 95 in Metacritic score

519
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,019
and they're on 75% off.

520
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,068
There was a quote that a player said,

521
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,271
he was like, oh, I was such a huge fan of Sanctum 1,

522
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,974
can't wait till Sanctum 2 is on 75% off.

523
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:24,285
And as a developer you get pissed off. Is there a competition that I don't know about

524
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:28,887
that's all about giving as little money as possible to the developers that make games

525
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:33,068
that you love? But of course that's how consumers work. That's how I work. I'm not going to

526
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:38,170
go and buy a shirt that's really expensive just because I want to give as much money

527
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,211
as possible to the guys that made the shirt.

528
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:44,495
So that's something that we need to get used to.

529
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:48,180
When we made Sanctum 2, it had so much more content

530
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,941
than Sanctum 1.

531
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:51,164
Sanctum 1 released with like three levels.

532
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:53,668
Sanctum 2 came out with like 16 levels

533
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:57,193
with so many more enemies, more weapon variation.

534
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,934
it was just like bigger and better in every single way.

535
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:03,615
But it still sold roughly as well as Sanctum 2.

536
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:06,635
Which kind of, it messed us up.

537
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:08,556
Because you realize that, you know,

538
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,516
just because you make twice as much content,

539
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:13,637
that doesn't mean that you're gonna get twice as many sales.

540
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:17,657
And you know, maybe you don't think that's a big deal,

541
00:29:17,737 --> 00:29:20,598
but when making twice as much content,

542
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:23,298
it costs you hundreds of thousands of dollars.

543
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:26,379
And that's, you know, it's quite a big deal to think about.

544
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,524
40 percent of the players never finished the first level in

545
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:33,806
Sanctum 2. We had an achievement when you finished the first

546
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:39,411
level and a lot of our players didn't even have that. Probably

547
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:42,293
because a lot of people bought our game on a sale, never

548
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:45,916
installed it. A lot of people bought our game, started it and

549
00:29:45,936 --> 00:29:49,319
they were like, I'm going to make some food instead, do

550
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:52,101
something else. Can't be bothered. It was just $2.74

551
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:53,202
either way.

552
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:58,846
So that kind of opened up my eyes for that.

553
00:30:00,127 --> 00:30:03,448
We made Sanctum 2, the purpose was that we're going to make the coolest,

554
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:07,150
we're like 20 employees at Coffee Stain, so we're like, we want to make the coolest

555
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:11,372
indie game that you can make, we want to set the bar for indie games.

556
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:14,134
We joked around that we were like small AAA,

557
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:15,094
lowercase AAA, and...

558
00:30:18,356 --> 00:30:21,799
The purpose of Goat Simulator was just to make it the craziest thing we could possibly

559
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:22,199
conceive.

560
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,402
And of course, Goat Simulator was widely more successful than Segment 2.

561
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:31,466
This is the revenue on Steam for us, our games.

562
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:34,509
As you can see, Goat Simulator has...

563
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,772
One third of Goat Simulator has more than all our other games combined.

564
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:46,619
As you can see Sanctum 2 sold a little bit better than Sanctum 1 but I think that's mainly

565
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:52,985
because we discounted Sanctum 2 harder than we did with Sanctum 1. Why is the market like

566
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:57,008
this? I think it's because money isn't a bottleneck for consumers anymore. It's time.

567
00:30:57,268 --> 00:31:03,373
Especially with humble bundles. You know, you pay one dollar you get like five award

568
00:31:03,393 --> 00:31:09,698
winning indie games and one triple A game. So it's not like I don't have the money.

569
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:15,440
$14 to buy this game. It's more like I have a backlog of 100 games that I haven't played yet

570
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,741
So I don't want to buy any more games till I finish those

571
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:21,982
Steam doesn't have physical shelves. It's not like when you're at GameStop

572
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:26,423
You have you know like 50 games on shelves and they have them for six months

573
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:32,424
And then they remove them and replace them with new ones. They have all the games that ever released on Steam

574
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:38,865
So you're not competing with other people on your shelf. You're competing with every single game. That's ever released on Steam

575
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,376
And they're also on semi-pipes.

576
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:46,759
So I'm gonna get to, I've been very negative,

577
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:49,100
I'm gonna get to my more positive slide.

578
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,461
How do you release a game in today's market?

579
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:54,442
I think making a radically different game

580
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,323
just gives you a better chance of success

581
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:59,124
because it bypasses a lot of the barriers

582
00:31:59,204 --> 00:32:00,564
that are on Steam right now,

583
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:03,245
such as people's huge backlogs.

584
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:06,146
Why buy something that's similar?

585
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:08,227
Like if you're gonna make, you love Braid,

586
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:10,027
and you're gonna make something similar to Braid,

587
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:11,668
why would people buy that when they?

588
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,961
Maybe they already own Braid and haven't played it.

589
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:18,423
Maybe Braid is gonna go on a sale soon anyway.

590
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:24,326
So I think basically what it comes down to

591
00:32:24,386 --> 00:32:26,827
is that we're just gonna get more variation on the scene.

592
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:30,009
People are just gonna try and make even more

593
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,011
different things than they did previously.

594
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,282
It helps with discovery. There is a game called cluster truck made by genius Swedish people.

595
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:50,025
It's about fucking trucks. And a game like that is when you see cluster truck you just got to

596
00:32:50,065 --> 00:32:54,366
click on it. I hope go home and look up cluster truck. You are going to remember the name

597
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:54,907
anyway, right?

598
00:32:56,081 --> 00:33:01,223
and shareability. I think games that are fundamentally different from what you've

599
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:05,705
played so far are better water cooler conversation. It's more interesting to

600
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:11,528
talk about that insane game that you played yesterday than, oh, I played this

601
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:16,550
very well balanced game with good content and it had a good variation in

602
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,771
enemies and there were a lot of different weapons. It's just more fun to

603
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,333
talk about something that's totally crazy.

604
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:25,674
You did it.

605
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:41,219
I did it. Thank you so much Armin and welcome to the stage

606
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,760
Jordan Thomas of question.

607
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,051
Thanks, Randy. Yeah, so, hey, I'm Jordan. You're looking at a

608
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,272
picture of the magic circle. It's the indie game we released

609
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:58,213
in July of 2015. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about

610
00:33:58,273 --> 00:34:01,474
how it did on steam, because as you pointed out, it's all on

611
00:34:01,514 --> 00:34:05,116
steam spy anyway, so why not share? But to do that, I kind of

612
00:34:05,136 --> 00:34:07,717
need to find a metaphor that makes this a little bit more fun

613
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:11,639
because, Randy, we only have the one game and this is all still

614
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,660
pretty raw. So in that spirit, I'm going to go with enhance,

615
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,021
enhance, enhance.

616
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,981
A six minute murder mystery. The end apocalypse if it exists is

617
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:25,163
such a widespread phenomenon or cycle that I can't wrap my head

618
00:34:25,203 --> 00:34:27,624
around it without zooming in. Personalizing it. Thinking of it

619
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:31,026
as a predator that has it out for games like ours. So

620
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:33,814
Before I can do that, I need to talk about the game from an

621
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:35,775
objective point of view and then we'll get into the subjective

622
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:39,397
fun stuff that might have doomed us. So the magic circle is the

623
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:41,958
story of a legendarily unfinished game. You play the

624
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,959
hero of that world and you're sick of waiting for your story

625
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,580
to start. So you steal the tools of game design and sort of fix

626
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,081
the game from the inside. Retailed at 20 bucks. Our team

627
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,342
comes from the Bioshock series, dishonored and so forth. In

628
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:55,003
theory we know how to close from many years in AAA shipping lots

629
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:58,104
of titles. We spent roughly 100K of real money not counting

630
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,925
crucially two years of opportunity cost.

631
00:35:00,702 --> 00:35:03,743
But that did lead to some strong mainstream media coverage

632
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:04,303
for our game.

633
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:06,364
We had a lot of positive attention leading up

634
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:09,345
and a reasonable social reach when our trailer came out.

635
00:35:10,946 --> 00:35:14,487
So we sort of leveled off at about 80% on Metacritic,

636
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:16,907
90% on user review scores,

637
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:18,448
and we were recently nominated by the IGF

638
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:19,408
for excellence in narrative.

639
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:20,889
Thank you, by the way, if you're in here.

640
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,576
But the upshot is that we sold about 16,500 copies and we're on

641
00:35:27,656 --> 00:35:30,800
44,000 wish lists. So this is not sustainable for us to go on

642
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,123
making games like the magic circle. We need to move on and

643
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:33,523
fast.

644
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:37,878
So this chalk outline kind of represents how the Magic Circle

645
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,118
did on Steam, now that you know.

646
00:35:39,518 --> 00:35:40,919
We are a little bit like a teddy bear who

647
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:44,039
wandered in the woods in search of gold and got promptly shivved.

648
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,220
So the question is, though, did we shivve ourselves?

649
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,601
Did some of the decisions we make

650
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:53,282
come more subject and more internal,

651
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,502
or are they things that might affect games like yours?

652
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,001
Well, let's start with the external stuff.

653
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:00,181
The stuff that, at the very least,

654
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:03,382
there are many parallels for in other short narrative games.

655
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:05,403
So first, that's our big thing.

656
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:07,224
Three to six hours, give or take,

657
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:10,966
and Steam players responded with violent negativity to that.

658
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,846
They, of our negative reviews,

659
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:15,347
over 50% mentioned length as the deal breaker.

660
00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:17,568
Even reviews that otherwise read like ads for us.

661
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:18,769
That surprised us.

662
00:36:19,749 --> 00:36:23,031
But it dovetails in a pretty ugly way with the culture of sales on Steam.

663
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:27,094
As some of my colleagues have pointed out, Steam players know that on a long enough timeline,

664
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:28,955
they can have your game for next to nothing.

665
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:33,357
And so it's not about whether they can afford you, it's about whether they, it is love at

666
00:36:33,397 --> 00:36:35,698
first sight, whether there's a reason to buy your game right now.

667
00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:38,580
Because otherwise, they put you on a wish list and promptly forget you.

668
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:41,788
And then finally, Steam is very much like the app store,

669
00:36:41,888 --> 00:36:43,088
as my friends have mentioned here.

670
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:45,750
The truth is that a short narrative game

671
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,991
that does not update as often is less commonly

672
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:49,071
on the front page of Steam.

673
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:50,692
So keep that in mind.

674
00:36:51,552 --> 00:36:52,973
Now, what about the more flattering stuff

675
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:54,814
that suggests that we screwed ourselves

676
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:55,935
and we can do better in the future?

677
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:59,670
Well, first we had no marketing budget.

678
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,891
We kind of ignored the potential for marketing

679
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:04,591
through Kickstarter because we felt it was at odds

680
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:05,512
with the tone of the game.

681
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:08,673
We focused at first on making a great game

682
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,433
and hoped the rest would sort of self-align.

683
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:12,134
That was the wisdom of 2013 when we started the thing.

684
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:15,856
But the big one was that our game is pretty polarizing.

685
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,059
It has a very stark art style, which

686
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,400
people tend to love or hate.

687
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,563
It was billed as a comedy, but it has some very serious parts.

688
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:25,266
It sort of focuses on how games and game developers

689
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:26,047
can go wrong.

690
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:28,269
And I remember the IGN review was just like,

691
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,711
this game is angry.

692
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:34,336
And that kind of stuff leads to fairly polarized opinions

693
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:35,397
in the user base as well.

694
00:37:36,398 --> 00:37:41,262
But we had compromised for so long that we really needed to make something that was radically unlike everything we had done before.

695
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:43,745
And we're still quite proud of that, but it has had some cost.

696
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,581
And we, on that note, could have focused on something that had a

697
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:50,083
more clear genre for our debut title, which a lot of

698
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:52,784
developers have done. Steam players really do respond well

699
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:56,026
to your game being like anything, some kind of touch

700
00:37:56,086 --> 00:38:01,149
zone. So, you know, where does that really leave us? Question.

701
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,671
And you guys, if you are thinking of making something

702
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:07,653
like this. Well, first, I would say that if you are considering

703
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:08,774
a short narrative game,

704
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:16,998
Maybe don't rely on steam to make you piles and piles of gold and fund the next projects exclusively and if you do certainly consider

705
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:21,241
Some expansion plans so that it isn't just a fire and forget project

706
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,342
There is a happy ending here, though, which is that teddy

707
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:27,124
bear chalk outline was pregnant and the paramedics made it to

708
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:31,388
her baby. We are here. I'm able to talk to you. But just look

709
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:33,930
at him. He's kind of mean and he might turn out to be some sort

710
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:38,294
of vengeance-driven vigilante. The time that we have spent on

711
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:40,976
the magic circle has sort of claimed our innocence. We are

712
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:43,278
not the same as we were when we started out. And that might be

713
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:45,139
healthy, but it still feels like a little bit of a loss right

714
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:45,319
now.

715
00:38:46,873 --> 00:38:50,416
But curation is your friend. Curated bundles coupled with

716
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:53,258
consoles which are harder to get on to have a very strong

717
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:57,501
possibility of bringing your game to a somewhat sustainable

718
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,804
overall loop. Relying on steam solely was sort of our mistake.

719
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,806
Mike Rose's talk which you can find at that link or just in the

720
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:07,349
GDC vault under Mike Rose talks about how if you have reasonable

721
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:10,552
support from the platform holder and decent scores you can see up

722
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:11,953
to 30,000 sales on the PS4, 20,000 on the Xbox one.

723
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:17,227
that even somewhere in between would put us in a position

724
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:19,549
where we might recoup some of that opportunity cost I

725
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:22,451
mentioned earlier. Our next project is much safer. It is

726
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:26,614
multiplayer focused. Has a very long tail and does actually have

727
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:30,537
a solution in place as a primary design goal to help players

728
00:39:30,557 --> 00:39:33,119
understand why they would want it now. But I can't go deep on

729
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:33,239
that.

730
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,651
However, if you survive through AAA, especially PC AAA,

731
00:39:38,232 --> 00:39:39,994
this might be something a little bit familiar to you,

732
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:41,956
the flight from PCs to consoles,

733
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:43,117
the focus on multiplayer,

734
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,259
and the receptivity to publishers,

735
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,502
all of which, we kind of went through this once already.

736
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:50,324
I'm just hoping that if we go through

737
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:51,886
another one of these boom-bust cycles,

738
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,808
we can pick a better name than Indiepocalypse.

739
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:54,949
Thanks.

740
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:07,001
Thank you Jordan. All right.

741
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:16,340
super cool animation. Again I'm Randy Smith of Tiger style. Tiger

742
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,741
style's first indication that there might be such a thing as

743
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:22,222
an indie apocalypse was when we released a game in 2015 and it

744
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:24,623
was doing much less business than games we released

745
00:40:25,003 --> 00:40:28,124
previously in 2009 and 2012. So what we're looking at here is

746
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:31,685
our first six months of revenue for a flat comparison. But it

747
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:34,406
gets a lot worse if you add in lifetime revenue and development

748
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:34,626
time.

749
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:40,109
So spider 2 took us nine person years of effort but made

750
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:43,591
significantly less money. If you look at that in terms of ROI

751
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:49,714
specifically net revenue per person year. In 2009 spider 1

752
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:53,436
was making us close to half a million dollars per person year

753
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:57,378
but spider 2 is making us 13,000. So this is a very not

754
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:57,939
sustainable.

755
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:02,424
indication. We had every reason to believe that spider 2 is a

756
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,107
better commercial product than spider 1. It's on more

757
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:09,292
platforms. There's a hilarious story about how we promote

758
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:11,735
spider 1. We just released it into the app store one day with

759
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:13,597
absolutely no messaging or promotion whatsoever.

760
00:41:14,517 --> 00:41:18,379
games. We did a bunch of things when they are promoting a game.

761
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:21,480
We had the social media stuff and a website and a trailer and

762
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,801
we went to expos and all that kind of stuff. Both games were

763
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:27,942
covered pretty well by the mobile press but spider one was

764
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:30,783
absolutely ignored by the core gamer press where spider two was

765
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:33,664
picked up favorably by the good smattering of the who's who.

766
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:37,105
of the core gamer press. They are reviewed about the same way.

767
00:41:37,145 --> 00:41:40,165
They are both good games by most metrics if not all metrics.

768
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:43,526
Spider one is very minimal game. It's extremely focused on this

769
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:47,326
one core high concept. In spider two you better believe we spent

770
00:41:47,346 --> 00:41:49,847
those nine years adding stuff. There's tons more content. It

771
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,607
features lots of polish, depth, replayability. We kept the

772
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:55,868
previous high concept and expanded it with some things

773
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:58,028
including this feature where it knows where you are in the real

774
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:00,769
world and it matches the time of day and weather in the game

775
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:02,409
where it is at your location.

776
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:05,131
So all kinds of things for the press to talk about.

777
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,652
But despite that, Spider 2 did all the work,

778
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:09,193
Spider 1 got all the glory,

779
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,434
it was the one that got editor's choice from Apple,

780
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,576
Spider 2 got a less important banner from Apple,

781
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:15,957
no coverage from Steam whatsoever.

782
00:42:17,178 --> 00:42:18,159
Spider 1 was game of the year

783
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:19,359
on a bunch of different websites

784
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:20,720
and the IGF and some other stuff.

785
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,002
and spider 2 is on the end of your list for quite a few mobile

786
00:42:24,022 --> 00:42:27,344
websites which is very pleasant. So obviously spider 2 is a

787
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:30,506
better product but is it 3.5 times better if you look at the

788
00:42:30,546 --> 00:42:33,147
first six months of revenue or if you want to go ROI is it a 40

789
00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:36,929
times better product? Because if it's not then maybe the market

790
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:41,291
is to blame. So do we blame the indie apocalypse? Well, the week

791
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:43,733
we came out you could buy Batman Arkham City game of the year

792
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:46,554
edition with all downloadable content for less than $5 on

793
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:48,815
steam and of course clash of clans is still pulling in $1.5

794
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:49,396
million every single day.

795
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:54,639
and we cannot compete with these games obviously. But at the same

796
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,001
time there was a game with absolutely no graphics about

797
00:42:57,021 --> 00:43:00,443
programming in assembly language that was kicking our ass and

798
00:43:00,483 --> 00:43:02,925
making the kind of money we were used to making and there was a

799
00:43:02,965 --> 00:43:04,706
choose your own adventure game that was told with push

800
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:07,809
notifications that was raking in lots more than that and this

801
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:10,571
kind of illustrates a big games versus small games concept that

802
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:11,551
I'm going to come back to later.

803
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:16,306
was there something wrong with spider 2? It was a multi

804
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:19,368
platform game and that probably meant that's why we got less

805
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:22,770
support from apple. It's not a great match for steam. It was

806
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,771
really hard for us to shake our mobile legacy. We didn't play

807
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:25,852
the steam PR game very well.

808
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:34,757
Is it because it's a sequel? I think it might be. We felt like

809
00:43:34,817 --> 00:43:37,419
this was a good decision because it was less risky. We had a fan

810
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:40,221
base that was clamoring for us to produce a sequel. We knew

811
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:42,783
that we hadn't reached our full audience so we could expand into

812
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:46,286
them. And we did our jobs correctly for sequels. All of

813
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:48,107
the press quotes are like this is exactly how you're supposed

814
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:50,169
to do sequels. We retained everything that was good about

815
00:43:50,189 --> 00:43:52,110
the old and we made a bunch of new stuff too.

816
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:55,393
But Armin and Jordan have already alluded to this.

817
00:43:55,693 --> 00:43:57,834
This is an audience that's interested in cool new things.

818
00:43:57,954 --> 00:44:00,616
And so even if your design and art and everything

819
00:44:00,656 --> 00:44:03,539
about your game is all but objectively better

820
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:06,000
than the prior game, which they gave a game of the year award

821
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,723
to, that type of attention is going to fresh new concepts

822
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:10,304
in this market.

823
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,464
the market likes high concept stuff. We were diluting our high

824
00:44:16,484 --> 00:44:19,306
concept. The audience had to spend more effort to get to the

825
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:21,707
part that was cool and unique and fresh about the game this

826
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:23,909
time around. We might have been better off focusing on one

827
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,150
thing. This is just a game that focuses on that real world

828
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,471
location, time and weather type stuff.

829
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Maybe a different way to think about it is to think about what

830
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:36,722
Spider 1 did correctly or benefited from, why it was

831
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:40,283
successful. It was released at the dawn of the app store. It

832
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,964
was a much less crowded market. Free to play didn't exist yet.

833
00:44:43,324 --> 00:44:47,006
The market was growing very rapidly. Our intention was to

834
00:44:47,066 --> 00:44:50,007
stand out by making a very solid heartfelt game on a platform

835
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,648
where that wasn't the standard at the time. Among other things

836
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,109
it made Apple's hardware look good. They supported and

837
00:44:55,149 --> 00:44:55,829
featured us a lot.

838
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:58,871
So coming back to this chart, another way to consider this

839
00:44:58,911 --> 00:45:02,716
comparison is like, you know, spider 2 hit a market upswing

840
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:05,018
and hit the right notes to ride that upswing versus spider 2

841
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:07,501
which was released into a perilous marketplace and it was

842
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,943
not indie apocalypse retardant.

843
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:17,495
So what do I mean by an indie apocalypse game. I like to think

844
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:20,736
about games that are big, medium and small. Big and small are

845
00:45:20,776 --> 00:45:23,957
good and medium is a bad idea financially speaking. This is

846
00:45:23,998 --> 00:45:26,038
kind of mostly in terms of production effort. You can see

847
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:28,439
the big games are like the triple I games if not triple A.

848
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,941
The problem is that medium games can't compete in the arms

849
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:34,462
race against those big games which are so expansive and have

850
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:38,124
all this depth and spectacle and gloriously long play times.

851
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:40,545
And compared to small games, medium games are really

852
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:43,226
expensive and they're also diluted. Those small games get

853
00:45:43,286 --> 00:45:45,207
right to the crucial high concept more immediately.

854
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:48,869
They're more self-evident. But that said, there's a bunch of

855
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:52,070
other medium-sized games I could list here. Potentially you

856
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,071
could qualify them that way. And they've done very well. So

857
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:56,553
you can think about, hey, why did these games succeed whereas

858
00:45:56,593 --> 00:45:57,473
Spider-2 did not?

859
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:02,236
I think it's super important to target your platform. So if

860
00:46:02,256 --> 00:46:04,698
you're targeting the app store, it's a really good idea to be

861
00:46:04,758 --> 00:46:08,020
Apple exclusive and show off their hardware features. That

862
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,941
audience really likes games that are very immediate, very

863
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:12,442
beautiful. And your goal is to get some featuring from Apple.

864
00:46:12,462 --> 00:46:14,824
Because if you don't, you can just throw your game out the

865
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:18,426
window. On steam there's a bunch of design qualities that the

866
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:20,968
steam audience seems to like. They're looking for deeper, more

867
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,569
beefier, more involved games. They think like things like

868
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:25,891
systemic game play, replay, multiplayer and so forth.

869
00:46:27,112 --> 00:46:30,415
I see games successful when they have this very long PR campaign

870
00:46:30,435 --> 00:46:33,317
with multiple stages to build a big audience and awareness

871
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:36,119
before the game comes out. And the goal is to launch strong and

872
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,841
have those steam metrics put you on the front page with

873
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:41,804
featuring. And of course there's consoles as Jordan mentioned

874
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:45,467
last year Mike rose spoke at the IGS about the console market. In

875
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:49,570
particular it's still curated so it does limit supply. And we're

876
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:53,273
porting spider to the PS4 and Vita so we're hoping that will

877
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:53,834
work out for us.

878
00:46:54,974 --> 00:46:58,535
I don't think it's a great idea to go multi-platform on launch

879
00:46:58,555 --> 00:47:02,456
day. Especially if you're a smaller game on that side of the

880
00:47:02,476 --> 00:47:05,537
spectrum. I know there's a lever in unity and you can pull it and

881
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:08,877
it pops out all these versions and it's so free. But these

882
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:11,038
things are a big distraction and take a lot of time and

883
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,999
attention. You should be tailoring your PR campaigns and

884
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:17,339
your game design around them. My approach is don't do it

885
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,860
simultaneously. If a game is taking off and successful think

886
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,060
about where to port it. If you're going to port between

887
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,021
App Store and Steam, definitely start on Steam.

888
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:27,965
not the other way around. I think Indy teams of the future

889
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:29,967
are probably going to need dedicated PR people and

890
00:47:30,007 --> 00:47:32,289
dedicated business people. Which is a little sad because if you

891
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:34,531
are like me you sort of got into Indy to get away from this kind

892
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:36,894
of stuff. But there is a lot of really important work here and

893
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:38,795
you have to treat your business like a business and have people

894
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:41,538
who are helping out with these important things. And I think

895
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:44,982
we might need to reconsider publishers because they provide

896
00:47:45,022 --> 00:47:46,863
all of those things that I just mentioned and they also really

897
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:49,186
help with discoverability. They can provide you with funding.

898
00:47:50,976 --> 00:47:52,937
when I think about the future of indie games, I wonder a little

899
00:47:52,977 --> 00:47:56,739
bit, I like to compare to like indie music or indie film. Indie

900
00:47:56,779 --> 00:47:59,880
music is just an enormously, ridiculously crowded space.

901
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,281
Basically everyone is a hobbyist who doesn't think they're ever

902
00:48:02,301 --> 00:48:05,103
going to make any money no matter how great their album is

903
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:07,944
or whatever. Indie film is not that far apart. The barrier to

904
00:48:08,004 --> 00:48:11,265
entry is a little higher but it's still risky. I wonder a

905
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,647
little bit about are we going to come up with better

906
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:16,128
discoverability tools. Indie music has a really strong

907
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:18,329
emphasis on blogs and labels and so forth.

908
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,033
I'm old enough to remember what it was like to make games in the

909
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:27,676
90s and it was fucking awful. The publishers had a strangle hold

910
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:30,199
on creativity unless you were making a game where it was like

911
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:33,121
your Edward's pistol hands killing mother fuckers it wasn't

912
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:35,743
going to get published. You had to try to squeeze in your

913
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:40,207
expression and art on the side of that. It was pretty awful. We

914
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:43,350
got everything we wanted. We have this list of stuff we talked

915
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,251
about in the 90s. This is what it's going to take to bring

916
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:46,352
games out of this ghetto.

917
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:50,195
we got what we wanted and now we have a much bigger market place

918
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:52,818
full of more creative people and I think that's a really good

919
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:56,541
thing. I'm happy to have them here. So that is it for our

920
00:48:56,581 --> 00:48:57,181
presentations.

921
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:05,548
Thank you.

922
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,551
Let me start with one and then we'll review this together.

923
00:49:19,491 --> 00:49:21,552
So Armin and Jordan, I'm going to give you the hard question

924
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:22,632
that Jordan asked to dodge.

925
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:23,633
So do your best, Jordan.

926
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:27,995
But you guys both mentioned this idea of games that need to

927
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:28,655
be bought now.

928
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:31,496
And as a customer, you can't just wait for the sale.

929
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:33,277
So can you give us a little bit more thoughts about what

930
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:34,378
that means and what to look at?

931
00:49:34,398 --> 00:49:36,158
And I'll let Armin go first so Jordan can dodge better.

932
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:41,862
Yeah, definitely. I think it's really important to make something that...

933
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:47,603
You know, you can wishlist things on Steam and then you get an email when the game is on sale.

934
00:49:48,223 --> 00:49:51,484
How fun isn't that? If you're Valve, that's a lot of fun.

935
00:49:54,065 --> 00:49:58,026
Absolutely. I think it's absolutely correct because we all have our Steam backlogs

936
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:01,646
and I think making something that people gotta play right now,

937
00:50:01,686 --> 00:50:07,148
you just gotta click it, you gotta buy it. It makes life so much easier.

938
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:20,572
I guess I would add to that, in addition to the sort of like, that's a toy, it's not like any of my other toys, and I must touch it, because there's not going to be another goat that I can sort of molest and ragdoll.

939
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:28,243
I think there is also some value in the idea of a community driven game, that there is

940
00:50:28,283 --> 00:50:32,586
a wave that streamers and other folks wish to ride. In other words, something about your

941
00:50:32,606 --> 00:50:36,949
game where there is some benefit to mining out the unknown for kind of collective games

942
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:42,173
culture around your title. There is horror games are very good at this. Where there is

943
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:46,156
a lot of new scares and eventually they do kind of get used up by the sheer aggregate

944
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:50,200
of streamers. But early on, they kind of want to be there before anybody else can. So their

945
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,701
reactions are novel. So the people who can

946
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:54,342
who come to their stream to watch your game exclusively,

947
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:56,544
get something that everybody else

948
00:50:56,584 --> 00:50:58,025
hasn't already kind of mined out.

949
00:50:58,945 --> 00:51:00,526
I just want to add one final thing.

950
00:51:00,646 --> 00:51:03,228
It doesn't just have to be farm animal simulators.

951
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:08,231
What Jeff does is basically, I think,

952
00:51:08,311 --> 00:51:11,513
when your fans see your games, they're like, holy shit,

953
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:12,593
there's a new Avernum out.

954
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:13,694
I got to buy it right now.

955
00:51:14,582 --> 00:51:15,742
nothing beats having a fan base.

956
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:16,622
Yeah, exactly.

957
00:51:16,662 --> 00:51:20,263
So I think it can be doing something totally crazy,

958
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:23,564
but it can be having a niche and providing something

959
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:24,725
that no one other provides.

960
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:27,025
Cool.

961
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,526
We're getting a lot of questions on the tweets

962
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:30,306
to the tone of like,

963
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:33,807
why do we think supply is going to go back down?

964
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:37,088
If the tools to build games are so accessible and so easy,

965
00:51:37,368 --> 00:51:38,569
doesn't that just suggest more people

966
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:39,889
are gonna come in here and want to build games?

967
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:41,630
Again, kind of to my indie music point,

968
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,750
whether or not they're intending to ever make money.

969
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,100
Do either of you two want to answer that? Have thoughts? Go

970
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:51,902
ahead. The beatings will continue until morale improves.

971
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:56,723
Of course people are going to keep writing games. People are

972
00:51:56,743 --> 00:51:59,564
going to keep writing games like crazy. But if people want to

973
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:03,925
keep writing games to make money, there is only the money

974
00:52:03,985 --> 00:52:06,886
pool is still finite. And what I'm saying might not be true. I

975
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:11,387
hope it's not true. But I believe that, you know, if

976
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:13,648
people, while people are going to keep writing games, people

977
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:18,209
keep writing lots and lots and lots of really big budget really intense games

978
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:22,152
they're gonna they're they're they may run into to problems.

979
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:26,234
Yeah just to add on that this is actually something Randy talked a little bit about

980
00:52:26,294 --> 00:52:30,217
but the market's not going to get less crowded like that's just not going to

981
00:52:30,257 --> 00:52:32,378
happen people are going to become hobbyists they're going to get like real

982
00:52:32,398 --> 00:52:34,980
jobs they're going to you know hedge their bets like a thousand times but

983
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,963
what's going to happen is people who work for just like do

984
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:40,484
discoverability like

985
00:52:41,184 --> 00:52:44,667
you know, they'll start cross-pollinating their own audiences.

986
00:52:44,707 --> 00:52:47,430
It's something like that's half the reason why we entered the publishing market.

987
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,051
It's like, how can we grow a bigger audience?

988
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:52,734
And it's, we get a whole bunch of games under one umbrella,

989
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:55,637
and then we have access to a whole bunch of other people.

990
00:52:56,638 --> 00:52:59,540
I think that's where it's going to go, is like it's going to constrict down,

991
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,221
and then you're going to...

992
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:05,183
like PR is just, sorry, sorry Indies, we've been talking about

993
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:08,164
this for years, but PR is just going to be a fucking thing you

994
00:53:08,204 --> 00:53:11,526
have to do. And like it sucks, like you have to find somebody

995
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:14,387
that's good at it and can talk to people and get the message

996
00:53:14,547 --> 00:53:19,369
out. But like our audience is like a fraction of a fraction,

997
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:23,510
like that's who plays Indie games and you got to hold on to

998
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,251
your customers and like get the message out.

999
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:32,245
cool. This next question kind of dovetails with that. What are

1000
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:34,448
your thoughts on if you have done everything right in terms

1001
00:53:34,488 --> 00:53:38,332
of your marketability, your game, it's good to stream, you

1002
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:40,914
have good talking points, a distinct art style and it's not

1003
00:53:40,994 --> 00:53:43,657
catching on. Is there anything you can do to salvage your

1004
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:45,339
marketing campaign? What are your thoughts on that?

1005
00:53:46,492 --> 00:53:48,473
I can actually pop in, because we're doing this right now.

1006
00:53:50,034 --> 00:53:51,574
We talk about this a lot.

1007
00:53:51,615 --> 00:53:54,096
We take legit contracts.

1008
00:53:54,396 --> 00:53:56,677
When we release a game, we know exactly how much.

1009
00:53:57,397 --> 00:53:58,778
This is how much we spent, and this is

1010
00:53:58,798 --> 00:53:59,878
how much we need to make back.

1011
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:03,380
And if it doesn't make that back in sales,

1012
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,842
we have 300 other backup plans in place.

1013
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:11,964
And that's just what we do.

1014
00:54:12,224 --> 00:54:16,407
Like, we have a family, we have a house, we have a life,

1015
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:19,449
and I can't destroy that because I work in a volatile market.

1016
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:24,313
So that's just the reality of being a grown up.

1017
00:54:24,673 --> 00:54:25,553
It kind of sucks.

1018
00:54:25,754 --> 00:54:28,676
But we have backup plans on backup plans on backup plans.

1019
00:54:28,696 --> 00:54:30,877
And I could talk about that all day.

1020
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:37,743
I would add to that. Sorry. Just that the curation thing is

1021
00:54:37,803 --> 00:54:40,344
also potentially your friend, like I mentioned during the

1022
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:44,785
talk, that there are bundles out there which can sort of buy your

1023
00:54:44,805 --> 00:54:48,207
game in lump sum and create word of mouth that would otherwise

1024
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:51,748
not have existed at the moment of launch. That stuff has at

1025
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:55,649
least created a nice little blip in the curve of sales friends

1026
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:58,330
that I know who have released games and been approached a

1027
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,130
while after release.

1028
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:03,132
So one of the most amazing advantages of being an indie

1029
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:05,053
that people discuss not often enough

1030
00:55:05,674 --> 00:55:07,936
is that you get to own your work.

1031
00:55:08,497 --> 00:55:09,978
And that's incredible.

1032
00:55:09,998 --> 00:55:12,320
Because if you release it and it kind of flops,

1033
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,621
you still own it.

1034
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:15,283
You can release it for new platforms.

1035
00:55:15,303 --> 00:55:17,605
You can wait three years for a better market and remaster it.

1036
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,187
You can wait 10 years and remaster it and re-release it.

1037
00:55:20,628 --> 00:55:22,189
You don't just have the cash.

1038
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:25,052
You have a thing that can be generated for you

1039
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:26,373
to generate more cash later on.

1040
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:30,917
It's true. We have cannibal. Maybe someday we'll do

1041
00:55:30,977 --> 00:55:34,360
something with that. It's there. It's just sitting there waiting

1042
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,504
to be mined someday. Exploited. Exploit that shit.

1043
00:55:39,204 --> 00:55:42,267
We're also getting questions about sales and the sale, the

1044
00:55:42,307 --> 00:55:45,770
prominence of sales and how they drive the customer's behavior.

1045
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:49,153
Is there any thoughts anyone has about promising never to put

1046
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:52,236
your game on sale for the first six months or anything like

1047
00:55:52,276 --> 00:55:52,396
that?

1048
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:54,278
Dude, don't make that public.

1049
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:55,199
No, don't do that.

1050
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:55,979
Don't say that.

1051
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,460
Why isn't that a good marketing strategy?

1052
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,861
Because, no, what are you going to do?

1053
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,142
Are you going to write it on Facebook?

1054
00:56:00,562 --> 00:56:02,724
Like Senator Pressley's people aren't,

1055
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:05,646
like everyone doesn't know everything instantly

1056
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:06,126
about your game.

1057
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:07,667
Dialogue window at the beginning of your game.

1058
00:56:09,848 --> 00:56:10,649
No, but why not do that?

1059
00:56:10,669 --> 00:56:11,209
No, try it.

1060
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:14,094
I don't know, try it.

1061
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:19,179
The forums, you're putting these games out on places where the forums are like cesspools of horror.

1062
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,605
They're looking for any reason to destroy you, and they don't care if you've made something amazing.

1063
00:56:24,825 --> 00:56:29,009
Why give them, you may internally say, I'm never putting this game on sale, that's fine.

1064
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:30,130
You don't got to tell anybody that.

1065
00:56:31,831 --> 00:56:34,572
you may launch this game and be like, dude, this was bad, but I

1066
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:39,132
made this public statement. Now there's another thing. Now you

1067
00:56:39,152 --> 00:56:42,333
put it on sale. There's some stuff where it's like you don't

1068
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:46,214
need to talk about this stuff publicly. Like tell your fan

1069
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:51,915
base, like, gaming, the forums are cesspools, you guys. Don't

1070
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:58,056
give them ammo to be mean. Make your games and be a business

1071
00:56:58,116 --> 00:57:00,577
person on the outside of that.

1072
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:04,559
security cameras because someone is going to pipe bomb your

1073
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:10,563
house. Don't let your mom read the forums. Last question, are

1074
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:16,527
we all screwed by VR? Do we all need to get VR jobs? I already

1075
00:57:16,547 --> 00:57:24,732
have one. My answer is no. I hope every single one of you

1076
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:27,694
moves to VR because then more candy for Jeff.

1077
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:34,727
everybody for coming. We're all going to move to the wrap-up

1078
00:57:34,768 --> 00:57:37,934
room. I'll be taking on all comers until free lunch is

1079
00:57:37,974 --> 00:57:38,335
available.
