00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,100
Hello, I am Darren Korb from Supergiant Games,

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,161
and I'm joined by Greg Kasavin.

3
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:12,402
And I am the audio director,

4
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:16,063
and I do all of the music and sound design

5
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:17,304
and voiceover direction.

6
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:18,464
Hey, and I'm Greg.

7
00:00:18,464 --> 00:00:21,005
As Darren mentioned, I'm creative director.

8
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,786
I do writing and contribute other aspects of game design.

9
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:26,647
We all wear a bunch of different hats at Supergiant

10
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:28,128
since we're a pretty small team.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,509
And Darren and I have been working together

12
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:31,909
ever since the Bastion days,

13
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:33,130
or more than 10 years now,

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,510
through...

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:48,306
four different games, most recently being Hades and before that pyre before that transistor, all the way back to bastion we're here to focus on Hades, in particular, and what we did with all the dialogue and voiceover how we got to.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:57,933
How we got to all that if you play the game, a little bit about Hades hopefully this is some fun trivia even if you are familiar with the game.

17
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:09,437
The big thing about it for us was that it was our first ever early access game we designed it for the from the ground up, knowing that we would be getting tons of feedback from our community through much of development.

18
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:24,221
We also made it a roguelike dungeon crawler genre we've never worked in before. We were very interested in infusing this style of play which involves dying and restarting over and over with a continuous narrative so every time you died, the story would

19
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:27,461
advance that was kind of the thing that we were excited about early on.

20
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:37,364
Our team size remained pretty small we developed the game over a little over three years and it has been.

21
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:45,566
It has done really really well for us we're so grateful for the incredible response, including six nominations and the game developers choice awards.

22
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,367
So, yeah, we're still over the moon.

23
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:52,229
about all that and the other key feature of the game

24
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,191
is that it's our first ever fully voiced game

25
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,031
with a big cast.

26
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:57,592
So that was a really big undertaking

27
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:00,594
and we wanna talk about how we got there.

28
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:04,596
But first, here is a taste of what fully voiced

29
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:05,857
meant in Hades.

30
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:09,159
Few tales are told of Hades,

31
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:12,761
whose very name inspires fear and penitence,

32
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:15,523
reminding us of the inevitable fate which we all share.

33
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:20,178
I, however, mean to tell you such a tale.

34
00:02:20,178 --> 00:02:24,160
Listen carefully.

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,484
I understand, young Zagreus, that you would seek to leave that bitter darkness for this

36
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,284
bitter cold.

37
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,106
Quite honestly, I fail to see why.

38
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:34,886
But I'll aid your plight.

39
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:35,747
Why not?

40
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:38,048
For I can offer plenty of assistance.

41
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:40,450
And you soon shall grow fond of it, I think.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,462
Your father sent me.

43
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,565
All in all, I'd rather be on your bad side than his.

44
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,408
Now you can turn back, like a good little man,

45
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:52,091
or I can send you home the painful way.

46
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:52,511
What'll it be?

47
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:55,695
I gather Lady Demeter's already got a frigid hold on you.

48
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:58,958
Certainly not the warmest member of the clan, now is she?

49
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,440
But do be patient with her, she's been through a lot.

50
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:09,606
Um, I just wanted to apologize because I think maybe I didn't act very appropriately last time you spoke to me.

51
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,708
But I just really, freely like this job and I promise I will always do my very best so I just hope I'll have another chance.

52
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:21,211
Pal, thanks again for that nectar bottle from before. Stuff just goes right through me like you won't believe.

53
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:25,373
Though I hope you're not going around giving that stuff away to every bozo you know.

54
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:29,575
You know, Prinset, I'd not expect it to run into you again. Not after all this time.

55
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:32,897
Something I missed out on the house or what?

56
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,477
Not had much company of late is all.

57
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:36,558
I warned you, short one.

58
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:38,458
Now you face a foe more terrible even than I.

59
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:44,860
The only other foe whom I have ever faced who bested me.

60
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,840
Hold, fiend!

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,062
You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.

62
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,181
So this is just a sample of all of the VO that we have in the game.

63
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,782
This is a little bit of a data visualization.

64
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:07,243
Uh, that's the sample of some of our 30 fully voiced characters that we have in

65
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:11,725
the game, we have over 21,000 voice lines in the game, which we did not

66
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:14,086
imagine we would have when we set out.

67
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:19,308
Uh, even Karon that you heard at the end there, the guy who just

68
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:20,569
goes, uh, has 120 of those.

69
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,649
So there's quite a few.

70
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:42,491
Yeah, we did not know, we did not realize the scope of the voiceover content in this game until we were basically done and having to do triple takes at this. I still don't really believe it this 300,000 word number, but our localization team reinforces that that is indeed the case.

71
00:04:43,655 --> 00:05:02,783
So how did we get there? We will walk you through that process for the remainder of this talk, starting with the kind of macro view, the initial questions that we had and choices that we made drilling down into characterization how we how we casted the different roles and then down into the nitty gritty of our day to day production pipeline.

72
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:16,292
But starting with these kind of macro decisions, you know, there were some big choices to make when we were starting out on Hades such as what game should we even make, but certain things were foregone conclusions and one of those is that audio and

73
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:30,061
narrative would be key to this game, that's something that has been key to each of our games, and myself and Darren are closely involved in the, in the conception of each of our games and are there early on to try and kind of discover

74
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:35,622
the particular vibe and atmosphere that we want, and the audio is always a really, really big part

75
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:41,543
of that. There's nothing like music and the human voice to immediately sort of create a particular

76
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:48,825
mood. So we knew we wanted to use that, and we also knew that we wanted to work with Logan.

77
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:53,426
Yes, this is Logan Cunningham standing next to that giant BAFTA right there.

78
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:57,987
Fun fact, Logan Cunningham won a BAFTA for his performances in Hades.

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,041
But that's getting ahead of ourselves.

80
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,304
He has voiced characters in all of our games

81
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:07,487
and been a really key part of our process,

82
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:09,288
knowing that he was gonna be involved.

83
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:11,850
We're gonna give some examples of each of the characters,

84
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,032
some of the characters he's played in each of our games.

85
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:16,834
Here's a sample from Bastion.

86
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,977
Proper story's supposed to start at the beginning.

87
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:22,579
Ain't so simple with this one.

88
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,041
Now here's a kid whose whole world got all twisted,

89
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,483
leaving him stranded on a rock in the sky.

90
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:32,659
And so he plays the narrator in that game, who is almost the only voice you hear.

91
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,420
He talks to you almost the entire time you play.

92
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,562
So he's he's very much the primary character in that game.

93
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:41,904
In 2014's Transistor, he is the main principal character in that game as well.

94
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:46,687
We added a couple more supporting characters, but he really still had the primary role.

95
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:53,811
Hey, we're not going to get away with this, are we?

96
00:06:56,702 --> 00:07:00,103
And then in 2017's Pyre, we still expanded our cast a little bit more.

97
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:04,544
We added more characters, but Logan had the only English-speaking character in

98
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:09,026
the game who is of course, the primary character, the Arch-Justice.

99
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:13,688
Breather! Dare you tamper with forbidden knowledge?

100
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,858
And so yeah, that's just a little snippet of Logan's performances in these games.

101
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:22,780
In fact, in Pyre, he ended up playing several more characters,

102
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,300
but that was his his main one.

103
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,682
Yeah, so we we love working with Logan.

104
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:33,365
We love discovering the just what else, what other kinds of characters he could play.

105
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,926
So it was exciting to go into Hades knowing

106
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:38,467
he could play any number of characters in this game.

107
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:41,969
And each of our games is kind of a reaction to the last game we worked on.

108
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,331
And so a special shout out to Pyre, our third game,

109
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,212
for informing so much of what Hades is,

110
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:51,113
despite the big differences in those games.

111
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:54,735
In Pyre, it was our first time working with a larger cast.

112
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:58,517
And we kind of sidestepped the issue of not every actor

113
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:02,439
is as much of a genius as Logan by having just about everyone

114
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,540
speaking like a gibberish language, where there's

115
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,141
less pressure on it to just be kind

116
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:09,622
of an amazing English language performance.

117
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:27,757
But that gave us the confidence to work with a big cast and be able to take that next step into creating a fully voiced game. That was something we were drawn to doing on this game from the start, mainly for this kind of bolded bullet point we felt that it would

118
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:34,542
help bring these characters to life, despite having kind of limited presentation techniques right we don't have like.

119
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:47,589
fully performance captured amazing cut scenes and stuff like that, but we do have actors like Logan, who can, through their voice alone, make these characters seem to pop out of the game.

120
00:08:47,589 --> 00:09:01,017
We wanted the narrative to do a bunch of different things, particularly to mitigate the kind of sting of failure that can make you want to rage quit out of a roguelike game, instead of experiencing what's so great about roguelike games which is that they're

121
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:02,598
so much more fun every single time you play.

122
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:05,080
We knew voiceover was powerful.

123
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,702
And yeah, it was our time to take the next step

124
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,163
and try to deliver on this tonal range

125
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:13,966
that we had in mind that could range from serious to silly.

126
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,288
And again, what better way to kind of deliver

127
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:19,951
on a particular tone than through the variety of voices?

128
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,633
Of course, it raised many questions

129
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,315
about how we would actually pull this off.

130
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:32,594
Yes, there were risks associated with going fully voiced. In our mind, we'd never tried

131
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:38,878
having a non-silent protagonist before. How do you reconcile the protagonist's characterization

132
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:45,883
with how the player feels as that character and how do you reconcile the point of view

133
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:49,166
and personality of that character and everything? So that was something that we had to consider.

134
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:54,834
tone and accent, how does the character speak, how should all the characters in this game speak,

135
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:59,702
the gods, ghosts, and monsters of Greek myth, what do they sound like, and what languages

136
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:03,308
they speak, and do they have accents when they speak those languages was another consideration.

137
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:17,086
We knew we were going to have a big cast in this game. The question was how big right how many characters do we want, do we need what's going to what's going to fill out the cast in a satisfying way and how do we find the actors to play them using

138
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:24,893
the resources at our disposal. And also another consideration for us is you know, not everyone is a BAFTA award winning actor.

139
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:27,495
You know some of us on the team do voices in the game and stuff so.

140
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:33,300
Part of the worry there was just making sure that the other performances in the game could sort of

141
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,362
live in the same game as Logan's, who we knew would be very good performances in the game.

142
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:44,784
So just making sure that there was a sort of quality consistency across the cast.

143
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:46,604
And then in terms of content volume,

144
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:53,116
you know, it's a huge game that you can play forever. How many voice lines do you need to

145
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:57,617
support that and to make it really feel like you're not running out of content at any particular

146
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:03,419
point? And then in terms of production, you know, what's our budget and localization plan

147
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,660
for a massive game like this? And we're not going to dig too much into that here,

148
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,441
but that was something we definitely considered.

149
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:25,301
Yeah, so these were big looming questions, but we to quote Zagreus, whatever let's try it was kind of our answer to all of them. And so we dug into actually creating the characters of this game knowing that they would be speaking.

150
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:41,344
Starting with our boy Zagreus here. This is a painting by Jen Z, our art director, whose artwork you see throughout this presentation. In fact, a big shout out to her for all the incredible artwork for all these characters.

151
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:44,465
She nailed this character pretty much right away.

152
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:47,505
There was very little for her to go on

153
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:51,326
other than he's the son of the god of the dead.

154
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:54,906
But there really wasn't much to go on for Zagreus at all.

155
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:59,407
We get asked sometimes, you know, even some players think

156
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:03,008
that he's our own invention, but he does come from classical mythology.

157
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:06,148
Particularly, he's referenced in this ancient fragment

158
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:09,129
of a play about Sisyphus by the poet Aeschylus.

159
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:21,258
who in this in this quote, the hospital or is is Hades himself so we're doing research into Greek myth and the underworld and come across this scrap of like wait a minute Hades had a son.

160
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:32,126
I've been studying Greek myths since I was a little kid I never heard of this and that alone was so compelling, just to kind of uncover the story that it became the basis for the whole game.

161
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:47,691
Jen, you know, was drawn to this idea of, well we were all drawn to this idea of making our first ever so called power fantasy character which is one of the most tiresome ideas in game development, honestly because, like power power fantasy

162
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:48,392
characters are there.

163
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:53,555
all over the place, we just had never done one ourselves. We'd avoided the idea of making a

164
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:58,877
character who's kind of explicitly kind of better than the player, you know, faster, stronger,

165
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:02,479
better looking, knows what to say in every situation, all that kind of stuff. But we

166
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:07,461
wanted to subvert the tropes around this kind of idea as well. He's not quite, Zagreus is not quite

167
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:13,384
what he appears to be. He's emotionally vulnerable. He's kind. He's polite, despite what you may

168
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:14,265
assume about him.

169
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:18,687
And really, we wanted to deeply understand his relationship

170
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,208
with Hades as being kind of at the heart of the character.

171
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,989
And we figured if we knew,

172
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:24,450
if we had a good understanding of that,

173
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,412
then we would get past some of the cliches.

174
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:29,313
At the bottom of this slide here,

175
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:31,114
you see an example from a spreadsheet I maintain

176
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:33,155
throughout development that has all the characters in it.

177
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:36,216
This happens to have only the row with Zagreus.

178
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,698
It has things like the tone photo reference.

179
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:42,680
We'll get to Loki there in just a moment,

180
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,481
but it also has things like the...

181
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:51,309
a highly cerebral tonality stack rank suggesting that the character should be cool, badass, and hot

182
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:58,096
in that particular order. So if you want to know about our highly artful process, there you go.

183
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:02,141
But this is a language that Jen and I understand when talking about characters.

184
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:18,636
We also understand a variety of different references and there aren't too many people at Supergiant for whom all of these references click. They do click for me, maybe, maybe for a few others but you know on one side with with someone like Jen I'm talking

185
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:25,302
about Alucard and Dante and Spike Spiegel and with Darren, you know we're talking about Loki, talking about the Dread Pirate Roberts.

186
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:39,162
The Princess Bride is a movie actually we kept coming back to is a really strong sort of tonal analogy. It could range from silly to serious in a manner similar to what we wanted, but this guy Loki here, he had the look he had the vibe, similar

187
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:40,063
to what we were going for.

188
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:45,006
So with that in mind, we wrote the casting sides for Zagreus.

189
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,107
We're like, okay, here he is.

190
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,147
Here's our guy.

191
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,888
Let's get some auditions.

192
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,230
Let's see what we could get for his voice.

193
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,151
But we had a lot of trouble finding his voice.

194
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:56,953
This was a character that was not necessarily in Logan's wheelhouse.

195
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:04,707
Yeah, and so we got a few reads for Zagreus based on these sides, and none of them were sort of

196
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:09,048
hitting all of the marks that we wanted them to hit, and we all had something specific in mind,

197
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:14,510
I think, that they weren't quite achieving. So I ended up recording some scratch for this just

198
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,531
to try to put something in to take a stab at it and just see if we could sort of get somewhere

199
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:22,592
a little bit closer on what Zag might sound like.

200
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:26,317
And so this is an example of the read that I did for Zagreus.

201
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:26,717
I'm home.

202
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:26,937
I'm home.

203
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:27,137
I'm home.

204
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:28,098
Carry on everyone, don't mind me.

205
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,340
That could have gone better.

206
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,361
That could have gone better.

207
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:34,363
That could have gone better.

208
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:35,725
Well, time to go get killed again.

209
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:36,325
I'm home.

210
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:56,416
When I, when I heard that time to go get killed again, I was like, Darren, you've been holding

211
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,679
out on us like how is he.

212
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:14,361
How Darren does all of our music, all of our sound effects, all the voice recording and, you know, he just casually delivers, you know, the winning audition for Zagreus, of course that was just my initial impression and it's by no means a unilateral decision

213
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:21,523
so we had to get Darren's takes into the game and present them as part of our team playtest and stuff but everybody.

214
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:36,078
Everybody liked it, and and we didn't look back, but there were a lot of decisions to make along the way like we played around with zags. It wasn't a foregone conclusion that Zagreus would speak with a British accent for example, Darren, did a take

215
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:43,721
that was all like kind of in an American accent as well, but we decided, certainly between us I think we both agreed that

216
00:16:44,041 --> 00:17:01,242
The British accent is like the de facto accent of historic Western fantasy right like from things like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, it's just an accent that gets associated with is sometimes totally imaginary worlds, and yet everyone

217
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,144
speaks speaks neutral English.

218
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:08,769
But we do use the American accent as well to represent a kind of cultural divide in the setting.

219
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:19,499
So the characters native to the underworld speak American, like us, and characters kind of Greek origin or surface origin, speak with, with the British accent.

220
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:28,605
And to be clear, you know, I was not expecting to voice Zagreus even several sessions deep into the game.

221
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:32,546
I think the actual files themselves are called like Zagreus Scratch.

222
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:32,726
Yeah.

223
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:36,268
And we just expected to replace them eventually and never ended up doing it.

224
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:43,209
Yeah, it ended up being kind of a big additional chunk of work for you, but hopefully, hopefully you had fun.

225
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,169
That was good. Yeah.

226
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:50,930
Now, certain characters like this one are not quite as difficult to cast as others, right?

227
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,871
Yes, that's true.

228
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:57,272
I think Lord Hades may have been the fastest we've ever found the voice of a character.

229
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:01,333
We you know, Greg wrote up some sides with Logan Cunningham in mind.

230
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,533
We knew he was going to play this guy.

231
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,894
You know, Logan and I talked about some references like.

232
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:12,017
darkness in in in Legend, Tim Curry's character in Legend and a couple other

233
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:15,199
references. And we just Greg sent him the sides.

234
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:19,301
And this is the read that he did for that with a little bit of processing on it.

235
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:20,942
Stupid boy.

236
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:25,065
I told you you'd be back.

237
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:29,287
How was your wanton ransacking of my domain?

238
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:31,409
And that's pretty much exactly the character.

239
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:32,849
I mean, it's just like, yep, that's it.

240
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,390
We heard it. And that was Hades.

241
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:40,665
Yeah. So then we got to a point where it was time to kind of put it all together, right?

242
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:44,527
And this, yeah, Darren, when did we make this thing?

243
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:50,611
This was in August of 2018, less than a year into development. This is a really,

244
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:53,532
really early build of the game. And what you're going to see here is

245
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:59,476
you know, you're going to hear Zagreus, you're going to hear Hades, you're going to hear the

246
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:03,958
storyteller, and it's going to help coalesce some of the tonal ideas that we're working on

247
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:19,567
through the voiceover here.

248
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:20,588
Damn it.

249
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:28,308
I'm home.

250
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:35,733
Yes, carry on everyone, don't mind me.

251
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:47,460
The House of Hades, that dark and lavishly appointed lair of the Underworld's king, is home not just to him, but to his willful progeny.

252
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,081
Shut up, old man.

253
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:50,763
Back already?

254
00:19:55,303 --> 00:20:01,446
Stupid boy. I told you nobody gets out of here whether alive or dead.

255
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:05,247
Though how was your wanton ransacking of my domain?

256
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:10,789
Greetings father. My ransacking was a delight, thank you for asking.

257
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:14,571
So I'll just be on my way again.

258
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:22,694
Be on your way indeed. What do I care? You shall never reach the surface. Go, see for yourself.

259
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:29,011
And you may notice if you've played a lot of Hades

260
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,512
that several of these lines shipped with the actual game.

261
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:31,552
These are really, really early,

262
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:35,295
and they made it all the way through to the final release.

263
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:37,477
Yeah, we never can tell with that stuff

264
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:39,258
what's going to stick.

265
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:41,760
So we were quite happy with how things were going

266
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,341
at around the time we put together that.

267
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:47,724
We don't really use the term vertical slice,

268
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,545
but that's kind of like what it was.

269
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,947
Essentially our first production content,

270
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:53,468
it was expressing this relationship.

271
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:56,189
between Hades and Zagreus that we were excited about.

272
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,210
But then we got the whole underworld.

273
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,191
It's time to figure out the supporting cast.

274
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,793
We knew we wanted the tone of the game to be much broader

275
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:07,354
than just what Hades and Zagreus represent.

276
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:10,836
So we considered a lot of different angles

277
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,777
on who else should be in this game.

278
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:14,418
One thing that came very quickly was the idea

279
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:16,559
that the Olympians are gonna be there.

280
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,260
We quickly got a bunch of Olympians in the game.

281
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:39,604
The Underworld also gives us some of these like iconic characters that you probably know from just any exposure to Greek myth, the Hellhound Cerberus, the boatman of the River Styx, Charon, Sisyphus eternally toiling with his boulder, those kind of characters were exciting to us and we wanted them to be part of this world.

282
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:46,946
We also thought about, you know, well that our vision of the House of Hades it's almost like a place of business who works there in what roles you know who was.

283
00:21:47,386 --> 00:22:00,576
Who was Zagreus's father figure if Hades wasn't doing it for him and these characters like Achilles came, came from that. And really, you know, we also thought about it from the production angle, how many characters will be even welcome in this game

284
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:02,698
how many do we have time and room for.

285
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:17,651
And a lot of our early stabs at these characters just stuck. We got these characters like Achilles, Nix, Hypnos, Dusa, Skelly, they were all in the game, quite early, they tested well with our team we had fun working on them, and we just kind

286
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:21,414
of never looked back. And a lot of the Olympians came online.

287
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:24,998
Early on as well, our idea for the Olympians that they're kind of like.

288
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:29,760
the awkward Thanksgiving family dinner type of idea,

289
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,861
it really informed the characterizations for them,

290
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:35,403
like Poseidon as the boisterous, inappropriate uncle,

291
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:35,943
and so on and so forth.

292
00:22:35,943 --> 00:22:39,845
It gave us clear ideas for the characterizations of each one,

293
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:42,047
and we got them in the game.

294
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:45,208
And things felt like they were coming together quickly

295
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:45,548
at that point.

296
00:22:46,249 --> 00:23:01,562
A lot of the other characters, we just kind of trickled in over early access some we didn't even plan for at all, like electo and Patroclus, and it's it's funny to think back on how we didn't even imagine those characters at all.

297
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:09,129
At the beginning, when they ended up being quite significant to the story but that's that's part of the beauty of early access which will be coming back to again and again.

298
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:10,490
Yeah.

299
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:14,234
we have all these characters in mind,

300
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:15,996
it's time to find who's gonna portray them.

301
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:18,518
And what is the first question that we ask

302
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:21,440
when it comes time to cast a new character?

303
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,082
Yes, the question is, can Logan do it?

304
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:26,343
That's the first question we ask.

305
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:28,225
And the answer is often yes.

306
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:32,008
There are five of the six characters Logan plays

307
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:33,289
pictured on this screen.

308
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:34,610
The only reason the sixth one is not here

309
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,772
is because he's the narrator and has no portrait.

310
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:39,974
But yes, Logan plays a bunch of characters in this game.

311
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:41,175
He's got a huge range.

312
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:47,981
And part of the idea behind that is embracing our constraints as a small studio,

313
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:49,742
using the resources available to us.

314
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:54,226
And Logan is an incredible actor who happens to be very close with us as a studio and

315
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,467
as a friend.

316
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,251
So we consider him to be an incredible resource to use as much as possible.

317
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:07,123
And so once the answer to that question becomes no, can Logan do it? No, not this character.

318
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:13,228
Then we need to expand our search a little bit. So we try to tap our network. Can any of us on

319
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:20,314
the team do it? This photograph here is a photograph from me in high school with Peter Canavesi,

320
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:23,537
who is the high school, was my high school drama teacher and

321
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:28,681
He was the moderator for the improv club that Logan and I were in.

322
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:32,683
He, in fact, plays Zeus and Chaos in this game.

323
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:35,005
And he did a few voices for us on Pyre.

324
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:38,887
So, you know, he did an incredible read for Zeus and did a great job as Chaos.

325
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:42,009
So we were thrilled to be able to work with him again.

326
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:44,611
I ended up voicing Zagreus and Skelly.

327
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:51,497
And Skelly is one of those characters where the character was sort of built around this silly voice that I like to do.

328
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:57,239
Where it was kind of like this. Originally, it was a guy talk to them more like that.

329
00:24:57,239 --> 00:25:03,380
And then but Skelly needed to be a little more high energy and deliver a little bit more information more quickly.

330
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,181
So he kind of got combined with almost like a Joe Pesci vibe, like, hey, boy, hit me over here.

331
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:13,703
What are you doing? You know, that kind of thing. So that's sort of how I speak a little bit more to that.

332
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:15,023
But that's kind of how he came about.

333
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:30,494
Yeah, Kelly, as you can tell is very deeply rooted in classical Greek mythology, and we, we had a lot of fun, you know with him we're testing the boundaries of the tone of this game right and like he started off as, as kind of a joke, but everybody liked

334
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:34,336
him and we liked working on him. So, so he stuck and he's not even the first time.

335
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:47,291
something like that happened like do so started off as, as a bit more of like a frivolous character, who became really important to the game and back on pyre, Logan's principal character started off based on like a funny voice that he would do

336
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:54,639
from time to time so it's just, again like it based on our constraints based on stuff that we enjoy doing, seeing what we could do with all that.

337
00:25:54,959 --> 00:26:00,704
Of course, there would come times when the answer to, you know, can Logan do it would be no.

338
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:06,528
The answer to, can we keep it in the family, you know, can Darren and Peter Canavesi or any of us do it would also be no.

339
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:09,911
And then we would have to reach a little bit further.

340
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:21,736
That's right. Yeah, we had to get auditions actually for some characters from outside of our network of people who are either on the team or people that we knew immediately.

341
00:26:21,736 --> 00:26:26,838
So, you know, we would look for recommendations from people that we trusted, friends of friends, that sort of thing.

342
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:37,822
Greg spent a fair share of time scouring voice acting, hashtag voice acting on Twitter and other online sources and then sort of cold emailing actors that seem promising for particular characters.

343
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:58,886
And then once we would receive the auditions, you know, I had several criteria upon which I like to evaluate them is the characterization unique relative to our existing cast can this person kind of slot into the game and not overlap too much with any other particular character that we have is the.

344
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:06,591
delivery believable and natural? Does it sound like someone speaking or does it sound like

345
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:11,753
they're reading? Is the accent believable if there is one? That's another thing that sort of

346
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:17,475
leans into that previous point there. And then this one to me is actually one of the most critical

347
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:19,476
is the understanding of a text itself.

348
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:21,367
Does the actor get it?

349
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,189
Are they conveying all the,

350
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:26,391
are they mining the line for all the beats that are in there

351
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,092
and trying to convey each one separately

352
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:29,934
and play all of the changes?

353
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:32,896
Of course, they're sending us an undirected audition.

354
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:35,823
And in the actual recording, it would be directed.

355
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:40,926
And if they didn't perceive all that stuff, we could sort of, you know, direct them to add it.

356
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:44,308
But just hearing that in the audition is such like, oh, they get it.

357
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:45,749
You know, it's such a relief.

358
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:50,893
So so we know that it's going to be easy for us in the booth

359
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:52,934
if if the audition comes back with that stuff in it.

360
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:59,793
And then, of course, another question we have is, does it meet or even exceed our expectations for

361
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:03,734
the character? Is it exactly what we're asking for? Sometimes we'll get an audition, we'll hear

362
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:07,775
it and be like, yep, that's it, that's perfect, that's exactly what I had in my head. And sometimes

363
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:12,556
we'll get an audition that's like, ooh, that's, I did not expect that. And it's even better than

364
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:17,877
the thing that I imagined. And so this next character is an example of that one.

365
00:28:18,537 --> 00:28:23,001
Yeah, and this is one of those, you know, you're talking about believable and natural delivery.

366
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:27,905
That's another one we really, really prioritize highly because even though we have these larger

367
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:32,929
than life characters or literal gods, in most cases, we want them to just kind of believe

368
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:37,233
the circumstances that they're in. This is just normal everyday life to them and they should

369
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:43,858
convey that in the delivery so that we don't try to go for like cartoonish voices. And it's worked

370
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:46,521
out well for us. So Megara here.

371
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:52,111
was a really, really important character, in part because she's one of the only characters in Hades that you can't skip.

372
00:28:52,111 --> 00:29:01,478
If you don't like talking to Hades you don't like talking to Dusa or Achilles, forget about them, you could just walk right by and it's fine. But Megara stands in your way.

373
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:14,767
As the first boss, you're going to run into her over and over again. And with her. We wanted to express a lot of what was unique about this game, where the story is kind of constantly unfolding and advancing so.

374
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:19,250
you know, when you play a game like this, your own experience as a player is that the first time

375
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,073
fighting a boss is different from the 20th time fighting a boss, and we wanted the relationship

376
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:29,656
between Zagreus and Megara to kind of reflect the player's own journey. So it's a lot of pressure on

377
00:29:29,656 --> 00:29:35,399
this character to be a lot of things, and we certainly did not have an actor, an actress in

378
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:41,103
mind. So we did the thing that we would do. We created the casting sides.

379
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:45,747
and we started to look for actresses.

380
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:48,649
Though even in this case, we did kind of keep this one

381
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:51,212
in the family, at least indirectly, didn't we?

382
00:29:51,212 --> 00:29:52,373
Yeah, sort of.

383
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,836
You know, so the actress who plays this,

384
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,377
who ended up playing this character

385
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:58,878
is named Avalon Penrose,

386
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:03,683
and she is good buddies with Courtney Vignez,

387
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:06,485
who plays Dusa in Aphrodite.

388
00:30:07,145 --> 00:30:11,067
and who happens to be married to Michael Aleshy,

389
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:14,288
who is the voice of Orpheus and a former Supergiant employee.

390
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:15,788
So it's sort of in the family.

391
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:19,869
And a fun fact here is that real life Meg and real life Dusa

392
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:22,690
are good buddies, which is kind of nice.

393
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,351
Yeah, just like they are in the game.

394
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:27,912
So we're kind of sweating bullets about this character.

395
00:30:27,912 --> 00:30:29,232
Who are we going to find?

396
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:31,713
And one day we just get this performance

397
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,034
from Avalon Penrose.

398
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:34,514
Your father sent me.

399
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:39,927
All in all, I'd rather be on your bad side than his.

400
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:43,731
Now, you can turn back, like a good little man,

401
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:49,058
or I can send you home the painful way.

402
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:49,558
What'll it be?

403
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,461
Yeah, we heard that and we're just like, oh, that's that's it.

404
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:56,784
It's more interesting than the thing we thought of.

405
00:30:56,784 --> 00:31:00,748
You know, as you can see here, our voice reference in the sheet is something like,

406
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:03,411
you know, Furiosa from Mad Max Fury Road.

407
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:07,715
And and this is this just is even even more subtle, more interesting.

408
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:11,759
The sort of hushed way she's speaking is like, oh, what a cool idea to have this.

409
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:26,087
antagonist that you fight and have this complicated relationship, have this sort of hushed way of speaking is very cool and and she ended up actually with the third most lines in the entire game. So this is a really critical character and we're so glad that we found Avalon.

410
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:33,068
And then, you know, to summarize the casting process here,

411
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:34,590
we create the casting sides,

412
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,674
and that's actually a great tool for us

413
00:31:37,674 --> 00:31:39,756
to align internally on a character

414
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:41,058
before we even send them out.

415
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:43,200
So it's actually really useful for us

416
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,562
from a character development standpoint.

417
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:50,268
And sometimes we have character art, sometimes we'll have some sort of tonal reference image

418
00:31:50,268 --> 00:31:56,570
on the sheet, depending on the particular sides. And then, of course, we ask, can we cast this

419
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:01,593
character internally? Can Logan do it? Can somebody else on team do it? Can somebody we know do it?

420
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:05,995
And then if not, we sort of reach outside of our network of actors when we need to.

421
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:11,077
And then we'll evaluate the auditions, test them in game, gather feedback,

422
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:14,498
and vet the casting choices with the wider team.

423
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,608
and then we cast the part and we scheduled the first recording.

424
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,002
And this is you and Logan casting Henry the fifth.

425
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:22,342
This is a picture.

426
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:25,784
Yes, I can't believe I forgot to mention this is Logan and I,

427
00:32:25,784 --> 00:32:27,105
Henry the fourth in the year 2000.

428
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:31,867
We're both playing middle aged men, as you can tell from our gray temples.

429
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:32,208
Yes.

430
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,749
So going way back.

431
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:35,189
Yeah.

432
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:38,791
So that's our casting process in a nutshell.

433
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:44,354
Doing some things kind of fast and loose and seeing what we can do

434
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:46,035
with the folks that we have.

435
00:32:46,915 --> 00:33:03,163
But now it's time to get into the real devil in the details. So, before we start recording, we need some stuff to record. And that's where the writing process comes in the writing process, you know, snugly fits.

436
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,408
On to a single slide, it wasn't too fancy.

437
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:18,287
The part where we had a game structure that you could play forever and keep running into the same characters over and over, meant that there was no shortage of content ideas, having like different stuff for characters to talk about.

438
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:24,850
The part where we were recording very frequently due to early access milestones and stuff like that

439
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:31,253
solved one of the key issues that writers such as myself experience, which is procrastination.

440
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:38,196
Nothing like a deadline to spur you out of a writer's block and so on. So when you know that

441
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:44,559
a great actor like Avalon or Logan is expecting to record some stuff soon, you really want to

442
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,861
do a bang up job and have enough good stuff for them.

443
00:33:48,762 --> 00:34:03,792
Um, you know, I committed sacrilege by writing, most of the stuff just straight into Google sheets or sometimes directly into game data. And in addition to all the story content there was a high emphasis on on so called barks, just the kind of quick repeatable

444
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:11,997
that mostly Zachary is would say in all sorts of different contexts because again you can play the game forever. We didn't want these lines to be repetitive so by the time.

445
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:16,239
we play through all the different options. It has been, you know, hopefully hours and hours

446
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,981
and hours and you don't notice the repeats. What really helped was having an outline for the story

447
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:25,763
early in the process and then from there all the writing was done kind of much more tactically

448
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:31,265
based on what we were working on at the time, but knowing where it was all going with the conclusion.

449
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:36,887
Oh, this here is an example of the spreadsheet that we used.

450
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:50,570
There's the column marked line, which is the actual stuff that the actor records, we're looking at than a toast here there, we've used this format basically with minor changes ever since bastion so it's not fancy but it's worked for us.

451
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,913
There's the line number. We include context information and.

452
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:59,098
We also include subtext information in that sentiment column.

453
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:03,762
That's really useful sometimes of saying what's really behind this line.

454
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:05,804
What does the character really mean?

455
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:09,427
And Darren is recording without me the vast majority of the time,

456
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:13,791
so it helps to know what's supposed to be behind each line like that.

457
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:16,934
And then it is time to record.

458
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:22,863
Yes, so we're going to show you a clip from the documentary by Noclip called Developing Hell,

459
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:27,526
Hades Developing Hell, and it's on YouTube. You can find it yourself. But this is an example

460
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:32,511
of what it's like when I'm recording lines for Zagreus in the booth.

461
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:41,318
We're good to go here. Let's see. Check. Hey, I hear my voice. Okay, let me just

462
00:35:41,318 --> 00:35:43,300
down a little bit.

463
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:48,643
I don't even remember what the last thing that was recorded in here was.

464
00:35:48,643 --> 00:35:49,604
I have no idea.

465
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:51,845
Death area.

466
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:56,607
So this is when I arrive back

467
00:35:56,607 --> 00:36:02,669
in the house of Hades after being killed by the bull.

468
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:03,069
By the Minotaur.

469
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:06,271
It's one bad bull.

470
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:09,032
It's one bad bull.

471
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:11,072
It's one bad bull.

472
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:11,933
First take.

473
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:14,064
824. That was 823. 824.

474
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:16,205
Oh, I got the horns.

475
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:18,186
I got the horns.

476
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:18,866
I got the horns.

477
00:36:18,866 --> 00:36:23,548
Oh, blasted ghost minotaur.

478
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,868
That's probably the one.

479
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:43,911
As you could probably tell, things got a little weird when I was in the booth by myself for

480
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,332
too long.

481
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:51,934
So, the process illustrated there, you know, is that for each line, we would do a minimum

482
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:52,695
of two takes.

483
00:36:52,695 --> 00:36:58,077
We would pre-slate the line, saying the number of the line, recording the number of the line

484
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:04,640
into the microphone, and then I would live sort of decide what the winning take was,

485
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,941
and then have the actor repeat that into the microphone, second take, third take, etc.

486
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:11,949
And that is for the benefit of Brad Hagman, who

487
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:14,351
was the editor of all the voiceover in the game.

488
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:15,832
So I would send him these sessions,

489
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:21,137
and he would chop up the lines, and edit them, clean them up,

490
00:37:21,137 --> 00:37:23,779
and name them, and send it back to me for processing.

491
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:28,584
So I'm going to show you one more video here, which

492
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:32,667
is sort of an example of how I applied processing for,

493
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,808
in this case, chaos.

494
00:37:35,395 --> 00:37:39,660
So this is the effects chain for Chaos,

495
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,184
who I would say is probably the most heavily processed

496
00:37:43,184 --> 00:37:44,225
character in all of Hades.

497
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:48,310
So I'm just gonna go through really quickly

498
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,551
all of the effects in the chain.

499
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:50,653
So first we got a compressor,

500
00:37:50,653 --> 00:37:53,035
then we got an EQ, standard stuff.

501
00:37:53,884 --> 00:37:57,586
Then we've got two instances of Urcam Trax.

502
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:59,727
It's by Flux.

503
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:01,728
So it's Urcam Trax version three.

504
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,910
It's a really crazy VO processing software.

505
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:09,232
And both of them have about a 50% mix in this first one

506
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:10,693
and then a 60% mix in the other one.

507
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:14,755
And they have a lot of funky controls.

508
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:17,896
But that's what is the principal thing

509
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,518
that you're hearing on Chaos's voice.

510
00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:22,759
Then after that, we've got.

511
00:38:24,775 --> 00:38:29,276
just a basic limiter, and then we've got a reverse reverb, and then we've got a regular

512
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:29,676
old reverb at the end.

513
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:37,637
So I'm going to play it back, and the way we have it here is this is the track that

514
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:43,238
I used for recording with no effects on it, and then all the selects will get chopped

515
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,498
out and moved onto this track down below here.

516
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:48,359
And this is the one with all the effects on it.

517
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,040
So I'm going to play that back now and you can see what that's like.

518
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:57,802
234. Perhaps this. Perhaps this. Perhaps this. Second take.

519
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:08,026
And so you can see, you can hear Peter called out the number. He did a take, he did another take,

520
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:13,507
and he did another take, and at the end he called out second take. And so that is, in fact,

521
00:39:13,507 --> 00:39:18,989
the one that gets chopped out and cleaned up by Brad, and then it gets named.

522
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:25,453
And you can see all of these are named similar file names,

523
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:27,574
235, 236, and so on, chaos underscore.

524
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:31,255
And that is to mirror the name in the spreadsheet,

525
00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:32,676
in the script spreadsheet.

526
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:35,097
And that's it, yeah, I'll just have the actor record

527
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:38,339
a single giant file usually.

528
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,080
This one in this case was recorded in the studio.

529
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,062
And then it all gets chopped up and named by Brad.

530
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:50,160
And then once Brad does all the editing, he sends it back to me

531
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,621
and I apply the processing and render it all out.

532
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:59,323
One thing I want to give a shout out to is batch rendering in Logic,

533
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:01,643
which I discovered after Transistor.

534
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:07,245
It really helps when you put a whole bunch of lines on a track, select them all

535
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:09,786
and can render them all at once with baked in processing

536
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:11,067
that that really saved a bunch of time.

537
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,581
So once the lines are rendered, then there are many, many technical considerations to consider.

538
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:23,143
We want to consider how we name the files. We're going to have thousands of files to organize,

539
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:27,905
so we tried to optimize them for searchability. We had the character name underscore 0002 was our

540
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:34,647
naming convention. We had a hunch we were going to need a thousands place for this game,

541
00:40:34,647 --> 00:40:36,647
hence the three zeros in front of the two.

542
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:42,256
One limitation obviously is that we can't have over 10,000 lines in a single spreadsheet,

543
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:48,481
but that proved not to be an issue. We got kind of close with Zag, but not too close. It was okay.

544
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:54,165
And then in terms of file management, we have thousands of WAV files to manage, and our solution

545
00:40:54,165 --> 00:41:01,310
for that was just to throw them all in a VO folder. So we have thousands of files in one particular

546
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:01,630
folder.

547
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:06,982
each character has their own sort of actor template queue in FMOD,

548
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:10,964
and that single queue is used to play all of that character's VO files.

549
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:14,345
And each actor template has its own settings,

550
00:41:14,345 --> 00:41:19,427
you know, spatial spatialization settings, sound size, distance,

551
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:23,608
fall off, all that stuff and busing and reverb and whatnot.

552
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:28,289
So and FMOD, for those of you unfamiliar, is the audio middleware

553
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:30,810
that we use to integrate the audio into the game.

554
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:40,413
And then of course, when you have thousands of voiceover lines memory can be consideration and, and can you do stream them or load them into memory.

555
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:45,995
Basically we were instructed by our engineers, however, to just sort of go nuts and they would figure it out at the end.

556
00:41:47,043 --> 00:41:48,384
And we did and they did.

557
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:51,507
That's we went.

558
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:52,568
Yes.

559
00:41:52,568 --> 00:41:58,032
So once Darren would render out a batch from one

560
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:00,434
of our voiceover sessions, then it's off to me

561
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:04,337
and I always felt like a kid in a candy store.

562
00:42:04,337 --> 00:42:06,979
I think I have a fairly unique privilege

563
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:11,242
in being able to integrate the voiceover myself.

564
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:12,703
I think a lot of writers.

565
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:25,567
working in the game industry don't necessarily have as hands on of a role in making sure everything is kind of playing the way it's supposed to all the all the timings are just so, and all that kind of stuff.

566
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:29,848
And this video will show you a little bit about what that process is like.

567
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:36,129
Greg here to give you a quick tour of how we script the voiceover in Hades using my friend

568
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:42,472
Thanatos here as an example. Here's Thanatos as he exists in data in this file called npcdata.lua.

569
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:46,833
We're looking at the data through a utility called Sublime Text, which you can download.

570
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:52,496
Thanatos has all of his story events in this kind of format.

571
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:56,058
It's a script-like format developed by Gavin Simon,

572
00:42:56,058 --> 00:42:59,560
one of our engineers and co-founders.

573
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,741
So, you know, line by line, Thanatos talks,

574
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:03,862
then Zagreus talks, then Thanatos again.

575
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:07,184
I could put an arbitrary amount of presentation,

576
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,085
you know, through character animations

577
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:11,566
or alternate portraits and things like that.

578
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:13,807
And I just plug in the voice lines, plug in the text.

579
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:17,670
And that's all there is to it at the simplest level.

580
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,494
Events can have various requirements,

581
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:25,778
and that is how we determine the sequencing of events,

582
00:43:25,778 --> 00:43:28,420
along with some good old-fashioned randomness.

583
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,722
For example, this requirement just says,

584
00:43:30,722 --> 00:43:34,065
you know, you have to have interacted with Thanatos at least one time

585
00:43:34,065 --> 00:43:36,147
for this event to be eligible.

586
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:37,989
And, you know, over time we just...

587
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,732
added lots and lots of events to Thanatos.

588
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:44,294
I'm actually going to hit Page Down instead of Mouse Wheel.

589
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:46,635
As you can see, he's got a lot.

590
00:43:46,635 --> 00:43:51,558
These are just events with Thanatos at the House of Hades.

591
00:43:51,558 --> 00:43:57,402
He actually has a separate entry for the version of him you encounter out in the field.

592
00:43:57,402 --> 00:44:02,805
These events are ordered in a way that makes sense to me,

593
00:44:02,805 --> 00:44:06,428
with the more generic, more repeatable events down at the bottom.

594
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:12,759
you get the picture. The other half of this is a function called isGameStateEligible,

595
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:18,224
which started off very simple, letting us do things like determine the chance to play for an

596
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:23,308
event, say a 50-50 chance or something like that, or required text lines is a requirement I use very

597
00:44:23,308 --> 00:44:28,132
frequently that just says, you know, has this story event already occurred? But as we went on

598
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:33,877
in development, things got more and more specific. For instance, we added a phishing system in early

599
00:44:33,877 --> 00:44:34,938
access because, of course,

600
00:44:35,678 --> 00:44:39,119
And so that introduced things like required hasFish,

601
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,060
required minCaughtFish this run, hasNoFish, minHeldFish,

602
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,020
minTotalCaughtFish, anyCaughtFish types,

603
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,621
anyCaughtFish types of each,

604
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:51,962
anyCaughtFish types this run, maxTotalCaughtFish.

605
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:53,982
So that gives you some impression.

606
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,483
We couldn't have imagined we would need all this stuff at the very beginning,

607
00:44:57,483 --> 00:44:59,903
or even when we first had the phishing system.

608
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:06,487
But as I ran into more examples of story events where the specificity was needed,

609
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:10,829
I could add these or in some cases get engineering support to add them.

610
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:12,150
And that's how we did it.

611
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:19,851
So if you take anything away from this talk, fish, I guess.

612
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:23,512
The part the video didn't get into,

613
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,393
kind of the other half of voiceover integration,

614
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,054
is all of the barks, the kind of contextual lines that

615
00:45:29,054 --> 00:45:32,595
play out in the world, Zagreus's quips and stuff like that.

616
00:45:32,595 --> 00:45:35,256
Those are integrated much the same way,

617
00:45:35,256 --> 00:45:36,056
just kind of line by line.

618
00:45:36,056 --> 00:45:38,457
They could have all the same requirements.

619
00:45:38,938 --> 00:45:42,200
either on the entire batch or on an individual line.

620
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,963
So, and again, we just try to have lots and lots of them.

621
00:45:45,963 --> 00:45:48,025
We have a playback system where all of them

622
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:51,168
will play randomly until the whole table is depleted.

623
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:53,269
And then we kind of reload the whole table

624
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:55,331
just to get at the maximum amount of variety

625
00:45:55,331 --> 00:45:57,433
and reduce chances of anything playing back to back,

626
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:58,393
that sort of thing.

627
00:45:58,393 --> 00:46:01,036
I'm really, really grateful to our QA team

628
00:46:01,036 --> 00:46:05,519
for making sure all this stuff worked because yeah,

629
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:07,841
the amount of narrative content in this game

630
00:46:07,841 --> 00:46:08,201
kind of...

631
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:10,564
spun out of control to a certain extent.

632
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:14,007
And between our early access players and our QA team,

633
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:17,350
they kept it going and making sure

634
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,072
everything was sounding good.

635
00:46:19,072 --> 00:46:20,333
Yeah, for sure.

636
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:23,876
I mean, and one of, so once everything is integrated

637
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:25,518
after Greg has done that, you know,

638
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:29,662
the process that is mystical to me somewhat

639
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,184
of integrating all the, everything into script.

640
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:42,546
And we play test internally a bunch to make sure everything is working before we send it out into the world, especially before early access we relied more heavily on the internal play tests where the whole team plays everything.

641
00:46:42,546 --> 00:46:54,597
Early access of course was an incredible source of feedback and we read every piece of it between our discord and Reddit and all the other places that feedback was delivered to us we made sure to read it and respond to it the best we could.

642
00:46:56,636 --> 00:47:07,578
One other thing that was interesting about the early access feedback is that it sort of protected the characters like once they were out in the world. We, we did you know we didn't want to cut a character that we'd already sort of released into the game.

643
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:17,120
For example, so, so I think Greg was was grateful for that that none of his the hard work that we've done to make these characters could be undone by our waffling on it or something.

644
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,441
I think the early access feedback also helped shore up our confidence in the tone because

645
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:27,551
the response had been so positive to a lot of the characters and the voiceover

646
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:30,679
that that it gave us motivation to really keep pushing as hard as we could.

647
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:36,718
And it was really helpful for iterating on small stuff and fleshing out the characters a ton,

648
00:47:36,718 --> 00:47:42,520
because it really exposed areas where, oh, we could do some more here. We could push on this

649
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:51,783
here with this character. And it also led to some silly stuff that we ended up doing. So, you know,

650
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:57,665
lava, when it is under the ground, technically is called magma. And there was a point in development

651
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:03,425
where we had recorded maybe two dozen lines across five characters where they are saying

652
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:06,487
the word lava, referring to magma.

653
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:11,470
And somebody on Reddit pointed this out, and Greg Sott was like, you know what?

654
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,751
We should probably go and fix that.

655
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:13,812
So here's an example.

656
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:19,196
How was the lava temperature lately, Lurney?

657
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,898
How was the magma temperature lately, Lurney?

658
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:26,000
We went back and picked up every single one of those two dozen or so lines across all

659
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,661
those characters.

660
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,321
Yeah, and this wasn't like meanly delivered.

661
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:35,105
No one was like roasting us for forgetting third grade geology

662
00:48:35,105 --> 00:48:37,246
or whatever, the difference between lava and magma.

663
00:48:37,246 --> 00:48:38,847
But it was one of those things where

664
00:48:38,847 --> 00:48:40,108
I think if left to our own devices,

665
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:43,630
we just would have shipped this maybe insignificant error,

666
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,231
but an error nonetheless.

667
00:48:45,231 --> 00:48:49,014
And yeah, it's just an example of how our community was

668
00:48:49,014 --> 00:48:52,877
able to help us identify all these little opportunities

669
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:55,618
to just try and improve little aspects of the game.

670
00:48:55,939 --> 00:49:11,181
They kept us honest. Yes. So, you know, we were just kind of hurtling the early access nature meant that the next milestone was kind of always around the corner. So we were just in the thick of it, making it happen and didn't have a ton of ability

671
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,363
to kind of reflect back.

672
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:26,614
on the process but something that really worked for us looking back on it was knowing it Hades was going to be an early access game we approach the story like like a serial almost like a TV show with the early access launch being like a pilot, and knowing

673
00:49:26,614 --> 00:49:28,576
that the 1.0 launch would be like the finale so.

674
00:49:29,156 --> 00:49:43,887
With the early access launch we introduced some of the characters, set the stakes, but the story doesn't end there and we just kind of built it out, update by update until we finally introduced the ending in our in our final update before launch.

675
00:49:44,673 --> 00:49:58,858
Having that outline was really, really valuable. It let us, we still could veer off course every which way and introduce characters we didn't anticipate but we knew what the through line was going to be Darren and I, you know, we're not a big

676
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:00,478
team between the two of us so it was.

677
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:13,723
incredibly valuable that Darren could just like solo record, not just himself but with basically our entire cast, I usually wouldn't be there, because I would often be still writing while Darren was recording so that was really helped save a ton

678
00:50:13,723 --> 00:50:22,126
of time. And yeah, we would just keep like playing, playing ourselves, watching streams, listening to feedback and it just kept.

679
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:24,808
spawning new ideas for content.

680
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:27,970
And we'd always try to make time for the small, so-called

681
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,330
unimportant moments.

682
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,732
Unimportant in quotation marks because they're actually

683
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:34,333
some of the most, I think, delightful moments in the game

684
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,715
that you can experience, even though they're not strictly

685
00:50:36,715 --> 00:50:37,936
needed.

686
00:50:37,936 --> 00:50:41,158
If you're interested in all the stuff we did with Dialogue,

687
00:50:41,158 --> 00:50:43,759
there's this video from the YouTube channel

688
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:47,201
People Make Games that delves into it really deeply

689
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:48,302
that I recommend.

690
00:50:50,285 --> 00:50:55,229
Now the production of the game was not without its challenges,

691
00:50:55,229 --> 00:50:59,812
not least of which were the growing scope of the game.

692
00:50:59,812 --> 00:51:02,575
As we added more and more to the game,

693
00:51:02,575 --> 00:51:05,577
there were more contexts that seemed like they needed VO that

694
00:51:05,577 --> 00:51:07,939
was highly specific to that context.

695
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,000
And so as the game expanded, so did the VO scope.

696
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,862
And it just kind of snowballed.

697
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:14,044
And the more positive feedback we got on characters,

698
00:51:14,044 --> 00:51:15,705
it made us want to push on those characters more

699
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,307
and give them more to talk about and more to do, more to say.

700
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:24,584
And of course, localization, as you can see from that terrified emoji,

701
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:31,468
you know, this was an involved process, localizing the 300,000 or so words in the game.

702
00:51:31,994 --> 00:51:37,579
Early access development also provided its own sort of challenges.

703
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:49,671
The next big update was sort of always around the corner. Greg, I'll let you, I'll let you speak to this a little more directly. Yeah, the the pressure to get it right the first time as it were so even though we're an early access game and you know technically

704
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:52,494
nothing's finished and technically everything can still be iterated on.

705
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,776
As soon as we would put new story stuff into the game,

706
00:51:55,776 --> 00:51:59,718
it was as though it came from classical mythology itself

707
00:51:59,718 --> 00:52:01,959
and was instantly canonical.

708
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:04,880
So it was unthinkable the idea of like,

709
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,201
oh, we're gonna cut this character

710
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:08,922
or we're gonna completely rewrite this character.

711
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:12,824
We felt that pressure, but it was a good pressure

712
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:15,966
because players are really enjoying the characters

713
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:16,466
on the whole.

714
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,807
And yeah, we were just inundated with feedback.

715
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:22,049
Players were really enjoying the game,

716
00:52:22,049 --> 00:52:25,830
but they wanted more of it, as is often the case.

717
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:31,373
And we were just busy recording, sometimes up to three or four

718
00:52:31,373 --> 00:52:32,814
sessions per week.

719
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:36,335
But there was another significant challenge

720
00:52:36,335 --> 00:52:41,378
last year that is worth mentioning, is this little guy.

721
00:52:41,378 --> 00:52:42,018
Oh, yeah.

722
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:47,200
There was a global pandemic in two thirds of the way through production.

723
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,303
That that was the thing that happened.

724
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,967
It certainly threw a wrench into our plans a little bit.

725
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:57,911
We had to do all of our video recording remotely.

726
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:01,134
A lot of it previously was being done in the actual office.

727
00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:02,335
We had a vocal booth in the office.

728
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:07,994
that you saw in that no clip documentary. That's where that was happening. And so we just had to

729
00:53:07,994 --> 00:53:13,960
improvise. We had almost a third of the game's content left to record, I would say at that

730
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:19,906
point. So we just sent all the actors snowballs, blue snowballs here, which is, you know, good

731
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:25,391
little soldier mic that did the job. Logan used this mic for all of Pyre, so I had confidence

732
00:53:25,391 --> 00:53:26,913
that it would just at least work.

733
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:32,456
It wasn't going to necessarily match the sound of the mic we were recording them on in the

734
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:36,879
office and the sort of outboard gear that I had that flowing going through.

735
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:41,482
But I just figured, well, we just got to get them recorded and all sorted out in post best

736
00:53:41,482 --> 00:53:41,562
I can.

737
00:53:41,562 --> 00:53:47,806
So I did my best to match the characters to their previous recordings to the best of my

738
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:48,167
ability.

739
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:54,316
Yeah, and there was obviously such a harrowing time.

740
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:59,781
And just on the on the project, the idea that our entire voiceover production might grind.

741
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:03,624
Well, the whole game, much less the voiceover production might grind to a halt.

742
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:05,985
was really scary.

743
00:54:05,985 --> 00:54:09,547
But Darren, through his ingenuity,

744
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:11,108
we like barely skipped a beat.

745
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:12,049
We just kept on trucking

746
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:16,571
and recorded so much of the most kind of essential stuff

747
00:54:16,571 --> 00:54:18,993
because we were recording all the ending content

748
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:20,914
at that time, some of the most important stuff in the game.

749
00:54:21,374 --> 00:54:26,736
Yeah, I think Zag had like 3,000 lines left to record just by himself.

750
00:54:26,736 --> 00:54:32,338
It was a lot. It was the most concentrated recording and with a lot of actors. But we

751
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:39,800
did it. And this was our team at the tail end of the project, all on a happy Zoom call.

752
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,021
And we, you know, the voiceover was

753
00:54:43,341 --> 00:54:50,105
just a small part of the puzzle, but a really, really fun part to work on.

754
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:55,667
You know, we were able to record a whole bunch of stuff that got a really good response.

755
00:54:55,667 --> 00:55:00,530
Darren and I, I remember we were just frequently really blown away and moved by people's like

756
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:05,632
positive response to the voice acting because we had so many questions about whether everybody

757
00:55:05,632 --> 00:55:08,614
would be able to live up to Logan's standard and all that kind of thing.

758
00:55:09,074 --> 00:55:12,877
Early access was really, really, really useful

759
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:16,460
and helping us just catch little details.

760
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,702
And I think our initial assumption

761
00:55:19,702 --> 00:55:21,524
that going fully voiced would help bring

762
00:55:21,524 --> 00:55:23,425
these characters to life, I think proved to work out

763
00:55:23,425 --> 00:55:24,006
very well.

764
00:55:24,006 --> 00:55:25,627
Absolutely.

765
00:55:25,627 --> 00:55:29,330
And in hindsight, there are things

766
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,151
that I would maybe do a little bit differently

767
00:55:31,151 --> 00:55:33,233
or if we were to do on our next, that we

768
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:34,313
could take into our next project.

769
00:55:35,185 --> 00:55:39,729
would be I'd like to achieve a little bit more sonic consistency perhaps across the different

770
00:55:39,729 --> 00:55:45,595
characters in terms of what microphones are being used, the signal path, and you know maybe next time

771
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:50,720
we can not have a global pandemic in the middle of the project. It would help help with that

772
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,405
if somebody could get right on that. I'd like to streamline the casting process going forward

773
00:55:56,405 --> 00:55:59,768
probably or if I were to go backward I would streamline the casting process because

774
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:05,109
you know, when we've reached outside of our network of actors, it became pretty stressful and time consuming.

775
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:09,311
And we were just kind of always worried about whether or not we'd get the thing we were looking for.

776
00:56:09,311 --> 00:56:15,574
So maybe we'd try to outsource that to a professional assassin who can find actors easily.

777
00:56:15,574 --> 00:56:24,699
Better file organization is something, you know, maybe our giant single folder for all of the VO files is not the best system, perhaps.

778
00:56:25,274 --> 00:56:36,844
And maybe an improved priority system for some of the thornier story events would be would be good as well it would save a lot of qA headaches on the back end perhaps and small bugs that way.

779
00:56:36,844 --> 00:56:47,393
And in terms of some other lessons that I'm taking forward to whatever we do next is, you know, regular recurring VO sessions really really worked well for us for a lot of reasons.

780
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:55,392
it avoided the crush of stuff at the end. You don't run out of time necessarily to if you have

781
00:56:55,392 --> 00:57:00,014
new ideas you can add them you can't throw anything onto the pile when you already have a mountain

782
00:57:00,014 --> 00:57:02,975
to record all at once. So that's one benefit. I also think

783
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:07,564
it really gave us time to know the characters.

784
00:57:07,564 --> 00:57:09,626
And for me as a director and for me as an actor,

785
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:11,928
it really gave me a better understanding

786
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,870
of every single character we were recording,

787
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,812
just living with them for so long throughout the project

788
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:18,253
and recording them consistently.

789
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:20,435
So it really gave me a better sense of,

790
00:57:20,435 --> 00:57:22,777
does this sound like it's in their voice?

791
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:25,360
And how would this character say this?

792
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,541
It was really important for me.

793
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:28,863
And I think most importantly of all,

794
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,345
one of the most valuable lessons we learned

795
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:38,074
which was a question that we had when we started this project, was can early access work for

796
00:57:38,074 --> 00:57:44,738
narrative games? And, you know, I feel like for our part it's worked out as well as we could have

797
00:57:44,738 --> 00:57:53,383
hoped in the case of Hades. So, yeah, it really was an exciting way to prove that out.

798
00:57:54,125 --> 00:58:07,951
Yeah, it really, you know, we would have ended with a much smaller and worse game. If we somehow in an alternate reality made Hades without the early access process.

799
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:08,291
So, yeah.

800
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:14,613
Thank you so much for listening. We're so incredibly grateful for the ongoing support

801
00:58:14,613 --> 00:58:21,178
for this game. Darren, I know you share my feeling that we're incredibly grateful to

802
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:27,003
our colleagues at Supergiant who do so much inspiring work to where we just want to...

803
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:31,509
live up to what they're doing with our own corner of it.

804
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:34,893
And and we've stuck together all this time,

805
00:58:34,893 --> 00:58:37,856
trying to see how long we can keep going, making games together.

806
00:58:37,856 --> 00:58:40,259
We want to keep on trucking for a while longer.

807
00:58:40,259 --> 00:58:44,083
And having had this experience on Hades, we're excited for what's next.

808
00:58:44,638 --> 00:58:50,641
Absolutely, yeah. I mean, you can't take a look at this image that Jen and Joanne collab on here and

809
00:58:50,641 --> 00:58:54,744
and think, you know what, I'm just going to phone it in. Yeah, you got to give it, you got to match

810
00:58:54,744 --> 00:59:02,368
the caliber of this kind of stuff. So yeah, for my part, I really am grateful to the entire team

811
00:59:02,368 --> 00:59:07,371
for the privilege to be able to work on games with them and thank you to GDC for having us.

812
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:13,395
It was a delight to be able to get to talk about this, just a sliver of all the work that went into

813
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:13,675
Hades.

814
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:18,348
Yeah, and thank you to our incredible voice cast for making all this possible.

815
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:19,453
See ya.
