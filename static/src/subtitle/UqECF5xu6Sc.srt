00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:09,454
Hi everyone, welcome to Lessons from Labor Organizers.

2
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:13,537
We're gonna be doing kind of a moderated Q&A panel

3
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:15,278
at the beginning and then halfway through

4
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,381
we're gonna switch into kind of an open mic audience Q&A.

5
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:22,303
So be thinking about your questions leading up to that.

6
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,825
Yeah, so my name is Emma Canema.

7
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:28,307
I'm a labor organizer with Game Workers Unite.

8
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:33,229
I'm joined today by Justin Melito, the Director of Organizing of the Writers Guild of America

9
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:40,052
East, Liz Schuler, the Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO, Linda Dow, a labor organizer

10
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:47,035
with SAG-AFTRA, and Kevin Agawadse, the Treasurer and Organizer with Game Workers Unite UK Union.

11
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:51,717
Yeah, it's a great group of people.

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,780
So before we jump into any questions,

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,601
I think we might just go down the row

14
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,421
and do a brief self-introduction,

15
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,641
maybe expand on what your title actually means

16
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:03,582
in terms of the work you do.

17
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:05,382
Justin, do you wanna start?

18
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:05,942
Sure.

19
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:10,023
Hello, and thank you so much to Game Workers Unite

20
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:12,463
and to all of you who are so interested

21
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:15,364
in the idea of collective action

22
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:18,245
and perhaps building unions in your industry.

23
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:20,525
My name is Justin Melito.

24
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:21,805
I'm the Director of Organizing

25
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:23,566
for the Writers Guild of America East.

26
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:31,610
What that means is as an organizer, I work towards helping people who want to build unions in the industries

27
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,951
that they work in

28
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,753
into the House of Labor. And so specifically

29
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:38,834
at the Writers Guild,

30
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:44,297
we're the union for film and television workers. There's an East Coast and a West Coast union.

31
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:46,838
We also have a large number of news members,

32
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,319
about 3,500 members.

33
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:54,384
in New York City and the East Coast.

34
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:58,489
Recently, that number is over 5,000

35
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,954
because we've organized about 20 digital publishers.

36
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:06,597
So places like Vice, Vox, Future,

37
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,160
Talking Points Memo, Salon, Slate, and a bunch of others

38
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,041
have organized with us fairly recently.

39
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:16,642
So that's the work that I've been involved

40
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:20,124
in with a team of organizers most recently

41
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:24,466
to expand the power of the union to new groups.

42
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,106
Thank you.

43
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:26,786
Liz?

44
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,182
Hi everyone, Liz Schuller, I'm the Secretary-Treasurer of the National AFL-CIO, which is an umbrella

45
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,483
organization of 55 unions.

46
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,884
Riders Guild East and SAG-AFTRA are two of those.

47
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:45,767
We represent 12.5 million working men and women in the United States and Canada.

48
00:02:47,107 --> 00:03:00,531
We are working across all industries and sectors which are, you know, anywhere from professional football players to professional technical engineers to teachers and construction workers.

49
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:07,314
And my role is basically as an organizer as well. I came from my local union out of the electrical workers.

50
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:10,094
And we are...

51
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,750
excited to talk about the future of work and what that means for working people,

52
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,077
what this country is starting to look like in terms of employment, and

53
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:23,762
getting your fair share of the wealth that you create on the job.

54
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,046
Linda.

55
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:27,586
Hi, I'm Linda.

56
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,447
I'm an organizer with SAG-AFTRA.

57
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:31,427
Right now I work closely with voice actors.

58
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,289
Those who work in video games, foreign language dubbing,

59
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,090
and TV animation.

60
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,831
So I deal with new organizing and internal organizing.

61
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:43,793
So new organizing is similar to what Justin said,

62
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:45,774
where we're trying to organize new shops.

63
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:49,076
But with internal organizing, we also

64
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:53,218
deal with collective actions and building collective power

65
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,679
to have leverage while we negotiate.

66
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,100
existing contracts.

67
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,600
Awesome, thank you.

68
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,303
And yeah, thank you again for being on the panel.

69
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:24,965
So I kind of want to start off with,

70
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,107
I think probably a question for Kevin.

71
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,772
What lessons have you and the other kind of fellow workers

72
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:33,434
and organizers from Game Workers Unite,

73
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:35,476
what lessons have you kind of learned

74
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:38,098
and what obstacles have you been having to overcome

75
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:41,242
as you kind of spin up your new national union

76
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:42,943
and starting to organize game workers?

77
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:48,115
Right, so as opposed to unionizing shop by shop,

78
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,636
like performing a national union,

79
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:51,597
we sort of have a lot of members,

80
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:54,299
so like the most union friendly in a lot of companies,

81
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,562
but we don't necessarily yet have big membership

82
00:04:58,602 --> 00:04:59,982
in any particular shop.

83
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:04,105
So it's nice that everybody in the union right now

84
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:06,026
is very active and wants to get involved,

85
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,107
but we still need to build campaigns

86
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:09,368
in all the shops in the UK.

87
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,350
The other sort of thing is we spoke to a lot of the

88
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:19,515
big and established unions and like the games industry space where there's a lot of like

89
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:25,339
highly trained professionals that do that like very different things from art to programming

90
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:31,583
community management and it is very like globalized international it's like a space that traditional

91
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:31,963
unions

92
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,691
aren't super sure how to approach yet.

93
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:40,573
That's a space that has been traditionally not unionized,

94
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:46,035
and it is a challenge to figure out how to do it.

95
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:50,197
Yeah, and I mean, you're talking about, you know,

96
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,078
spaces that are traditionally not unionized just,

97
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,159
and you, of course, have quite a bit of experience

98
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,280
organizing kind of new territories

99
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,721
where workers aren't unionized.

100
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:00,082
Can you maybe expand on some of the challenges

101
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:00,722
involved in that?

102
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:10,227
Yeah, in 2015, some writers from Gawker Media, just show of hands, do people know about Gawker

103
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:12,649
and maybe the campaign to organize at Gawker?

104
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:12,949
Great.

105
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,892
Came to our office because they were interested in organizing a union.

106
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:25,914
And we immediately began to work with them in an approach that in some ways was different

107
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:29,175
than traditional labor organizing approach and in some ways quite similar.

108
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:37,337
The thing that was different is that the sort of premium on transparency from people that

109
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:44,740
worked at Gawker made for a process that was much more horizontal in terms of how the organizing

110
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,160
happened.

111
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,564
meaning that all of the decisions and all of the activities were public,

112
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:56,948
and so public, in fact, that they were all on a blog as people were deliberating

113
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:58,930
on whether or not to organize, which is pretty unique.

114
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,353
I share that anecdote because the most important thing,

115
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:07,276
the most important lesson really there is to make sure that we listen

116
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:09,398
as organizers and as the labor movement.

117
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:13,962
You know, when we're trained as organizers, we're told we have two ears and one mouth,

118
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,925
and therefore we should be doing twice as much listening.

119
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:22,930
So as an institution and as organizers, we listened very closely to what it was that

120
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,813
people in the digital media sector were saying.

121
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:33,120
They were talking about overwork, underpay, the precariousness of the industry, some traditional

122
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,640
bread and butter.

123
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:40,184
labor issues, but they also spoke a lot about diversity and equity and the need for transparency

124
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:41,124
and decision making.

125
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:45,966
And so we emphasized in our communications the importance of that.

126
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:51,949
And in fact, as organizers, really just facilitated the communication that happened as opposed

127
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:55,991
to being the institution and communicating on behalf of.

128
00:07:56,652 --> 00:08:02,180
of the workers. They also had the added benefit of being professional communicators, so it would be

129
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:08,209
pretty foolish for us to redo their communications about why unions were important.

130
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:12,455
And then lastly, one lesson that was extremely important and has maintained...

131
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:18,379
throughout is having a movement approach, meaning that we're not talking about just

132
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,582
organizing one shop and one place that happens to be either the bad place or the harder place

133
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:29,165
to work. We're talking about organizing the entire industry so that standards are set

134
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:33,768
across the board no matter which company you happen to be working on any given day, which

135
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:39,612
of course, as you know, is very important when in this economy as people jump from job

136
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,553
to job, we no longer live in an economy that

137
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:46,297
people go to work at one factory for 30 or 40 years, they jump from place to place.

138
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:49,881
And so therefore the union effort and movement has to be

139
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:53,705
across all companies, across the entire sector,

140
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:58,450
and really based on the labor as opposed to any given particular company.

141
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:05,277
And then lastly, very much using the technological tools that people use at work,

142
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,281
having those tools be used in the organizing campaigns.

143
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:17,351
So use of Slack, use of Twitter campaign were all very effective for developing solidarity and building strong unions.

144
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:22,698
Yeah, I feel like Game Workers Unite has also kind of taken up a lot of those approaches,

145
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:28,703
right, using communication methods that workers are already using, being more flexible, thinking

146
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:32,626
about building movement as opposed to just focusing on individual shops.

147
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:36,449
Yeah, that's really interesting and I think that applies a lot to our industry as well.

148
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:44,075
Linda, I think you do a lot of work in terms of organizing with voice actors,

149
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:50,640
and I've always been really impressed how voice actors are often directly involved in the organizing campaigns,

150
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,303
just in the way that the writers Justin works with have been directly involved.

151
00:09:54,944 --> 00:10:00,388
Can you speak to a little bit of that process, and maybe touch on how you feel like voice actors

152
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:05,592
and organizing with SAG-AFTRA relates into the larger labor movement within the games industry as a whole?

153
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:11,045
Sure. So maybe I should start off by giving a little overview of the last

154
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:17,768
interactive negotiations and the strike. So when we're in negotiations 2016 we

155
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:22,570
had been negotiating trying to reach a new agreement for almost two years. So

156
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,412
finally the proposals were too far apart for us to feel that it was a good

157
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:31,974
agreement. So eventually there was you know a strike authorization vote and we

158
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:32,975
did go on strike.

159
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:39,518
And three of the main issues were, one was transparency.

160
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:42,019
They wanted to know either the name of the game

161
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:45,261
or the genre or if there's sexually explicit

162
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:47,922
or racially explicit or violence in the game

163
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:50,303
so that they can make a decision

164
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,764
on whether they want to audition or even work on the game.

165
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:57,187
And secondary payments was a big deal

166
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:00,889
because with actors, usually they,

167
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,730
get residuals on other contract areas.

168
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,530
And this is the model that works for them

169
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,671
because it's not guaranteed that they work every day,

170
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,592
not even guaranteed that they work once a month.

171
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:12,813
So having a secondary payment on the back end

172
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,473
really helps while they're in between gigs.

173
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,874
And the other issue was vocal stress

174
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,395
because a lot of these games,

175
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,396
they're exerting themselves, they're screaming,

176
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:22,537
they're dying like a million different ways.

177
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,098
So like vocal stress was a big issue because.

178
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,879
if they strain their vocal cords too much,

179
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,700
they might get bleeding, swelling,

180
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,281
might have to get surgery,

181
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,481
so that means they can't work

182
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:35,122
if any of those things happen.

183
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,942
So that's kind of like the overview,

184
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:39,463
the big issues that they were fighting for.

185
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:43,825
So even while they were negotiating.

186
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:49,046
and bargaining for two years, they started off doing one-on-ones.

187
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:55,509
So it's basically doing your initial conversations, figuring out who's the leaders in the community,

188
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,370
who's really influential, and then building like a leadership structure, kind of like

189
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,631
a core group to strategize and reach the larger community to assess support.

190
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:08,455
And they did things where they would do house meetings,

191
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:10,897
they would do caucuses at the offices,

192
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,721
smaller group meetings, mixers,

193
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:18,404
and then obviously they had a Facebook group

194
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:21,287
that they would chat with and do education,

195
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:26,111
and they did a newsletter using MailChimp and...

196
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:31,394
just always keeping the community in the loop and educated about everything.

197
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,155
And they still do that now where even though there's no contract,

198
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:38,416
there's no negotiations happening,

199
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:42,257
that they still actively use that Facebook and that newsletter

200
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:43,818
to keep everybody updated.

201
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:46,298
And they're continually doing issue-based organizing.

202
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,503
because we couldn't get exact language for what is vocal stress on the contract,

203
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:55,127
that they're continually partnering up with industry professionals

204
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:58,951
to do all-day workshops and evening panels

205
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:02,254
so that we can look into this even more and figure out,

206
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:06,719
oh, how do we protect voice actors from losing their voice?

207
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:13,565
And I mean, Kevin, so I mean, I feel like a lot of what Linda just said is stuff that

208
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,087
you all do in the UK, right?

209
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:18,691
A lot of it really, it seems to boil down to community building, right?

210
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:19,532
At the end of it, right?

211
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,553
Yeah.

212
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:25,819
Can you speak to like, how community building works into your organizing model in the UK?

213
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,419
I mean there's a lot of those things that we do, right?

214
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,080
We have a newsletter that is bi-weekly, we have a Discord where people can speak to us.

215
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,502
We are going to have a weekly meeting just with our membership where everybody can just join

216
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:44,343
and ask questions about what they're doing or ask how they can get involved.

217
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:50,384
We have regional groups and local meetings once a month in different regions.

218
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:55,267
So just people can meet up in real life and actually get to know each other.

219
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:02,513
We just constantly communicate what we're doing.

220
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:09,558
And it's very important because a lot of people in the game industry have essentially no idea

221
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,920
what a union is, how it works and what it does.

222
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,903
And it's really important to show how we're helping people.

223
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:23,876
which we actively do, but it can be hard if you're just working somewhere, you're crunching,

224
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:27,060
you're trying to focus on yourself or maybe on your mental health or your kid,

225
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,846
then it's really hard to like actively stay engaged in what the union is doing.

226
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:34,489
So we need to show people the good we're doing.

227
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:40,285
Yeah, I feel like education has to be a very core component,

228
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:42,907
especially when it comes to these new territories

229
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:45,209
where people aren't familiar with unionization,

230
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:47,952
they aren't familiar with a lot of the labor rights

231
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,293
and things that come with that.

232
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:51,755
Liz, so in a lot of your work,

233
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,958
you do a lot of involvement with young folks

234
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:55,679
in the industries.

235
00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:00,463
who are wanting to get into labor and organizing new territory.

236
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:07,689
What component does education play in that, and how does the AFL-CIO play into some of those things?

237
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,995
Absolutely, and it's been so interesting to listen to the panelists so far

238
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:20,000
because I think you're seeing a lot of examples of creative and innovative organizing across different sectors,

239
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,841
and I want to compliment Emma because...

240
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:27,266
what you all have done to come together collectively already just since last year.

241
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:30,034
I think it was birthed, right, at this conference.

242
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:39,184
Yes, it's just been tremendous because it does take some guts, right, to step out there

243
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:41,945
and talk about these issues, and there's a lot at stake.

244
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:49,488
And what I've been hearing from the panelists so far, the theme is, is workers taking risks

245
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:56,671
and workers who want to get a return on the value that they are creating for these companies.

246
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:58,493
and in the economy.

247
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:01,116
And I don't think it's a lot to ask

248
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:02,437
when you're in an industry

249
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:05,521
that is three times the size of Hollywood

250
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:09,145
for you to be getting a fair return on the work

251
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:11,468
and the risk that you are putting into

252
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:13,370
the product that you're creating.

253
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:21,876
So, that is what it means to come together in union, whether it's in a union or collectively

254
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:23,436
in some other form, right?

255
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:30,060
And that's the beauty of this is the law protects workers who want to come together collectively

256
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,303
no matter what your workplace looks like or what kind of work you do.

257
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:40,906
So, that's what the AFL-CIO tries to do as an umbrella organization is lift up the organizing

258
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,947
of the various affiliated unions that...

259
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,769
belong to the AFL-CIO, but really speaking out for working people

260
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:50,350
across the economy, no matter if you're in a union or not.

261
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,551
Because we all deserve basic rights on the job, we all deserve fair pay

262
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,112
and protections, and equality,

263
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:03,734
and transparency, and accountability, which was spoken to earlier on the panel

264
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:04,174
as well.

265
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,655
And so it really is about this power dynamic.

266
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:16,697
And what we're seeing not just in your industry, but everywhere is that there seems to be this

267
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:22,478
concentration where the profits are going to a handful of people and the working people

268
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:26,739
are the ones getting the short end of the stick, not getting the value on the risk and

269
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,059
the return that you should be seeing in your work.

270
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,961
And so just a couple of quick examples, we're seeing activism unlike we've seen anywhere

271
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:37,481
in a long time.

272
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:43,843
Obviously in your industry, but most recently in the hospitality industry.

273
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:52,485
Unite Here is the union that represents hotel and restaurant employees, housekeepers, room attendants,

274
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:59,668
who just went on strike against the most profitable hotel company in the world, Marriott.

275
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:05,571
And they wanted fair wages, of course, and better working conditions.

276
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:12,656
You can imagine the stress and taxation that is happening to a room attendant who is lifting

277
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:15,558
up heavy mattresses and dealing with cleaning materials.

278
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,661
making sure they have those safety protections on the job,

279
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,943
but they also were fighting for protection

280
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:26,548
against sexual harassment because of guests in the hotels

281
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:29,370
and what they encounter when they are cleaning rooms.

282
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:32,072
Also technology.

283
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:38,618
and the introduction of automation in industrial kitchens and robots for when you check into

284
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:39,178
a hotel.

285
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:44,322
They wanted a voice in how that technology was going to be implemented in their industry.

286
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:47,465
So they used their collective bargaining process with their union.

287
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:50,787
to have enough power at the table to say,

288
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,229
here are our ideas and this is what we would like to see.

289
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,790
So that was an example of workers coming together

290
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,252
most recently, along with teachers who have been,

291
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,493
you know, out on the picket line saying,

292
00:19:02,593 --> 00:19:04,454
you know, enough's enough, we want better,

293
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:07,036
smaller class sizes in our classrooms and,

294
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,197
you know, more school supplies so we don't have

295
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,358
to buy them out of our pockets.

296
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,440
So I think this is a moment, we're calling it

297
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,461
a movement moment that you're a part of.

298
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,522
Yeah, and you touched on hospitality workers, service.

299
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,244
There's burgeoning labor movements,

300
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:25,905
not just in games, but in technology.

301
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:30,489
And you recently published an open letter to game workers

302
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,550
calling on them to unionize

303
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,911
and start organizing with one another,

304
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:36,193
and that the time was kind of right for that.

305
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:42,044
Why do you think it is that, not just in the games industry, but kind of really the whole

306
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:46,473
national picture, why do you feel like labor is kind of resurging in this moment?

307
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,296
What do you think creates these kind of conditions?

308
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:51,672
And that kind of ties to your first question about education.

309
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:54,232
I think people are starting to discover that, hey, we don't

310
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:55,653
have to just sit back and take it.

311
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:58,094
We do have a way to fight back.

312
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,755
And I think people have a lack of awareness

313
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:05,476
that you can form a union, for the most part.

314
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:08,837
Or they have old stereotypes about what unions are.

315
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:12,598
I cannot tell you the number of times I get on an airplane

316
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,959
and people ask me what I do.

317
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,540
And I say, I work for the labor movement.

318
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,760
And they either look right back down at their book.

319
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:22,743
Or they say, oh, that still exists.

320
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:25,305
I thought that was back in the 30s or whatever,

321
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:27,346
you know, for people who work in steel mills.

322
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:30,889
And yes, that's true, but I think in this moment

323
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,531
where our economy is becoming so fluid

324
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:35,772
and work is looking different,

325
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:38,774
and as you were saying about nobody works

326
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,976
in one place for 30 years anymore, right?

327
00:20:41,997 --> 00:20:45,600
We are experiencing a modernization and a surge

328
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,922
in people wanting to come together collectively

329
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:49,664
like we haven't seen before

330
00:20:49,704 --> 00:20:52,006
because of what the economy has been doing, right?

331
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:56,330
It's been repressive and the fairness and equality

332
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,434
is absolutely non-existent and people are feeling very alone

333
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:02,576
and this is a way to fight back.

334
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:05,264
Yeah.

335
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:08,106
So in your letter, you're talking about

336
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,107
now's the time to organize.

337
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:14,250
How do you feel, as the Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO,

338
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,851
a national kind of umbrella org

339
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,073
of all these different labor movements and unions,

340
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:22,075
how do you imagine game workers and tech workers in general

341
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:23,976
fitting into that national picture?

342
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,658
How do you imagine us incorporating into the larger whole?

343
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:30,040
Well, this is so incredibly exciting because

344
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:33,058
The world is your oyster, right?

345
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:35,741
There is no one particular way to do this.

346
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,783
And I think we could benefit from your creativity

347
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:41,205
and your innovation in thinking about

348
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:42,887
what a model could look like.

349
00:21:43,147 --> 00:21:44,728
Now, there are models that exist,

350
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:48,271
and I think that could work for this industry as well.

351
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,693
I came out of the electrical workers union, right?

352
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:52,935
Where electricians who work in construction

353
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,958
are moving from job to job, it's very dynamic,

354
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:58,480
it's very fluid, they get all of their training.

355
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,724
through the union because they're constantly coming back to the union as a center of gravity.

356
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:06,206
They get their benefits through the union.

357
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:08,907
People think portable benefits is a new conversation.

358
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:09,508
It's not.

359
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,611
Because for over 100 years, unions have been doing this, right?

360
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:15,993
So that is a model that exists.

361
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:22,317
Now, there could be a model like a guild, for example, that Uber drivers have formed

362
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:24,999
in New York, where they come together and they fight against

363
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,786
Not only company policies and to be recognized, that's how the tipping policy was changed, actually, with Uber.

364
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:38,072
As the Independent Drivers Guild went to the company and said, this is absolutely locking us out.

365
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:45,039
And then also, certainly with the Taxi Cab Commission and the regulatory framework, they're able to use their guild to leverage that.

366
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,965
There could be a model where you might be a member of the AFL-CIO, for example, directly,

367
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:54,648
independently, and we could provide support and infrastructure.

368
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:59,793
But I think the one thing to think about is there's the movement piece of this, but there's

369
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:03,336
also the organization piece of this that's so important.

370
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:07,860
And a lot of people think, yeah, we got a movement, but you also have to have an organization

371
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,843
to be able to deliver on the goals of that movement.

372
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:17,646
So I kind of want to make sure we have a nice decent chunk of time for audience Q&A, but

373
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:23,069
before we get on to that, I think it would be really nice to take a moment and step back

374
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:27,832
maybe from that larger picture of everything, but to people who are maybe new to the labor

375
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:32,194
movement, people who are new to organizing and talking to their fellow co-workers about

376
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:32,935
these kinds of things.

377
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:35,496
Each of you, I'd like to hear just briefly kind of like,

378
00:23:36,176 --> 00:23:38,257
what maybe a general tip you might be,

379
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:40,918
you would just give to someone who's just starting out

380
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:42,619
and maybe like, what first steps would you

381
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,660
recommend them kind of following?

382
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,221
Justin, do you wanna start off?

383
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:47,962
Yeah, I think that,

384
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:54,665
boy, it's hard not to jump in on the economic situation

385
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:57,126
for people in the industry and the big picture.

386
00:23:57,146 --> 00:24:01,028
But can I just say one little thing about that is that,

387
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:21,443
What's happening is the massive disparity of wealth inequality in this country is, I feel like I'm preaching to the choir here, but I feel like it's worth saying that there are a few people that are taking everybody's money and making people work like 60 or 70 hours a week and giving them

388
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:26,108
just enough for them to survive to continue producing wealth for them.

389
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,192
And that's the moment that we're in.

390
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:33,137
That's the moment that this country has been in in the past, and this world has been in the past,

391
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:37,082
and the solution to that situation is mass organizing.

392
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,103
into militant, strong labor unions.

393
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,825
And that's, I feel like, it is a moment, it is happening.

394
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:47,806
People are doing it, and it's up for institutions

395
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:49,707
to figure out how to interact with that

396
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:51,828
and provide the necessary resources

397
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:54,529
for people that are on the front lines fighting that.

398
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,910
And I think that that's also what's really exciting,

399
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,572
is that's happening everywhere across our industry,

400
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:03,073
and people are looking to fight back,

401
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,414
and we have to figure out how to help support that.

402
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:09,676
And that's not necessarily helpful day-to-day advice.

403
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,537
So I will circle back to that and say

404
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:15,139
that beginning to have conversations with people

405
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,000
that you know and trust about what's

406
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,801
happening at your workspace, what's

407
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:24,105
happening in your working lives, is the best way to start.

408
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:28,147
You'll find that there's obviously tremendous fear

409
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:29,748
about collective action because.

410
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:35,531
the corporations that you work for are in a structure where they have most of the power.

411
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:41,994
But you'll also find that when you have open conversations with people who are experiencing

412
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:47,196
the same or very similar situation as you are, that there's going to be tremendous solidarity

413
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:51,498
and tremendous receptiveness to at least talking about those things.

414
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:54,559
So just to elevate the notion of community building.

415
00:25:55,157 --> 00:26:02,041
We do a lot of happy hours, we do a lot of coffees, a lot of teas, where people just start breaking

416
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:08,404
down the isolation that they're facing and realizing that it's not just them who are facing these

417
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:14,628
problems and that it's actually a systemic approach for companies to maximize profit off of your

418
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:18,970
labor. That happens through one-on-ones and that happens through people coming together

419
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,973
collectively. And then the next step is trying to build that organization.

420
00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:27,565
And that will come after.

421
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:30,787
But really just developing the solidarity by talking

422
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:33,229
to each other about what you're experiencing.

423
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,490
Thank you.

424
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:34,950
Liz?

425
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:39,247
I think the education piece is really big in knowing your rights.

426
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:44,709
And Emma can be also a support source for that.

427
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,570
But also the broader labor movement is here.

428
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,771
You've got a whole table full of people who want to help.

429
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:54,513
And so us being there to answer questions and encourage you along the way and support you.

430
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:59,015
So knowing your rights and then, as Justin said, talking to each other.

431
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:05,278
You're used to living in an open source environment and solving problems collectively.

432
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:09,481
Have those conversations with each other and think outside the box.

433
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,243
I hate that saying, but I'm going to say it anyway.

434
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:16,108
But, you know, it's why not be brainstorming new ways of doing things.

435
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:22,654
And we can be there as a labor movement infrastructure to support you along the way.

436
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:24,055
Awesome. Thanks.

437
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:28,059
Linda, what advice would you have for someone just starting out?

438
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:36,278
Yeah, I'd really stress the importance of one-on-one and the building trust amongst one another.

439
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:39,619
And because when you're going through these organizing efforts,

440
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,681
these are going to be the building blocks and the relationships you carry throughout every step of the way.

441
00:27:44,022 --> 00:27:47,423
You want to make sure that people are educated, you're talking to people,

442
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:50,905
that people are involved and are excited to be involved.

443
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,046
So one-on-ones are super important.

444
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:55,427
Yeah. And Kevin?

445
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,282
I feel like I'm preaching to a choir here, but yeah, it is talking to your co-workers,

446
00:28:00,322 --> 00:28:04,823
talking to the people you work with and figuring out their problems, building connections.

447
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:10,985
Because a lot of people in this industry are marginalized or feel isolated and believe

448
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:16,007
that they are facing these problems alone, by themselves, when we're all facing those

449
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:20,148
problems and we want to stand up together to fight for better conditions.

450
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:24,892
It's not just like figuring out what our problems are, right?

451
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:30,817
It's building actual human connection to form like a culture of care where we care about each other,

452
00:28:30,857 --> 00:28:35,201
we care about our problems, we care about solving the issues we're facing together.

453
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,021
Yeah, and I'll add my two cents.

454
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:40,582
I think everyone kind of touched on it, really,

455
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:42,983
but Kevin, you really articulated it.

456
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:46,145
A fellow organizer once told me that to her,

457
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:48,787
organizing is about building a culture of care

458
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,648
in your workplace, right, and in your industry.

459
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:54,150
And I think that's really kind of a profound

460
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,951
and very sweet way to approach organizing, right?

461
00:28:57,412 --> 00:28:58,972
It's about building a culture of care.

462
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:02,013
And that means actually listening to people,

463
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:04,653
hearing their problems, genuinely caring,

464
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:06,954
and it doesn't matter what their position are

465
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:10,395
on unions and things, what role they play in the industry,

466
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:13,295
genuinely approaching them with genuine empathy

467
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:14,896
and care about their situation,

468
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,816
and learning to listen first,

469
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:20,397
and not just lecture and share stats and things,

470
00:29:20,437 --> 00:29:21,977
but focus on emotion and story.

471
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:23,538
I think that's at least something

472
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:26,898
I would definitely share with new organizers.

473
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:29,159
Awesome.

474
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,580
So, we're going to move into the audience section.

475
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,302
So if you have any questions or advice that you want to seek from our panelists, there's

476
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:43,724
a lot of really wonderful perspective and knowledge to share up here.

477
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:46,265
So we could go all night, but we've got about 30 minutes.

478
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:48,226
Yeah, we'll start over here.

479
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:49,301
Hello.

480
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:52,443
What are the unique challenges presented by, say,

481
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:55,525
an indie developer where you might be alone

482
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:58,127
or working part-time in a different industry

483
00:29:58,367 --> 00:29:59,768
and in your free time making games?

484
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,570
Sure.

485
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,450
Justin, you want to take that?

486
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:08,257
One thing that, as I've looked at and just starting to learn a little bit more about this industry,

487
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:16,644
is that the independent development scene looks a little bit to me like the independent film scene in our union.

488
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:19,626
And so, oftentimes, people will wear the hat.

489
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:23,748
many different hats and do many different things within a production.

490
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:27,209
And so the things that have worked for our union in that space

491
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:31,431
is the community building. And so we'll have an independent film caucus where

492
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:36,012
people who are working in isolated situations can come together and talk

493
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:36,952
about their craft,

494
00:30:37,413 --> 00:30:41,054
talk about funders, talk about the various issues that are impacting them

495
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:41,894
as individually,

496
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:45,936
and look for common, potential common solutions related to that. Or just get

497
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:46,536
together and

498
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:48,296
talk to other human beings.

499
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:51,898
seems to be actually of value for folks in that.

500
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:55,680
And then also, the union has a contract

501
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:59,803
that can be negotiated whereby you would be,

502
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:02,304
if you're the indie game developer

503
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:05,286
and you're working sort of as a self-owned

504
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:07,927
or self-produced entity,

505
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,389
that you can actually become signatory

506
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,490
to the union contract and become eligible

507
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,590
for health insurance.

508
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:15,772
And that contract was developed

509
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:22,594
as independent film makers got together and talked about ways in which that contract should

510
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:23,414
be structured.

511
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:31,297
And so Indy, if by Indy you also mean some smaller companies, then I think it's important

512
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:37,339
to take an industry-wide approach so that not just one or two of them are unionized,

513
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:38,360
but all of them are.

514
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:42,257
Well, I'm talking about people who are not in a shop, specifically.

515
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,839
Can I add an additional part to that question?

516
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:45,860
Briefly.

517
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,321
Yeah.

518
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:53,266
What about groups that already exist, say like the IGDA branch of your local thing,

519
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:57,890
how will that, how will Game Workers Unite distinguish itself from that or be joined

520
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,450
into that?

521
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,853
Maybe they don't want to be joined into it, but the community already exists.

522
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:06,036
I'm kind of like thinking of these like case scenarios, edge case scenarios.

523
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:07,929
I'd actually like to tackle that.

524
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,490
For clarity, when it comes to labor organizing,

525
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,191
it always happens on a shop by shop basis.

526
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:16,632
It's a very local, grassroots approach.

527
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:19,032
Even if it's a part of a larger national

528
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,133
or international movement,

529
00:32:20,193 --> 00:32:22,973
it's always about the individual workers in the shop

530
00:32:23,313 --> 00:32:25,294
coming together to find whatever path forward

531
00:32:25,674 --> 00:32:27,895
and whatever issues they want to work around

532
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:29,975
and what solutions they want to find.

533
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:35,317
And so in that way, it really is up to the individual groups of workers in their studios

534
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:36,457
to find out their own path.

535
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:42,278
And so, yeah, if they want to find community and solidarity in the IGDA or Game Workers

536
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:45,959
Unite or any community really, that's wonderful.

537
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:50,360
And Game Workers Unite is here to help with education and providing organizer training

538
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,922
and kind of building up the general skills of the populace, but really it's again about

539
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:56,982
that local shop.

540
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,703
And they might choose to go with any one existing union.

541
00:33:00,423 --> 00:33:03,567
They might choose to keep their own independent just themselves union, right?

542
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:11,415
They might also want to form as a collective of other shops that are unionizing a larger like National Union

543
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:18,903
Say it's very flexible and it's up to what the workers themselves decide. Does that provide a little clarity on that? Yeah. Thank you for sure

544
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:25,310
If I could add a couple of thoughts here. That has been a debate around, you know, traditionally

545
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:31,460
we've seen people organized around craft. So, for example, I used my union electrical

546
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,623
workers, we're all electricians in the country.

547
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:36,405
based on their craft organized a union.

548
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:43,868
Then you have also this sort of more horizontal industry example of, you know, steel workers,

549
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:49,591
you know, and their companies would go across a company, no matter where that company's

550
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:54,593
footprint was, they organized by the company in that particular industry.

551
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:57,014
And sometimes you could have an industry-wide...

552
00:33:57,525 --> 00:34:01,953
you know, all the companies coming together too at one table where we've had models like

553
00:34:01,993 --> 00:34:02,234
that.

554
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:05,920
But for folks who are independent who aren't employees...

555
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,682
there's a distinction there because under the National Labor Relations Act, you're not

556
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:15,763
eligible, I guess, to form a traditional union as an independent contractor.

557
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:20,625
So that's where we're seeing these new models emerge, where I mentioned the Uber Drivers

558
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:25,327
Guild, where they still can come together collectively to leverage their strength, right,

559
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:28,768
because you're more powerful together than you are on your own.

560
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:31,129
And so they're organizing in different ways.

561
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:34,790
Car wash workers, taxi drivers, folks

562
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,290
who have been on their own, feeling alone,

563
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,671
have a way to come together and bargain or negotiate.

564
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:45,112
So the AFL-CIO is exploring this right now

565
00:34:45,172 --> 00:34:47,933
because we're doing a future of work initiative

566
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:51,133
where we're thinking, how can the labor movement actually

567
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:54,954
think more creatively, more fluidly about how

568
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:56,895
work is going to be organized in the future?

569
00:34:56,955 --> 00:34:58,755
Because there is, as we know, this push.

570
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:04,120
to try to, employers to try to, you know, skirt responsibility, to be honest, right?

571
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,641
They don't want to be an employer anymore.

572
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:09,525
Of course, we're going to fight that, but we also need to figure out a path forward

573
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:12,527
for workers who want to come together in a different way.

574
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:18,833
So it is about scale, and I would guess as someone who works on your own independently,

575
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:21,255
you still want to have access to affordable health care.

576
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:23,897
You still want to have access to, you know,

577
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:27,259
perhaps maybe one day buying a home and getting a mortgage.

578
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:28,000
Who knows, right?

579
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,822
And also discounts on things that, you know,

580
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,622
when you are part of a large organization,

581
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:38,525
you can get cheaper access to staying at a hotel

582
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:39,325
or whatever it is.

583
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,286
So I think we're looking at a model

584
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:43,988
of how we can open up the labor movement scale

585
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,509
to leverage that for workers

586
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:49,851
who aren't necessarily employees, if that makes sense.

587
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:51,832
Thanks for the question.

588
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:53,172
Yeah, over here.

589
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:53,873
So.

590
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,781
Very similar to my question.

591
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,624
So I'm a freelancer, and I've debated

592
00:35:59,764 --> 00:36:03,688
putting up on my website discounts for studios

593
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:06,130
with union labor, that employs union labor.

594
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,074
Is there any other way that freelancers

595
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:15,059
can support our fellow workers in bigger studios

596
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,903
than just discounts or showing up to meetings?

597
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:22,284
I feel like either Linda or Justin could probably tackle that.

598
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:23,465
Linda, do you want to take a stab?

599
00:36:23,565 --> 00:36:27,326
One of the things that, since we've started organizing in digital media,

600
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:30,286
the folks that have been able to join the union

601
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:32,447
and be part of the collective bargaining agreement

602
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:35,928
are the staff and staff workers at places.

603
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:39,949
But just like in your industry, in the writing industry,

604
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,770
there's many, many freelancers who are either doing an article here

605
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,250
and there and.

606
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:45,892
are not eligible to join the union.

607
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:52,676
And so we have a sort of an adjacent effort of freelance solidarity that happens where

608
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:57,779
people who are in the freelance space come together at our union office and look for

609
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:02,821
collective solutions to try to either increase the rates that they're part of or to support

610
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,183
contract campaigns that places that they write for.

611
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:08,205
are part of.

612
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:11,388
And so that requires, just like Liz was saying,

613
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:13,950
thinking about things a little bit differently

614
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,914
and adapting to the actual economy that's in front of us,

615
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:21,017
which includes multiple freelance pools of labor

616
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:23,920
and multiple ways that companies, frankly,

617
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,321
are working to get around.

618
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:29,004
having traditional employee-employer relationships.

619
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:33,528
So I think as long as a lot of the same things apply

620
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:37,331
if you're freelance, and that's about building community,

621
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:38,612
building collective power.

622
00:37:39,432 --> 00:37:41,694
If you look at some things the National Writers Union

623
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:42,675
has done in terms of

624
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:49,219
They've done lawsuits around non-payment for magazine publications and have been really

625
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:52,642
innovating doing new collective actions for freelancers.

626
00:37:52,702 --> 00:37:58,526
So I would argue that it's going to be extremely important to make sure that freelancers are

627
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:01,888
part of any future unions within your industry.

628
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,451
Linda, do you want to touch on that as well?

629
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:09,603
Yeah, I think it's a matter of, you know, what Justin touched upon, it's like where

630
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:14,785
you have a space where you can also stay organized even if you're not particularly in that bargaining

631
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:15,726
unit of the union.

632
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:23,249
Because one example of SAG-AFTRA is that choreographers are not considered part of our union, but

633
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:23,529
they...

634
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:30,271
A lot of them actually are members because we do cover dancers, but then they created

635
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:35,193
kind of like their own space, but also work closely with the union where they call themselves

636
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:40,915
the Choreographer Alliance and use this alliance model where they still have a lot of autonomy

637
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:47,077
where they can create their own meetings, they teach classes, do fundraising, and they

638
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:48,417
still talk to one another.

639
00:38:49,678 --> 00:38:52,961
are able to actually create minimums for each other.

640
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:57,504
So I think there's still ways like using kind of like the alliance model of like

641
00:38:57,524 --> 00:39:02,488
this is kind of like the on rap to activism and organizing and they're able to do that.

642
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:07,072
But also be in solidarity with the dancers and the union and work together.

643
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:12,236
I just want to add because it works slightly differently in the UK. In the UK, even if

644
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:16,079
you're a freelancer or a contractor, you have no job. You're allowed to join the union.

645
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,323
There's just a fundamental right of every person in the UK to have the right to join

646
00:39:20,343 --> 00:39:26,889
the union. And one of the things that we at our solidarity workers and the AWGB achieved

647
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:29,331
is that for the Liverpool and Uber drivers.

648
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:36,060
They formed a union for them, they successfully unionised and in high court they thought that

649
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:42,747
these careers are recognised as employees with full employee rights, sick days, vacation,

650
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:44,008
paternity, maternity leave.

651
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:50,577
Because, I know it's scientific, yes, but there's one thing that a lot of people work

652
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:57,064
on like rolling contracts from years to like just a couple of weeks, that actually like

653
00:39:57,084 --> 00:40:01,389
they should be full-time employees, they should be bought in-house and just get a regular

654
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:02,590
salary and regular benefits.

655
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,253
And that is also something we are trying to fight for.

656
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:12,790
I'm sorry, another thing that we're experimenting with that might be relevant is bargaining

657
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,270
for all.

658
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:19,776
So that, for example, the UFCW commercial workers are in negotiations with big grocery

659
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:24,680
stores and they've invited non-union workers to their bargaining table because they're

660
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,602
going to bargain for lifting standards for everyone.

661
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:30,525
So that might be also an outlet in the future.

662
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:32,267
Thank you.

663
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:43,162
So there's been a lot of talk about organizing by trade, specifically.

664
00:40:43,383 --> 00:40:52,089
Like, Linda, you were saying, for example, that choreographers aren't included in SAG-AFTRA.

665
00:40:57,156 --> 00:41:01,558
Can you talk a little bit about a solidarity union model

666
00:41:02,038 --> 00:41:05,639
where you're organizing not necessarily just the game

667
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:10,781
workers, but everyone in the shop, including janitorial

668
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:16,283
staff, and using the leverage that game workers have?

669
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:24,106
as folks who have a little bit more of specific skills

670
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:27,046
and therefore leverage in order to raise the standards

671
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:30,287
for workers in their shop who their bosses might see

672
00:41:30,347 --> 00:41:33,348
as more disposable, heavy air quotes.

673
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:36,169
I think that's really crucial.

674
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:37,889
Do you wanna tackle that?

675
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:42,411
Yeah, so even to continue talking about choreographers,

676
00:41:42,451 --> 00:41:43,491
like we know that.

677
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:47,355
they have a super specialized skill set,

678
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:51,478
and usually they will be in solidarity with the dancers

679
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:54,059
because a lot of them grew up and trained as dancers

680
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,321
and are part of our union because of dancing.

681
00:41:58,721 --> 00:42:01,663
So they would even show solidarity with the dancers

682
00:42:01,683 --> 00:42:04,744
where they can say that we want this project

683
00:42:04,764 --> 00:42:06,345
to be covered by union contract.

684
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:16,887
they've been building, and then the choreographers will go to other shows,

685
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:19,307
like say they go on tour with a musical artist,

686
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:21,928
where they're like, okay, and then they still float that idea,

687
00:42:21,988 --> 00:42:24,209
because the choreographer, there's only like,

688
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:26,869
there's a smaller set of choreographers doing this kind of work,

689
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:29,070
and then they're constantly getting work.

690
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,230
So if they go to, like say on tour,

691
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,371
then they can also float that idea of like,

692
00:42:34,411 --> 00:42:37,652
we want this to be, you know, covered by union contract,

693
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:39,892
we want union dancers and, you know,

694
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,033
help organize in that way, so that.

695
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:48,016
there is that solidarity and that education going on and they

696
00:42:49,137 --> 00:42:52,819
were able to, that's still like an ongoing effort to

697
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,522
organize music tours, but they were able to do it with a Justin Timberlake tour in 2012

698
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:03,126
and then recently he went on tour last year and then that they were able to make that a union tour as well.

699
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:06,194
Awesome, and yeah, I would just further expand by

700
00:43:07,095 --> 00:43:09,218
emphasizing that at least for me,

701
00:43:09,258 --> 00:43:10,740
and I think a lot of people in Game Workers Unite,

702
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,384
we really do buy into the industrial model of organizing,

703
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:17,247
which kind of, as you were describing, means, you know.

704
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:18,669
Yeah, that's exactly what I was describing.

705
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:25,745
Yeah, to reiterate is kind of yes about like organizing all workers across all disciplines

706
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:30,706
because it's a little harder to separate people when we're all banded together in one big group.

707
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:35,568
And I think a part of that absolutely, it absolutely is organizing all workers.

708
00:43:35,808 --> 00:43:40,630
If you have any role to play in the work of our companies and our studios making games,

709
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:46,631
and I mean genuinely like engineers, artists, writers, QA testers, right, community managers.

710
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:49,954
I mean, the folks who work down in the cafeteria

711
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:50,954
or who maintain the building,

712
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:53,156
everyone's playing a hand here, right?

713
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:56,158
Like everyone's enabling this medium that we work in, right?

714
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,740
And I think it's super essential to,

715
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,141
yeah, as we've been saying,

716
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:02,123
include everyone when we're trying

717
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:03,704
to improve our workplaces, yeah.

718
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:04,773
In a campus...

719
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:05,494
Great, thank you.

720
00:44:06,575 --> 00:44:06,835
Sorry.

721
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:08,717
The example might also be with campuses.

722
00:44:08,777 --> 00:44:13,282
We've been seeing, you know, that solidarity come around on college campuses where you

723
00:44:13,322 --> 00:44:17,567
have, you know, obviously the faculty, you've got the grad students organizing, you've got

724
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:21,671
cafeteria workers, and they're leveraging, you know, each other's strengths.

725
00:44:22,652 --> 00:44:27,994
In some cases the whole campus is organized and they help the cafeteria workers lift up their voice.

726
00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:33,056
And also in Silicon Valley we have an example of what we call Silicon Valley Rising,

727
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:37,617
where you saw at Facebook and Google and other places where shuttle bus drivers,

728
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:40,498
cafeteria workers and security guards organized a union.

729
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:47,221
Because of the support in the Silicon Valley area of all the other labor unions coming together,

730
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:51,364
lifting them up and using every tool at our disposal,

731
00:44:51,404 --> 00:44:54,046
whether it's capital strategies with our pension funds and

732
00:44:54,106 --> 00:44:56,447
leveraging, you know, at shareholders meetings,

733
00:44:56,567 --> 00:45:00,150
it's, you know, legislative and regulatory pressure strategy to

734
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,032
get the company to pay attention, media, you know.

735
00:45:03,092 --> 00:45:07,515
So we bring all those tools to bear together in a particular

736
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:11,098
geographical area to help workers who may not necessarily

737
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:12,959
have as much of a voice.

738
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:14,983
And to button that, I would also say,

739
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,125
I think we genuinely have a lot to learn

740
00:45:17,165 --> 00:45:19,246
from those people who have organized, right?

741
00:45:19,307 --> 00:45:21,288
Those cafeteria workers, those shuttle workers,

742
00:45:21,328 --> 00:45:22,309
those maintenance folks.

743
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:24,390
We have much to learn from them,

744
00:45:24,611 --> 00:45:27,513
and they are already doing that work in our studios,

745
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:28,794
right, in our companies, right,

746
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:30,115
at Facebook and other places.

747
00:45:30,935 --> 00:45:32,296
So we have a lot to learn from them,

748
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,098
and I think that's a healthy relationship

749
00:45:35,138 --> 00:45:36,660
we should be continuing to develop.

750
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,480
Thank you.

751
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:38,681
Thank you.

752
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,183
Hi, thanks for coming.

753
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:42,344
So.

754
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:45,233
There are entire parts of the video game industry

755
00:45:45,273 --> 00:45:48,375
that rely on free labor that generates money for companies,

756
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,117
for example, like streaming or like kids making skins

757
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:52,958
for Minecraft.

758
00:45:53,738 --> 00:45:55,580
Like another more well-known example of this

759
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,741
from another industry are like BuzzFeed quizzes.

760
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:00,623
And I'm just wondering, how has this

761
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:02,544
happened in other sites of organizing,

762
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:04,326
and how has it been addressed?

763
00:46:04,486 --> 00:46:06,707
And are these people considered to be workers?

764
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:08,428
Are we bringing them into these efforts?

765
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:14,965
So you're kind of talking about community made labor and products of labor. How does that fit into this? Awesome question

766
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:16,686
Does anyone want to tackle that?

767
00:46:18,587 --> 00:46:23,831
In one thing I tell you if you came from union is deciding on who who's eligible eligible to join

768
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,433
I go to draw the line. Is it a

769
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:31,977
Professional eSports players they get a salary from the company that makes the game. Are they considered game workers?

770
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:34,459
freelance game journalists like

771
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:40,313
where do we people who work on middleware for games who are gonna have a day

772
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:41,195
consider game workers

773
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:45,285
one of the things you have to do is that

774
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:54,583
anybody who is involved in the process of making games at some level is in the union

775
00:46:54,603 --> 00:47:01,466
when it comes to user-generated content, when it comes to modders or YouTubers which are

776
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:08,870
seen as professional esports players. There we draw the line because

777
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:18,744
Like, the Games Industry is a very big, big space where it is hard to get the solidarity

778
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:20,105
you need from all the workers.

779
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:26,408
So until we can really get a foothold in this industry, we don't want to stretch ourselves

780
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:28,729
too soon and try to cover too many bases.

781
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:35,940
Maybe Linda or Justin, I think this is kind of slightly also related to things like spec work.

782
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:42,547
In the industry we definitely have an issue with people requesting spec work, which for those who aren't familiar are

783
00:47:43,148 --> 00:47:50,196
requesting essentially free labor, free examples of your creativity or ability before actually hiring you or paying you.

784
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:56,160
We even had a very notable example at last E3 where Ubisoft had a program that was essentially

785
00:47:56,781 --> 00:47:58,241
asking for community spec work.

786
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:03,225
Is that common in maybe your industry I would assume as well maybe?

787
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:09,025
Yeah, that's an even, you know, in the film and television industry and for script writing,

788
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:10,206
it's quite common.

789
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:15,971
And the way that folks have addressed that is through a collective bargaining agreement

790
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:21,376
that sets out the standards for what people are paid for doing labor.

791
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:27,199
And in order to get there, there just needs to be a common understanding of the people

792
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:33,321
who are doing that work and a shared responsibility to hold each other accountable to not working

793
00:48:33,462 --> 00:48:34,082
for free.

794
00:48:34,942 --> 00:48:40,604
But that problem definitely doesn't go away with a union because people are doing work

795
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:44,526
that they are passionate about and they care about and are trying to break into an industry.

796
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:49,728
So that's definitely a challenge with or without a union, frankly.

797
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:51,208
Thank you.

798
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:00,123
Hi, any advice for students who, especially undergrad, who want to raise awareness and stuff in

799
00:49:01,123 --> 00:49:03,304
schools that sometimes the teachers are a bit more

800
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:10,027
old-fashioned about this, especially because I don't want to rest on my laurels and say, oh, it'll be solved by the time I graduate.

801
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:12,088
We'll have a union by then.

802
00:49:12,108 --> 00:49:16,690
Yeah, does anyone want to tackle the kind of subject of students?

803
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:21,032
How they fit in? As far as activism? Yeah, and getting them involved.

804
00:49:21,516 --> 00:49:26,199
Yeah, there's an organization called the United Students Against Sweatshops that is very active

805
00:49:26,259 --> 00:49:28,760
on campuses speaking out.

806
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:35,283
Of course, the motivator for them or the reason why they formed was because of the college

807
00:49:35,324 --> 00:49:40,666
athletic wear that was being sold on campus was being made in sweatshops in other countries

808
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:42,788
and they wanted to change the standards.

809
00:49:43,808 --> 00:49:46,530
for what they could sell on campus, right?

810
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,593
We want clothing that's made using, you know,

811
00:49:50,013 --> 00:49:51,594
folks who are being paid a fair wage

812
00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:53,656
and aren't being taken advantage of.

813
00:49:53,716 --> 00:49:56,198
So that activism kind of branched out

814
00:49:56,518 --> 00:50:01,101
and now is, I think, a very fluid organization

815
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:04,003
that turns over in leadership quite often

816
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,465
because the nature of students coming and going.

817
00:50:06,926 --> 00:50:08,047
But it's been evergreen.

818
00:50:08,947 --> 00:50:11,529
And I don't know, you could look them up online probably.

819
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,916
But also, you know, you're able to start a chapter of your own if you want at your campus

820
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:24,484
in terms of connecting with the players in your community and being a voice on campus

821
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:26,746
for the organizing that's going on in the community.

822
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:30,975
I would also say there's kind of an inverse relationship too to be mindful of.

823
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:36,741
At least with Game Workers Unite we do a lot of work around preparing education materials

824
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:41,726
for students about not just the reality of the industry but also basics of how to advocate

825
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:43,207
for yourself in the workplace and things.

826
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:47,912
And I think it's super important that we include student voices in our organizing work because

827
00:50:48,272 --> 00:50:50,815
even though they might not be workers now, they certainly will be.

828
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,518
in a few years and this industry is really hard for new people.

829
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:57,540
Jumping in can feel like going right into the deep end and

830
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,703
I think as much as we can prepare people for it is

831
00:51:01,204 --> 00:51:05,447
really essential so your voice and any student's voices are super welcome and

832
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:06,028
appreciated

833
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:09,150
in the movement and I would encourage everyone to get involved for sure.

834
00:51:11,656 --> 00:51:12,918
We probably have time for about one more.

835
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:18,765
Yeah, so yesterday we spoke a bit about how in a union you can't have anyone who's got

836
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:20,206
a hiring and firing power.

837
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:24,411
And looking at the business cards you've been giving out, there's lots of executives on

838
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:27,555
there, but there's no supervisors, there's no lead developers.

839
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:31,656
a lot of these people would be exploited as well

840
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,177
by the executive class, they would be at risk of layoffs,

841
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,137
like frontline workers.

842
00:51:36,017 --> 00:51:37,698
Is there a labor organization model

843
00:51:37,718 --> 00:51:40,198
where frontline workers can unite with them

844
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:41,878
to form a united front against

845
00:51:42,118 --> 00:51:50,540
the highest levels in the companies?

846
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,501
Nothing that I'm familiar with, does anyone have any?

847
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:56,381
Oh yeah.

848
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:57,881
That's really hard for me to hear.

849
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:05,107
I think the question was about people being part of the labor unions who are technically

850
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:09,311
under labor law statutory supervisors or otherwise ineligible, right?

851
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:10,672
Is that what you're asking?

852
00:52:11,132 --> 00:52:11,493
Yeah, yeah.

853
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:16,317
So basically like low to mid-level managers who would also be at risk from abuse from

854
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:22,722
executives and how they can help us form a united front against this kind of executive

855
00:52:22,762 --> 00:52:23,122
overpaying.

856
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:31,614
We've been, the organizing that we've been doing since 2015 has been all outside of the National Labor Relations Board.

857
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:38,364
The National Labor Relations Board is the entity that enforces the National Labor Relations Act.

858
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:47,529
And that is to us essentially a law that is designed in many ways to prevent workers from organizing.

859
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:56,793
And so we've been operating outside of that law, which gives us tremendous flexibility in terms of bargaining unit composition,

860
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:57,173
meaning

861
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:05,726
that people that that law may consider to be supervisors or managers or otherwise unable to join a union,

862
00:53:06,146 --> 00:53:10,528
can in fact join the unions that are being formed at the companies where people are working.

863
00:53:10,728 --> 00:53:17,190
And that requires tremendous solidarity of the people that are organizing,

864
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,911
and it's much more difficult to have folks like that included.

865
00:53:22,512 --> 00:53:25,453
and you have to leverage the company to agree to that

866
00:53:25,754 --> 00:53:29,996
through using direct action tactics and public shaming

867
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:32,337
and whatever else you can find in your arsenal

868
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,539
up to and including the threat of withholding your labor

869
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:36,280
in a strike.

870
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,163
But we have found it to be useful to have unions

871
00:53:41,223 --> 00:53:42,743
that have more people in them,

872
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:45,545
who sometimes have more power in them,

873
00:53:46,406 --> 00:53:48,767
to get better things from the company.

874
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,477
But it's definitely a, it's a challenge.

875
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:56,667
I would also tack onto this that I know you're from Ireland.

876
00:53:57,087 --> 00:53:59,568
And so something to note also is that we're

877
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:01,508
talking about the National Labor Relations Board,

878
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:02,849
and that's very US-centric.

879
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:06,269
And I think the thing to really say

880
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:11,451
is that the legal framework and context around labor and unions

881
00:54:11,511 --> 00:54:14,411
and things really does vary a lot by country to country.

882
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:15,792
And that's something that would just

883
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:19,252
have to be researched for your actual communities and studios.

884
00:54:19,853 --> 00:54:22,733
But yeah, to build off of what Justin was saying.

885
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:28,872
It isn't terribly uncommon that managers and supervisors, creative leads, things like that...

886
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,581
can be sometimes included in an organizing campaign.

887
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:36,302
And I think, just to extra emphasize something

888
00:54:36,342 --> 00:54:37,503
I think Justin was hinting at is,

889
00:54:37,843 --> 00:54:39,924
I think it's really crucial that when you're organizing

890
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,945
with those types of folks, one, I would say,

891
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:44,226
you bring them on a little bit after,

892
00:54:44,506 --> 00:54:46,127
when you've already organized many of the

893
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,667
kind of base level workers.

894
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:49,988
And secondly, when you're organizing,

895
00:54:50,348 --> 00:54:53,250
ensure that the actual structures of the organization

896
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,031
and how you run things and how voices are represented

897
00:54:56,231 --> 00:54:57,912
in the democratic structure of the union is,

898
00:54:58,792 --> 00:55:02,215
is taking into account the kind of natural power dynamics

899
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:04,917
that some of these leads and directors and supervisors

900
00:55:05,217 --> 00:55:06,378
tend to have in the company.

901
00:55:06,778 --> 00:55:08,880
So that way they're not overrunning anyone's voice.

902
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,041
Yeah.

903
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:16,975
One small point is the scenario we see most often is very confrontational.

904
00:55:17,535 --> 00:55:24,477
But there are scenarios where employers and managers actually will work with you to form a union.

905
00:55:24,817 --> 00:55:26,878
And they are rare, but they do happen.

906
00:55:27,218 --> 00:55:34,180
And I guess we should maybe approach it always first with the rationale that, hey, we're in this together.

907
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,462
We're creating value at this company.

908
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:38,524
When we do better, you do better.

909
00:55:38,664 --> 00:55:40,586
We all want to see this company succeed.

910
00:55:41,747 --> 00:55:44,449
So we want to form a union just so that we have a seat at the table.

911
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,633
And we want to be a shareholder, so to speak, and have a voice.

912
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:53,573
And so I come from a tradition where that is the case.

913
00:55:53,653 --> 00:55:56,274
Labor and management are together in lockstep

914
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:58,315
because we are the skilled, trained talent

915
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,416
that make the money, and they know it.

916
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:03,597
So the union benefits them in this way.

917
00:56:04,238 --> 00:56:05,958
So I guess that's one thought I had

918
00:56:05,998 --> 00:56:07,439
when you were talking about management

919
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,720
is that we can't always assume that they're our enemy.

920
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,522
And because in some cases, middle management benefit when there's a union in the company, right?

921
00:56:15,562 --> 00:56:19,244
Because we're raising that lifting tide or that raising tide lifts all boats

922
00:56:19,364 --> 00:56:23,545
that the managers actually end up benefiting when there's a union in the workplace.

923
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:28,210
Yeah, and I think, of course, it's always, throughout that process, even if we go in

924
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:32,714
with good intentions and assuming the best of folks, always having that kind of caveat

925
00:56:32,754 --> 00:56:32,954
there.

926
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:33,735
Absolutely.

927
00:56:34,316 --> 00:56:39,560
The relationship is inherently one where the workers and the bosses have different needs

928
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,261
and interests.

929
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:41,562
That's more common, yes.

930
00:56:43,424 --> 00:56:45,966
And yeah, I think that's a wonderful question.

931
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:46,407
Thank you.

932
00:56:46,427 --> 00:56:47,608
Thanks very much.

933
00:56:48,028 --> 00:56:48,208
Yeah.

934
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:53,550
So, we are now out of time. Thank you for, you know, the panelists for being here today.

935
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:58,771
It's really awesome to hear all your perspectives and voices. Thank you for your questions.

936
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:02,511
Some of them I actually hadn't heard before, and so I think having these conversations

937
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:09,553
and these trickier questions are really, really helpful. I also want to say thank you to our

938
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:14,134
wonderful techs who are running the conference. They are our siblings in labor at the IATSE

939
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:14,454
Local 16.

940
00:57:14,494 --> 00:57:14,814
Thank you.

941
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:26,341
Every single session that you've been at this week has been run by union labor.

942
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:26,822
Yeah.

943
00:57:27,382 --> 00:57:32,008
And it is them who make this conference as smooth and wonderful as it is.

944
00:57:32,068 --> 00:57:33,250
So we are deeply grateful.

945
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,012
Thank you for doing the work that you do.

946
00:57:40,662 --> 00:57:45,084
I also want to super thank all of our CAs who are just doing an amazing job.

947
00:57:45,284 --> 00:57:50,646
They have so much on their plates, but they do it with such passion and kindness and just

948
00:57:50,726 --> 00:57:51,407
endless support.

949
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:54,048
And your labor is also very much valued.

950
00:57:54,148 --> 00:57:58,650
Even though you're only here one week out of the year, you're still doing very excellent

951
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:01,832
labor and we recognize that and we wish you the best as well.

952
00:58:08,593 --> 00:58:12,375
And finally, I would also say, please thank all of the service workers who are working

953
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:12,995
on the conference.

954
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:17,017
The people working at Moscone and Yerba Buena work very hard to make sure that this place

955
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:21,460
is a safe and comfortable environment that's clean and friendly and very approachable.

956
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,542
So please do thank them when you're kind of spending your final day here at GDC.

957
00:58:27,163 --> 00:58:31,107
And then, yeah, lastly, I would just say I'm supposed to remind you that you'll have an

958
00:58:31,187 --> 00:58:33,550
email in your inbox for evaluations.

959
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,551
Please do fill them out.

960
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:40,237
They are very helpful for both the conference and those of us up here who, you know, really

961
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:43,900
would appreciate the feedback on how the panel was run and what kind of content you'd like

962
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,961
to see in the future, right?

963
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:47,044
And then finally...

964
00:58:49,045 --> 00:58:53,268
We have a roundtable, a community roundtable just in 15, 20 minutes.

965
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:56,750
It's in the South Hall in room 216.

966
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:01,093
And we would really encourage everyone to come out.

967
00:59:01,113 --> 00:59:04,095
We're going to have a really great discussion about next steps and talking

968
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:06,917
about granular problems we're all facing and how people can get involved.

969
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:09,739
And we would love all your voices to be there as well.

970
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:11,340
But yeah, thank you.

971
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,460
Thank you.

972
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:14,301
Thanks to Emma.

973
00:59:25,903 --> 00:59:27,124
and developers against each other.

974
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:28,424
So this is what's...

975
00:59:29,145 --> 00:59:31,466
We really don't want to fall down that hole again

976
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:34,467
where they're pitting workers against other workers

977
00:59:34,547 --> 00:59:36,848
because the more people that are organized,

978
00:59:36,888 --> 00:59:38,728
the better industry standards we can create.

979
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:41,529
So SAG-AFTRA totally supports this.

980
00:59:41,549 --> 00:59:43,510
The voice actors totally support this.

981
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,611
So any way we can support, we're all for it.

982
00:59:46,851 --> 00:59:48,252
And this is super exciting for us.

983
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:49,032
Thank you.
