1
00:00:04,701 --> 00:00:14,744
I am Toshiyuki Kamei from Capcom Japan, here to talk a little bit about Street Fighter with you guys.

2
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:19,246
I am focusing specifically on Street Fighter V with some other stuff thrown in there.

3
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:21,726
So I'm John, I'm just going to be interpreting, don't mind me.

4
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:34,950
So let's go.

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,512
First is the agenda.

6
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,394
All right, this is our agenda for today.

7
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:46,439
The first is about art direction, which is easy to see and easy to understand.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,142
We want to really talk about the most important thing,

9
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:54,005
which is making the art easy to understand and follow.

10
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:59,730
The second is about art direction, which is about creative ideas and creating individuality.

11
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,571
After that, we want to talk a little bit about how we gave the art a real personality.

12
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:14,615
Of course, making the game easy to understand, very legible, very important,

13
00:01:14,736 --> 00:01:16,916
but it's also Street Fighter, so it needs some style.

14
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:26,700
We're going to talk about a few of the techniques that we used to really give the impression of,

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,761
oh, this is Street Fighter.

16
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:31,999
And then we've got a conclusion, so yeah, let's jump right in.

17
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:36,841
So I've been a technical artist in the games industry for about 16 years.

18
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,303
And was the art director on both Street Fighter 4 and Street Fighter 5.

19
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:40,584
What I'd like to tell you today is...

20
00:01:56,252 --> 00:02:10,078
So, we're going to talk a little bit about our philosophy.

21
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:14,020
What were we thinking when we made a lot of decisions around the art for Street Fighter

22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,923
and also how we made those decisions and the learning that we've used, decades of learning along the way.

23
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,273
Street Fighter IV has become a huge esport.

24
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:31,813
It's an event.

25
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:33,274
Ever since Street Fighter IV, this

26
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:35,235
has been a wonderful thing for the series.

27
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,916
Speaking Japanese

28
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:54,815
Since time immemorial, people have been enjoying Street Fighter at these huge events like EVO, Togeki,

29
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:59,397
but now with the advent of real-time streaming,

30
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:03,279
this kind of feeling of enjoying Street Fighter in a tournament,

31
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,080
we're able to share it in real-time with everybody all over the world.

32
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:08,561
We can now comment in real-time,

33
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:11,323
so we can now share the winnings and emotions of tournaments around the world.

34
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:23,076
It's really great to just be able to bring that emotion that you get when you come to these tournaments to everyone in real time all over the world.

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,244
That's also been one of the things that's helped us grow the popularity of fighting games in general too.

36
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:47,568
This is one of the things that we thought about a lot when we were building Street Fighter V from the early days

37
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,849
and it informed everything from the art on down.

38
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:54,551
For a fighting game, it's very, very important if we're going to spread the audience,

39
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:56,551
if we're going to share this with new people,

40
00:03:56,571 --> 00:04:00,633
that it be very easy to follow the battle and understand what's going on.

41
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:11,477
Even if you watch it, you can get absorbed in the battle.

42
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:12,337
That's the ideal.

43
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:14,478
Today, we'll introduce some of the know-how that Capcom has developed.

44
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:17,040
First, we'll start with the art direction for ease of viewing and understanding.

45
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:37,373
All right, section one.

46
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:40,135
Here's how we made the art easy to follow and understand.

47
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:45,419
Street Fighter characters are all muscular.

48
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,682
Their body silhouettes are often clear and distinct.

49
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,244
So it's pretty obvious, but Street Fighter characters,

50
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,306
super muscular, and the character outlines

51
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:56,268
very, very clear, well-defined, and unique.

52
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:00,131
Why are Street Fighter characters so muscular?

53
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,012
I'm often asked that question.

54
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:03,133
I always get the question,

55
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:05,655
why the heck are Street Fighter characters so muscular?

56
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,081
It's a fighting game, so it looks strong.

57
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:11,823
If you get hit by this guy, it looks painful.

58
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,685
If you get hit by this thick arm, you'll die.

59
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:15,126
There's a reason for that.

60
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:16,868
So that first impression is super important.

61
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,749
So when I want people to think,

62
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:21,211
oh gosh, if I get hit by this guy, I'm going to die.

63
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:22,172
This guy is super strong.

64
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,214
That's the first impression that I want to bring out

65
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,615
when I show a Street Fighter character.

66
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:28,478
Also, the facial expressions are exaggerated.

67
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,640
If you want to laugh, you'll laugh a lot.

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,782
If you get attacked, you'll look really painful.

69
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:38,020
In the facial expressions, another area where we tend to exaggerate an awful lot.

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,822
You know, if a character is laughing, it's the biggest laugh in the world.

71
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,104
If they get punched, it really looks like it hurts.

72
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:46,947
The art of fighting games, especially the characters,

73
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:53,953
is the best way for the player to understand the game's situation in an instant.

74
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,675
Really, the art, especially the character art,

75
00:05:56,935 --> 00:06:00,638
is the number one vehicle that we use to give players information

76
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,600
frame by frame about what's going on in the battle.

77
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:12,988
Players have to make decisions as they're playing every frame, so this is very important.

78
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,635
Really thinking about how we can give the player the information they need, you know,

79
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,117
basically 60 times every second.

80
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:30,583
So if you don't express it in a natural way, you won't be able to convey the information in an instant.

81
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:35,845
And what that means is we found that rather than using very realistic art,

82
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:39,246
this exaggeration really helps communicate information quickly.

83
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:48,150
So again, a quick explanation of the game loop.

84
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,372
So first, every frame, we display for the player what's going on in the battle.

85
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:57,694
They make a decision based on that information.

86
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:00,755
Reflect their decision back into the game.

87
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:05,503
In a fighting game, you need to be able to create a loop in a short frame.

88
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:08,244
That's why understanding and conveying the story is so important.

89
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:26,758
So when we create fighting game art, we need to pay attention to the player's feedback.

90
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:30,300
Art is the only thing that can give the player feedback on the game's situation in an instant.

91
00:07:52,492 --> 00:08:01,299
Let's look at a few examples, first around character silhouettes.

92
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,984
Of course, as we said, Street Fighter characters are super muscular with very strong and unique silhouettes and outlines.

93
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:18,253
The easiest way to understand and convey this is to give feedback to the player and audience about what the character is doing and what kind of pose they are doing during the battle.

94
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,794
And these outlines are giving the player feedback on what's happening in the game, every frame,

95
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:27,115
from this kind of far battle camera perspective.

96
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:35,000
We judge whether the standards of clarity and transparency are clear from the camera during battle.

97
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,203
And really, when we decide whether we've achieved our goals of this legibility,

98
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:42,285
we have to decide that all through this battle camera, which you see the whole game from.

99
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,247
I really thought long and hard about the body and the poses of all these characters.

100
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:48,448
And really, this is true, this was true back then and it's true now.

101
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:51,170
And the 2D sprite era has informed everything up until this point.

102
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:21,930
And as you can see, these are really, really dynamic, very, very well-defined, and very exaggerated character outlines.

103
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:31,236
In the battle camera angle, the character is shown in a very small way, but with this much movement, you can tell what the character is doing in a moment.

104
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:37,839
The viewpoint of a fighting game, no matter what, you're kind of pulled back away from the characters.

105
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,044
They're a bit small on the screen, but by kind of deforming and exaggerating their shapes,

106
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,766
we can actually convey a lot of information very quickly.

107
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:51,030
For example, Yun, the character on the far right,

108
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,952
you can see that his arm is quite pronounced.

109
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:55,333
Let's take a closer look at Yun.

110
00:09:56,474 --> 00:10:00,838
So, when you hold out his arm, you can see there's a lot of deformation going on.

111
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,951
Six pixels to show the thinnest part of his wrist.

112
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:13,113
But then the thumb, that hump of his thumb is an extra four pixels.

113
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:19,976
And the musculature on his forearm, that's another two pixels.

114
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:21,557
Now this is very exaggerated.

115
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:33,089
When you pull the camera, you can see how the player is extending his arm,

116
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:36,191
and you can tell if his hand is a Gu or Pa by the silhouette.

117
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:41,335
By using this exaggeration, you can really convey a lot of information to the player very quickly,

118
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,637
like how their arm is extended, what orientation it's in,

119
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,918
whether they are making a fist, whether their hand's open.

120
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,581
We analyze the know-how from past .air and internal data.

121
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,802
And how we show this on screen, it all comes from rules that were laid down from time immemorial.

122
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:10,645
This is one example of an internal document that was created that has a lot of these rules written down,

123
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:12,325
A Strange Guide for Artists.

124
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:17,107
This document was created around the time of Street Fighter Alpha series and Darkstalkers was being made.

125
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:32,644
And it's been used ever since then to help teach artists some of the rules that we use to create our art.

126
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:37,248
This was created by some of the world-class artists at Capcom back in the time,

127
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:41,612
and it was edited by none other than Yasuda Akira, or Akiman, as you know.

128
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:59,130
It's kind of hard to tell, but that's actually Dimitri on the cover from Darkstalkers.

129
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,172
Yeah, again, it's a pretty old document, but again, still very valuable today for us.

130
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:21,201
So the content inside its figure drawing is very similar to the style of Andrew Loomis.

131
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:28,343
And what it explains is a lot of shortcuts and rules about how we take that musculature

132
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:31,284
and a character's frame and make a sprite out of it.

133
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:48,750
It's got a lot of great know-how, like if you exaggerate this part of the musculature,

134
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,571
it looks really cool.

135
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:55,379
Or if you actually make this part slimmer, it can actually help be a little more efficient

136
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,300
in the visual language.

137
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,462
A lot of different rules.

138
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:09,465
20 years old, but the information is still important.

139
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:19,692
So even though this is over 20 years old, having that information about what's important, what's not important, and how you can use that to create your characters, it's still used today?

140
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,496
Here's one example from Street Fighter V.

141
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:38,299
When you look at an arm from the front, the rule is the upper arm should be thinner than the lower arm.

142
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:49,123
But when looking at it from the side, that same arm should look narrow in the forearm and wider for the upper arm.

143
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:54,426
By following this one rule, you can actually convey a lot of information about how the

144
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:58,448
player is extending their arm, whether they're doing a straight punch, an uppercut, in just

145
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,928
a really short amount of time.

146
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,187
And when you compare this to an actual photograph,

147
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,328
it's obvious that it's much easier

148
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,631
to understand the position and what's going on with the arm

149
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:27,471
in just a second.

150
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:37,239
Actually, during the prototyping phase of Street Fighter V,

151
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,160
it was a time when photorealistic graphics

152
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,901
were very popular.

153
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,864
We actually prototyped and tried out a different style,

154
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:44,244
like this.

155
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:59,705
But one of the things we learned very quickly was that the realistic proportions in this model actually made the game a lot harder to play.

156
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:05,628
And it was really easy to go away from this style and make the decision to keep that more exaggerated style for the game.

157
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:19,776
Let's talk about how we decide how tall our characters look.

158
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:30,384
The character relative height is very important during the battle.

159
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:35,728
So if you know our character's bios, you've got Ryu, he's 175cm tall,

160
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:38,410
and M. Bison, 182cm tall, with a difference of only 7cm.

161
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:58,953
In most games, the relative height of the models is decided in a digital content creation tool,

162
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:02,836
using a grid to kind of set out those proportions and heights.

163
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:04,478
But that's not how we do it on Street Fighter.

164
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:04,778
What we do is,

165
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:22,637
We basically sit the characters next to each other, get them posed, and decide that more by feel.

166
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:28,623
And as you can see, M. Bison looks a bit larger than you. He kind of looks like he's looking down on him.

167
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:48,444
But if you look at their actual models in our content creation tool, the models themselves are pretty much the same height.

168
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:56,165
What we do is we put Ryu in his ready pose and we compare the other characters to him and decide how they should look and feel in the battle scene.

169
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:08,169
In the 2D era, there's even times when M. Bison

170
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:09,951
actually looks like he's over 2 meters tall.

171
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:14,415
So, deciding a character's height based on their battle impression

172
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:17,858
has been a popular method in fighting games for a long time.

173
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,622
So this is something, again, we've done ever since the 2D era,

174
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:34,603
kind of deciding those different relative character heights

175
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,644
just in the battle pose by feel.

176
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:40,986
Now let's talk a little bit about character animation.

177
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:46,308
There's a lot of information that we have to put into the character's animation

178
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:47,729
to relate battle information to the player.

179
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,461
First off is the fighting style of the character.

180
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:05,764
That needs to be easily understood through the posing, the animation.

181
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:12,930
So this is a medium kick, and as you know Ryu uses karate.

182
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:24,355
And then weight and rhythm, this is really the core important part of the animation.

183
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:28,297
It needs to be consistent with the fighting style, be very cool,

184
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:32,039
and also give the player the right information about what's going on.

185
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,782
And this really just comes down to the pure quality of the animation.

186
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:43,005
Last thing is the actual functioning of the game, what's going on.

187
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:57,383
The animation is what changes the collision of the game and the player's frame by frame.

188
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:02,864
So that pose and that outline and how it moves and being able to follow that frame by frame is again one of the most important things.

189
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,205
There's a lot of different techniques we use.

190
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,627
And we talk to the game designers

191
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:25,649
about the hundreds of different scenarios

192
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:28,171
where they need to get information of the player.

193
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,272
Like for instance, if the game designer

194
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,915
knows that there's going to be a sweep motion

195
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:36,577
and the player should be able to read that in, say,

196
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:38,779
three or four frames, that's the discussion we have

197
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,841
and it's used when we create the animation.

198
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:49,572
This is actually an animation from Street Fighter 4, Zangief.

199
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:56,977
I'll show you a quick video that will illustrate some of the different things we do to exaggerate.

200
00:19:56,997 --> 00:20:01,301
There we go. Looks like we're dropping some frames, but you get the idea.

201
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,803
First, let's look at it from a battle camera angle.

202
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:10,651
So this is a very close camera angle to what you see during battle,

203
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:12,252
but when you look at it from the front,

204
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:16,014
you can see that Zangief is walking sideways at you.

205
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:17,775
Obviously, this animation would be completely wrong

206
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:22,458
for a game where you can view the character from 360 degrees.

207
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:24,719
But for fighting games, this is exactly what we need.

208
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:41,947
This one.

209
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,968
When you look at it from the front,

210
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:45,689
you can see that the pose is correct.

211
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,451
The left is the fighting game style animation,

212
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:50,972
and the right is the normal animation

213
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:54,414
that corrects the pose when viewed from the front.

214
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:55,975
So here, these two images you see,

215
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:57,336
we've got a normal animation.

216
00:20:57,396 --> 00:21:00,517
This is if you were looking at the character from 360 degrees,

217
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:01,598
this is how you would animate.

218
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:03,859
But for fighting games, as you can see,

219
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,540
it's kind of tilted sideways.

220
00:21:06,462 --> 00:21:09,065
Looking at it from the front, it's true, but from the side,

221
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:14,289
the waist rotation is also constricted, and it's hard to see the silhouette.

222
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:16,271
The information about the body is not transmitted.

223
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:46,334
This happens a lot because when you're creating animation, you're looking at the model from 360 degrees, so it's an easy pitfall.

224
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:51,618
And when that happens, the thing we say a lot is, do the 5 degree turn.

225
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:58,502
If you turn your waist and body 5 degrees in the direction of the battle camera, it's a great sign for a fighting game.

226
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:02,426
What we find is if you kind of take the character from their hips and their whole body

227
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:05,048
and just turn them five degrees towards the camera,

228
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:10,290
just that simple thing will just help get a lot of that information you need into the animation.

229
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,092
I'll show a few examples.

230
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,994
So first we've got M. Bison here as you can see.

231
00:22:17,174 --> 00:22:19,895
This is his kind of battle camera view looking at his opponent.

232
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:24,938
But when you see him from the front, you can see his whole body is kind of at a 45 degree angle.

233
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:30,402
Next we got Zangief. Looks like he's ready to suck his opponent in,

234
00:22:31,303 --> 00:22:34,264
but he's completely looking off to the other side when you look at him from the front.

235
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:40,107
Next we got Rainbow Mika. She's got a drop kick going right to her opponent's face,

236
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:44,209
but actually her whole body is slanted sideways.

237
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:50,032
In a fighting game, when you look at the camera work during a battle that shows more than 90% of the battle,

238
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:53,894
it's important that the player can see the information in the body.

239
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,112
So we really prioritize just that battle camera.

240
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:01,113
You're seeing over 90% of the game from that perspective.

241
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:03,094
So all of the information that the player needs

242
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:05,555
about what the character's doing, how they're posed,

243
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:07,096
needs to come from that perspective.

244
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:12,038
ANIMATION DESCRIPTION

245
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:15,239
We talk a lot about the animations,

246
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,320
but at the end of the day, the final decisions

247
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,621
are always made from that perspective.

248
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:20,742
ANIMATION DESCRIPTION

249
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:27,350
Talk a little bit about critical arts, super combos, those cinematic moves that Street Fighter is known for.

250
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:38,733
Basically, the important thing we've thought about for a long time is,

251
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:40,494
can you explain this in one phrase?

252
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:48,496
Let's take a look at this quick video, no sound, but hopefully you guys have seen this a few times.

253
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:51,557
We've got Rashid, his critical art.

254
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,199
Laura.

255
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:08,826
And Rainbow Mika again.

256
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:21,693
It's good timing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice.

257
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:25,195
So what's the common point here?

258
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:31,172
I couldn't play the video to the end, but for example,

259
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:32,472
this technique you just saw,

260
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:35,654
wouldn't you want to say something like Aladin or Genie?

261
00:24:35,914 --> 00:24:38,516
So when you look at Rashid's critical art,

262
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:41,197
don't you think the words like Aladdin or a Genie,

263
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:42,478
don't those words come to mind?

264
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:44,379
Next, this technique,

265
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:48,081
wouldn't you want to say something like electric whirling or Sonic the Hedgehog?

266
00:24:48,602 --> 00:24:50,723
In Laura's case, it looks like electricity.

267
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,764
It looks like she's Sonic the Hedgehog going around the screen.

268
00:24:55,383 --> 00:25:00,986
I guess Ken's being turned into a butt sandwich here.

269
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:08,931
And here's a classic one, Ryu's super uppercut looks like he's breaking his opponent's jaw.

270
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:24,406
And this is really, really important for us.

271
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:28,508
If you can't describe these critical arts in a single simple phrase, that's no good.

272
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:32,191
This is a traditional element of the Street Fighter series.

273
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:36,334
And this is true, again, since the very beginning with special moves and other things like that.

274
00:25:36,774 --> 00:25:40,156
For example, have you ever talked about this 20 years ago?

275
00:25:40,337 --> 00:25:42,678
When you first started playing Street Fighter, maybe your friends didn't.

276
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:44,459
Did you ever have these kind of conversations?

277
00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:48,445
Dosuko yuute jimen to suihei ni sumo otori ga zutsuki sunnen.

278
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:52,246
It's like a sumo wrestler flying across the screen with a headbutt while yelling dog pie.

279
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:55,027
Yoga yuute kuchi kara hii hakunen.

280
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,867
It's this Indian guy who says yoga and breathes fire.

281
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:04,708
Kore wa tanin ni mo tsutaeyasui gengo ga dekiru youso ya ugoki wo itoteki ni toriireteru tteyuu koto desu.

282
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:11,350
And that's something again that we really try to make moves, animations that are easy to express with a single phrase.

283
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,572
When I watch a tournament and I want to tell my fans how I feel,

284
00:26:14,632 --> 00:26:18,133
I watch Street Fighter's new character,

285
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:21,715
a character like Genie, and it's easier to tell them.

286
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:24,496
The fans are interested in what it is.

287
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:29,178
Going back to talking about Street Fighter as something that people enjoy in tournament settings,

288
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:33,299
if you want to tell someone about that, if you want to have them understand why Street Fighter is so cool,

289
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:36,621
it's very important that it's easy to relate these cool things

290
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,422
and easy for them to imagine them with a simple phrase that gets them interested.

291
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:49,805
We're going to talk a little bit about stages, and again, it goes back to the 2D era.

292
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:55,007
This is probably the easiest example to show, a screenshot from Street Fighter Alpha.

293
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:11,144
So this is still the 2D era, so there's no true concept of depth in the image,

294
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:16,909
but we did control the color saturation very closely to give that impression.

295
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:21,893
You can see from this image that the characters are very vivid colors,

296
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:25,916
but the background is a little muted to create a mood.

297
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:28,218
So it's pretty clear where the difference here is.

298
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:31,100
The characters use really bright, vibrant, saturated colors,

299
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,743
while all the background colors are very muted and toned down.

300
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:39,798
The characters use the darkest colors to the brightest colors.

301
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,021
On the other hand, the backgrounds have a narrow range of colors.

302
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:46,524
For the characters, we use the entire full range of colors,

303
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:50,047
but for the stages, we have pretty strict rules about

304
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:53,529
kind of shortening that range and only using a narrower range.

305
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,710
This is the main color used.

306
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,172
The background has 0, 0, 0 black,

307
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:56,912
and 2, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, white.

308
00:27:56,932 --> 00:27:58,633
You can see that it's not used at all.

309
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,146
And you can see just by these histograms,

310
00:28:04,186 --> 00:28:07,968
we never use a pure 000 white or 255, 255, 255 black

311
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:09,028
on the backgrounds.

312
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:12,830
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

313
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,831
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

314
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,092
And this, again, it's just another example

315
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:20,534
of one of the many rules that were created back in the day

316
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,235
when we were creating this series that we still use today.

317
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,214
In this game, to adjust the histogram of the background and character,

318
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:29,075
we improved the color grading of Unreal Engine 4.

319
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:31,116
We call it multi-color grading.

320
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:55,195
This image is with multi-color grading turned on, and this is off.

321
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:59,600
So you can see the difference between multi-color grading turned on and off.

322
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:02,925
Off is more correct in terms of lighting,

323
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:07,811
but in a fighting game that is a two-frame game, the visibility is very low.

324
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:13,434
So the off image, it's much more accurate in terms of lighting,

325
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:19,475
but when you're talking about, again, the battle happening within the moment of a few frames,

326
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:23,836
it's not as easy to get the understanding and the information of what's going on.

327
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,417
So what we did was we upgraded the color grading system

328
00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:31,598
to be able to use multiple lookup tables at a time for the scene.

329
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:49,014
We use four lookup tables for four different areas of the screen so we can separate foreground,

330
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,715
background, and also left and right depending on the stage.

331
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,985
And then we can use these tables to boost all the elements that

332
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:07,526
are in the foreground, including the characters, and kind of

333
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:09,367
mute the background elements.

334
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:16,452
YOSHIMASA ENJI, SPEAKING JAPANESE

335
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,594
We also have different tables for left and right.

336
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:21,495
So what that allows us to do is to give a different effect

337
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:25,017
to, say, a stage that's kind of half indoors and half outdoors.

338
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,919
YOSHIMASA ENJI, SPEAKING JAPANESE

339
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:35,283
So this is just those lookup tables kind of highlighted with red in the foreground, green in the background.

340
00:30:37,264 --> 00:30:44,729
And of course we can kind of decide how this blends just by tuning the parameters in the tables.

341
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:59,817
And what this allows us to do is just basically follow those same rules to make the characters pop out and make the backgrounds look great.

342
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:11,968
Now let's talk a little bit about a field of view technique we use.

343
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,794
So of course from a 3D camera's perspective, a model will be a bit distorted,

344
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,577
look a little bit different in the center of the screen and on the edge of the screen.

345
00:31:21,597 --> 00:31:26,221
It's hard to see the collision, and as a fighting game, it's a factor that can cause problems.

346
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:28,475
So this is really bad for fighting games

347
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,316
because that will actually affect the collision

348
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,656
and how the collision looks to the player.

349
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:35,957
So we needed to find a way to fix this.

350
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:44,139
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JPNE2 TRANSLATOR So again, this is just

351
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,819
an example of how you would look in the middle of the screen

352
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:47,980
and on the edge of the screen.

353
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,441
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JPNE2 TRANSLATOR So to address this,

354
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,542
we created a vertex shader that we call fixed projection.

355
00:31:58,362 --> 00:32:03,126
Fixed projection eliminates the horizontal angle of the character.

356
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:08,430
This does not actually weaken the angle of the camera.

357
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:14,994
It artificially adjusts the vertex of the character in the opposite direction of the angle of the camera.

358
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:30,441
We're using the vertex information on the character model to actually kind of negate that field of view.

359
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:37,443
So this image is the image without fixed projection applied.

360
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:42,704
And this is the shader applied to its full extent.

361
00:32:43,404 --> 00:32:46,725
And you can see that that sideways distortion is completely eliminated.

362
00:32:53,569 --> 00:33:03,395
This fixed projection 1.0 is very similar to an orthographic view head-on in a content creation tool.

363
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:14,662
However, if you completely erase the angle of the picture, the three-dimensional effect of the character will be lost, so I blend it with a value of 0.5, which is just the right value in the product version.

364
00:33:15,054 --> 00:33:20,697
We find if we applied it all the way it does make the character lose a lot of depth information as well.

365
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:23,578
So we played with it a little bit and came up with a value of about 0.5.

366
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:27,500
This is kind of the nice balance point where we still had a lot of depth information for the character,

367
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,901
but we didn't have the issues of kind of distorted collision.

368
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:56,495
The shader allowed us to keep a nice robust wide field of view to let the stages breathe and be really impressive,

369
00:33:56,936 --> 00:34:02,857
but also kind of do what we needed to do in controlling that distortion on the characters for the purposes of the battle.

370
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:08,198
Now, let's move on to the second chapter, Art Direction.

371
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:13,373
All right, let's talk a little bit about the actual style and look of the art in Street Fighter V.

372
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:16,936
So again, very early on, in terms of the rendering style,

373
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:21,279
we decided on this non-photorealistic, or NPR, style at a very early stage.

374
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:22,060
Two reasons why we chose that.

375
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:42,622
The first reason is that Street Fighter is a series that has a wonderful artistic history,

376
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:48,344
and we wanted to make sure that Street Fighter V continued that tradition in its in-game art.

377
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:12,517
The second reason is really consistency in the image.

378
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:16,800
We talked a lot about the need to exaggerate and deform the models for the purposes of

379
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,201
legibility during battle.

380
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:22,484
Well, a very realistic rendering style just doesn't match up with that, so this helps

381
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:23,445
keep the image consistent.

382
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,794
And this is kind of the final result, two keywords like rich lighting and a painterly accent.

383
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:33,375
To achieve this,

384
00:35:33,455 --> 00:35:34,395
we use three different techniques.

385
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:52,116
Those three we talked a little bit about are the brush strokes, those painterly accents,

386
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:58,321
how we emphasized the edges of the image, and how we played with color and controlled it.

387
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:05,466
First, we talked about this painterly style, how we achieved it.

388
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:16,194
So again, this is a good concept image that conveys what we wanted the final image to look like

389
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:18,256
with this very strong brush stroke kind of feel.

390
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,292
So we did this by applying filters directly to the normal map on the model.

391
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:36,696
We used the normal map because it allowed us to use the environment's lighting to really bring out that texture in the model.

392
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:53,663
And this is the same technique we used on Street Fighter 4,

393
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:54,863
actually, some differences.

394
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:57,464
On Street Fighter 4, we used a default Photoshop filter

395
00:36:57,544 --> 00:37:01,045
to add some of this information right into the normal maps.

396
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:03,525
But we had an issue trying that with Street Fighter 5.

397
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,241
In the previous game, Street Fighter IV, the resolution of the normal map was increased,

398
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:21,421
so it was difficult to filter.

399
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:25,483
To solve this problem, we converted the normal map of tangent space to the normal map of object space.

400
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:51,774
To alleviate this, we took the normal map and converted it from tangent space into object space.

401
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:58,377
As you can see, in tangent space, there is no color difference because purple is spread all over the map,

402
00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:03,400
but in object space, there are many colors, so it's easy to filter.

403
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,543
And we did this because object space affords us a much wider range of colors that we can play with when we're applying the filter.

404
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:11,484
Let's take a look at the production procedure.

405
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:13,714
So let's look at our process here.

406
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:15,636
So we've got the original normal map.

407
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:18,460
We convert that from tangent space into object space.

408
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:21,283
That object space, that's where we kind of play

409
00:38:21,303 --> 00:38:23,806
with the filters, add different levels of effect

410
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:24,927
on different parts of the model,

411
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:27,790
reconvert that back to tangent space,

412
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:30,413
and then check the results in Unreal Editor 4.

413
00:38:31,455 --> 00:38:31,755
Thank you.

414
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,136
Oh, no problem, yeah.

415
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,491
In 4.0, we used Photoshop's standard filter to reproduce the touch,

416
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:40,132
but in 5.0, we increased the resolution of the texture,

417
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:42,552
so we can now reproduce the touch in more detail.

418
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:44,413
We are using the third-party plugin SnapArt,

419
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:47,314
which allows us to reproduce the touch of watercolors and other brushes.

420
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:07,441
We actually used Snap Art 4 for a lot of the really great artistic effects.

421
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:12,844
They've got really nice, you know, everything from oil painting, watercolors, a lot of different styles.

422
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:24,930
It was really great for the team because there was just a lot of freedom to play with the parameters

423
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:29,092
and get a really, really different effect for every character, even within the same model.

424
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:43,678
For example, there's some parts of the characters where we want this effect to be very subtle,

425
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,202
and other parts of the characters where we go ahead and put it up strong all the way.

426
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:51,786
For example, this picture is easy to understand.

427
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,187
When you draw a picture,

428
00:39:54,854 --> 00:39:59,558
The face of the character is drawn with a delicate touch and high density,

429
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:02,601
and is drawn with a rough touch as it moves away from the face.

430
00:40:27,474 --> 00:40:34,739
This also really draws the player's attention when they're looking at the models to the areas of the model that have the highest and most important information.

431
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:40,102
We create models by selecting fine strands, from rough to fine strands, when we are compositing them in NM.

432
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:48,974
So we were able to choose what level of accent we wanted to put on each model

433
00:40:49,454 --> 00:40:54,555
based on what part of the model was important and what exactly we were trying to emphasize.

434
00:40:54,575 --> 00:41:00,096
So with this accent off, there's not a lot of detail in the musculature,

435
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:01,296
and it's a little bit flat.

436
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:21,843
but adding that accent really gives it a nice painterly look.

437
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:26,966
And this again, it just gets really close to our goal

438
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,667
of making the image look like it was just painted on

439
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:30,768
with some rough brushstrokes.

440
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:34,830
And this is what Nash looks like.

441
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:41,933
Let's talk a little bit about edge filter.

442
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:49,611
YOSHIMASA ENJI, SPEAKING JAPANESE So we used a full screen post processing

443
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:52,892
effect to achieve our edge filter highlight.

444
00:41:53,432 --> 00:42:02,994
YOSHIMASA ENJI, SPEAKING JAPANESE Basically this post effect applies a specific

445
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:05,335
color to areas of the image that have very high contrast.

446
00:42:06,475 --> 00:42:07,656
This is an image with the edge filter off.

447
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,518
It not only is really, really great for defining,

448
00:42:09,538 --> 00:42:11,519
helping define that really strong silhouette,

449
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,941
but also that painterly effect we just talked about.

450
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:14,762
There's on and off.

451
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,103
You can see the difference.

452
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:39,628
This is a compound technique that further enhances the touch of the normal map.

453
00:42:39,648 --> 00:42:41,889
It also works as a character outline,

454
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:45,631
which contributes to the improvement of visibility.

455
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:49,613
So again, this really helps us strengthen that character outline

456
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:51,314
and make it even clearer for the player,

457
00:42:51,354 --> 00:42:55,416
but also it helps boost that painterly effect

458
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:59,237
that we're getting with our normal textures, normal map textures.

459
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:01,198
Next, we have the joint light.

460
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,625
Third, talk a little bit about how we apply indirect lighting to our character models.

461
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:13,508
So indirect light, it's a really, really important piece

462
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:16,891
if we're going to achieve this kind of very painterly effect.

463
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:19,693
It really lets us make something that's really nice and strong

464
00:43:19,713 --> 00:43:20,994
by using these highlighted colors.

465
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:42,146
We wanted to give the artists the freedom to be able to add these highlights and effects to the characters wherever they wanted.

466
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:48,231
How we achieved that, we basically controlled the indirect lighting in a couple of different ways here.

467
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:06,243
The indirect lighting is the very, very last part of the lighting pass that we do on the final rendered image.

468
00:44:06,503 --> 00:44:12,365
After creating a three-dimensional effect with the basic lighting, we add color to the shadows and reflections.

469
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:19,845
So after we do a pre-lighting pass and get the characters dimensions, get their volume on the screen,

470
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:27,589
we do a basic indirect lighting pass to emphasize the shadows and other parts of the model.

471
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:32,572
And these second two images make it really apparent how we use that indirect lighting.

472
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,751
Also, there are two types of indirect lighting, one is UE4's Indirect Lighting Catch.

473
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:45,933
The other is Light Middleware's In-Light, which is in real-time.

474
00:44:57,742 --> 00:45:04,186
And then we used Enlighten for adding real-time lighting effects to the final image.

475
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:09,269
You can see that the effect of Enlighten is quite influential in the creation of the image.

476
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:13,732
And that really, as you can see, allowed us to play with the image

477
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:18,355
and really dial in exactly what we wanted to do for each model and each stage.

478
00:45:18,935 --> 00:45:23,238
By using these two joint technology, we were able to intentionally add the shadows and stars to the characters.

479
00:45:25,702 --> 00:45:30,843
And it was really great, the artists were able to achieve a lot of different looks in a lot of different contexts.

480
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:37,084
I talked a lot with the lighting artists about exactly how they wanted the lighting in each stage to be reflected on the characters.

481
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:44,386
I talked a lot with the lighting artists about exactly how they wanted the lighting in each stage to be reflected on the characters.

482
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:50,167
I still have a lot to tell you, but I don't have much time left, so I'll sum up what I've talked about today.

483
00:45:52,992 --> 00:45:59,594
So this is just a few examples of the many, many different things that we did to give Street Fighter its look.

484
00:45:59,654 --> 00:46:04,676
A lot of different stuff that I would love to talk to you guys about, but we only have time to introduce a few of them.

485
00:46:16,093 --> 00:46:24,479
So again, art is a singular element that we can use to convey all the information that the player needs to play the game correctly.

486
00:46:30,863 --> 00:46:39,268
Of course, it's very important to make our characters look cool, look cute, but if you can't understand and read the battle, it's all for nothing.

487
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:53,200
And again, like I said, I think that art is really the only vehicle that we have to convey that information to the player as quickly as it needs to be conveyed.

488
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:59,364
Once we're able to achieve that, then we can think about, OK, how do we give this art the personality that Street Fighter deserves?

489
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,831
This talk is really about the role of art. What does it do? How does it function in fighting games?

490
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:17,912
But as you guys are working on your projects, I'd love for you to think about that.

491
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:19,892
What is the function? What role does the art play?

492
00:47:35,078 --> 00:47:45,927
So that was kind of the reason for this talk and I hope you guys were able to take something from it.

493
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,711
Thank you so much for listening.

494
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,882
And I believe we do have a little time for some questions.

495
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:16,384
Hi, great talk. I was wondering, I mean you've made a lot of emphasis about

496
00:48:17,224 --> 00:48:21,086
deforming the characters so that they look good in battle. However,

497
00:48:25,387 --> 00:48:29,869
differently from 2D, in 3D with all the camera angles and really detailed...

498
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:32,839
but like framing of the characters,

499
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,220
those deformities can come across as a little off.

500
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,161
So, for example, when you did in Street Fighter V,

501
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:42,182
the story mode, a lot of the characters,

502
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:44,002
for example, Karen was walking around

503
00:48:44,062 --> 00:48:45,382
and she had a huge hand.

504
00:48:46,162 --> 00:48:49,023
So in that regard, did you have any special considerations

505
00:48:49,123 --> 00:48:51,004
for cinematic animations?

506
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:54,044
Kind of separate from the battle, the battle model.

507
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:57,545
So the question is, what considerations did you take

508
00:48:57,645 --> 00:48:59,766
for the player models and character models

509
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:01,126
in cinematics versus battle?

510
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:02,406
If there are differences.

511
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:31,849
So when we do cinematic, we make the hand a little smaller

512
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:33,810
to maintain the head and body.

513
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:38,952
Yeah, we do kind of soften some of the exaggeration

514
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:41,452
in the cinematic mode.

515
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:43,633
So we do kind of tone it down a little bit.

516
00:49:45,354 --> 00:49:48,995
Just a little bit.

517
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:51,736
Yeah, just a little bit, but there's still the character,

518
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:53,056
so we leave a lot of it.

519
00:49:53,396 --> 00:49:54,217
All right, thank you.

520
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:55,237
Thank you.

521
00:49:57,687 --> 00:50:04,051
Thank you very much for the talk. I was wondering if there's anything special to be said about the cast shadows of the fighters?

522
00:50:05,152 --> 00:50:09,594
Anything special to be said about the cast shadows of the characters?

523
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:10,715
Ah, the shadows?

524
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:12,516
Cheat or tips and tricks.

525
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:16,738
Ah, so you mean the shadows of the characters?

526
00:50:16,758 --> 00:50:19,020
Did you have any tips or tips about the shadows?

527
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:25,844
I'm worried about that.

528
00:50:25,864 --> 00:50:27,645
When it comes to shadows,

529
00:50:27,665 --> 00:50:28,665
if you use black,

530
00:50:28,805 --> 00:50:29,606
it doesn't look good.

531
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,766
So I try to use some special colors

532
00:50:30,786 --> 00:50:31,887
so that it doesn't look black

533
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:32,307
on all stages.

534
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:34,008
I try to use all the colors.

535
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:44,924
One thing we do is we make sure that shadows are never

536
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:46,346
100% black.

537
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,629
That's something that we found, if we do that,

538
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:51,270
you start losing information.

539
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:56,815
So by using indirect lighting, we

540
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:59,978
make sure that the shadows have some kind of color information

541
00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:03,722
and that it's properly saturated so that the image is consistent.

542
00:51:04,502 --> 00:51:04,783
Thank you.

543
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:05,603
Thank you.

544
00:51:09,648 --> 00:51:15,210
Good afternoon. I have a question concerning character silhouettes in regards to both Fang

545
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:20,651
and Nicali. I'm just curious, because of all the very crisp silhouettes that have always

546
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:25,653
existed in Street Fighter, there's a feeling that with Fang and Nicali, especially when

547
00:51:25,673 --> 00:51:31,575
Nicali's in V-Trigger and his hair goes crazy, that their silhouettes get much harder to

548
00:51:31,615 --> 00:51:36,016
define and to track. And I'm wondering if that was kind of an intentional choice to

549
00:51:36,077 --> 00:51:38,017
make them a little bit harder to fight.

550
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:42,104
A question about Fang and Nicali's character silhouettes,

551
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:46,147
how there's maybe a little bit less defined than some of the other characters.

552
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:08,261
As for the Necalli, he appears a bit ambiguous in this film, but I really tried to make it look erotic for you guys.

553
00:52:08,281 --> 00:52:13,804
About the fans, you can see the Chinese character and how he wears a Kimono.

554
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:17,006
I have tried to focus on that and make it clear that he is Chinese.

555
00:52:29,535 --> 00:52:30,555
Sorry, one second.

556
00:52:46,952 --> 00:52:53,576
The thing about those 2 characters, you know, I don't really feel like they're any less well-defined.

557
00:52:53,896 --> 00:52:59,740
It's more about how we did it. Like for instance, in Fang's case, you know, he's got his clothing,

558
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,502
the kind of not, it's very exaggerated kind of Chinese style, right?

559
00:53:05,363 --> 00:53:08,345
But the same kind of information that we can get from that musculature,

560
00:53:09,065 --> 00:53:12,087
we use by, you know, just showing that through the clothing.

561
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:14,708
Nicali, very muscular and things like that.

562
00:53:15,308 --> 00:53:18,689
How can you make the V-trigger of Nekari easier to understand?

563
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,570
The V-trigger?

564
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:21,950
Yes, the Nekari.

565
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,270
The easier to understand?

566
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:24,231
Yes, that's right.

567
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:29,452
The easier to understand when you use the V-trigger is because the hair is an obstacle.

568
00:53:29,512 --> 00:53:33,173
So I emphasized that it doesn't have to be three-dimensional,

569
00:53:33,193 --> 00:53:38,094
but that it looks like an effect and that it doesn't matter if you hit the target.

570
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:46,515
As it as it regards to the Kali and the V trigger specifically,

571
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:49,477
you know, the hair is what really goes crazy.

572
00:53:49,497 --> 00:53:52,399
You know, that's where we kind of focused all of that really

573
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,640
nice visual expression.

574
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:58,183
But the actual body where, you know, the collision comes out

575
00:53:58,264 --> 00:53:59,965
and everything's moving fast, you know,

576
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:01,206
we still follow the same rules.

577
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:03,867
So I think we hopefully were able to do it.

578
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:05,208
Thank you for your time.

579
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:06,109
Thank you very much.

580
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:10,589
First of all, thank you for the talk.

581
00:54:11,029 --> 00:54:12,269
It's very amazing.

582
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,951
My question is about character creation.

583
00:54:17,012 --> 00:54:22,834
It's more about who decides about the fighting style.

584
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:24,815
It's more design or art?

585
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:29,635
So basically, who decided the character's fighting style?

586
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:30,156
Yeah.

587
00:54:54,473 --> 00:54:59,277
Yep. So again, the question was who kind of makes the final decision about the characters and their fighting styles.

588
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,262
And at the end of the day, that's the game director, who is Nakayama-san.

589
00:55:05,242 --> 00:55:13,669
But of course, it's not just his decision, it's a team decision, and Kamei is very involved in kind of deciding,

590
00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:19,994
OK, well, once we have, you know, if it's a karate man or, you know, someone who's using Brazilian jiu-jitsu,

591
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:23,137
how is that going to look? That's something that they work up together.

592
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:30,633
As a tradition for Street Fighter, the characters are shuffled between countries and martial arts.

593
00:55:30,653 --> 00:55:33,594
So we made the base based on that in FFV.

594
00:55:33,794 --> 00:55:34,655
Countries and?

595
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,316
Countries and martial arts.

596
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:42,258
Yeah, you know, Street Fighter, it's all about the country and the fighting style.

597
00:55:42,378 --> 00:55:44,059
And those are kind of matched together.

598
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:45,900
So that's how we start thinking about the character.

599
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,862
Like, okay, this is going to be a character from some country.

600
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:51,383
And okay, what's their fighting style?

601
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:52,463
And then what do they look like?

602
00:55:52,824 --> 00:55:54,465
That's kind of how it comes together.

603
00:55:54,705 --> 00:55:55,945
Japan, karate, Ryu.

604
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:57,887
Japan, karate, Ryu.

605
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:00,948
Spain, ninja, Vega.

606
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:03,410
Spain, ninja, Vega.

607
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,752
Yeah, sure.

608
00:56:06,812 --> 00:56:07,492
Cool, thank you.

609
00:56:08,392 --> 00:56:08,953
Thank you very much.

610
00:56:10,554 --> 00:56:11,334
Thank you for the talk.

611
00:56:11,594 --> 00:56:14,436
I also had a question about character creation.

612
00:56:15,056 --> 00:56:17,478
When adding a new character into the world,

613
00:56:18,818 --> 00:56:20,299
you're introducing a new silhouette

614
00:56:20,399 --> 00:56:22,000
into the whole cast of characters.

615
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,053
So do you have characters that you check against?

616
00:56:25,994 --> 00:56:27,696
And then the second part of my question is,

617
00:56:27,736 --> 00:56:29,799
I noticed that the newer characters

618
00:56:29,899 --> 00:56:32,822
are more elaborately designed than the original set.

619
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:37,868
And so is that an intentional choice

620
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:41,071
to sort of introduce adding newer,

621
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,192
more interesting silhouettes?

622
00:56:42,753 --> 00:56:45,075
OK, so the question is for the new characters,

623
00:56:45,255 --> 00:56:47,997
when you add a new character, how do you compare their silhouettes?

624
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:48,718
Make sure they're unique.

625
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:54,662
And then why are the later characters seem a little bit more rich or?

626
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:55,523
Elaborate.

627
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:56,103
Elaborate.

628
00:56:56,263 --> 00:56:56,464
OK.

629
00:56:57,104 --> 00:56:58,645
SPEAKER 1 IN JAPANESE

630
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:11,093
Do you think there is a difference between the current characters and the new characters?

631
00:57:11,113 --> 00:57:16,256
The new characters' silhouettes are basically the same as the existing characters.

632
00:57:29,305 --> 00:57:38,372
Yeah, we definitely, for the first part of your question, we certainly kind of compare all the character silhouettes to new character silhouettes to existing ones and make sure they're not confusing.

633
00:57:38,694 --> 00:57:42,617
If you make it the same silhouette as the old character,

634
00:57:42,717 --> 00:57:46,020
the old character will die and you won't be able to appear again.

635
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,022
That's the disadvantage.

636
00:57:49,042 --> 00:57:53,406
Yeah, and that means, you know, it's very important to do that because

637
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:57,389
say we make a new character that looks very similar to an older character

638
00:57:57,789 --> 00:57:59,651
and then later we want to bring them back,

639
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:02,513
it makes it very difficult to bring that old character back

640
00:58:02,593 --> 00:58:04,435
and, you know, just makes them both weaker.

641
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,800
And the other one, V-Trigger...

642
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:07,841
Oh, not V-Trigger...

643
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:09,602
The new character is more...

644
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:10,842
Elevator.

645
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:11,763
Yes, that's right.

646
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:14,425
The new character has a unique movement and ability.

647
00:58:14,465 --> 00:58:16,506
In Street Fighter V, there is a system called V-Trigger.

648
00:58:16,546 --> 00:58:18,427
Based on that, when we were making the character,

649
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:20,828
we used a new power, a power we've never seen before.

650
00:58:20,848 --> 00:58:21,729
That's how it came about.

651
00:58:31,894 --> 00:58:34,776
And probably the biggest reason why the characters look more

652
00:58:34,856 --> 00:58:37,637
elaborate this time around is because of the V Trigger system

653
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:40,779
in Street Fighter V. So the V Trigger system is based around

654
00:58:40,879 --> 00:58:44,501
really wild, crazy, and very, very different techniques based

655
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:45,182
on the character.

656
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:49,204
And so that was a chance for us to kind of really boost some

657
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:51,726
of the cool things that they do with Nicali's hair and

658
00:58:51,886 --> 00:58:52,346
things like that.

659
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:53,387
Thank you.

660
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:54,367
Thank you.

661
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:56,588
Hi.

662
00:58:56,989 --> 00:58:57,289
Thanks.

663
00:58:57,629 --> 00:58:57,869
Evening.

664
00:58:58,069 --> 00:58:58,650
Great talk.

665
00:58:59,823 --> 00:59:08,165
So my question is, with 4 and 5, it's a very strong departure from the sprite styles of the earlier Street Fighter games.

666
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:16,027
And I was wondering if that change was dictated from above, from your director, or if it came from the art department?

667
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:24,030
And regardless of which way that went, how you went about kind of mitigating...

668
00:59:25,043 --> 00:59:31,166
or embracing responses to the shift from 2D Street Fighter into 3D Street Fighter?

669
00:59:31,426 --> 00:59:34,127
Responses in terms of the reaction from fans and things like that?

670
00:59:34,287 --> 00:59:36,147
From fans and from within the studio as well.

671
00:59:36,388 --> 00:59:42,730
Okay. So the question is, who made that decision to do the shift from 2D to 3D,

672
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,811
and then how we handled the reaction?

673
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,832
We moved from 3D to 4D, and then from 2D to 3D.

674
00:59:48,913 --> 00:59:49,573
First of all...

675
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:56,656
The decision was made after the art was done?

676
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,798
Or was it the headquarters that told you to make it 3D?

677
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:00,598
It was Ono.

678
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,679
Ah, that was Ono.

679
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:02,099
Make it 3D.

680
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:02,299
Also,

681
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,060
the reaction to the fans,

682
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,242
I don't want to say control,

683
01:00:06,262 --> 01:00:07,722
but how did you react?

684
01:00:22,634 --> 01:00:23,435
What do you think?

685
01:00:23,776 --> 01:00:26,159
I don't know anything about it,

686
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:28,281
but I think it's something that the producer

687
01:00:28,321 --> 01:00:29,323
has to think about.

688
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:42,777
the fans would react.

689
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:47,559
You know, we honestly weren't thinking too much about that

690
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:48,560
in the art department.

691
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,561
It was really all about figuring out

692
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:54,102
how to create Street Fighter in 3D.

693
01:00:54,983 --> 01:00:57,064
And we were lucky enough to have a team of great producers

694
01:00:57,104 --> 01:01:00,145
like Ono and some wonderful folks managing the community

695
01:01:00,165 --> 01:01:03,587
that helped us kind of bring everyone along for that journey.

696
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:07,048
We try to just focus on the art as much as we can.

697
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:09,869
Thank you.

698
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:10,430
Thank you.

699
01:01:11,476 --> 01:01:15,038
Hi, yeah, thank you for your talk. I was wondering are we done

700
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,361
No more, I think I'm getting the

701
01:01:20,002 --> 01:01:20,643
Sorry about that

702
01:01:21,884 --> 01:01:24,506
Last one last one last one so much be quick. I promise

703
01:01:24,586 --> 01:01:30,090
I was just wondering on that book that you were showing earlier with all the like guides and rules for the muscles

704
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,612
Like is there a copy of that somewhere or is that just internal?

705
01:01:33,017 --> 01:01:35,678
Did you find any copies of the materials you discovered at that research institute?

706
01:01:35,698 --> 01:01:37,999
I was also asked this question in Japan but no.

707
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:41,880
We should be able to publish them in a blog called Shadow Loo Research Center.

708
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:01,894
You should check it out.

709
01:02:01,974 --> 01:02:05,136
There's a lot of stuff from those documents,

710
01:02:05,336 --> 01:02:07,277
and I believe over 200 characters.

711
01:02:07,877 --> 01:02:12,300
I think I've already introduced more than 2,000 characters.

712
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,722
Oh, that's right.

713
01:02:14,762 --> 01:02:15,822
The whole thing isn't up there.

714
01:02:16,262 --> 01:02:18,584
There's a lot of information from that document

715
01:02:18,644 --> 01:02:19,464
and other documents.

716
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:22,926
Also, Nakayama has over 200 characters,

717
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,548
Street Fighter characters that he's worked with these guys on,

718
01:02:26,428 --> 01:02:27,209
that you can check out.

719
01:02:27,249 --> 01:02:29,510
So I highly recommend you look at the Shadaloo blog.

720
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:40,953
And this was another question he got when giving this presentation, a different presentation in Japan.

721
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:49,417
So when he returns back to Japan, he's going to let people know how interested everyone is in these old documents and see if we can release them publicly.

722
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:57,442
Send them messages on Facebook, tell them how much you want to see these internal documents.

723
01:02:57,462 --> 01:02:59,503
Cool, thank you very much. What was that website called again?

724
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:02,150
The Shadowloo blog.

725
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,772
Shadowloo.

726
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:08,734
What was the name of the blog?

727
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:11,795
In Japanese, it's called the Shadowloo Laboratory.

728
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:17,038
And I apologize, I can't remember if that's the same name in English or not,

729
01:03:17,439 --> 01:03:20,320
but if you look up Nakayama Shadowloo Blog,

730
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,601
it's going to come up.

731
01:03:22,922 --> 01:03:23,482
Sorry about that.

732
01:03:23,782 --> 01:03:24,643
No, thank you so much.

733
01:03:24,663 --> 01:03:25,863
Cheers. Thank you so much, guys.
