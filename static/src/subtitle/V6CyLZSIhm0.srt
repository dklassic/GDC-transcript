1
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:09,628
Welcome back to GDC.

2
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:14,712
Hope you guys had a warm lunch to thaw yourselves out.

3
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:22,259
So this is my 11th GDC,

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,262
but my first, very first solo talk.

5
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:26,543
So I'm really excited to be here.

6
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:28,164
My name is Pete Cooper.

7
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:31,639
I am a little bit about myself.

8
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,940
I'm a pretty hardcore gamer,

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,101
and I have been playing, making,

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,142
and designing games my whole life.

11
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:43,123
This is my at-home work studio space.

12
00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:45,044
I try to make sure I don't have too many distractions.

13
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:49,706
So I've been making games for quite a while.

14
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:52,327
Here's some of the games I've helped ship

15
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:53,547
over the past 15 years.

16
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:02,122
I'm also the co-founder and creative director at Gamers for Good, which is a non-profit

17
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:06,204
organization that I run with my wonderful wife Liz, who's in the back there with the

18
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:06,664
purple hair.

19
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:07,744
Hey Liz!

20
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:13,527
And I've been privileged to be part of the art leadership team at Riot Games for the

21
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:14,147
past five years.

22
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:18,679
All right, so I'm here to talk about internal game jams.

23
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,441
So when Keith first asked me to give this talk,

24
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,942
I was a little surprised because it doesn't seem

25
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:26,684
like it's super art specific.

26
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:30,466
But when I thought about it, it is relevant

27
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:33,748
because as art leaders, it's our responsibility

28
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:38,330
to keep our teams creative, highly motivated and energized,

29
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,392
as well as ensuring they continuously have

30
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:42,973
great opportunities to learn and grow.

31
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:48,160
So before I get ahead of myself, I want to make sure everyone here knows what a game jam is.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,621
Is there anybody here who doesn't know?

33
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:54,265
Alright, hey, got one, two.

34
00:01:54,746 --> 00:02:02,172
Alright, so a standard definition of game jam is making games within a super short time frame.

35
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,033
In most cases it's 48 hours-ish.

36
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:09,633
I've seen them go as long as a week and I've seen them go as short as eight hours, but

37
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,595
it's normally a couple of days.

38
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:19,783
And they normally have a general theme, something to constrain the team a little bit so that

39
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:21,104
they have things to collaborate on.

40
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:25,889
So what I want to talk about is a little bit different.

41
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,751
It's something I like to call a company jam.

42
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:34,756
And what that is, it's basically giving cross-discipline groups freedom to try things way outside the

43
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:35,096
box.

44
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:41,999
So it doesn't necessarily have to be games, but it's basically just finding ways to get

45
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:42,840
teams doing things.

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,262
Now the important thing, it needs to also still have this super short time frame and

47
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:52,584
hopefully some general theme or constraint, but the cross-discipline part is very important.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,242
It's really easy to say, hey, concept artists,

49
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:59,903
spend a couple days concepting whatever you want.

50
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:01,444
You'll get a whole bunch of really cool drawings

51
00:03:01,484 --> 00:03:02,004
and that's great.

52
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:04,705
But when you make it cross-discipline,

53
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,706
when you combine an engineer, an animator, a VFX artist,

54
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,308
you know, that unlocks everybody's individual skills

55
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,889
and then the sky's the limit on what they can make.

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,150
So for a couple brief examples

57
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,111
of how I've seen this work in the past,

58
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,192
is I worked at a studio called N-Space

59
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:21,913
many years ago in Orlando.

60
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:25,767
And after we shipped the game,

61
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:29,150
we were given a few days to try an art prototype.

62
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,132
So we had full freedom to do whatever we wanted

63
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,795
within the constraints of it had to run on the GameCube.

64
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,517
This was also around the time that Doom 3 came out,

65
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:41,079
so we also wanted to try some cool dynamic lighting.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,461
Anyone who's worked on the GameCube knows

67
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:44,562
that's almost impossible.

68
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,352
And another example is when I worked at Blizzard on Diablo 3, there was a point where all the

69
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:57,074
designers were all trying to solve a specific problem and a bunch of the rest of us were

70
00:03:57,114 --> 00:04:02,657
given a few days to figure out and implement any dungeon mechanic ideas we wanted.

71
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:07,619
We came up with a whole bunch of really cool things and it was really great because when

72
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,400
we presented it to the designers, they were really surprised on what we were able to come

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,240
up with on our own.

74
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:17,033
Now the best example I've ever seen of this is something called

75
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:22,441
riot thunder dome. And here is a five minute video that will

76
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:23,522
explain it better than I will.

77
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:27,993
Thunderdome starts with this jolt of adrenaline.

78
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:30,074
Three days, over 70 teams.

79
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:34,176
We've got over 380 people participating in Thunderdome.

80
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,837
It's really about getting teams together to just try

81
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:38,819
kind of moonshot type things.

82
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,540
If you're doing Thunderdome with the people

83
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,820
that you work with every day,

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,361
you're doing Thunderdome wrong.

85
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,103
The team and I are taking League of Legends characters

86
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:47,964
and we're actually making a fighting game.

87
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,506
We're working on a project to basically

88
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:53,687
build some robot minions and have them fight.

89
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,676
So we're working on a game called Clash of Fates.

90
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,398
Two players playing head-to-head.

91
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:01,560
Whoever has the fastest reaction time wins out.

92
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,282
Yeah, let's go and get all the stuff over there.

93
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:08,245
We're going to try to take six months of work and put it into three days.

94
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:12,908
So the planning process needs to be really fast and really tight.

95
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:17,792
We're doing something entirely within our day jobs.

96
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:21,875
And this is a chance for us to work together on not only something that we can team up and use our skills on,

97
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:23,636
but something we can develop new skills together with.

98
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:27,610
So do you want to start mocking up on UI or anything?

99
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,292
Yeah, I mean just anything that we need to get to here.

100
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,674
So first priority is the health bar thing.

101
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:36,257
We had some hiccups with the Roombas that we ordered.

102
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:39,580
We're a little bit out of date models because we were trying to be out of budget.

103
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:43,984
They're actually two months too old to really truly be hackable.

104
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,008
So that's a really big challenge.

105
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:52,519
We should have a rough something on the screen in two hours.

106
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:57,422
It's not just about getting everything done, it's about also them playing it and changing it and playing it and changing it.

107
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:02,445
It's a cool opportunity to try out new technology, play with some stuff that I've been eyeing in the past few months,

108
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:06,988
and really push myself to see what I'll be able to do in the next 48 hours.

109
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:12,571
I'll probably take the animation that we showed the first step and we'll see what all the integration steps are.

110
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:14,593
Got it. Ready? Let's do it.

111
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:35,344
Day two is just sort of most of the day is just freaking out and wondering if we can

112
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:36,204
get done on time.

113
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:42,027
You know it was really great to see the minion molds progressing and like it was starting

114
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:43,047
to really look like minions.

115
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:47,649
I sat down and just basically started editing the code that we had done and refactoring

116
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:47,909
that.

117
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:50,790
Doing the lights blinking and the eyes and the wand.

118
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:59,776
For me, I don't ever touch code, and, you know, being able to do that and play around with electronics for a couple days was really cool.

119
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:04,900
I'm pretty sure what's going to end up happening is everybody will have something awesome on their own machine,

120
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,522
and then we'll mash it all together and they're going to be like,

121
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,023
oh, crap, Frankenstein fighting game.

122
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,265
Okay, I really do have to target those little statues, they look like big ups.

123
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:14,526
Yeah, they're too bright.

124
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:18,869
It's like, you know, can we still get everything done if we stay up all night?

125
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,330
It's not loading yet?

126
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,583
Start making the tough choices.

127
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:39,485
Do we have time for it?

128
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,467
You should try it if we don't.

129
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,471
Yeah, we have an hour and a half left to cut off.

130
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:45,953
Right now we're just polishing up.

131
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:49,538
We've been up since, myself, 7th Jane. We were here all night last night.

132
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,044
We're not necessarily the appropriate people to make this type of game by our job title,

133
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:56,267
but absolutely by what our passion.

134
00:07:56,757 --> 00:07:57,317
Is it working?

135
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:58,737
Best of three.

136
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:03,778
As much planning as you do when creating games, you never really know if something's fun until

137
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:07,939
you have your hands on it, you know, and that always feels so good when it's like, oh my

138
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,179
god, I played it and it was fun.

139
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,119
Oh!

140
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,100
We were changing versions at the very last minute.

141
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,620
I'm down to the wire, I'm pencils down.

142
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,721
We're rushing around trying to finish everything and put the finishing touches on the minions

143
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:23,581
both visually and...

144
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,340
in the code. So trying to finish all of that in just a couple hours was a little bit hectic.

145
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,003
We're like, you know what? This is what we're going with. This is good enough.

146
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:40,806
This is our victory dance. It's official now. It's the moment of truth.

147
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:44,687
Yes. Yes. Yes.

148
00:08:57,206 --> 00:09:02,310
At the end of Thunderdome we have this awesome science fair where everybody presents the

149
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,391
work that they've been doing for the past three days.

150
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:11,517
We're a very teamwork oriented company.

151
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:16,921
Engineers, it's programmers, it's artists, you know, audio, everything comes together

152
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:17,841
to create these things.

153
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:21,863
And it's sort of how we work at Riot.

154
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:25,603
You know, there aren't a lot of barriers between different disciplines.

155
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,724
Everybody crushes together and makes something cool.

156
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:31,365
Three days ago, this was just like an idea in our heads,

157
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:33,485
and now it's a thing we're actually playing.

158
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:38,486
People get joy out of it. That's what I want.

159
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,306
Each Thunderdome, we try something more and more difficult,

160
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:45,067
until one day, maybe we'll be doing something that we didn't even imagine we could do.

161
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:52,862
To me, this just reinforces how special a place this is.

162
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:55,883
You guys continue to amaze me every time.

163
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:58,003
Thanks.

164
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:01,185
All right, that's Thunderdome.

165
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:04,106
So, and that's the end of my talk, thanks.

166
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:15,294
Okay, so I want to talk about six of my personal Thunderdome experiences and what I've learned

167
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:21,439
from them and what value I think doing these type of jams for any company has.

168
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,767
Okay, so my first Thunderdome was about a month

169
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,088
after I started at Riot.

170
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:29,249
This was close to six years ago at this point.

171
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:33,071
And I was initially on the environment team.

172
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,932
So that crew decided that they really wanted

173
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,433
to make a new map.

174
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:38,794
They wanted to give that a try.

175
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:41,275
So we had these seven guys,

176
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:45,277
and this was our team comp.

177
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,199
You can probably see some challenges already here.

178
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:48,259
So,

179
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:55,580
This was super exciting for, this is a 48 hour jam,

180
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,202
and this was very exciting for about the first 15 hours.

181
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:01,904
But then you realize, okay, we're ultimately

182
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:05,967
this exact same team doing the exact same job.

183
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:12,191
And by hour 25, you have people who had no energy,

184
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,374
people who were actually fighting amongst themselves,

185
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:18,836
and the inevitable

186
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,726
ran out of time.

187
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,948
Artists are notorious for being horrible at time management,

188
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:26,769
at least in my experience.

189
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,391
So that was pretty rough.

190
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:32,252
So lessons learned.

191
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:34,454
Team composition matters.

192
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,696
Having all one discipline is a pretty bad idea.

193
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:43,258
Working with new people is really important.

194
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:47,581
It teaches you a lot about teamwork, collaboration.

195
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,182
Finishing something is important.

196
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,385
We went in saying, we're just going to have fun.

197
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:55,848
And whether we get done with something or not, it's all good.

198
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:58,311
But I could tell everyone on the team

199
00:11:58,331 --> 00:11:59,653
was really disappointed because we

200
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:00,494
weren't able to get it done.

201
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:06,388
And producers, while I've always appreciated producers,

202
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,168
I appreciate them a whole lot more

203
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:12,710
during a very tight game jam session of 48 hours.

204
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,651
And it doesn't really have to be a producer per se,

205
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:19,172
just someone who's paying attention to the time,

206
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:21,873
who's allocating resources appropriately,

207
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:25,475
who's ensuring people are hitting milestones,

208
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:26,575
and it's, you know,

209
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:29,356
I gotta have those organized people in place.

210
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,801
Okay, so fast forward to the next Thunderdome.

211
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,566
So this was right before League of Legends All-Star break

212
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,508
where we have pro players,

213
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:42,252
and we have this thing where some of the pros

214
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:43,393
do one-on-one matches,

215
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,857
so we decided let's try to make a one-v-one mode

216
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:47,558
during Thunderdome.

217
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:57,766
And this time we learned from our mistakes. So we actually had a real team with designers,

218
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:04,394
engineers, producers and QA and audio. That was good. So a few key things that happened.

219
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:09,005
At the beginning we were thinking about themes,

220
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:10,046
what could the themes be?

221
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:13,267
And someone had an idea to use Magma Chamber.

222
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:14,988
So for history on Magma Chamber,

223
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,451
this was an old map that we were trying to make

224
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:20,372
for players a long time ago, a huge map.

225
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:23,554
And it ended up getting canceled for a lot of reasons

226
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:24,974
and there was a lot of disappointed players.

227
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,555
So someone had the idea of,

228
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,797
hey, let's just redo Magma Chamber in this

229
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,578
and maybe players will think that's cool.

230
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:40,233
Next thing, this is my buddy Chris Haga. He's an amazing guy for anyone who knows him. So

231
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:45,096
Chris Haga is a super soldier Viking. He's like, we don't need sleep, we're just going

232
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:53,482
all in. Let's do this. By hour 15, Chris Haga was a fucking zombie. Like, he was completely

233
00:13:53,582 --> 00:14:01,067
useless. He was the sole VFX artist on the team. I hope he's here. Is he here? But anyway,

234
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:07,928
We were trolling him by asking him when you're going to have that lava fall in. He kept saying

235
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:12,092
I'll get it in ten minutes. We would ask him in an hour and he'd say the same thing. I don't

236
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:18,700
even think he had any understanding of time for a ten hour gap. That didn't work out too well.

237
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,751
But besides that, we did have a producer.

238
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:27,772
And other than Chris Haga, we were able to allocate

239
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:29,953
resources properly, get everything working,

240
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,153
and that was fantastic.

241
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:33,753
We weren't stressed about anything,

242
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,054
because someone was paying attention

243
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,034
to everything that had to get done.

244
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:42,055
And another thing was at 6 a.m., my awesome wife

245
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:44,136
brought us breakfast burritos one day,

246
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:45,736
and that was pretty amazing.

247
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:47,397
Thanks, Liz.

248
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:51,899
So here is the map we ended up with.

249
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,740
We wanted, this was the magma chamber, dark lava theme.

250
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,460
There's Chris Haga's lava falls,

251
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,400
he actually managed to get in.

252
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:02,921
So this was pretty cool, we were really happy with it.

253
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,762
We had fun making it and overall it was great.

254
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:08,983
But something we realized is there was another team

255
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:09,983
that was doing something

256
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,084
that they were having even more fun with.

257
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:17,326
So this is a character on the left, Hecarim in League of Legends.

258
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:21,888
He's like a dark, shadow isles, centaur, evil dude.

259
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:27,529
And one of the crews had the idea of doing an arcade skin line,

260
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,830
which is really over-the-top, silly stuff.

261
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,412
And there was producers at the company who didn't think this was a great idea,

262
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,112
so they used Thunderdome to prove it.

263
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:43,107
And during the development of this, these guys were having a blast. They were making 8-bit

264
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:48,813
pixel VFX. We could go by and hear all the silly ass sound effects they were trying to make.

265
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:54,860
All these beep boop bops and rainbow unicorn horns. They were having such a great time. That

266
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,922
was a pretty eye-opening experience.

267
00:15:57,982 --> 00:16:01,043
So while this was really great, it made me realize,

268
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:03,584
okay, this is tonally pretty similar

269
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:05,585
to what we regularly do.

270
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:07,926
We do a lot of fun, silly stuff,

271
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,967
but I'd say 90% of it is kind of in the serious,

272
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,227
the little more serious space.

273
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,608
So this is where I decided that going forward,

274
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:17,109
we want to do more lighthearted stuff.

275
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,750
Another thing that happened is

276
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:25,392
some players thought the magma chamber thing was cool,

277
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:26,612
other players not so much.

278
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:30,757
Because we promised this huge thing and then ended up

279
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:34,938
canceling it, then when we showed them this tiny little

280
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:37,118
thing that we made, look, we brought Magma Chamber back.

281
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,579
They're like, bullshit, that's not it.

282
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,860
So they were pretty disappointed in that.

283
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,001
And then we weren't actually able to ship this mode to them.

284
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,321
We were trying to, but we had server issues, so we couldn't

285
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:48,721
get it done.

286
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:51,582
So they were double upset about that.

287
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:53,703
So lessons learned this time.

288
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:56,018
Number one, sleep is good.

289
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:58,300
That kind of sounds like a no-brainer,

290
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,982
but I've seen a lot of people try to do game jams

291
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,322
and try to do the all-nighter thing,

292
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,083
and sometimes it works out great,

293
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:08,604
but every time I've seen people just go home,

294
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:11,086
sleep, come back fresh,

295
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:13,027
you end up getting a lot more done anyway.

296
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:15,708
Player expectations.

297
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:17,709
You know, if you promise something to players,

298
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,070
don't surprise them by saying,

299
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,511
look, we made it something else.

300
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:22,211
Isn't that cool?

301
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,972
Team size doesn't matter when you have organized people.

302
00:17:27,492 --> 00:17:29,613
This, we thought this team was a little large.

303
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:30,453
It was 10 people.

304
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:32,774
So we were a little concerned,

305
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:34,875
but it ended up working out perfectly fine

306
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:36,015
because someone was paying attention.

307
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:36,795
Someone was organized.

308
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:41,297
And finally, theme and tone can affect work tone.

309
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:45,418
So because you're in such a tight timeframe,

310
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:47,999
I feel like doing more lighthearted things

311
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,620
keeps the entire tone of the project

312
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,801
and then tone of the team in a much happier place.

313
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:58,136
Okay, so next time on Thunderdome.

314
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,900
This time we decided let's make a map skin.

315
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:05,764
All right, so for a little context, this is ARAM.

316
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,787
This is a mode in League of Legends 5v5 single lane.

317
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:11,570
And this is Alex Gonzalez,

318
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,233
one of my good buddies and amazing concept artists.

319
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:18,517
And one Monday he comes to work and says,

320
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:19,518
hey, check this out.

321
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:20,679
I did this drawing over the weekend.

322
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,760
I think it would be really cool

323
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,042
if we made a map skin of ARAM.

324
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,343
What do you think of this?

325
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,305
I'm like, wow, this is really cool.

326
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:28,446
This is awesome.

327
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:29,868
We've never done a map skin before.

328
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:31,169
Maybe we should try that.

329
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,391
I'll talk to the production crew

330
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,433
and see if somewhere down the line

331
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:36,955
we can get this on a schedule somewhere.

332
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,577
And he's like, well, Thunderdome's coming up,

333
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:40,638
how about we just do it for Thunderdome?

334
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,180
And my initial reaction was like, what?

335
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,443
That's, look at how much content that is.

336
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:46,223
That's insanity.

337
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,146
And then I was looking at it, I'm like, you know,

338
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:51,828
there's a lot of stuff that's kind of duplicated,

339
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:53,490
you know, we may be able to pull it off,

340
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,131
but we're gonna need a pretty big team

341
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:56,252
if we're gonna do it.

342
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:57,634
So.

343
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,223
We decided, all right, let's just see how big a team we can make.

344
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:04,965
So we got a team of 25 people.

345
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,786
I believe 20 of the 25 were artists.

346
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,528
This is a very art-heavy experiment.

347
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:14,750
So a couple of key things that happened.

348
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:21,320
So, right before it started, I went to Party City and bought a whole bunch of stupid pirate

349
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,700
props.

350
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,001
I bought foam swords and hats and eye patches, doubloons.

351
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:30,762
Actually found, I was shocked, they had pirate ship pinata.

352
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:33,143
I was like, sweet, that's perfect.

353
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:39,004
So in order to try to keep the fun going, I wanted to do that.

354
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,065
And that actually really helped.

355
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:42,825
This was really important.

356
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:44,626
Say yes to everything.

357
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:44,906
So.

358
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:54,124
One of our jobs as leaders is actually to not specifically shoot down ideas, but we

359
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:58,966
have to block a lot of crazy things from going into our products because we have a cohesive

360
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:00,087
vision that we have to uphold.

361
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:06,470
So during game jam scenarios, this is an amazing opportunity to let people put in whatever

362
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,411
crazy, absurd, nutty ideas they want to.

363
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,242
Any time anyone walked up to me and said,

364
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:14,183
hey, what do you think of this?

365
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,284
I'm like, that sounds ridiculous, let's do it.

366
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:23,649
And this is actually where I fell in love with whiteboards.

367
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,412
There was a point, so there was huge concern.

368
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:30,653
20 artists were gonna be stepping on each other's toes

369
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:32,835
left and right, this is gonna be a total disaster.

370
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:35,497
And I've never been able to get

371
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:45,676
artists to use Jira or Trello or any of these damn tracking things. Any artists here like

372
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:49,300
Jira? Are you a tech artist?

373
00:20:55,075 --> 00:21:01,284
So Tim Hill, a producer at the time, he rolled in a whiteboard and was like, guys, just write

374
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:07,573
down all the shit you want to do. And just write it all down on the board and then just put

375
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:10,477
your name next to the thing you're putting in and when you check it in, cross it off.

376
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:13,297
And that was phenomenal.

377
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,297
That was the most amazing eye-opening thing.

378
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:19,218
Because anytime anyone can get up,

379
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,479
you just look over and say,

380
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:23,400
oh, hey, Steve's working on the river,

381
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,340
and Bob's working on X and Y.

382
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,681
And it was really great.

383
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:27,441
We stopped a lot of people

384
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:29,842
from stepping on each other's toes.

385
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,182
And that made me fall in love with whiteboards.

386
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:33,803
And I've used them ever since.

387
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:35,063
So here's a...

388
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,711
video of our production.

389
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:40,892
So we started by stripping everything out of the map.

390
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:42,952
And then we did a build every couple hours

391
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:45,233
that showed all the crap that was going in.

392
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:50,555
So, man, we put in so much stuff into this.

393
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:52,195
It was pretty nutty how fast it went in.

394
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,557
And I ripped the audio out of this

395
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:59,098
because I asked someone for this video

396
00:21:59,238 --> 00:22:00,298
and I think they trolled me

397
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:02,159
by putting the Pirates of the Caribbean

398
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:04,880
old ride theme on it.

399
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,540
And it was super obnoxious.

400
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:16,526
So yeah, we made all new nexuses, turrets, minions, just tons and tons of content. We

401
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:22,371
actually figured out new tech that we ended up using in the future. Things like rotating

402
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:30,739
turrets, lots of destruction. Made a new mini map in the bottom corner. People are just

403
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,401
throwing in all sorts of stuff. I don't even know what that is.

404
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:43,540
There's the rotating turrets. That was really cool. This was a really neat thing. Someone put in the

405
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,144
two boats and they made it so when one of the red side turrets gets destroyed, the blue ship

406
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:55,230
shoots and vice versa. And then when the last turret gets destroyed, that ship goes down. So

407
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:00,455
there was just a lot of people trying brand new things that nobody knew how we would make them

408
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:01,676
work. And...

409
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:03,673
It was great.

410
00:23:04,154 --> 00:23:05,394
Nobody was saying no to anything.

411
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:06,755
We were all just trying to get stuff in.

412
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:08,757
And then here's this great illustration

413
00:23:08,797 --> 00:23:11,699
made by Bo Liu in about 12 hours.

414
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:12,940
He's awesome.

415
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,002
All right, so my lessons learned from this

416
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,003
is big teams are awesome.

417
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,705
Like we were really concerned about how large this team was

418
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,707
and it worked out super well.

419
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:25,208
So we're like, sweet, there's no downside.

420
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:27,070
As long as you have organized people,

421
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,451
you can make it happen.

422
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:32,397
Prioritizing having fun was a really big win.

423
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:35,019
Like everyone had a great time the whole time.

424
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:38,682
Whiteboard tracking for the win.

425
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:40,163
Holy shit, I love whiteboards,

426
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:41,424
as you can tell from this talk.

427
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,127
And yes to all ideas.

428
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:46,989
And not just yes to all ideas.

429
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,731
It's one thing to give someone permission to do a thing.

430
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,473
It's another thing to be really supportive about it.

431
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:54,114
So if someone comes up and is like,

432
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,275
hey, I got this idea.

433
00:23:56,387 --> 00:24:02,836
Cool. Not only can you get it in, what can I do to support you from getting it in? Can I help

434
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:09,986
you make a model? Can I help you animate something? And that was a big win. And we also

435
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:12,389
found out we can make a ton of content really quickly.

436
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:18,756
After this Thunderdome, we had people from all over the company coming up and saying,

437
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:21,097
how are you moving so fast?

438
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:28,383
How can we figure out how to get this type of urgency, this type of speed into our regular daily jobs?

439
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:34,348
We surprised a lot of people on the team and outside the team, and that was really fantastic.

440
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:40,433
And this is where I decided that I want to change goals for how I want to go forward with Thunderdome.

441
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:41,494
So.

442
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,325
One of the things, and I love Riot, but one of the issues that I have is we have a lot of people who

443
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:58,591
kind of fall into the paralysis by analysis camp. We have philosophical debates about, you know,

444
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:06,056
the trim of a frame on an icon sometimes. So I wanted to use Thunderdome to

445
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,102
Show people and remind people how quickly we can move,

446
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:11,423
how fast we can make decisions.

447
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:14,605
So here are some of the goals that we move forward with.

448
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:16,266
Make games without over planning.

449
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:18,887
Do as little pre-production as we possibly can.

450
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:23,829
Go in pretty blind and see what we can do on the fly.

451
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,511
Get lots of people involved.

452
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,892
I wanted to grab people from all over the company

453
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:32,734
to make sure we're working with lots of new people

454
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:36,716
and exposing as many people to this type of jams as possible.

455
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,101
And finally, push people out of their comfort zones.

456
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:42,142
Try to get people learning,

457
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:44,083
try to get everyone learning something new

458
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:45,684
every time we do one of these jams.

459
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:49,726
Okay, so fast forwarding.

460
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:53,728
So we've done a bunch of modes, some maps,

461
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:54,828
a lot of these little things.

462
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:55,929
We're like, all right, this time

463
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:57,069
we're just gonna straight up make a game.

464
00:25:57,662 --> 00:26:02,463
Let's see what we can do. So someone came up with a very basic idea of a minion side

465
00:26:02,483 --> 00:26:06,664
scroller. And then I was like, cool, that's a great idea, let's leave it at that. And of

466
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:09,905
course people wanted, oh, well let's plan some stuff out. No, no, no, stop. That's it.

467
00:26:10,545 --> 00:26:16,386
No planning. Don't do it. Caught a couple people trying. Blocked them. Stop it. Burn

468
00:26:16,426 --> 00:26:17,686
that. Let's not do it.

469
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,051
Okay, so we actually ended up with another 25 person team.

470
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:23,012
It wasn't the same.

471
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:24,693
We had about 10 people from the old team

472
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,153
and about 15 new people.

473
00:26:26,713 --> 00:26:27,894
We actually grabbed a couple of people

474
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:29,635
that this was like their first week at Riot.

475
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:31,916
Brand new people, so lots of new faces.

476
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:35,377
We found a room that had a gigantic whiteboard,

477
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:35,978
which was awesome.

478
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:39,434
I was like, okay, right when it starts, we have a beginning,

479
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:41,816
because minions start at a crystal,

480
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:42,976
then they go to the other side crystal.

481
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,297
So we have a beginning and end of the game.

482
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:47,700
Now everyone just throw out whatever ideas come to mind.

483
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,801
What do you guys want to see in the game?

484
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:52,099
And so we did this ridiculous brainstorm of,

485
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:53,840
hey, let's throw some minions in there,

486
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,441
let's have an epic forest vista,

487
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:57,602
let's drop Anivia the Icebird in there

488
00:26:57,642 --> 00:26:58,963
and have her drop ice walls

489
00:26:59,063 --> 00:27:01,104
and we'll throw zigs throwing bombs

490
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,765
and have cannon minions

491
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:06,887
and have Nautilus in mid lane smashing 100 minions

492
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:09,369
and then you go into the jungle and there's crabs

493
00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:13,111
and people just threw out a million ridiculous absurd ideas.

494
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,692
And then you blow up the crystal at the end

495
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:16,212
after you fight a super mech minion.

496
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:17,993
And I was like, all right, sweet.

497
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:21,335
Now we have 40-something hours.

498
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:24,776
Where's the producer to organize this?

499
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:26,617
So 48 hours of development.

500
00:27:26,677 --> 00:27:27,698
Some really cool things happened.

501
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:36,450
First off, we decided to do flash style 2D style development.

502
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,651
This is primarily because no one on the team

503
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:39,331
has ever done this.

504
00:27:40,332 --> 00:27:42,272
So we wanted to get people learning new things.

505
00:27:42,332 --> 00:27:43,132
And this was amazing.

506
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:44,973
Within the first few hours,

507
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:47,194
there was constantly people going,

508
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,834
hey, I figured out how to do this thing.

509
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,318
Five other people crowd around them and go,

510
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,820
oh sweet, I see, now I get it.

511
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,203
We had concept artists learning new things,

512
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:58,586
animators, everyone across the board

513
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,609
was learning a brand new way to build things.

514
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:05,363
This was the first time we purposely kicked everyone out.

515
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:06,264
We're like, all right.

516
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,226
We probably had one or two people who did a couple,

517
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:11,748
the super-lates or all-nighters,

518
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:13,689
but the vast majority of everyone were like,

519
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,290
go home, get a good night's sleep,

520
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:18,072
nine or 10 p.m., take off,

521
00:28:18,272 --> 00:28:19,593
and then come in the morning fresh.

522
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:21,094
And it worked out really well.

523
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,361
And the other thing is we spent so much time focusing on learning and putting a million

524
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:33,163
things in the game that we forgot about the all important thing of iterating.

525
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:34,844
We had zero time.

526
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:40,046
So the game was put together, it was Frankenstein together at the very, very last minute.

527
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,687
So we're like, we don't know if this game is any good.

528
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,708
So here's a video.

529
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:47,808
Of course, you've got to start with that screen.

530
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:51,556
So we made this really cool intro.

531
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,739
I love motion graphics people.

532
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:56,840
They're hot.

533
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,202
So we started as a single player game

534
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:00,502
and then like 5 minutes before

535
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,244
we ended, let's just do multiplayer, why not?

536
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:05,206
So we just have this

537
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:08,108
super fun

538
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:08,808
silly

539
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:10,409
minion

540
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:11,930
game.

541
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:17,560
And no time to animate an enemy, I throw her up in the air and shoot, sweet.

542
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:21,703
Alright so this video is really long so I'm just gonna take screenshots.

543
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:27,926
So we fight shit tons of minions, you fight a cannon minion, then you have Nautilus, and

544
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,287
then you go into a jungle.

545
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:31,569
We made a ton of different environments.

546
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:34,850
You fight the epic crab boss, then you go to the river.

547
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,493
where you fight piranhas and all sorts of other crap,

548
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:41,316
and then you go to the other outside and you fight towers,

549
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:44,138
and then here's the ultra minion mech,

550
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:45,900
and there's a ton of stuff between this,

551
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,701
and then you go to the Nexus,

552
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:51,004
and then Garen comes in and takes the last hit

553
00:29:51,064 --> 00:29:51,905
and takes credit for the win.

554
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:55,348
That's why it's called Last Hit.

555
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:01,381
So this was a pretty amazing experience,

556
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:03,843
and there's some really good lessons learned from this.

557
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,025
Number one, we can make a game with almost no planning.

558
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:09,007
And that was really cool to see.

559
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,169
It surprised a lot of people on the team,

560
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,813
and I think it woke up a lot of people to that reality.

561
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:18,235
Number two, no crunch needed.

562
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:19,896
You can totally...

563
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:21,738
You know, get some sleep.

564
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:22,959
You know, prioritize.

565
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:25,420
You can do jams without doing all-nighters.

566
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,160
You know, it's totally doable.

567
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:29,881
Accelerated learning for the win.

568
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:32,082
I think this is the biggest amazing lesson.

569
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:36,064
Like, we all know people on our teams who say, oh, you know,

570
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,305
I really want to learn this new program.

571
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:39,685
I really want to learn this new thing.

572
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:44,987
I'm going to put it on my six-month personal development

573
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:47,568
plan, and hopefully I'll find time to do tutorials.

574
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:50,470
And then two years later, they still don't know it.

575
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:57,058
So forcing people to learn things during a game jam is amazing

576
00:30:57,178 --> 00:30:59,039
because you only have two days.

577
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:02,100
You're going to learn it because all these other people are counting on you to learn it.

578
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,061
So no one wants to let the team down.

579
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:07,882
So that's a pretty amazing thing.

580
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:10,983
And finally, this game kind of sucks.

581
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:16,146
Because we just didn't think of it as a game for some reason.

582
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:18,948
We just didn't think about iterating on it.

583
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:21,089
Alright, so fast forward.

584
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,952
This time let's make a good game with no planning.

585
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:28,454
So one of the things I realized afterwards is

586
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:31,496
we didn't do a lot of planning, but because we already had a theme

587
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,697
everyone already kind of had in their mind

588
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:35,599
alright, we know what it's going to look like

589
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,440
we know the characters, you know.

590
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,461
So this time...

591
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:41,346
No theme, no nothing, zero planning.

592
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:43,631
Other than we did say we wanna make a twin stick shooter,

593
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:44,212
but that is it.

594
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,543
This time we brought in a bunch more people.

595
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:55,066
I was actually inviting people who've never made games before.

596
00:31:56,307 --> 00:32:01,090
At this point I'm inviting people from HR, from facilities, finance.

597
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:04,792
Like, come on, who wants to help learn something to make a game?

598
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:05,273
Let's do it.

599
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:10,496
So when Thunderdome started, we had a vote.

600
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:12,937
We just had everyone in a room and say, okay, let's vote on.

601
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,279
What themes do you guys want to make?

602
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:16,359
What's the characters?

603
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,161
What's the environment?

604
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:20,522
See if we can make a game designed by committee

605
00:32:20,602 --> 00:32:23,664
and still actually have it be good.

606
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:29,027
So like I said before, we were asking a lot of other people.

607
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:31,629
And also, this time.

608
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:38,195
Well, one of the things that stops people from doing Thunderdome at Riot is people are really busy.

609
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,519
So there's like a big commitment to say,

610
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:44,583
okay, I'm going to go ahead and do the whole end of the week.

611
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,184
I'm just committing to Thunderdome.

612
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:47,386
So a lot of people have meetings.

613
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:50,690
A lot of people have end of the week milestones they're still trying to hit.

614
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,452
So this time...

615
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,702
I just said, you know what, if you can dedicate any time, an hour, two hours, if you just

616
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:01,103
want to stay one evening, it doesn't even matter.

617
00:33:01,343 --> 00:33:03,864
Anything you want to contribute, that's awesome.

618
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:05,005
You can totally be part of the team.

619
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:09,807
So another cool thing is...

620
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:15,879
We had a cool twin stick shooter up and running pretty quickly, but we didn't have any really

621
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:20,941
interesting unique mechanic. I believe it was one of the guys on the merge team who

622
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:25,683
actually came up with the idea of having like these Tetris style blocks falling into the

623
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:33,706
play space and creating blockers. That was really cool. So this is my buddy Warren who is a

624
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,147
phenomenal animator. He doesn't look anything like this. He doesn't wear glasses or ties or

625
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,188
anything. I just love this picture.

626
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:44,229
And late in the second day, he walks up to me and says,

627
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,409
hey, we're just about done with all of the animation

628
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:47,150
of the game.

629
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,250
I want to try making an intro cutscene thing.

630
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:53,151
And I'm like, OK.

631
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:55,312
So you're saying, I'm like, do you have a plan?

632
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:55,832
He's like, no.

633
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:57,893
I'm like, OK, awesome.

634
00:33:57,993 --> 00:33:59,413
So within the next couple hours, you

635
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:04,074
want to plan, storyboard, animate, find audio support

636
00:34:04,734 --> 00:34:05,875
to get an intro into the game.

637
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,175
All right, let's see if we can make it happen.

638
00:34:09,056 --> 00:34:09,736
And I actually did.

639
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:17,481
And Liz made us some awesome arcade themed cupcakes.

640
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:19,102
Thanks again, Liz.

641
00:34:20,463 --> 00:34:21,524
My wife, she's amazing.

642
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:25,346
So here's a video.

643
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:26,467
Hell yeah.

644
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:27,747
Arcade.

645
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,188
This is where we were voting.

646
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,130
Looks like our MVP is going to be Lucian Jinx.

647
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:45,224
Super arcade gunners to the something.

648
00:34:45,785 --> 00:34:46,945
So are we voting on names?

649
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:50,067
That's one of the dumbest name ideas.

650
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:50,728
Oh shit.

651
00:34:51,448 --> 00:34:52,068
Five minutes.

652
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,231
Good morning everybody!

653
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:57,071
Whoa, that's loud.

654
00:34:58,232 --> 00:34:59,613
Welcome to day two!

655
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:00,333
Whee!

656
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:02,675
Day two of making a fucking game.

657
00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:03,875
So here we are.

658
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,337
Wow, Wednesday's dead.

659
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:16,120
Bow! 9am is dead. We'll call that 10. Just kidding, 10 is dead. Where we at?

660
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:20,603
1041 to 1 o'clock. Alright, who's the engineers? How much time we got?

661
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:23,185
Someone who knows math. Tell me how much time we got.

662
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:28,468
We actually made t-shirts. That was pretty funny.

663
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:37,233
So we found out one of the people's SOs has a side t-shirt company.

664
00:35:37,253 --> 00:35:39,594
So we're like, can we just get t-shirts made, like, right now?

665
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:41,175
Who's got a graphic?

666
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:41,636
Let's do it.

667
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:43,096
And that was fun.

668
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:47,419
And here's the actual story trailer and gameplay thing.

669
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:11,213
Zero Iteration was the name of our team.

670
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:17,115
Kind of trolling ourselves.

671
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:28,297
This was like a Smash TV kind of thing.

672
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:30,478
The Garin Gun.

673
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,958
Fires spinning Garins.

674
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:48,533
That was my first attempt at pixel art.

675
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:50,515
Someone's like, hey, we need to cover...

676
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:52,817
Oh, yeah, pixel art. That'll take about an hour.

677
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:54,018
Pfft, yeah, I was wrong.

678
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,121
So, lessons learned.

679
00:36:58,422 --> 00:37:00,023
Pixel art is fucking hard.

680
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:04,807
Bonus props to everyone who makes pixel art.

681
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:08,390
I was surprised. I've never actually done it before.

682
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:17,270
Next thing is part-timers welcome. That was a really big win. Letting people join who, it just

683
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:23,535
basically alleviated anyone from having an excuse to not join in. It's like, hey, if you have two

684
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:31,320
hours, if you have a lunch break, come on and learn something real quick, have fun. This is an

685
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,263
obvious one. The best ideas can come from anyone. I mean, everyone knows that. But it's really

686
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:38,986
great when there's super clear examples to point out to people.

687
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,941
And anyone can help make games.

688
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:47,023
Like, I mean, we really had all sorts of people on the team

689
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:49,684
who aren't even game developers join in,

690
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:51,205
learn how to animate something real quick,

691
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:53,546
learn how to do a VFX, learn how to implement a model.

692
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:55,848
That was really great to see.

693
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,229
All right, and for the final one,

694
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,591
we decided let's see if we can make

695
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,432
and ship a game with players.

696
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:06,913
So here's the pitch.

697
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:08,554
It was...

698
00:38:09,902 --> 00:38:13,184
We're gonna come up with five different game types

699
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,048
and a whole bunch of themes and create a survey,

700
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,529
put it on the League of Legends forums

701
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:20,431
and let players vote on what it is.

702
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,734
And we'll have the voting end

703
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,856
the minute Thunderdome starts.

704
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:28,718
So there's zero chance for any pre-production whatsoever.

705
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,461
So we know what it is that we're making

706
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:32,361
right when it starts.

707
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:39,937
live. So give players live updates, give them builds, take

708
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:44,902
their feedback. And then the goal is to build, finish and

709
00:38:44,982 --> 00:38:49,066
ship a game in 48 hours. So we wanted to have it up for anyone

710
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:53,431
to download and play by the time Thunderdome ended. At this

711
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:56,974
point I have no idea how big the team is. I think

712
00:38:58,104 --> 00:38:59,624
Someone brought in their mom at one point.

713
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:01,866
It was massive.

714
00:39:02,546 --> 00:39:05,088
I don't even know how we organized that.

715
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:09,910
So here's the thing we threw up on the forum.

716
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,612
So yeah, we had the five different game types,

717
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:16,354
Infinite Runner, Match 3, 2D Platformer,

718
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:18,135
Gallery Shooter, and a Rhythm Game.

719
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,636
I was really pulling for Rhythm Game.

720
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:25,490
But the vote ended up being 2D platformer in the arcade theme.

721
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:31,218
Arcade theme is popular, you know, thanks to that team, Thunderdome, back in the day.

722
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:34,983
All right, so let's just hop right into one of the dev videos.

723
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:38,728
It's great having people who are recording shit for you.

724
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,399
I hope this was the little end sequence, what you get when you win the game.

725
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:29,667
Doran's Ring, that is a shitty item for anyone who doesn't play League.

726
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:32,211
It's a great starter item, I shouldn't say shitty.

727
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,132
My job is to stand over people, as you can see.

728
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,328
All right. So, despite the fact that we have a

729
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:36,300
Getting everyone to spend time communicating with players,

730
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,202
getting feedback, all the enemies in the game

731
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:42,864
were originally concepted by just some random people

732
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:45,305
on the forums, which was really great.

733
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:46,606
And then we were translating the game.

734
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:51,109
Despite that, this went really, really smooth.

735
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:52,209
It was actually strange.

736
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:54,991
I remember looking over at our head producer, Blake,

737
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:56,552
when we were about halfway through going.

738
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,240
Why is this going so well?

739
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,280
Normally, stuff is on fire,

740
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:03,921
like things are breaking left and right.

741
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,221
We have people putting things in

742
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,682
that have never put anything in before,

743
00:42:06,782 --> 00:42:07,742
so you know what that looks like.

744
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,223
But this went crazy smooth.

745
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:12,764
And that was amazing.

746
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,665
And here is our actual game trailer.

747
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:22,166
This is what it ended up being.

748
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:47,668
This is Arcade Slash!

749
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,052
Alright, so...

750
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:53,994
Lessons learned.

751
00:42:55,295 --> 00:42:56,897
Number one, planning is overrated.

752
00:42:57,957 --> 00:43:06,282
I mean, obviously this is a gross generalization, but we proved multiple times that teams can

753
00:43:06,482 --> 00:43:10,584
absolutely make things without any kind of pre-production, just making things on the

754
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:10,944
fly.

755
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:17,408
And it's absolutely doable, and it actually greatly raises teams' confidence level in

756
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:18,549
themselves and their abilities.

757
00:43:21,007 --> 00:43:22,889
Engaging with players is amazing.

758
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:25,930
That was a really, really great thing.

759
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,332
Interacting with your audience is hugely beneficial.

760
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:33,935
I believe it actually keeps and creates long-term fans.

761
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:38,057
And just, that was,

762
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:40,959
it actually made me want to start streaming myself.

763
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,881
It was really great to just be part of the,

764
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:46,462
be part of the actual player community.

765
00:43:48,182 --> 00:43:49,923
And we proved that we could kind of accomplish anything.

766
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:51,805
So that was really great.

767
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:57,190
OK, so before I end, I want to talk quickly

768
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,913
about some Game Jam resources.

769
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:04,317
Now, not every studio has the resources of a Riot Games

770
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:06,620
or has the ability to.

771
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:10,811
to actually make a giant Thunderdome style thing happen.

772
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:13,633
But there's a lot of great resources out there

773
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:16,415
that exist that can help figure out

774
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:17,936
how to make a game jam possible.

775
00:44:18,636 --> 00:44:21,498
One great thing is, I can't talk about game jams

776
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:22,899
without talking about Global Game Jam.

777
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,722
Global Game Jam is this amazing worldwide game jam

778
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:28,783
that happens every January.

779
00:44:30,386 --> 00:44:34,610
And it's huge. So as of February 24th, the day I made this slide, there was 42,811 people

780
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,154
registered at 803 jam sites located in 108 countries around the world. So global game jam

781
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:38,675
is really massive.

782
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,730
So here's some of the posters that are made

783
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,271
for the different locations.

784
00:44:56,532 --> 00:44:59,273
So there's Mexico and Singapore,

785
00:44:59,353 --> 00:45:02,454
and I had to represent Portland, that's my jam site.

786
00:45:03,995 --> 00:45:06,496
And here's some pictures of some of the people

787
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:08,497
who are at these jam sites.

788
00:45:08,797 --> 00:45:10,958
Some of them are small, there's 15 people,

789
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,999
and other ones have hundreds of people

790
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,240
that show up to do this.

791
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:18,048
So Global Game Jam is an amazing thing.

792
00:45:18,568 --> 00:45:23,172
And there's ways you can help by simply letting,

793
00:45:23,192 --> 00:45:27,355
if you can just have your,

794
00:45:27,796 --> 00:45:29,197
Global Game Jam happens over the weekend,

795
00:45:29,277 --> 00:45:33,400
so if you can get your office to just sponsor

796
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,542
a Global Game Jam for your teams,

797
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:38,024
that'll be a really amazing thing for them.

798
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:40,706
You could also do simple things like sponsoring

799
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:42,607
with supplies, snacks, and t-shirts.

800
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:44,909
You could even do a thing where,

801
00:45:46,225 --> 00:45:49,846
allowing your people to go to Global Game Jam over a weekend and then giving them the

802
00:45:49,886 --> 00:45:50,586
next Monday off.

803
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:55,007
And that would be the only thing you actually have to do yourself, is eat one day.

804
00:45:56,968 --> 00:46:00,949
Now Global Game Jam always happens at the same time in January, but there's game jams

805
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:01,869
happening all the time.

806
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:05,930
So this is a site called Game Jams on itch.io.

807
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:14,149
This is a huge calendar and it's always full of shit tons of game jams that are going on at

808
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:23,496
any time and anyone can just hop in and join. There's one on the far right that was called

809
00:46:24,557 --> 00:46:29,521
no shit Sherlock jam. That was one I wanted to join. I have no idea what that theme is but

810
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:29,921
that's cool.

811
00:46:30,718 --> 00:46:33,200
There's another site called IndieGameJams.com.

812
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:37,683
And when I made this, there was over 50 game jams

813
00:46:37,784 --> 00:46:40,065
happening at the time I was making this presentation.

814
00:46:40,306 --> 00:46:43,088
So game jams are always going on.

815
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:45,890
So for closing thoughts.

816
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:50,314
So I've seen firsthand how amazing game jams are

817
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:54,217
for building teamwork skills with individuals.

818
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:58,300
So much amazing creative problem solving

819
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,801
happens on the fly during these.

820
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,303
Time management, like huge improvements.

821
00:47:05,563 --> 00:47:08,306
Myself and everyone on my team who's done this

822
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:11,790
learns how to really focus on getting things done

823
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,071
in a very timely manner.

824
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:17,732
It also builds, it also gives people fresh perspective.

825
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:22,973
I mean a lot of us work on these huge games that take sometimes years and years to make.

826
00:47:23,613 --> 00:47:31,014
So allowing your teams a couple days to just kind of make something from scratch, separate

827
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:35,395
themselves from the product for a couple days, it really gives them, I think it can really

828
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,076
give them a very fresh perspective and help them out.

829
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:41,157
Sense of accomplishment is huge also.

830
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:44,359
Like a lot of us work on games that get canceled

831
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:45,659
or again take a long time to make.

832
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:48,040
Being able to say our goal is to make something

833
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,181
really quickly in two days.

834
00:47:50,241 --> 00:47:51,962
And having it done, finished,

835
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:55,084
and everyone's relieved and excited about that.

836
00:47:56,904 --> 00:47:58,425
And finally creative freedom.

837
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:01,767
You know we can't all let all of our people

838
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:03,227
throw in all their crazy ideas.

839
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:06,569
But game jams are an amazing opportunity to let that happen.

840
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:09,896
Creative freedom is super important for creative people.

841
00:48:10,456 --> 00:48:14,478
So finding these small windows to make sure your teams can do

842
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,200
whatever wild thing they want is really important, and

843
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:18,940
they'll appreciate it.

844
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:21,422
All right.

845
00:48:21,742 --> 00:48:22,943
And that's all I got.

846
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:25,304
So thank you very much.

847
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:31,587
Thanks.

848
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:33,468
Oh, one thing I forgot.

849
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:35,029
Please silence your phones.

850
00:48:36,572 --> 00:48:36,792
Thanks.

851
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:42,196
And please fill out the survey so we can get some feedback.

852
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:46,839
And now it's time for Q&A. If anyone has any questions at all,

853
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:49,621
I'll leave up the resources.

854
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:51,842
And the last one is gamersforgood.com,

855
00:48:51,882 --> 00:48:53,083
my nonprofit organization.

856
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:56,646
If anyone has any questions or wants

857
00:48:56,706 --> 00:48:59,448
any ideas for how they can get their teams involved

858
00:48:59,488 --> 00:49:00,989
in game jams, hit me up.

859
00:49:01,169 --> 00:49:02,650
I'd be glad to help you with that.

860
00:49:10,524 --> 00:49:10,784
Hello.

861
00:49:12,585 --> 00:49:13,325
When do you do them?

862
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:14,786
Like on the week, on the weekends?

863
00:49:15,106 --> 00:49:15,566
What's like?

864
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:17,567
It's really whatever works for you.

865
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,427
I mean, most game jams are actually happening

866
00:49:19,587 --> 00:49:20,228
on the weekend.

867
00:49:20,428 --> 00:49:22,108
Yeah, but at Riot.

868
00:49:22,488 --> 00:49:23,869
At Riot, we do it during the week.

869
00:49:24,389 --> 00:49:27,770
So we have, we start at noon on Wednesday

870
00:49:28,651 --> 00:49:30,331
and we end noon on Friday.

871
00:49:32,412 --> 00:49:32,632
Thanks.

872
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:36,293
Yep, and we try to do them about twice a year.

873
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:40,175
Thanks for the.

874
00:49:40,617 --> 00:49:42,139
The talk was great.

875
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:45,223
I see you guys, you put together big teams.

876
00:49:45,363 --> 00:49:46,745
How do you guys go, or how do you

877
00:49:46,785 --> 00:49:48,968
go about breaking those teams into smaller pods

878
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:51,591
or into smaller teams that could work together?

879
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:55,135
Or do you guys just all work on things individually?

880
00:49:55,901 --> 00:50:01,402
Well, we make sure when we start, we make sure we have some type of very basic leadership

881
00:50:01,422 --> 00:50:06,144
structure where it's like, OK, we know we want to have someone in charge of making sure

882
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:07,564
the characters are getting in the game.

883
00:50:08,024 --> 00:50:11,465
Someone makes sure, you know, we definitely have a lead producer.

884
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:12,465
Everyone knows who that is.

885
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:15,326
And then based on the size of the team, we try to have a few of those.

886
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,307
So for the most part, it's pretty just chaotic.

887
00:50:20,447 --> 00:50:24,608
Everyone figures out where they kind of fit in and where they can slot in.

888
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:25,408
And then the producer.

889
00:50:26,249 --> 00:50:30,592
team on time. I see the guy that's there's someone that's basically going,

890
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:35,737
hey, can we get this by 2 p.m. Yes. Yes, absolutely. That's that's what the producers are basically

891
00:50:35,797 --> 00:50:40,761
saying. Hey guys, here's the whole project. Sure. We can keep throwing shit in,

892
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:45,645
but some of this other stuff is getting cut. So we put it all out there. And then, you know,

893
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:50,068
it's like, cool. You guys want to add a new submarine? Awesome. This other thing is gone.

894
00:50:54,031 --> 00:50:55,092
Hey, so I have a question.

895
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:58,374
One of the kind of points throughout with these

896
00:50:58,394 --> 00:51:01,517
different examples was this sort of danger of paralysis

897
00:51:01,537 --> 00:51:05,280
analysis and the danger of over planning these things and

898
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:07,021
that kind of stuff.

899
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,203
But I wonder, like with the examples you gave, a lot of

900
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:13,666
these are kind of known genres that people know what a twin

901
00:51:13,686 --> 00:51:15,788
stick shooter is and what a 2D platformer is.

902
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,750
How much do you think that helped?

903
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,971
And can you speak to how that benefited the process?

904
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:25,536
Well, I mean a 2D platformer is still a pretty broad thing.

905
00:51:27,257 --> 00:51:29,138
But yeah, it definitely helps.

906
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:31,560
It definitely helps to have some kind of very small

907
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,281
basic constraint so people have something to rally around.

908
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,443
Because if you don't have that, you know,

909
00:51:36,483 --> 00:51:39,004
you'll be spending the very beginning of a game jam

910
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:41,346
or even a game cycle just fighting over,

911
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:42,627
are we making an open world thing?

912
00:51:42,647 --> 00:51:43,988
Are we making a fishing simulator?

913
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:44,888
Like, what are we doing?

914
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,730
So I definitely think having at least the genre.

915
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:51,468
or just some kind of thing in place at the start

916
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,731
is really going to save time.

917
00:51:57,971 --> 00:51:58,432
Well, hello.

918
00:51:58,892 --> 00:52:00,413
I think that was a very interesting talk,

919
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:03,376
and also especially to form the creativity inside the team,

920
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:06,678
and also get to know the people inside the team.

921
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:08,540
I think that was really informative about that.

922
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:12,563
My question was more about, even though you

923
00:52:12,603 --> 00:52:15,926
say that in these jams, planning may not be necessary,

924
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,068
but I think there's also a sense of scope, right?

925
00:52:19,128 --> 00:52:21,190
So how do you get the scope so that you can actually

926
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,492
finish the game by the end of the 48 hours?

927
00:52:25,015 --> 00:52:28,317
We normally don't worry about scope at the start.

928
00:52:29,157 --> 00:52:31,698
We just kind of let people go insane.

929
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:34,980
And then about halfway through, we just start killing things.

930
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:39,002
Just, sure, go ahead, balloon out of control.

931
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:41,363
And then it's going to end up getting rained back in at the end.

932
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:44,504
We actually end up making a ton of content that doesn't get in.

933
00:52:45,345 --> 00:52:46,465
And that's fine.

934
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:47,626
That's just part of the process.

935
00:52:48,626 --> 00:52:49,166
OK, thank you.

936
00:52:52,788 --> 00:52:53,628
Hey, how's it going, Pete?

937
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:54,088
Good to talk.

938
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:54,941
Thank you.

939
00:52:54,961 --> 00:52:56,361
I really appreciated it.

940
00:52:57,082 --> 00:52:58,602
Is it okay to ask a two-parter?

941
00:52:58,742 --> 00:52:59,462
Is that not allowed?

942
00:53:01,363 --> 00:53:02,123
For you, yes.

943
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:02,963
Oh, okay.

944
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:03,283
Thank you.

945
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:04,503
You owe me five bucks for that.

946
00:53:04,743 --> 00:53:04,983
Okay.

947
00:53:05,804 --> 00:53:12,485
Okay, so the first part is, so on that very first Thunderdome, how did you convince or

948
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:19,787
how was management convinced that it'd be okay to take 10 to 20 people out of production

949
00:53:21,267 --> 00:53:23,248
and to work on something that wasn't product-related?

950
00:53:24,063 --> 00:53:26,665
How did Riot justify that cost?

951
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:28,586
You're talking about just Thunderdome in general?

952
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:29,547
Thunderdome in general, yeah.

953
00:53:29,587 --> 00:53:33,129
Like that first one, like obviously over time it proved it had value.

954
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:37,311
But on the first one, how was it just a leap of faith?

955
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:39,553
Well, I wasn't there for the very first Thunderdome.

956
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:41,134
My first Thunderdome was Thunderdome 2.

957
00:53:42,114 --> 00:53:42,955
But I think it...

958
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:46,657
What I believe is it's really about...

959
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:52,335
People are working on a game like League of Legends, which is a gigantic game, and it's

960
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:54,777
very easy, like they're doing the same job over and over.

961
00:53:55,658 --> 00:54:03,224
And so the desire and need for a different creative outlet for the people I think is

962
00:54:03,244 --> 00:54:05,626
just really important, and that was recognized.

963
00:54:06,887 --> 00:54:07,167
Cool.

964
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:09,810
And the second part is...

965
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:16,622
The things that you learned over these five or so Thunderdomes, like all these awesome

966
00:54:16,642 --> 00:54:22,209
learnings that you got, do they scale to a larger team or do they only work in small

967
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:23,211
40-something teams?

968
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:25,794
I think they scale infinitely.

969
00:54:25,814 --> 00:54:27,536
Yeah, I think there's...

970
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,178
Okay.

971
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:29,299
Yeah.

972
00:54:29,879 --> 00:54:30,020
Yeah.

973
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:31,783
Cool. Thanks, Pete.

974
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,846
Sorry, I mean, is there something more specific you're referring to?

975
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:39,888
Well, yeah, it seems as though a lot of times your findings were planning is overrated, right?

976
00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:42,170
Like, and I know that that was a gross generalization you said that.

977
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:48,855
But, um, it seems like you just get a bunch of really creative people that are super passionate and just let it rip.

978
00:54:49,115 --> 00:54:52,457
Like, and they're confident in what they're doing and they all have a shared vision.

979
00:54:53,467 --> 00:54:54,929
I mean, is that all really it takes?

980
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,551
Like, is it...

981
00:54:56,691 --> 00:54:58,013
Well, I guess what I'm asking is,

982
00:54:58,593 --> 00:55:01,156
how do you maintain that alignment of vision

983
00:55:01,457 --> 00:55:03,379
across larger groups of people

984
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:05,481
so that they know exactly what they're making?

985
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,144
Are you talking about for a game jam or for a game product?

986
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,286
I'm talking about a game product.

987
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,009
Like, do these game jam methodologies apply to product?

988
00:55:13,136 --> 00:55:19,278
I think they do to some degree, but a lot of what this is is about doing something absurd.

989
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:22,200
Most of the stuff is not shippable content.

990
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:28,162
It's just doing something fun, something super creative, building confidence for your team,

991
00:55:28,362 --> 00:55:32,724
making sure they're aware that, hey, if I needed to make a model with zero planning

992
00:55:32,764 --> 00:55:34,425
in one day, I totally could do that.

993
00:55:35,706 --> 00:55:41,489
So I don't think a lot of this translates directly to like AAA products,

994
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:47,813
but it's really just about giving teams the opportunity to collaborate with new people,

995
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:52,876
to build confidence in their abilities, to, you know, just have fun.

996
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:54,237
And that's what they take back to their desk.

997
00:55:54,257 --> 00:55:58,179
Like when it's all said and done, they take back the experience, the camaraderie,

998
00:55:58,479 --> 00:56:01,461
the, you know, the ability and confidence in themselves

999
00:56:01,481 --> 00:56:03,542
that they can make something really, really super fast, right?

1000
00:56:03,934 --> 00:56:07,478
Yeah, and it's also just the kind of reboot.

1001
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:09,640
You work on the same thing every single day.

1002
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,645
It's very easy to just kind of get into that mental funk.

1003
00:56:15,466 --> 00:56:18,129
So just taking a couple days and doing something totally

1004
00:56:18,169 --> 00:56:21,272
different can help reset you creatively.

1005
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:22,413
Cool.

1006
00:56:22,573 --> 00:56:22,973
Thanks, Pete.

1007
00:56:23,354 --> 00:56:24,055
Creativitively.

1008
00:56:27,665 --> 00:56:28,105
Hi there, Pete.

1009
00:56:28,286 --> 00:56:28,486
Hello.

1010
00:56:28,506 --> 00:56:29,428
This was a great talk.

1011
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:30,329
Thanks.

1012
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:35,117
I was wondering if there were any specific methods of brainstorming that you used.

1013
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:36,700
Yeah, yeah.

1014
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:40,186
We used a lot of whiteboards, which were awesome.

1015
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,181
I'm not starting a whiteboard company or anything.

1016
00:56:43,261 --> 00:56:49,125
But yeah, we really just, we did a lot of whiteboard brainstorming where we just grabbed

1017
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:53,848
a few people and said, hey, this is going to be the crew that needs to do this one part

1018
00:56:53,888 --> 00:56:54,188
of this.

1019
00:56:55,068 --> 00:56:56,489
Let's sit down and talk about what we want to do.

1020
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,130
And all right, how much time do we have?

1021
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:58,530
And we just.

1022
00:56:58,891 --> 00:57:02,135
It's just scribble it all out, and then we put names on everything.

1023
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:03,236
That's the most important thing.

1024
00:57:03,656 --> 00:57:08,983
Put names to every task, or that one floating task with no name on it is gonna be floating

1025
00:57:09,063 --> 00:57:09,804
and never get done.

1026
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:12,928
So yeah, it's just really writing things down.

1027
00:57:12,948 --> 00:57:14,009
Awesome.

1028
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:14,390
Thank you.

1029
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:17,981
Oh, hey, Pete.

1030
00:57:18,121 --> 00:57:18,841
Oh, man, it's loud.

1031
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:20,102
It's sick talk.

1032
00:57:20,283 --> 00:57:21,604
Also great Aurelia teaser.

1033
00:57:21,624 --> 00:57:21,944
I saw that.

1034
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:22,524
That was neat.

1035
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:26,587
So I'm actually a student, and I participated in Global Game Jam

1036
00:57:26,607 --> 00:57:28,288
myself, and a few other Itch Jams.

1037
00:57:28,429 --> 00:57:31,391
So I'm wondering, what would you say some of the benefits

1038
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:33,813
of doing them when you're still kind of trying

1039
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,474
to get your foot in the door, compared

1040
00:57:35,514 --> 00:57:36,755
to when you're in a company?

1041
00:57:37,175 --> 00:57:38,956
What kind of, like, do you think there's

1042
00:57:38,996 --> 00:57:40,918
a huge benefit from maybe starting these projects

1043
00:57:40,938 --> 00:57:44,581
and then expanding them possibly into bigger projects

1044
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,962
that you can show off for your own work?

1045
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:52,552
I guess what I'm saying is when you're still learning and you kind of get together with

1046
00:57:52,592 --> 00:57:56,654
a bunch of people that are still learning compared to when all of you are already professionals,

1047
00:57:57,094 --> 00:58:02,876
what's some of the benefits of that compared to when you're already out there compared

1048
00:58:02,956 --> 00:58:05,157
to when you're still trying to squeeze your way through the door?

1049
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:08,325
Oh, there's huge benefits for students doing game jams.

1050
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:11,466
One of the biggest problems I see with students regularly

1051
00:58:11,486 --> 00:58:14,067
is they don't know how to collaborate.

1052
00:58:14,627 --> 00:58:17,628
They don't work within each other.

1053
00:58:17,788 --> 00:58:20,869
And they also scope out of control.

1054
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:23,870
I've seen so many student projects that are like,

1055
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,570
I'm a student.

1056
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,310
I'm making an MMO by myself.

1057
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,351
I'm like, what are you doing?

1058
00:58:28,311 --> 00:58:34,335
So that constraint of a couple days is absolutely fantastic.

1059
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:37,317
And it'll ensure you're collaborating

1060
00:58:37,397 --> 00:58:38,438
and you're getting something done.

1061
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,880
So you'll learn, as a student,

1062
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,581
learning time management is fantastic.

1063
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:46,043
I don't think I've ever hired someone out of school

1064
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:48,184
who has any understanding of time management.

1065
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:50,406
So please do that.

1066
00:58:51,687 --> 00:58:53,008
Yeah, all right, thank you very much.

1067
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:56,690
You know what I'm talking about.

1068
00:58:57,858 --> 00:58:59,619
Hey, great talk.

1069
00:58:59,779 --> 00:59:02,900
I was wondering how do you motivate people for game jams

1070
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,521
or stuff like this?

1071
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:06,702
You know, it's quite common in the video games industry

1072
00:59:06,722 --> 00:59:09,563
that people lose motivation to try new things

1073
00:59:09,703 --> 00:59:11,484
or get out of their comfort zone.

1074
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:14,185
And they tend to be very hard to motivate.

1075
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:18,887
And that is a great opportunity to get people to do new stuff.

1076
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:22,348
And I was wondering if you had any advice to give

1077
00:59:22,468 --> 00:59:24,189
or any opinion on that.

1078
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:30,706
Absolutely. I mean, I think the best motivation is leading by example.

1079
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:35,089
You know, if you're a leader of a crew and you suggest doing a game jam

1080
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:38,070
and they're like, we don't really want to, do it yourself.

1081
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:42,893
Join another crew and then show, bring it back to work.

1082
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:46,854
Say, hey, this is what we made. This was great. This is what I learned.

1083
00:59:47,595 --> 00:59:49,256
Do a presentation about it. Talk about it.

1084
00:59:49,376 --> 00:59:51,717
Say, look at all the benefits that come from this.

1085
00:59:52,418 --> 00:59:57,234
So I just think leading by example is the ultimate motivator.
