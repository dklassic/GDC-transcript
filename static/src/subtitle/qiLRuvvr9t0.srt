1
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:07,427
So we're going to start.

2
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:11,530
My name is Camden Stoddard of Double Fine Productions.

3
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:16,814
And I'm David Earl of David Earl Productions and we're the sound and music team of Headlander.

4
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:19,476
Brought to you by Double Fine and Adult Swim.

5
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:24,399
So we just wanted to show you a little bit of Headlander in action to start so you get

6
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:26,741
a chance to see it in full game mode.

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,568
The tranquility of the stars is yours, citizen.

8
00:00:55,588 --> 00:01:04,075
You have arrived at the pleasure point, would you like to go in?

9
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:29,671
NEVER TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

10
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:43,305
Throw your keys, into the person who will use them

11
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:44,026
I AM DYING

12
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:46,208
it's not

13
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:02,127
All right.

14
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,267
So what is Headlander?

15
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:10,148
Headlander is a retro-futuristic side-scrolling action-adventure game.

16
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:14,029
It's set in a world inspired by 1970s science fiction.

17
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,450
It's a world of automation in which all of humanity has transferred their minds into

18
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,532
robotic imposter bodies, and it's a utopia gone wrong, which is run by a deranged computer.

19
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,565
Headlander was inspired by the science fiction movies and media of the 70s.

20
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:33,310
And when I say that, we're not talking about Star Wars.

21
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:38,616
We're talking about the more experimental and fringe movies of the 70s, movies like

22
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:44,384
The Black Hole, Silent Running, Logan's Run, and Dark Star, among others.

23
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,273
It takes a long time for those prompts.

24
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:51,415
These movies had some things in common.

25
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:53,997
They were experimental with heavy themes,

26
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,719
a bit of dark humor, and most importantly,

27
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,581
they were not a hero's journey.

28
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:01,423
Another common theme in all of the science fiction

29
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:03,865
of the 70s was that many of the protagonists

30
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:04,705
were full of doubt.

31
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,488
The character would start out with a purpose in life

32
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:11,490
and solid conviction, which is then disrupted

33
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,992
by a shattering doubt as the truth of the system

34
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:15,713
that they're involved in is revealed.

35
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:20,349
This gives an unparalleled sense of discovery in these stories.

36
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,395
What we are talking about today, the approach of music and sound for Headlander,

37
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:28,660
was our attempt to mirror the approach of the filmmakers of 70s sci-fi.

38
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:35,536
Now, we aren't knocking Star Wars, even though we just ran a line through the Death Star.

39
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:39,897
We love that movie and many of the movies and media following it.

40
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:44,318
We're just emphasizing that our influences for this film are firmly rooted in the weird

41
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:48,338
and experimental aesthetic of 70s dystopian sci-fi.

42
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:54,180
One of the most experimental aspects of Headlander is its core mechanic.

43
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,636
You're a human head in a life-sustaining flying helmet that can detach and attach to other

44
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:06,261
bodies, machines and vehicles. And when we asked about the inspiration for this crazy

45
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:11,046
idea, we were able to get this little clip from Lee Petty, who was the creative lead

46
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:13,288
for the, and he had this story to tell us.

47
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:18,810
So sometimes inspiration comes from really strange places.

48
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,692
And I remember thinking about a car accident, or a near car

49
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:24,293
accident I was almost in once.

50
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,954
And my girlfriend at the time was driving.

51
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:30,596
And we were going along the freeway, and the car suddenly

52
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:35,278
braked, and she pulled the wheel really strong to the side.

53
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:38,540
And I just remember the whole car skidding sideways,

54
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,241
like all the way across in a fast lane,

55
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,223
all the way across all those lanes of traffic.

56
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:45,445
And I remember that sensation that a lot of people

57
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,087
have in those sort of tense situations

58
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,208
where time seems to slow down.

59
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:52,891
I remember reaching my hand over there and grabbing the wheel

60
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,092
and trying to straighten the car out

61
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:56,254
because we were heading right off the road into a ditch.

62
00:04:57,295 --> 00:05:00,137
And we corrected right at the last moment.

63
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:02,338
It didn't go into the ditch as the car stopped.

64
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,379
And I remember.

65
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:07,744
Yeah, that feeling of weightlessness, almost like I was in zero-g.

66
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:11,888
And there was that sensation that, like, maybe my head was accelerating or blasting off.

67
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:17,117
And I remember remembering that when thinking about this game for some reason.

68
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:21,159
And then the other piece of the puzzle that actually happened at that same time was she

69
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,239
had a crystal hanging from her reading mirror.

70
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:29,701
And I remember her reaching up and thanking the crystal for saving us, right, when of

71
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,662
course it was back that I grabbed the wheel.

72
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:36,304
But there was also something about the idea of a crystal, this like faith in this strange

73
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:40,845
inanimate object or this artifice that was somehow connected to that for me.

74
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:43,786
And we have crystal power in the game, so maybe that's...

75
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:53,170
So, for our creative brief, we're told that Headlander was going to be 70s sci-fi exploration

76
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,091
of a story that's not a hero's journey.

77
00:05:56,671 --> 00:06:00,153
The player becomes less sure of themselves as the game progresses.

78
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:03,814
And the game is, like, really personal in origin.

79
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:08,076
In fact, according to Lee, Headlander is an exploration of identity.

80
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:09,336
In summation...

81
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:12,366
Really weird, unusual game.

82
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,468
So as lead sound designer working within these

83
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:18,288
parameters, I had many challenges.

84
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:21,469
Today I wanted to focus on just three of the biggest and

85
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,669
how I approached them and some of the solutions

86
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:24,349
I came up with.

87
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,571
These challenges were dialogue profiles for multiple

88
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:32,732
characters, evoking the memory of 70s sound design, and then

89
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,912
the relationship of the sound design and the music.

90
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:40,757
In Headlander, you interact with over 25 different characters, and they are all robots.

91
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:47,460
When 25 different robot characters, and sometimes all of them are on the screen chattering about,

92
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,320
how do you separate their voices?

93
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:53,282
How can you tell them apart, especially if gameplay relies on it?

94
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:57,564
To start, I broke the characters of Headlander into groups.

95
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:02,977
The differences between the groups were determined on a spectrum of absolute machine to almost

96
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:03,337
human.

97
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:06,701
Shepherds are weaponized and fully mechanical.

98
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:11,105
Citizens are robotic with human personalities, but they've been compromised.

99
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:13,027
It's like they're in a permanent daze.

100
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,730
Rebels are like citizens.

101
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,093
They have robotic bodies, but are fully alert and cognizant.

102
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,316
Global applies to only a few characters.

103
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:27,144
The deranged computer that runs the whole world, the security system that speaks to

104
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:31,167
the player through the door, and then a benefactor character that speaks to the player through

105
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:31,587
the helmet.

106
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,629
Yeah, the door is a character in this game.

107
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:34,870
Yes, a very rude one.

108
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:39,993
My solutions to creating unique vocal profiles for these character groups fell mainly into

109
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:43,375
three techniques, processing, editing, and spatial placement.

110
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:49,179
For the Shepherds, I fully vocoded the dialogue using an EMS 5000 vocoder plugin.

111
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,355
And the reason I chose this specific vocoder plugin is because out of all the others that

112
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,039
I tested, like the Orange, the Mouth, the Evoke 20, the EMS came the closest to the

113
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,441
original 70s vocoder robot sound that I was looking for.

114
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:09,666
This is because it's modeled on the original hardware very similar to the one that created

115
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:15,210
the iconic voices of the Cylons from the original Battlestar Galactica.

116
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:19,253
I don't think any voice of the 70s could be more iconic than the Cylons.

117
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:22,973
Here's some examples of some of the shepherds.

118
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:26,154
I have a dry example and then vocoded wet.

119
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:31,255
Citizens are also adviced that prolonged eye contact with shepherds will result in

120
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:32,216
immediate termination.

121
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:53,302
Citizens are also advised that prolonged eye contact with Shepard will result in immediate termination.

122
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:54,303
I love that plugin.

123
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:59,154
Cry not upon, the destruction is to be expected.

124
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:00,935
There's a little explanation here.

125
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:05,738
So there's a certain part of the game that's based on chess and all the characters were

126
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,540
speaking Elizabethan, like Shakespearean lines.

127
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,002
So it got very difficult processing Shakespeare through a vocoder.

128
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:17,144
Yeah, trying to make Shakespeare happen when they sound like a robot.

129
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:17,845
Or a silent.

130
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:21,627
Cry not upon, the destruction is to be expected.

131
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:23,327
End of line.

132
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:23,648
Yes.

133
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:28,453
I lit a car, lit a car, a castle, a floor.

134
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:33,675
I lit a castle, a floor.

135
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,796
All functions transferred to primary unit.

136
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:42,718
In this case, this was a really specific hunter-shepherd.

137
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,578
It was almost insect-like.

138
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:49,480
So we asked the actress to enunciate all of her S's and really, really hard pronounce them.

139
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,640
And we got this result.

140
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:52,321
Perfection.

141
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,503
Sleep mode activate.

142
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:06,129
Sleep mode activate.

143
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:07,249
Very fun.

144
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:12,293
For the Citizens and Rebels, my approach was slightly different,

145
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:14,775
because I wanted some of the humanity to poke through.

146
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,597
Citizens and Rebels are closely related.

147
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:21,300
In the game, the citizens are being controlled by a behavioral dampening circuit.

148
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:24,211
They're kind of out of it, like they're in a trance.

149
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:26,953
The rebels, on the other hand, are fully aware,

150
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,855
since they have removed that circuit.

151
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:31,438
The removal had consequences, though,

152
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,019
in the form of speech impediment,

153
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:35,682
robotic stutter, if you will.

154
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,605
The process tones of both these characters

155
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:39,566
are actually the same.

156
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,988
It was basically a heavy chorusing effect.

157
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,690
But it occurred to me the best way

158
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,512
to show the difference between these characters

159
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:46,373
would be in the editing.

160
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:51,674
For Citizens, I chose to show the loss of their humanity by editing out the breaths

161
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:54,140
of the voice actors that were portraying the citizens.

162
00:10:55,142 --> 00:11:00,245
Now, any good dialogue editor will tell you that keeping the breaths in are good for motion,

163
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:03,406
for showing how the character is feeling.

164
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:08,568
But it was this kind of vaguely disturbing feel that I was going for, so I took them

165
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:08,949
all out.

166
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:13,391
The rebels, on the other hand, I kept their breaths in to show that they had regained

167
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:17,613
some of their humanity, but they also had a digital stutter due to the fact that they

168
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:20,134
had slightly damaged themselves when removing their circuit.

169
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:24,732
This also had the benefit of making them sound like they were struggling, which added to

170
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:25,873
their story arc in the game.

171
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:31,197
Now I gave the rebels a stutter roughly every five lines, and I had to do it manually.

172
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:36,621
So as you can imagine, this was a little bit more than trimming tops and tails, and in

173
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:40,304
all it added another two to three months of extra dialogue editing.

174
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:42,606
And here's some examples.

175
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:46,188
It reminds me that it's what's inside that counts.

176
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,834
It reminds me that it's what's inside that counts.

177
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:54,055
Headlander!

178
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:56,815
They're also very 70s.

179
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,316
Artemis 11, signing out.

180
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:03,537
Artemis 11, signing out.

181
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,438
We're headed to the Luna Citadel soon.

182
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:09,378
I hope you'll be with us.

183
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:12,439
We're headed to the Luna Citadel soon.

184
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,319
I hope you'll be with us.

185
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:18,185
You know what I'm talking about, Michael.

186
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:24,449
For the next set of characters, they needed to sound like they were coming from everywhere.

187
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:28,571
These voices were actually coming out of the world around the player, including the

188
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:29,892
player's helmet on occasion.

189
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:34,215
This differs greatly from the robots that are just walking around in the environment.

190
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,416
These characters are the environment.

191
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:40,378
Every room, every ship, every vehicle had these omnipresent characters.

192
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:45,492
On occasion these characters would morph from 3D to 2D depending on the game state.

193
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:50,216
In order to give these characters the kind of weight and power that they possess, I used

194
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,738
heavy, heavy compression with a lot of drive and phasing techniques.

195
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,362
When I'm talking about these characters and how powerful they are, I literally mean they

196
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,444
are filled with electricity and energy.

197
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:03,286
It's like the whole world is talking to you when they speak.

198
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,708
Here's some examples.

199
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,510
Incorrect color, no admittance.

200
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,571
This is the rude door.

201
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:10,512
Yeah, that's the door.

202
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:13,327
Incorrect color, no admittance.

203
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:17,150
Take your little costume and go play somewhere else.

204
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,873
Take your little costume and go play somewhere else.

205
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,677
Lockdown is over. Let the game continue!

206
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,119
This is the queen in the chess world, very Eastern European.

207
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,543
Lockdown is over. Let the game continue!

208
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:55,280
For this character, the actor was very, very good, but he kind of still felt like a little

209
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,442
bit of an old man, so added a lot of weight through him through compression and sub.

210
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,003
Here's what he sounds like dry.

211
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:07,025
It's time for a reminder on the importance of waste management from your friendly neighborhood

212
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,186
refuse captain Electrosucksz4.

213
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:16,428
It's time for a reminder on the importance of waste management from your friendly neighborhood.

214
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,041
So, what is sound design from the 70s if not Star Wars inspired sound design?

215
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:34,302
When I was studying sound design for Headlander, the movies they studied like Dark Star and

216
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:39,623
Westworld and Logan's Run actually had pretty lackluster sound design.

217
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:41,364
I wasn't really that impressed.

218
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:46,385
But I was surprised that my memories of these movies did not match up to the reality of

219
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:48,285
how they sounded when I saw them later.

220
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:52,065
And I actually had a similar reaction recently to 8-bit music.

221
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:54,066
I have all kinds of reactions to 8-bit music.

222
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:54,847
That's another story.

223
00:14:55,627 --> 00:15:00,389
I did appreciate how the sound designers of these movies worked within their constraints

224
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:01,849
and the approach they took.

225
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,791
I noticed that the sound design was not taking wildly different sounds and blending them

226
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:08,112
together to get a bigger sound.

227
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:14,777
If there was to be something like an engine, it would be an amalgam of engines, not an

228
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:18,705
elephant roar or dry ice on a cymbal or a ball-peen hammer hitting a cable.

229
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:24,064
Sound designers on these movies would take a single source or only a couple and then

230
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:30,007
process these few sources with very strange delays, hyper pitch shifting and massive compression.

231
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:35,130
In the black hole, the engines of the ship don't sound like new technology or particularly

232
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,652
futuristic, they just sound really, really big.

233
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:43,495
The transport in Westworld, which is a sort of futuristic hydrofoil, just sounds really,

234
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:44,136
really loud.

235
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,090
My favorite is the guns in Logan's run.

236
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:51,872
It's like the sound designer was more concerned with the energy being output by the weapon

237
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:55,774
rather than being concerned with how the weapon was creating the energy.

238
00:15:56,934 --> 00:16:00,875
Now this all changed radically after Star Wars where folks like Ben Burtt would open

239
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,556
the door to layered sound design.

240
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:08,638
For Headlander though, I was interested in pre-Burtt sound design where constraints played

241
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:09,679
more of a role in the results.

242
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
A lot of the sounds of 70s sci-fi were more mechanical.

243
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,957
Later on, sounds of robotics and chips and doors and other elements would be based on

244
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:22,299
hydraulics and other more efficient futuristic things.

245
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:26,962
But I wanted to approach things in Headlander like they were all mechanical in nature, even

246
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:27,642
the computers.

247
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:32,986
And I received this creative direction from Lee who said in this world, in Headlander's

248
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:35,127
world, digital was never invented.

249
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:38,089
Here are some of the examples that I did.

250
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,550
Just maxed.

251
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,911
This is feedback being played through an 8-track player's speaker.

252
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:19,253
It had a really weird property.

253
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,237
That 8-track was crazy.

254
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,258
Tape delay for days.

255
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:56,764
This is actually the inner workings of a clock.

256
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:07,554
So the other part of 70s sound design that I noticed was the use of synthesis.

257
00:18:14,122 --> 00:18:19,267
The appearance of a synthesizer in early 70s cinema especially was not blended in with

258
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:19,848
other sounds.

259
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:25,373
It was usually a cue for the listener denoting a special event, like an evil robot arriving,

260
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:28,657
a large ship taking off, or teleportation.

261
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:32,821
I realized my sound design and use of synthesizers in Headlander would need to be particularly

262
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,284
mindful of the soundtrack, which Dave was making, and it was wonderful.

263
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:39,568
I also noticed something about the story arc.

264
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:44,191
I realized over the course of the game, the separation of music and sound design needed

265
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:45,572
to become less and less obvious.

266
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:51,296
As the character becomes more and more confused, and the situation becomes more unhinged, the

267
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:52,997
sound and the music needed to blur.

268
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:57,200
This would enhance the effect of being uncomfortable and unsure for the player.

269
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,463
And Dave and I were both given instructions for the end of the game to be very, very psychedelic,

270
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:05,185
and as Lee put it, to take the gloves off.

271
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:11,161
Here are some examples of our psychedelic sound design blurring into music.

272
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:24,172
This was all made by the voices of people who work at Double Fine, by the way.

273
00:19:42,107 --> 00:19:45,011
This next example is made entirely out of guitar feedback.

274
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,279
Ahem.

275
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:39,795
So as you can see, it had to get very unhinged.

276
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:43,537
And I would like to now turn it over to Dave and the

277
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:46,058
wonderful soundtrack and synthesis work that he did.

278
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,379
Aw, thanks, man.

279
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:50,160
I mean, it's amazing to work on a game where it's only you

280
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,881
and one other person making all of the sound.

281
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:55,002
Like, all of the sound.

282
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,743
It makes it a very personal thing.

283
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:00,705
So I started working on the music for Headlander in 2013

284
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:04,146
when Lee Petty was doing Amnesia Fortnight, which is

285
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:04,666
this sort of.

286
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,926
pitch that everybody in the company is pitching a game.

287
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:10,647
And so I was able to work on it.

288
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,969
And the original aesthetic for the game was to be sort of

289
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,670
John Barry in space.

290
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,193
So John Barry does like the James Bond scores.

291
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,174
And the original black hole was John Barry.

292
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:24,716
And when Adult Swim swooped in, the aesthetic changed.

293
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,077
They shoved it into the 70s.

294
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,560
And that made me pretty happy.

295
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:36,584
The new idea was to draw upon the electronic music of the 70s and I was beaming ear to

296
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:42,151
ear because as a kid I was absolutely crazy about electronic music.

297
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:46,857
I was really entranced with the worlds of Vangelis and Wendy Carlos and Jean-Michel

298
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:49,260
Jarre and Izao Tomita and Tangerine Dream.

299
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,381
He knows what I'm talking about.

300
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:53,767
And the idea that I could create music from my childhood,

301
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:56,551
like something that was just going to be this pure nostalgia fest,

302
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,435
had me really excited.

303
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:01,380
But there were some challenges, and I just wanted to explore

304
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:04,285
three of the sort of things that I had to deal with.

305
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:10,075
As Camden said before, the game was taking place in a world that existed without the

306
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:10,636
microchip.

307
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,719
And it's also noted that it had a bunch of robots instead of humans.

308
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,422
And even the protagonist didn't have lungs.

309
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:21,765
So it was going to make things kind of interesting.

310
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:26,489
From the very beginning, I was told that the score for Headlander needed to sound as synthetic

311
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:28,351
as the world that it was set in.

312
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:32,854
This meant that I was going to find myself some analog synths.

313
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,063
Yeah, there's some great software out there. But my goal was to get knobs and sliders and a

314
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:49,127
real tactile sort of writing process. There wasn't much in the 70s as far as like digital

315
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:53,769
recording was concerned, not sort of mass produced. So music was recorded to tape. So I'm

316
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:58,291
like, ah, I got to get my hand on some tape. Oh, it'll be great. Tape. So, you know, I'll talk a

317
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,192
little bit about that.

318
00:23:01,324 --> 00:23:06,187
Science fiction of the 70s also had the kind of classic themes that were expected of film scoring.

319
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:14,794
They were still kind of throwbacks to the 50s and 60s and there were still those kind of expectations placed on the composers, just with a different palette.

320
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:22,559
And I knew I was going to need to create some themes for Headlander, but I didn't want to get all John Williams, you know, like leitmotifs and like opera.

321
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,961
You know, it was going to be much more simple.

322
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:28,323
And I knew that I needed to make the score sound really personal.

323
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:32,779
Sometimes cheesy and definitely sentimental.

324
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:39,425
The soundtracks that inspired Headlander sometimes conveyed an almost naive sense of

325
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:40,886
the future.

326
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:46,471
You could hear the composers tinkering around with synthesizers.

327
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:51,756
They were trying to pull emotions out of synthesizers and sort of failing.

328
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:56,019
So it was a lot of fun to listen to these composers experimenting with what they considered

329
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:56,980
new technology.

330
00:23:57,376 --> 00:24:00,623
and integrate it in with their composer tendencies.

331
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:03,970
So I wanted to try and capture that as well,

332
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,894
that kind of sense of experimentation,

333
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:08,580
that naive, sort of childlike sense of experimentation.

334
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:15,457
So I already had an SH-101 by Roland and I had a Korg Monotron.

335
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:19,301
The Monotron is this big and it's like fifty bucks and it's awesome.

336
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:21,644
Every sound designer and composer should have one.

337
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:24,127
And then the Dave Smith Prophet 8.

338
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,251
And I was like, oh, you know, I could do the whole score on these three synths.

339
00:24:28,612 --> 00:24:29,533
Ha ha ha ha ha.

340
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:31,415
Yeah, that wasn't going to happen.

341
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:40,289
So I ended up leaning on, I did cheat a little bit, and I leaned on Monarch by NI, and a whole bunch of reactor ensembles.

342
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:45,233
Like I have a really amazing Selina string ensemble in Reactor that I really enjoyed a lot.

343
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:52,499
And then of course I had a sampled Buchla, System 100 Buchla that helped a lot.

344
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,483
So I'd originally envisioned writing all the music at home.

345
00:24:57,984 --> 00:25:01,788
And then going into the synth museum in Emeryville. Because the synth museum in Emeryville has

346
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:09,676
everything. They have the Yamaha CS80. I mean they have all these like really rare analog

347
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:14,500
synths. And if you ever want to go and just play with analog synths, that's the place to go.

348
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,242
It's an amazing, amazing joint.

349
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:21,585
They're all taken care of and ready to record and everything. But after a couple of days of

350
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,569
recording with my sense, I knew I was going to have to get sense in my studio because the

351
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:31,612
immediate gratification of having the sense right there, I could wake up, walk in my studio

352
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:36,136
and just go for it, well, it kind of infected me with the sickness.

353
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:41,605
So Jeff Cross is a friend of mine who works over at Apple, and he's a great electronic

354
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,046
musician.

355
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:44,787
And I remembered his collection of analog synths.

356
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:48,388
I went over to his house, and we were hanging out, and I was drooling all over them.

357
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:54,990
So I drove a van to his house, and I decided to ask him, after I drove the van to his house,

358
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:58,532
if I could borrow his synths.

359
00:25:59,192 --> 00:25:59,772
And he agreed.

360
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:03,153
So I immediately loaded them in the van before he could change his mind.

361
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:11,103
We ended up with a Yamaha CS15, we had a Moog Prodigy and an ARP Odyssey and the

362
00:26:11,223 --> 00:26:16,527
original Korg MS-20 and a lot of the soundtrack was written on these devices.

363
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:24,213
So I'm eternally grateful to Jeff but I wasn't done there. So another friend of

364
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:28,236
mine, Frank Garvey, I remembered he had this huge collection of synths and I'd call

365
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:31,779
him up and I'm like, hey Frank, you know those synths? Yeah.

366
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:39,586
Can I borrow them? Well if you get them out of Hawk. They were all sitting in a pawn shop off

367
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:43,788
of 6th Street here in San Francisco. If you know 6th Street in San Francisco, not a great

368
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:51,953
area. So that said, Candidate and I made a deal and we bailed them out, rescued them. That

369
00:26:51,973 --> 00:27:00,398
included the Moog Voyager XL. We had a Dave Smith mono and poly evolver. And we had a

370
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:11,420
Another ARP Odyssey. And then of course I had all of my synths. So as you can see, got a lot of

371
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:18,123
synths going on in this score. It was kind of ridiculous. And one of the things that was

372
00:27:18,143 --> 00:27:22,185
important about this was just to realize that I have this community of people that I've put a

373
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:26,907
lot of energy and time into and I try to really help everybody I possibly can. Anybody who

374
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:28,487
knows me knows that I will like...

375
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:33,334
give you whatever I can technically to help you out. And it came back. And that was just

376
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:39,335
really nice to feel that reciprocity, which was really, really cool. So on my first

377
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:47,078
date, I mean night, with the Moog Voyager XL, I ran it through Valhalla DSP's Shimmer

378
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:53,879
Reverb and it was just a total revelation. I mean, it just changed everything. And I just

379
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,140
hit record and started going with it and ended up with stuff like this.

380
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:15,973
It's quite a night.

381
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:17,894
Oh man, it was a hell of a night.

382
00:28:33,935 --> 00:28:38,641
If you have any questions or other problems, please post them in the comments.

383
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:42,526
If you have any questions or other problems, please post them in the comments.

384
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,489
I will be happy to help.

385
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:45,410
I will be happy to help.

386
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,539
Look, people walking now, they're like, what the hell is going on?

387
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:58,972
So all of that that you just heard are excerpts from a single improvisation.

388
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:04,411
An unbroken improvisation that went on for about seven and a half minutes and it's on

389
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:05,913
the Headlander soundtrack.

390
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,074
It's called Methuselah's Game.

391
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:12,158
And there's no editing, there's no like, no quantize, no nothing.

392
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:16,141
It's just, it's just a synth and a reverb and that's it.

393
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:24,003
So the creative direction for the game is also to have this kind of polished and slick

394
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:29,245
sound, but have some cracks in the veneer showing the decrepit and broken innards of

395
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:31,426
a world that was being held together with spit and glue.

396
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:37,248
So I really thought that using tape was going to help me get there.

397
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,088
And I was really excited about it.

398
00:30:39,728 --> 00:30:41,689
I remember recording on tape, barely.

399
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:44,536
And I was like, OK, we're going to saturate the tape,

400
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:46,358
and we're going to get all this tapey goodness and all

401
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:47,159
this great stuff.

402
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,462
And there's going to be this dirt and wow and flutter and

403
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:51,363
all this cool stuff.

404
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:55,547
I even had a wire recorder set up, and I had cassette players

405
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:56,428
and all this stuff.

406
00:30:57,209 --> 00:31:00,472
And in the course of using it, I remembered something.

407
00:31:04,236 --> 00:31:04,837
I hate tape.

408
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,878
I hate it. I hate almost everything about it.

409
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:13,281
And I just, my nostalgia took me over. You know, I don't like loading tape machines.

410
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:16,363
I don't like waiting for the transport. I don't like maintaining the machines.

411
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,384
There's some engineer out there with like a gun.

412
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:24,848
But, you know, some of the tracks on the soundtrack ended up staying that have the

413
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:27,929
layback from tape. But honestly, it was such a pain to work with.

414
00:31:30,379 --> 00:31:32,183
It was an important revelation for me.

415
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:34,950
Camden was talking earlier about how he had watched these

416
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:38,138
movies from the 70s and was like, you know, sound design

417
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:39,241
is not really great.

418
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,091
And I had a similar reaction when I was using tape.

419
00:31:43,471 --> 00:31:46,192
So it was kind of important, because I

420
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:47,932
remembered using tape.

421
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,332
I remember hitting the view meters.

422
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:52,573
I remember trying to get it as loud as possible, and

423
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,173
saturating tape.

424
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:56,514
I remember doing that.

425
00:31:57,294 --> 00:31:58,034
And it was fun.

426
00:31:58,234 --> 00:31:59,214
My memories were fun.

427
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,175
But when I actually started doing it again, I was like,

428
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:01,915
this is a pain.

429
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:04,395
So I went back, and I started listening to old soundtracks

430
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:06,116
and watching old commercials.

431
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:13,241
I even checked out the really crappy color palette of the 70s where everything is beige and

432
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:21,628
brown and yellow and orange. Even the wood trimmed technology. You would have this really

433
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:27,093
awesome piece of tech or synth and it had wood on it. Which makes me laugh when you open

434
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:31,416
garage band it has wood paneling on the sides. So, you know, I'm not a big fan of the

435
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:35,321
Going through all this stuff, I realized that I had to put some ugly in the score.

436
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,023
You know, I needed some stuff that was just ugly and gross, like the 70s were,

437
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:44,547
to properly show, you know, this fabricated world that this computer was trying to think up.

438
00:32:45,227 --> 00:32:49,089
You know, all the way down to like Adobe and lapels.

439
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:57,074
So tape reminded me of all that, and that was kind of important to go through that whole series of hating tape,

440
00:32:57,134 --> 00:32:59,896
but I did also find out that I love tape emulation.

441
00:33:00,716 --> 00:33:00,876
So...

442
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:06,311
I ended up leaning a lot on UAD for their Studer 800 and

443
00:33:06,371 --> 00:33:10,295
Roland Space Echo and EP34 tape delay.

444
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:15,940
McDSP, I used their AC201 and 101, which do a really good

445
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,763
job of emulating that sort of hardware.

446
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:22,066
I also used Wave's Eddie Kramer tape.

447
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:24,267
And that stuff worked really well.

448
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:25,767
It gave me concise control.

449
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:28,048
My loops would come out correct.

450
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:29,849
I could play something back twice, and it

451
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:30,829
would sound the same.

452
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,990
It was a lot of fun to use that stuff.

453
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,712
And I also used console emulation from Steve Slate,

454
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:43,174
which helped me not only get these emulations of the sort

455
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:45,455
of non-linear sounds of these.

456
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:52,684
analog channels across my mix, but I could also sum as well, which worked out pretty well.

457
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:58,531
Now, one of the funniest things and most memorable things about Headlander when we were talking

458
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:00,852
about the score was no drums for you.

459
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,834
In the first meeting, Lee was pretty open about, you know, ideas and things about the

460
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:10,136
score and like where we were going to go with it, but then out of the blue he goes, oh,

461
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:11,096
by the way, I don't want drums.

462
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:11,956
I hate drums.

463
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:12,817
I don't want them at all.

464
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,197
No drums anywhere.

465
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:14,938
I couldn't believe it.

466
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:19,420
Yeah, I mean, my eye was twitching and I'm like, you know, as you can imagine, it's a

467
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,260
huge limitation.

468
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,125
It's a pretty big deal because drums do so much. They drive the soundtrack, they add drama,

469
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:31,749
they can even transport you to a decade of choice if you're using a drum kit. I was looking

470
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:37,234
forward to that, the 70s thuddy dead drum kit, like Fleetwood Mac or something. I was looking

471
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:42,498
forward to that kind of thing and maybe going towards Led Zeppelin or something. No. Nope.

472
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:46,881
No drums for you. So I'm like, well, what am I going to do? I'm going to have to drive

473
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:50,024
things along. So I ended up using sequencers and arpeggiators.

474
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:54,894
And using more of synthesis to try and drive things.

475
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:58,377
Some of my synths, like the SH-101 that I brought with me,

476
00:34:58,878 --> 00:35:01,220
have an onboard sequencer and an onboard arpeggiator.

477
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,344
And I was able to use those and help use that to drive the

478
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:07,446
score and create motion.

479
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:11,269
One of the things that's funny about these old sequencers,

480
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:13,792
the simple sequencers, is that they go beat to beat.

481
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:16,374
It's like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

482
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:20,610
So I came up with this solution of taking, you know, they take

483
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:25,117
control voltage, right? It's not MIDI. It's like you're literally

484
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:29,363
taking a guitar cable and going click and sending voltage to

485
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:30,204
make it do something.

486
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:34,580
And the clock on here basically is looking for control voltage to pulse.

487
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,124
So what I did is I took a cable out of my audio interface and in Logic I have this drum

488
00:35:42,164 --> 00:35:46,246
machine playing a really, really, really loud stick clack.

489
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:52,989
And I would be able to use the sequencer within UltraBeat to program these kind of disjointed

490
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:53,589
patterns.

491
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,412
So the clock in here that was coming in was no longer this steady thing.

492
00:35:58,692 --> 00:35:58,992
It would be...

493
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:03,519
And it worked really well.

494
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:05,099
It was actually really cool.

495
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,981
I also used the Moog Voyager XL's MIDI beat clock to CV

496
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:13,383
control as well to help facilitate that.

497
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:14,363
It worked out really well.

498
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:17,044
So what I wanted to do is just show you a

499
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,325
little bit about my baby.

500
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,266
This is the SH-101 that you see on screen.

501
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,987
It's the same as the one I have, except it doesn't have

502
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:24,587
that awesome.

503
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:27,728
I thought about getting the handle just for this talking

504
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:29,469
engagement, and I was going to get the little headset mic

505
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:31,790
and start zapping and rogering all over the place.

506
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:31,950
But.

507
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:39,519
So what we have is we have a modulator, VCO, you know,

508
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,421
that's an oscillator, we've got a mixer for all these different waves,

509
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:45,102
and we've got a filter and an envelope.

510
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:47,583
Monophonic, I can play one note at a time.

511
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:49,283
But what's beautiful is the note sounds...

512
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:58,367
For a little tiny synthesizer that can run on batteries,

513
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:00,468
you know, this thing can sound pretty amazing.

514
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,152
To give you an example, I can also drop that down a little bit.

515
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:17,396
And when I talk about the immediacy of

516
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:20,137
sliders, that's what I'm talking about. Like you just sit there and you grab

517
00:37:20,177 --> 00:37:21,238
something and make something happen.

518
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:24,439
So I really have a lot of fun with that.

519
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,600
So with the envelope on the right hand side, of course, I can shape how the sound

520
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,120
propagates.

521
00:37:34,923 --> 00:37:45,351
If I make a very short decay, now I'll load up that sequencer that I was talking about.

522
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,059
So I have an internal clock that's running this right now.

523
00:38:14,629 --> 00:38:26,554
That's basically how that and the arpeggiator work.

524
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:36,149
Yeah, I gotta say, as a sound designer, it was really easy to be inspired with the stuff he was sending me.

525
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:37,109
This was fun.

526
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,791
And speaking of sound design, so I'm not allowed to use drones, right?

527
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,091
Right?

528
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,272
You know I'm gonna cheat, so...

529
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:47,254
On these old synthesizers, they always had a noise generator.

530
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:48,895
You know, it sounds like...

531
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:58,194
It's what you get when your television used to turn off at night, which it doesn't do anymore.

532
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:00,716
And so I've got noise.

533
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:05,560
But what's cool about noise is that if you add a resonant peak on your filter,

534
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,183
it's singling out some of those frequencies.

535
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:23,628
So you end up, it does self-oscillating, which is pretty neat and very handy.

536
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,229
Cause if you start adding an envelope to your filter,

537
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:34,152
you know, you have something that sounds a lot like, I mean, all that reverb,

538
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:35,632
but it's like a kick drum, right?

539
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:38,573
Yeah.

540
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:40,734
Especially in old video games and things like that, they use little

541
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:41,834
tricks like this all the time.

542
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,195
Then if you wanted to get a snare, you just turn that resonance down and turn

543
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:45,895
the frequency up.

544
00:39:50,072 --> 00:39:52,653
And then you have this cool thing where if you hold it down, it dies.

545
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,354
But if you turn your release up...

546
00:39:54,735 --> 00:40:01,759
Yeah, thanks, Flynn.

547
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,521
So it's just so much fun for sound design.

548
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:08,083
Oh, and you have the huge bass drop, you know, like if you go into a club and you're like...

549
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:28,029
I don't have much of a sub going on here.

550
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:28,790
No.

551
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,571
Oh, that's sad.

552
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:34,193
Anyway, so anyway, I just wanted to show you some of the things that the synth could do

553
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:35,413
and kind of how I have fun with it.

554
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:40,036
You know, I definitely have an illness.

555
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,863
So when I create a queue for Headlander, I would think

556
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:44,643
really vertically.

557
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:48,884
And what I mean by that is I would stack, I'd make a

558
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:52,865
composition, but then stack it very deep with stems and give

559
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:55,966
them over to Camden so that he could mix these stems together

560
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:57,286
in different ways.

561
00:40:57,346 --> 00:40:59,866
It's essential to do that sort of thing so you can get as

562
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:04,587
many queues as possible, as many rooms and things covered

563
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:07,148
with a single queue as possible.

564
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,288
Yeah, I think the final count was 143 tracks.

565
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:15,336
It's a sickness.

566
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:16,277
The score would change.

567
00:41:16,297 --> 00:41:19,838
You'd get more stems if you're in a large room, less stems if you're in a small room.

568
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,238
Things would be filtered a certain way.

569
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:25,799
If you're outside, Camden would throw a lot of reverb on it and things like that.

570
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:29,701
There's even one room where you walk over these lasers and Camden had pulled out this

571
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:34,122
sequenced noise and just pushed that up in the mix.

572
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:36,402
It really gave you a feeling of lasers, which was cool.

573
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:41,169
That was really unique for me.

574
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:45,071
I mean Camden had this amazing ability to remix my material

575
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:46,152
without pissing me off.

576
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:52,856
And I never let people kind of mix my stuff, but Camden just

577
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:54,037
really had an ear for it.

578
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:55,738
And after a couple levels, I knew that I could

579
00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:56,638
trust him implicitly.

580
00:41:56,658 --> 00:41:59,300
I think it's explicit.

581
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,480
Anyway.

582
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:08,123
So I knew I could trust his judgment, and we were on the phone every day talking about

583
00:42:08,163 --> 00:42:08,584
this stuff.

584
00:42:09,084 --> 00:42:15,306
And that was new to me as well, like having a team and feeling part of a team when you're

585
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:17,287
an external contractor doing music.

586
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:23,289
I was invited to meetings every week from the beginning, before levels were designed.

587
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:28,873
When we were talking about concepts, I was in there with them talking to people who were

588
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:37,759
building levels and rooms and people making art. It was incredible. And because of all this,

589
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,783
I was sitting in a meeting one time and I just kind of piped up because I saw that they had this

590
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:44,304
one level in...

591
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:50,697
Headlander that was calling back to this movie Silent Running.

592
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,399
And Silent Running is this movie where basically they're

593
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:56,421
flying the last forests of Earth through space to save

594
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:56,581
them.

595
00:42:57,301 --> 00:43:00,063
And Bruce Dern falls in love with these forests and

596
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:02,264
essentially murders all of his crew mates to save the

597
00:43:02,304 --> 00:43:02,724
forests.

598
00:43:03,285 --> 00:43:05,486
And then there's this scene where he's walking through one

599
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:11,349
of the forests, thinking about killing his crew or whatever.

600
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:12,570
It's very serene.

601
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,951
And this Joan Baez song comes on.

602
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:22,821
You know, and it just, this like morose Joan Baez syrupy folk song comes on.

603
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:23,722
It was surreal.

604
00:43:23,822 --> 00:43:25,182
And I'm like, we have to do that.

605
00:43:25,762 --> 00:43:26,963
We gotta make that happen.

606
00:43:27,383 --> 00:43:30,724
And I mentioned it to Camden and then we brought it up at the meeting and they were like, oh

607
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:32,525
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're gonna do that.

608
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:37,186
So not only did they include the song, which I had my wife sing the Joan Baez part and

609
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:39,847
I wrote this song that was like just a total ripoff of.

610
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:41,029
It's a little bit like a movie.

611
00:43:41,169 --> 00:43:44,413
I'm sorry, homage of the song in Silent Running.

612
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:50,201
They not only took the song and put it in there, they changed game mechanics, they slowed

613
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:54,206
the level down, they like ducked all the sound and all the dialogue.

614
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:55,708
And we ended up with this.

615
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:21,737
Freedom is your mindset free.

616
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:32,545
It's all gone.

617
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:35,968
Like a dreadful knowing smile,

618
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:37,249
was once made.

619
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:39,670
It's all gone.

620
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:46,611
Mass carnage.

621
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:50,913
Okay, well, you get the idea.

622
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:52,494
When it goes...

623
00:44:53,434 --> 00:44:56,395
A little bit later on, a little bit later on, the full band comes in,

624
00:44:56,455 --> 00:44:58,856
and there's of course a flugelhorn solo, and you know...

625
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:00,637
I went there.

626
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,692
But that's incredible, right?

627
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:06,093
Somebody's going to let you do an idea like that?

628
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:07,274
That was batty.

629
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:12,076
So working on Headlander got Camden and I experimenting in

630
00:45:12,096 --> 00:45:13,117
a really unique way.

631
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:16,678
And by creating the sound design with these boundaries

632
00:45:16,698 --> 00:45:20,520
and limitations set on us, I think it pushed us to create

633
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,341
something really special.

634
00:45:23,322 --> 00:45:25,563
So what did we learn from all of this?

635
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:31,077
When Dave and I were first introduced to the ideas behind Headlander, we both had a very

636
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:32,979
visceral reaction to the content.

637
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,705
When I first saw the trailer where the Headlander's head lifts off his body, I literally got creepy

638
00:45:39,725 --> 00:45:40,166
goosebumps.

639
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:45,640
So the strength of the initial idea and the core of the game's story was something we

640
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,921
need to keep in our sights over the course of production.

641
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:51,644
And sometimes when you're working on a game for a long time, you can forget where you

642
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:52,165
came from.

643
00:45:52,865 --> 00:45:57,268
So Dave and I had come up with some ways to keep that initial powerful idea intact, and

644
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,870
we wanted to pass it along to you today.

645
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:04,655
First of all, distill the inspiration of the game down to its essence.

646
00:46:04,935 --> 00:46:07,657
Think of it like a funnel where you put all of your influences at the top,

647
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,400
and then at the other end you're going to get the building blocks

648
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,942
made up of the sound profile of all those influences.

649
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:18,346
In Headlander, we put all of the sci-fi movies of the 70s into a funnel

650
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:21,549
and came out with a palette for sound, music, and dialogue

651
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:24,531
based on what was common amongst all those influences.

652
00:46:25,272 --> 00:46:27,874
And that technique can be used for anything, any genre.

653
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:33,876
We then took that palette and we put constraints on it in terms of sound source, tools, and techniques.

654
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:39,521
And this put us in a similar position of those who were experimenting within sci-fi cinema in the 70s.

655
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:43,605
And those experimentations resulted in some very creative solutions.

656
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:48,990
We encourage you to occasionally use constraints in your projects to foster experimentation.

657
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:55,364
Remind yourself during the course of the project of where you started when you first took the

658
00:46:55,404 --> 00:47:00,327
project on, you know, that initial spark and inspiration. Get it from yourself and how

659
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:04,649
you felt about it when you first heard it and also talk to the team about it and always

660
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:09,692
reinforce that initial spark that got you going. You know, if you're an external contractor,

661
00:47:09,732 --> 00:47:14,255
make sure that you engage with the developers as much as you can if you're not in-house.

662
00:47:14,923 --> 00:47:19,166
If you are working in-house, talk to everyone on the team and avoid isolation.

663
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:23,770
The perspectives and ideas of what the game is about and where it's going will change

664
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,852
your approach and enrich your perception.

665
00:47:27,213 --> 00:47:28,814
Thanks for joining us today.

666
00:47:28,854 --> 00:47:31,176
It was really fun to talk to you about this game.

667
00:47:31,376 --> 00:47:33,458
Please rate the presentation if you can.

668
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,179
Yes, please rate us.

669
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:35,720
And we hope you enjoyed it.

670
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,400
Thank you.

671
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:36,921
Thank you.

672
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:42,460
And we'll take any questions if you like.

673
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:43,884
If anybody has any questions.

674
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:44,265
Anybody?

675
00:47:44,285 --> 00:47:46,389
Oh boy.

676
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:49,035
Of course.

677
00:47:50,017 --> 00:47:50,980
Can I eat my banana now?

678
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,717
Yeah, totally. That was really good, guys. That was great talk.

679
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:58,780
I had a serious question, actually.

680
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,283
70s aesthetic versus modern audience expectations.

681
00:48:02,703 --> 00:48:07,547
So, it's so rad that you guys went there with the sound design especially,

682
00:48:07,647 --> 00:48:10,869
just getting that like, you were talking about the pre-Ben Burt era kind of stuff.

683
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,490
I'm sorry, my voice is shot.

684
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:17,679
But there is a certain level of audience expectation for the

685
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:22,408
timbre and tonality of what they want to be pleasing.

686
00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:24,332
So how did you end up balancing that?

687
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:34,981
Well, I remember while I was studying for sound design anyway, when I would go in and look at these old movie ideas and like Lee would bring in something we'd watch as a team.

688
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:41,763
I remember looking at it two different ways, which was like what was actually happening and like what I remembered when I first saw it.

689
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:44,964
Like I would kind of design to the memory as well.

690
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:46,950
So that was one thing.

691
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:49,831
Because I remember when I was growing up and I first saw

692
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:52,432
the black hole and everything, I was super inspired by it.

693
00:48:52,872 --> 00:48:54,212
And when I came back, I was like, it's not

694
00:48:54,252 --> 00:48:55,352
what I thought at all.

695
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:59,614
So I started doing a journal of how I actually remembered

696
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:01,874
it, and I would kind of combine that.

697
00:49:01,914 --> 00:49:03,475
Yeah, you'd go on your memory, not what's real.

698
00:49:03,655 --> 00:49:04,275
Yeah.

699
00:49:04,815 --> 00:49:09,497
I mean, I had a tremendous, I mean, Stranger Things came out

700
00:49:09,537 --> 00:49:10,857
at the same time as Headlander.

701
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:16,780
And it's just a trip to be sort of in the flow of that particular zeitgeist.

702
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:24,506
I mean, and I feel that, I mean I did definitely in the score, I cheated a lot by layering things in such a way

703
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:26,988
and using reverbs and stuff that you'd never hear back then.

704
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:33,454
And hopefully, you know, the low end and some of the ways that you adjust timbre for modern expectations, I think,

705
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:37,737
you know, we sort of inherently, we sort of did that without thinking about it, I think.

706
00:49:38,438 --> 00:49:40,420
It sounds really, am I blocking anyone?

707
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:52,109
The door that was doing the laughing, I really, for me it resonated with the memory of the skeleton in The Last Unicorn.

708
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,872
I didn't know if that was intentional or not, but it was great, man. It was great.

709
00:49:57,633 --> 00:50:01,836
Also, the layered feedback element that you played sounds exactly like a Sun song.

710
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:13,103
And this is on a serious tip. When he delivered the music to you on reels, was that a challenge

711
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:13,363
for you?

712
00:50:14,824 --> 00:50:19,267
Like I would ever deliver to him on reels. That's a funny trick question.

713
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:22,229
It was easy.

714
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:25,512
I just delivered the whole machine.

715
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,763
First of all, where is, hi, great talk, thank you very much.

716
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:31,525
Oh, thank you.

717
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,367
Where is the Synth Museum, please?

718
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:35,791
Oh, the Synth Museum in Emeryville.

719
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:37,313
I will find it for you right now, because I

720
00:50:37,353 --> 00:50:38,294
have it in my contacts.

721
00:50:40,658 --> 00:50:42,400
Yeah, the Synth Museum is fantastic.

722
00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:44,973
I will find the address.

723
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:46,033
Well, which city even?

724
00:50:46,494 --> 00:50:46,814
Emeryville.

725
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:47,254
Emeryville.

726
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:47,914
Emeryville.

727
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:48,795
Yeah, across the bay.

728
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,475
Okay.

729
00:50:50,356 --> 00:50:53,217
And also about the feedback thing.

730
00:50:53,877 --> 00:51:00,681
Did you record the feedback and then sampled it and like, you know, played it?

731
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:02,862
Or how did you pitch it?

732
00:51:02,882 --> 00:51:03,602
No.

733
00:51:03,723 --> 00:51:04,043
Actually.

734
00:51:05,517 --> 00:51:08,417
I didn't do any sampling in this entire project.

735
00:51:09,557 --> 00:51:13,858
What I did is me and my senior sound designer, I don't know

736
00:51:13,878 --> 00:51:17,199
if he's here, Paul, but we basically took my guitar in my

737
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:19,640
office and just beat the hell out of it and made it feedback

738
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,460
for like two hours.

739
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,200
And then it was all editing.

740
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,220
I literally just did everything by edit.

741
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:24,681
OK.

742
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:25,141
Yeah.

743
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:27,361
I guess technically it's in Oakland.

744
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:28,261
So it's 1145 65th Street.

745
00:51:28,301 --> 00:51:28,981
We need that in LA.

746
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:36,424
I'm sure you do. I mean, in L.A.

747
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:37,345
Thanks for the talk.

748
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,286
It's called Jesper Kidd.

749
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:46,518
So, could you have, do you have any recommendations for someone who's not into analog synths to start the sickness?

750
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:49,543
To say, having one synth to start.

751
00:51:50,747 --> 00:51:55,091
Uh, my, my key into that deep hole was the uh, the Korg Monotron.

752
00:51:55,211 --> 00:51:55,452
Yeah.

753
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:56,032
Instant.

754
00:51:56,072 --> 00:52:04,962
And the Korg, Korg has done a fantastic job of sort of reinvigorating, I felt that they were really on the forefront of reinvigorating, um, the synth movement, the analog synth movement.

755
00:52:05,062 --> 00:52:06,443
And they have these little boxes.

756
00:52:06,884 --> 00:52:09,907
There are a lot of things that are really inexpensive. The vulca series that you can chain

757
00:52:09,947 --> 00:52:14,972
together and they have like a sequencer and they have the monotone which has a little ribbon on

758
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:20,658
it that you can play the keys on. But it has real analog filters on it and stuff and that kind of

759
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,020
juiciness that you get.

760
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:28,985
analog you can pull out of those. Even the MS 20 is only about 700 bucks but you can get in on

761
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:35,070
the ground floor using the Volca series. If you want to get really sick, well no I'm not going

762
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:40,354
to start you down that road. The euro rack stuff is pretty interesting, pretty cool stuff.

763
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:46,979
It all depends, you know I'm talking about analog synthesis but to be more specific I'm

764
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:48,560
talking about, uh, uh, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

765
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:53,749
I'm doing subtractive synthesis and maybe a little bit of sync,

766
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:57,330
you know, hard sync synthesis and things like that. And I think

767
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,412
that subtractive synthesis is a really great place to start

768
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:03,613
because you're taking waves that are rich with content and then

769
00:53:03,653 --> 00:53:07,075
you're pulling out harmonic stuff out of them using really

770
00:53:07,095 --> 00:53:10,336
interesting filters. Go for the Volca series first, I think.

771
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:15,298
Awesome. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Anybody else?

772
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:19,856
Thank you.

773
00:53:20,183 --> 00:53:20,408
Thanks.
