My name is Tim Keenan, and I made a game called Duskers, where you pilot drones into derelict

2
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:10,391
spaceships to find the means to survive and piece together how the universe became a giant

3
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:10,911
graveyard.

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:15,535
Duskers has received a lot of critical acclaim for being innovative and completely immersing

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,437
players in a dead science fiction world.

6
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:21,081
I think what helped us to do this is our unique approach to the game's design.

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,345
In essence, we listened to the game and let Duskers tell us what it needed, rather than

8
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:26,205
us trying to steer it.

9
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:32,210
In my GDC talk, I'm going to explain our approach and how we use the notion of design pillars, but in a different way.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,695
Namely, focusing on emotions rather than features, refining the game's vision throughout development, and focusing on player fantasy.

11
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:41,136
I hope to see you there!
