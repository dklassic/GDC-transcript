1
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,167
Hi, welcome.

2
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:11,128
Quite the room, oh man.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,230
I'm not nervous, I swear.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,831
Yeah, thanks everyone for coming.

5
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:18,834
I know it's early, so we'll make sure to keep the energy nice and high so we don't all fall asleep.

6
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:21,296
Yeah, welcome, welcome to our talk.

7
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:24,178
There's plenty of other talks going on, so I appreciate you all coming here today.

8
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:30,903
Today we'll be talking about Call of the Lamb and how we use Twitch integration to reach a massive audience.

9
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:41,148
So we'll run through some of the integration features, as well as the design and development of the Twitch integration, plus the release data, and then, yeah, post-launch.

10
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,589
So I'm Harrison.

11
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:46,289
I'm the lead gameplay programmer at Massive Monster.

12
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,951
I've been working on Caught in the Lamb for three years, and I set up the Twitch integration on the game side.

13
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:57,172
I've worked on a few commercial projects before, but nothing as exciting as Caught in the Lamb.

14
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,329
And I'm Thomas, also known as Streaming Toolsmith.

15
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:08,194
I basically help gaming companies improve live viewership by creating interactive experiences for viewers as they're playing your game.

16
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:15,080
Some of my past work includes stuff like Baldur's Gate 3, Disco Elysium, League of Legends, and obviously Cult of the Lamb as well.

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,647
So, this talk is all about Cult of the Lamb and how we used Twitch integration to drastically improve its popularity on Twitch.

18
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:25,471
So just to make sure we're on the same page, everyone needs to know what Cult of the Lamb is.

19
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:27,774
First of all, if you don't, shame on you.

20
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:32,559
Second of all, who better than Harrison, one of the people who made it, to tell you all about it.

21
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:37,220
Yeah, so Cult of the Lamb is a dungeon crawler mixed with a base builder.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,981
Imagine Binding of Isaac meets Rimworld.

23
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,601
You play as a little lamb and you run a cult of woodland creatures.

24
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:53,904
You explore dungeons, defeat rival cult leaders, perform rituals, clean up poop, do daily sermons, all to gain power to become the one true cult leader.

25
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:59,787
Yeah, so one of the big questions is, as an indie studio, how do you stand out?

26
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:04,390
So before Caught in the Lamb, Massive Monster had made two games, The Adventure Powers and Never Give Up.

27
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:12,536
The Adventure Powers was a 2D platformer that was moderately successful, whereas Never Give Up was a work for hire that never really made recoup.

28
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:17,539
Yeah, so Caught in the Lamb was sort of a last resort project for the studio.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,183
It kind of needed to do really well to keep the studio afloat, and it had to be something real special.

30
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,641
So the theming and design of Colton & Lamb was an iterative process.

31
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:35,871
If you've seen some podcasts from the directors, then you know that the Colton & Lamb that we know and love today, it didn't start that way.

32
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,633
It was quite an iterative process.

33
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:42,099
And eventually, over time, they landed on the theme of cute and culty.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,326
So I wasn't at MM until about halfway through Cult of the Lamb, the development of Cult of the Lamb.

35
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:51,952
So I'm speaking on behalf of the directors, a couple are just over there.

36
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:58,120
Marketing and social presence was always at the forefront of the design of the game to ensure that it would stand out, really.

37
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,704
And a game about a cult will do that.

38
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:10,235
So going back to that big question of how do you make your game stand out, especially as an indie, one of the ways of doing that is by leveraging social media and streaming platforms.

39
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:15,060
So Cult of the Lamb has an incredibly strong social media presence, especially on Twitter and TikTok.

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,803
I'm sure most of you have seen one, if not several, of

41
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:20,605
The Cult of the Lambs Twitter spicy tweets.

42
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:24,109
That's all thanks to Josie's handiwork, who sadly isn't here today.

43
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,372
They're obviously also doing really well on TikTok with lots of meme videos.

44
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:37,641
Jared from Devolver actually gave an amazing talk on Cult of the Lambs social strategy last year here at GDC, which I recommend you check out if you have access to the GDC vault.

45
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:50,821
So while we have all of these standard, let's call them social media platforms, that are good for getting a first impression of the game to viewers, Twitch and other streaming platforms are much better at converting viewers to actual players.

46
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:55,623
So Twitch in particular has 140 million users per month, which is just insane.

47
00:03:55,663 --> 00:04:01,285
So there's crazy potential there to get lots of eyeballs on your game, even if you're just an indie game.

48
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:07,008
So Twitch offers several integrations that allow you to integrate your game with Twitch or vice versa.

49
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:08,969
One of those is Twitch Drops.

50
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,990
You're probably all familiar with that.

51
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:18,734
If not, Twitch Drops are basically just a way for you as a viewer to watch streams and then you get rewards for that game that you can then use in-game.

52
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:22,175
The other big facet of Twitch integrations are Twitch extensions.

53
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:32,258
So they allow you to offer interactivity for your viewer, and other platforms, other streaming platforms anyway, don't really even come close to what Twitch offers in terms of extensions.

54
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:36,659
They either have nothing at all or something very basic, in my opinion.

55
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:46,722
So the concept of Twitch extensions themselves have existed for a while, but in my opinion, they're still vastly underutilized, even though they're super exciting for viewers.

56
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:54,887
So going back to converting viewers to players, interacting with an integration kind of turns your viewers into players.

57
00:04:54,927 --> 00:05:02,052
They're not playing your actual game yet, but it is their first real touch point by interacting with the game, and that's going to help with conversion.

58
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:03,753
Yeah, so I watch a lot of Twitch.

59
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:05,654
I've always got it glued to my second monitor.

60
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,336
And yeah, I watch a lot of different streamers and different games.

61
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,298
And like Thomas was mentioning, I find that

62
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:15,059
Not many games actually have Twitch integration, even though it's been around for quite a while.

63
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:26,402
So I find that when I do come across a streamer playing a game with Twitch integration, I usually, yeah, I like to stick around, see how they're interacting with integration, as well as the viewers, and see some of these cool little stories that come out from it.

64
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:36,065
And that's exactly one of the reasons why I got into this in the first place, because I saw the vast potential of Twitch integrations, but no one else was really building this kind of stuff, even game developers themselves.

65
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:38,546
So I figured I'll just start building it myself.

66
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:42,726
So Twitch extensions come in many ways.

67
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,267
So there are a couple of forms.

68
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,309
The one we used mainly is the one you see up top.

69
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,490
So that's a video overlay.

70
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,374
All of these are basically small applications that run either on top of or next to the stream in some type of way.

71
00:05:56,295 --> 00:06:04,605
Installing these extensions on Twitch as a creator is super straightforward, so you basically just have to do a couple of clicks in the creator dashboard and then you're good to go.

72
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:12,215
Viewers don't even need to install anything, they basically just go to a channel that has the integration enabled and it just pops up for them by default.

73
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:22,674
So going back to the concept of a Twitch integration specifically for Cult of the Lamb, we wanted to play into the similarities between cults and Twitch channels.

74
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:34,060
So I say that with all of the love and respect for any potential Twitch staff or creators here in the crowd, but there are some parallels to be drawn between especially very big Twitch channels and an actual cult.

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:43,005
So Cult of the Lamb was pretty much a perfect game for a Twitch integration, both conceptually as well as thanks to its really fun and quirky art style that makes it stand out.

76
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:49,834
Yeah, so we'll take you through our little journey from signing the contract with Thomas to releasing Co-Op The Lamb and the Twitch integration.

77
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:54,598
It's sort of a post-mortem in a way, although we are actually still developing the Twitch integration.

78
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:58,622
So we'll go through what went well and also what didn't and some of the issues we come across.

79
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:09,430
So going back all the way to the beginning around July 2021, Clara from Devolver Digital introduced me to a couple of games that they wanted to pursue a Twitch integration for.

80
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:17,218
Sadly, none of those games panned out because of developer or timing issues, but then seemingly out of nowhere, Cult of the Lamb popped up on our radar.

81
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:23,763
And I think we all immediately felt that just the concept of the game was a natural fit for a Twitch integration.

82
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:27,325
So let's talk about the Twitch features for Call of the Lamb.

83
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:31,568
If you're unfamiliar with it, Harrison is going to walk you through each feature in more detail in a second.

84
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,772
But basically, each of the three features focus on a different interaction model, let's say.

85
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:42,597
So the first one, the reward totem, that allows the community to collaboratively contribute towards a shared goal.

86
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:59,509
then help or hinder allows viewers to dynamically alter the gameplay in really exciting ways and finally the most exciting feature to me anyway is viewer followers where viewers get to actually appear in game as a cult member and express their own identity because they're able to customize their follower as they join

87
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:04,678
Yeah, so we'll take a little bit of a deeper dive into some of these features, first being the reward totem.

88
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,760
It allows viewers to contribute towards this totem using channel points.

89
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:19,347
Once the totem is full, it will look like something like that for the streamer, which they can then interact and they get some resources or maybe something a little more exciting, like some Twitch exclusive follower skins.

90
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:24,036
Once they've claimed it, it then resets, and that loop can kind of continue.

91
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:28,920
The streamer will receive a little notification in-game when a viewer contributes towards that totem.

92
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,183
So it might say, like, blah, blah, blah has contributed to the totem.

93
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:35,887
And it's another incentive for the viewer to just make some notice from the streamer.

94
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:39,491
There's also a global cooldown between these contributions.

95
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:47,940
And the reason we did this is so it balances the game between these streamers that might have 50,000 viewers compared to the streamers that might have 10 viewers.

96
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,605
Because if 50,000 people are contributing, it's just going to throw off the balance of the game.

97
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:58,151
And in a way, it's also like a bit of a race for these viewers to contribute and get in quickly.

98
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:02,567
Yeah, next up is the help or hinder.

99
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:09,672
So roughly every 10 to 20 minutes in game, the streamer will receive a little notification saying that the viewers are deciding your fate.

100
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:17,978
For the viewers, they will receive this little UI on their Twitch screen, and it allows them to vote to help or hinder the streamer.

101
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:20,819
It takes about 30 seconds, and it's a majority vote.

102
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,404
Once they're voted, it then moves on to the next phase, which is, again, a majority vote, but this time it will be three options.

103
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:30,967
based on whether they chose help or whether they chose hinder.

104
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:37,873
They then vote again on these three options, and then, yeah, the majority vote will then trigger in-game.

105
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:46,722
So if they chose, let's say, to kill a follower, the streamer will then see their follower just die, and it will be like, Julian died, thanks to Twitch chat.

106
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:56,806
So to me, the most powerful moments of Help or Hinder are when viewers kind of get to come together and help the streamer overcome challenges.

107
00:09:56,906 --> 00:10:00,027
So they kind of get to save the day during playthroughs.

108
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:03,509
We have a video coming up in a second that really illustrates that concept as well.

109
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:04,509
OK.

110
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,150
So let's do a little show of hands.

111
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,371
So if you're watching your favorite streamer, would you choose to help or hinder?

112
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,252
Would you choose to help?

113
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:15,433
OK.

114
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:16,193
What about hinder?

115
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:18,724
Yeah.

116
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:19,805
So, same, right?

117
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,847
I think it's more exciting when you're watching a streamer.

118
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:22,927
You want them to suffer, really.

119
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,989
You want them to, like, to make it harder.

120
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:30,573
But it turns out 91.3% of people watching and voting for Help A Hinder chose Help.

121
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:31,574
That's so boring.

122
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:40,521
And I think it's mostly because we have a lot of communities, like small streamers, and these viewers, they don't want their streamer to be hindered.

123
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,342
Goody two-shoes.

124
00:10:44,997 --> 00:10:45,077
I'm

125
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:05,007
will be

126
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:37,265
Okay, so we've seen the core interactions of the integration, so let's see them in action.

127
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:39,527
Good luck.

128
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:40,328
I can't do anything.

129
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:41,629
I'm gonna do a follower raffle.

130
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,131
Dude, this game is so sick.

131
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,413
The Twitch integration is so fire, too.

132
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,234
Either you got in or you didn't.

133
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:50,275
Let's see.

134
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,797
Look, Tia!

135
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:55,098
Yay!

136
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,780
Alright, Tia, you can make your character.

137
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:56,900
Cute!

138
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,070
It is so dope.

139
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:05,652
That's cute.

140
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:07,153
That's very you vibes, to be honest.

141
00:12:08,073 --> 00:12:08,494
Nice.

142
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:09,274
Okay.

143
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:14,757
It's the first game that I've seen that has done channel points, which blew my mind a little bit.

144
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:22,141
But honestly, as a streamer, it's the one thing I always want.

145
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:23,582
Give me the extension.

146
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:25,043
Don't do the in-chat stuff.

147
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:26,904
Do it on their own screen.

148
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,345
It's been great.

149
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,667
Turbo Scrub, come here, buddy.

150
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,189
Turbo Scrub, what's your f***ing problem, dude?

151
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:38,069
My faith is shaken.

152
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:38,969
I can see through your lies.

153
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:39,969
You're a fraud.

154
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,511
Twitch chatter deciding your fate?

155
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:45,031
What are you doing?

156
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:46,331
Hey.

157
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,552
Chat, what are you doing?

158
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:50,813
Deciding my fate.

159
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:53,874
He's got, like, full descent.

160
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:54,734
He's gonna, like, run away.

161
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,423
All followers have been cured thanks to Twitch chat.

162
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:05,584
Aww.

163
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:09,086
Hi, Turbo.

164
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:09,567
Wait.

165
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:12,008
You're not just found a bunch of s***?

166
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,532
Wait, did he get cured of his dissent?

167
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,354
Was being dissenting a disease?

168
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:21,675
Oh, look, he likes me again.

169
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:25,358
He f***ing loves me.

170
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,379
He fixed him.

171
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,401
Oh my God, that's amazing.

172
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,431
We've got work to do.

173
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,373
Hey, but we can collect the totem reward from our Twitch viewers.

174
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:36,033
Thank you so much.

175
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:37,514
Let's see what we get.

176
00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:38,275
Spin the wheel.

177
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,760
A new follower form.

178
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,941
Now we can make mices.

179
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,523
Eventually I'll learn these symbols.

180
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:49,923
Oh no.

181
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:51,965
Twitch chat, chat, you're deciding my fate.

182
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:52,565
Be nice.

183
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:54,426
Not everything has to be negative.

184
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,208
We don't have to hurt Bog.

185
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,649
We don't have to make my game harder.

186
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,581
You received a demon.

187
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:01,962
Thanks to Twi- SEE THAT'S AWESOME!

188
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:03,243
You gave me a demon?

189
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:05,984
How do I rece- How do I accept the demon?

190
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,026
Oh wait, there he is!

191
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,127
Lookit, I got a demon!

192
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:11,988
Yes!

193
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:16,312
The Twitch integration I've been waiting for, for seven years of streaming.

194
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:22,280
It is so good having the raffle handled in the game.

195
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,246
So I don't have to like stop every time we want to like customize one of our characters for the stream.

196
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:28,708
It is beautiful.

197
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:29,990
I absolutely love that.

198
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:37,741
So for the clip we just saw where the follower was dissenting, that interaction wasn't planned or scripted in any way.

199
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:41,765
It just happened organically thanks to the integration features working together.

200
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:47,911
So it was basically just a random moment that I came across during watching just streams on launch.

201
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:53,117
And those little stories and moments basically happen all the time thanks to the integration.

202
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,122
So let's talk about design.

203
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:03,426
By design, I don't mean UI and UX of the integration, but rather the conceptual design of it.

204
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:09,450
Much like how good games are designed, Twitch integrations also need to be thought of and designed in good ways.

205
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:15,034
So the following two principles are a couple of design principles that I try to stick to when creating integrations.

206
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:22,459
They might not necessarily be yours if you end up building one of your own, but they did help me to create successful integrations in the past, including Cult of the Lamb.

207
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:25,635
So the first one is really obvious, I guess.

208
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:26,535
Make cool shit.

209
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:31,836
So you want to create something awesome and exciting for viewers and streamers alike.

210
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:45,921
You want to avoid viewing a Twitch integration as purely a marketing tool, because that's going to set you on a path where you think about features in certain ways that are going to probably be a little gimmicky for viewers, and that's not going to feel right for them.

211
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:52,203
You also want to give viewers power, the ability to influence gameplay in meaningful ways.

212
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:55,524
And you also want to make them invested in the game in some type of way.

213
00:15:55,584 --> 00:16:00,086
So we did that with the Twitch Totem that allowed them to contribute towards a shared goal.

214
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:05,068
And lastly, it's important to think of game balance when designing something like this as well.

215
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:12,291
In general, it's okay to make things harder for streamers, because streamers usually are good gamers, or you would hope so anyway.

216
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:22,196
But you don't want to make things too easy because that's going to cause viewers to see the streamer playing a game that's vastly easier for them and that might not feel very good for them.

217
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:25,437
So you have to consider game balance as well when creating something like this.

218
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,139
Then second of all, building on existing systems and features.

219
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:33,742
This is kind of a big one, especially for indie developers where resources are very limited.

220
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:38,785
Yeah, Massive Monster was and are still quite a small team, so we were really limited on resources.

221
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:43,148
We were still developing Call of the Lamb, and when I mean developing, I don't mean just fixing a few bugs.

222
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,310
We were still coming over quite a few design hurdles and whatnot, making the game fun.

223
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:51,313
So we really couldn't put too many resources into creating the Twitch integration.

224
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:57,638
And hindsight is obviously 2020, but I think this was the right decision, both from a conceptual as well as a business standpoint.

225
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,800
So you want to build on stuff that you've already made anyway.

226
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,743
So the game already had the ability to customize followers within the base game.

227
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:10,868
So that was a natural fit to put into the extension instead and give viewers agency to express their own identity.

228
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:16,733
Similarly, the totem is basically just an extension of the base game shrine that you build when you first start playing.

229
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,455
So it's basically just another skin with a progress bar on top.

230
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:24,057
You don't also want non-streamers missing out on content.

231
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:40,066
This means that you don't want to build entirely new features or game systems that are only accessible throughout the Twitch integration, because the vast majority of your player base won't be streaming the game, and then they'll see all of these cool features that they can't even access unless they're streaming.

232
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:52,310
For example, we created these really awesome looking Twitch exclusive skins, and they were only available at the start through the Twitch Totem, so only through streaming the game thanks to the Twitch integration.

233
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,712
A lot of people really liked these skins, even when they weren't streaming, so we ended up having to add them to the base game as well.

234
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:03,113
Okay, onto the development and the fight between Thomas and I.

235
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:05,610
not

236
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:31,591
The game integration took only roughly a month, and yeah, we were able to do that basically near launch, and fortunately we were able to do that during console cert.

237
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:39,696
So console cert takes like a month to two months, and because the Twitch integration isn't on consoles, we were able to do that like parallel.

238
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:47,384
We also only spent roughly about a week on testing the Twitch integration, which in hindsight probably could have been a little longer.

239
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:53,051
But it's harder to simulate high volumes of traffic, and spoiler alert, that's kind of what we dealt with.

240
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:54,452
Suffering from success.

241
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:54,833
Yeah.

242
00:18:55,914 --> 00:19:02,077
So now that we know what Twitch integrations are on a conceptual level, especially extensions, let's talk about its architecture.

243
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:04,258
So you have three major parts for an extension.

244
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:05,879
First of all, you have the game integration.

245
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:08,160
So that's the game code that ends up running within the game.

246
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,700
That's the part that Harrison developed.

247
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:13,262
I'm not a game dev myself, so I don't want to muddle up the game code.

248
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:19,125
Then you have the backend service, which basically just lets the game talk to the backend, and then that backend

249
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:20,026
a bit.

250
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:41,252
So this is built with web technologies using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and this is hosted on Twitch.

251
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:49,237
That also means that you need to stick to certain guidelines and policies set forth by Twitch, and that they also need to be submitted for review to Twitch.

252
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:55,340
So you can kind of think of the extension marketplace, let's call it, as some kind of app store that they control.

253
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,831
So what we're seeing here is the extension, but not the extension on Twitch.

254
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:05,373
So because I build a lot of integrations, I have a couple of aces up my sleeve that make development easier.

255
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:10,855
So this is the extension debug viewer that kind of mimics what it would look like on Twitch.

256
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,117
Yeah, I'm Australian, so my internet is just trash.

257
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:20,340
So this allowed me to basically mimic, like what Thomas was saying, the Twitch side of things.

258
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,802
So I didn't have to open OBS, I didn't have to stream, I didn't have to do any of that.

259
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:29,584
So the extension debugger also allows you to masquerade as certain users or on certain channels.

260
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:37,968
So allowing that to happen also means that it's very easy to share a very specific view that you're seeing through just sharing the URL on Slack.

261
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:39,850
and we

262
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:03,355
And this was used by Harrison to kind of reference things and as a debugging tool as well.

263
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:10,437
So it allowed him to trigger different events easily like totem contributions that would otherwise have to be done on Twitch.

264
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:20,660
So with the mock game and the extension debugger I showed just now, we were able to simulate Twitch and the game without having to stream on Twitch, without having to actually play the game.

265
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,921
So this allowed us to develop things in a much quicker way.

266
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:28,805
So before we released Cult of the Lamb, we soft launched about a week prior.

267
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:33,910
So this allowed us to test with a small handful of streamers the game, basically.

268
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:41,157
And it gave us the opportunity to iron out any bugs, both in Cult of the Lamb and the Twitch integration itself, and also optimize.

269
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:45,882
Fortunately, we had our publisher, Devolver, basically do all of this process.

270
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:48,824
So it's super handy having a publisher that's hands-on.

271
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:58,268
One of the more interesting things that Devolver did in my opinion during that soft launch was that they heavily promoted the Twitch integration usage for those streamers in the early access period.

272
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:04,751
And this kind of caused a natural trickle-down effect, let's call it, where streamers who weren't part of the early access period

273
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:10,674
saw these streamers using the integration and then just installing it themselves was just a matter of a couple of clicks.

274
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:15,577
So that means that everyone was pretty much locked and loaded, let's say, for the actual launch.

275
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:21,941
And this means that to this day, I would say 9 out of 10 streamers at least are using the Twitch integration for Cult of the Lamb.

276
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,643
Okay, so remember this beautiful timeline from earlier?

277
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:29,025
It was a little bit more like this.

278
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,160
it was

279
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:56,669
The integration was melting and nothing worked.

280
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,015
I think the main issue we faced was that Cult of the Lamb was just too good of a game and was too popular.

281
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:09,362
So there were a couple of issues where even games that weren't actually streaming to Twitch were sending over data to the server.

282
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:16,469
So I was able to patch some of that stuff on my end but ultimately we did need to update the game code as well to fix all issues.

283
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,951
Yeah, it wasn't my crap code.

284
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:19,791
It was just too popular.

285
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:28,235
So yeah, we had like lots of streamers that weren't streaming that were sending data and just lots of little things which created high server load.

286
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:33,698
There was even a point where bit transactions were failing and bit transactions are actual viewers money.

287
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:35,839
So we had to make sure we fixed that.

288
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:41,123
Yeah, so despite the rocky launch, and it was a little rocky, people still loved it.

289
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:42,924
People just ate it up.

290
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:46,987
And a lot of people even bought Call of the Lamb just because of the Twitch integration.

291
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:52,039
All righty, so that brings us to release of Caught the Lamb.

292
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,380
So a week later, on the 12th of August, we launched Caught the Lamb.

293
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,924
So we'll go through some of the stats on Twitch for the first month of how Caught the Lamb did and how it boosted the game's popularity.

294
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:15,210
It's also worth noting that we did launch with Twitch drops, so viewers were able to jump on streamers' streams and watch and get these exclusive Twitch follower skins.

295
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,971
So that may have helped boost the numbers a little bit.

296
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:22,225
So the first that we're looking at is the max viewers for the first month of launch.

297
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:29,847
So on the day of launch, we had 150,000 viewers, which honestly is just mind-bogglingly huge for a non-multiplayer indie game.

298
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:34,689
And like I said earlier, around 90%, I would say, of those streamers were using the Twitch integration.

299
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:40,878
Yeah, so I was browsing streamers, watching them play Call of the Lamb, as you do when your game launches.

300
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:42,459
I just wanted to check out what they thought.

301
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:48,842
And at one point, we come across this one streamer that was talking to a viewer, and they were like, hey, I can add you to the game.

302
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:53,005
You choose a follower form and a color, and I can add you in.

303
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:55,606
And it's like, we made an integration for that.

304
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:58,828
It was kind of frustrating, but also really funny to see at the same time.

305
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:05,432
But I think it also speaks volumes to what we ended up building was something that streamers actually would want in an integration.

306
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:11,327
So for the next one, we're looking at the average viewers again for the first month of release compared to other games.

307
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:14,912
We're basically just trumping all other games without integration.

308
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:19,157
Now, I'm not as delusional to say that that's only due to the Twitch integration.

309
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:23,222
Obviously, Cult of Lam was just a really good game that managed to stand out regardless.

310
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,666
But for the sake of argument, let's say that it did help at least a little bit.

311
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:31,276
So to me, this is actually the most interesting step there is.

312
00:25:31,336 --> 00:25:35,097
This is the amount of average channels for the first month of release.

313
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:45,719
So this is kind of an underrated statistic, but it was really crucial to Cult of the Lamb's success, because this means that a lot more channels were streaming Cult of the Lamb than compared to any other game.

314
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,481
So we would have these really small, intimate channels of, let's say, 10 to 50 viewers or something, also streaming Cult of the Lamb.

315
00:25:53,061 --> 00:26:11,850
and this means that the value of the interactions we provide throughout the integration are even more powerful in those kinds of communities because those tight-knit communities kind of know each other and it's way more exciting for viewers to see familiar names both in-game as well as when to vote on someone to marry or kill or send to the fight pits.

316
00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:16,804
So these are the first average viewers for some of our friends.

317
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:19,686
We've got Gungeon, Darkest Dungeon, and Inscription.

318
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:25,870
And as you can see, they launch, massive views, and then there's that natural trickle-down effect over the month of launch.

319
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:27,351
Inscriptions is weird.

320
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:28,452
Theirs has gone boom, boom, boom, boom.

321
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:31,254
I assume there's some big streamers streaming their game there.

322
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:38,239
So with indie games and probably a lot of games, that natural trickle-down could eventually end up to zero viewers, basically.

323
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,451
And then we have caught the lamb.

324
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:43,153
So that first part is the soft launch.

325
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:44,936
So the viewers are going to be a little bit less.

326
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,719
And then we launch, which goes super high.

327
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,482
And then we have that natural trickle down effect like the other ones.

328
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:59,132
But one thing to notice is that our trickle down effect, it kind of stays at a decently high viewer amount, around the 20,000 mark over that first month.

329
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:16,150
I'm not trying to blow smoke up our own ass here, but we think that most likely the Twitch integration did help because it made streamers keep streaming the game, they loved the integration, they wanted to keep streaming, and viewers wanted to keep watching these streamers and check out how their viewer followers are doing and stuff.

330
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,814
And that's probably why that tail kind of doesn't hit zero.

331
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:24,473
Okay, so yeah, a few more fun numbers.

332
00:27:24,913 --> 00:27:34,975
In the first month of release we had 13,000 unique people streaming the game with over 46 million views, which is huge for an indie.

333
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:40,757
14 million unique interactors with the Twitch integration with an average of 8 clicks per interactor.

334
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:47,519
over 400,000 viewer followers created with 28,000 totem contributions.

335
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:51,601
So keeping in mind, this is just in the first month of launch of Cult of the Lamb.

336
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:54,922
So these numbers are probably in dot max value or something by now.

337
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:59,844
So this brings us to post-launch, and you might be wondering how we're going now.

338
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:05,768
Well, we're still doing well, but obviously not as well as launch, because hype dies down naturally.

339
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:11,912
There's no way to avoid that unless you build the next evergreen game like League of Legends, Counter-Strike Go, and so on.

340
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:21,779
But like Harrison said, we're still holding a pretty high viewer count, as well as a high streamer count, which is really important to Cult of the Lamb's success on Twitch, especially compared to other indie games.

341
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:25,069
Now obviously we haven't sat still since launch.

342
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:27,389
We've done a couple of major updates.

343
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:31,530
The first one during Relics of the Old Faith allows viewers to send follower messages.

344
00:28:31,891 --> 00:28:43,474
It's basically just a little native Twitch UI that you use and then your follower kind of waddles over to the streamer and shows a little speech bubble showing your message, which is really cool to interact with the streamer in a direct way.

345
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:49,618
Then you also have the follower gallery, which allows you to look at all cult followers, both NPCs and viewers.

346
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:55,182
And you basically just get to see their levels, stats, whether they're a coprophiliac and like to eat poop, for example.

347
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:55,863
Why'd you look at me?

348
00:28:57,064 --> 00:29:06,371
And they can also use that to vote, again, like I mentioned earlier, on followers when they're choosing to sacrifice or kill, convert to a demon, and so on.

349
00:29:06,951 --> 00:29:09,853
We also added some additional help or hinder options to keep things fresh.

350
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:17,795
For the next update, Sins of the Flesh, we added the ability for viewers to choose outfits during the customization process.

351
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:21,058
It's basically Cult of the Fashion at this point, where they get to look pretty.

352
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:24,201
We also added mobile support, which was a highly requested feature.

353
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:27,604
So if you remember that early slide where I showed the different extension types,

354
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:31,750
We started with the one on top, so the video overlay, meaning it's desktop only.

355
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:37,880
Then the community basically, since launch, kept asking for mobile support, so we had to add it eventually.

356
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,565
And additionally, some more help are in our options, again, to keep things fresh.

357
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:45,660
Now for the upcoming update, that's our last Twitch update.

358
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,760
It says Operation Health.

359
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:54,385
If any of you are familiar with Rainbow Six Siege, they had an Operation Health that basically just focused on fixing longstanding technical issues.

360
00:29:54,945 --> 00:30:01,849
That's what we're doing with this update as well because since launch, I had to implement quite a lot of dirty fixes on my end just to keep things running.

361
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:10,114
The aim for the technical rewrite is basically just to get rid of that and make the extension as stable as possible, make sure it holds up without any issues.

362
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:18,827
Yeah, so with Operation Health, the idea is to, and it's a little bit of a secret, but rewrite it in a way where we could use the extension for future games.

363
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:28,075
And we're not just doing the technical rewrite, we're also improving several extension flows like, for example, customizing a follower is going to be easier for viewers.

364
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:32,798
And if you play Call of the Lamb, you probably know there's a very fun minigame in there.

365
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:35,941
We're adding Twitch support for that as well, so be on the lookout for that.

366
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,723
Yeah, so as you can see here, we launched Sins of the Flesh on the 16th of January this year, so a couple of months back.

367
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,725
And keeping in mind, this is a year and a half after we originally launched Cult of the Lamb.

368
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:55,988
And yeah, so a bunch of streamers come back, hundreds of streamers, and a bunch of viewers as well, over 35,000 viewers.

369
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:59,590
And it's worth noting that all these streamers were using the Twitch integration.

370
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:04,305
Okay, so that brings us to near the end of our talk.

371
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:07,147
Here's a few other games that have Twitch integration.

372
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:10,670
So definitely worth checking them out, especially if you're interested more in Twitch integration.

373
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,693
Baldur's Gate 3 being one of the most recent and popular.

374
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:15,254
And this guy worked on it.

375
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,475
He did the Twitch integration for that.

376
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,798
We've got a few key takeaways, some of these a bit more obvious than others.

377
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,642
The first being that streamers and viewers love it.

378
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:27,745
You're not going to encounter a viewer that doesn't like Twitch integration.

379
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:36,034
And also it's worth noting that people stream it, people watch it, and then these people that watch it, they love the integration and they want to stream it themselves.

380
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:40,038
So they buy the game and then they stream it and then people watch it and it's just this vicious loop of sales.

381
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:44,697
It's also never too early or too late to start a Twitch integration.

382
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:49,379
It might be a little too early if you're still in the conceptual phase where things are changing at a rapid pace.

383
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,680
But other than that, you can pretty much add it to your game at any point.

384
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,222
Obviously, there is an ideal release window, which is early access or full release.

385
00:31:57,702 --> 00:32:05,706
But if you can't make that, then I would suggest combining that with a big content or DLC update so that they can kind of boost each other's popularity.

386
00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:07,026
Yeah.

387
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:09,387
Also, make sure to test more than we did, if you can.

388
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:11,188
What are

389
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:38,082
So all of the initial hype has died down and without an integration, viewership would probably hit zero or close to zero anyway, but we're still alive and kicking.

390
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:47,915
So thanks to the Twitch integration, even to this day, constant stories and fun little moments are created by streamers and viewers by them just interacting with the integration.

391
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:51,116
Okay, that brings us to the end.

392
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,418
Sorry for saying Twitch integration like a million times.

393
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,521
Thank you all for coming.

394
00:32:55,561 --> 00:33:01,348
A big shout out to all the GDC staff and lovely, massive monster people, Julian, Jimp, and Jojo.

395
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:04,431
My name's Harrison, and this is Thomas.

396
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:06,533
Yeah, go implement some Twitch integration.

397
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:07,615
Thanks.

398
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:25,682
Yeah, if you have any questions We've got some pins and bracelets and things that will give you a few if you ask us something Also, if you don't get to end up asking your question, we'll be outside for more questions afterwards.

399
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:25,943
Yeah

400
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,883
Yeah, great talk, amazing to see you guys.

401
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:32,185
I have two questions.

402
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:37,990
The first one is who approached who to start developing the Twitch integration?

403
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,934
And how do the updates of the game impact the viewership on Twitch?

404
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:49,120
So for the first question, the question was who approached who at the start of the project, right?

405
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,845
So like I mentioned, Clara, who works at Devolver Digital, she does influencer relations.

406
00:33:53,925 --> 00:34:05,257
She reached out to me because we previously worked on Baldur's Gate 3 together, and she basically just proposed a couple of games that she thought a Twitch integration would work well for, and then we ended up with Cult of the Lambs.

407
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,179
So the publisher in this case reached out first.

408
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:10,801
Yeah, for the second question, it was how do the updates impact the viewership?

409
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:12,522
They impacted quite a lot.

410
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:16,264
When we update, we don't just update the Twitch integration, we also update the game.

411
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:18,206
And we do a lot of marketing beats around that.

412
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:25,110
So I feel like if we just updated the Twitch integration, it probably wouldn't impact viewers as much as it would as a full game update.

413
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:32,294
But when we do a full game update with Twitch integration, it probably brings in 20,000, 30,000 viewers on Twitch.

414
00:34:32,314 --> 00:34:34,536
And that lasts for a good month or so.

415
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:36,197
Thank you.

416
00:34:37,972 --> 00:34:39,932
Hi, great talk, really enjoyed that.

417
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:44,013
I was curious, how do the streamers sort of know that there's Twitch integration?

418
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:48,174
Do you guys like advertise that ahead of time to be like, hey, come stream our game, we have integration?

419
00:34:48,674 --> 00:34:50,575
Or is that more of like a discoverable thing on Twitch?

420
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:55,236
Okay, so the question was, how do streamers discover the integration in the first place?

421
00:34:55,816 --> 00:35:06,978
So I think with Call to the Lamb, we're very lucky in the sense that we got that snowball effect going in the beginning where people just see the streamers using the integration and then just installing that on your own channel, like I said, is a matter

422
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:09,059
a couple of clicks, basically.

423
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:16,222
There is a whole marketplace, I guess you could call it, for Twitch integration, so you can look for specific game integrations.

424
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:21,765
In my opinion, there might be a little bit of discoverability issues, but I'm sure Twitch is working on that.

425
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:25,427
So it is pretty easy for streamers to get involved with the integration.

426
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:29,669
So for Call of the Lambs specifically, I guess you could say it was word of mouth, basically.

427
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:36,132
We also do have in the pause menu a Twitch button, so you can click on that and then it shows you all about the Twitch integration as well.

428
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:38,033
Cool, thank you.

429
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:41,116
So, good talk guys, thanks a lot.

430
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:51,945
When you say, obviously a streamer is going to want to interact with their community, and the fact that the extension provides that is a huge value for them.

431
00:35:52,765 --> 00:36:03,474
Do you know, or are you provided by Twitch any statistics, like hard data, as to whether or not the use of the extension actually improved viewership or retention for their channels?

432
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:11,760
Okay, so the question is, does Twitch provide stats on probably how the extension is doing and how it would compare without the extension, if I understand correctly?

433
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,665
Yeah, like if their viewership was higher than normal while they were using the game with the extension?

434
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:20,827
I don't think they have those numbers specifically.

435
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:25,971
Twitch does offer a lot of analytics for your extension specifically to see how many streamers installed it and so on.

436
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:28,092
That specific

437
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:46,599
detail of data I don't think you can get but also conceptually it's kind of hard to gauge how an integration or how the game would be doing without the integration because it either exists with the integration or without it so you can't even compare one streamer to another because it's basically apples and oranges at that point.

438
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay, thank you.

439
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,641
They do offer some stats but I'm not sure if you can get that deep into it.

440
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:52,341
Okay, thanks a lot.

441
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:55,591
Hello.

442
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:56,292
Great talk.

443
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:58,014
Love the game.

444
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:01,597
So, kind of a couple questions I was thinking about.

445
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:08,283
Is there a lot of update or upkeep, I would say, with Twitch integration post-launch?

446
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,707
Like, you mentioned patching the servers when testing and stuff.

447
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:26,738
Do things like that kind of come up consistently, like when you're getting a lot of traffic through the Twitch integration, or a lot of people are using it, or just maybe errors happening like that, like post-launch and keeping up with it?

448
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,702
Yep, so the question was, does it require a lot of upkeep, Twitch integration, post-launch?

449
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:43,009
I would say in Call to the Lamb, at the start it did, just because of the popularity we had and I had to implement all kinds of weird fixes that I kind of regret now, but you know, you do what you have to do.

450
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:52,455
So in that sense it did require a bit of upkeep, but in normal scenarios, so let's take Baldur's Gate 3 for example, that barely requires any updates

451
00:37:53,095 --> 00:38:01,138
The most updates I had to do was during their early access period, where they had these big content updates, like for example, adding a whole new class like a Druid or something.

452
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:09,061
So that did require some upkeep, but that's more upkeep in the sense of basically just supporting new data or updating texture sheets and so on.

453
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,882
Yeah, like when doing big updates for the game.

454
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:19,605
Luckily, Twitch doesn't change their APIs that often, and they also communicate it well beforehand, so you know what to expect

455
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:23,527
within a couple of months if you do need to update something down the line.

456
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:26,450
Sorry, kind of quick follow-up.

457
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,792
And I know Massive Monster is pretty small studio-wise.

458
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:35,376
Like, the game that just launched my development team in early access, like, were eight people.

459
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:38,478
So this is something super interesting to think about.

460
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:43,502
And I'm kind of thinking, like, oh, God, if I go to my programmers and producer, are they going to be like, hell no?

461
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,685
So the question, I guess the question was, like,

462
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,969
How much work was it on you?

463
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:51,030
Yeah, how much work, yeah.

464
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,473
So when we launched Call of the Lamb, I'd say there was probably like five, six, seven of us.

465
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,055
So it wasn't a huge team.

466
00:38:58,396 --> 00:39:00,798
On the game integration side, it wasn't that much.

467
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:02,479
At least I didn't feel like it was that much.

468
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,241
And I did majority of it.

469
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:05,622
There was a bit of UI I wanted to do.

470
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,984
It was mostly Thomas.

471
00:39:08,004 --> 00:39:09,405
He had to do a lot of the heavy lifting.

472
00:39:09,685 --> 00:39:11,627
So if you find yourself with Thomas, you should be OK.

473
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,270
If you're going to do it all yourself, that's probably a bit of work.

474
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:16,671
But yeah.

475
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:17,151
Awesome.

476
00:39:17,412 --> 00:39:17,752
Thank you.

477
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:19,879
Hello.

478
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,800
Thank you very much for the game.

479
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:27,141
I have enjoyed it immensely, both as someone viewing streamers play and as a non-streamer player.

480
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:35,784
I was curious about some of the tools that you talked about for testing the integration without having to actually use Twitch.

481
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:40,526
I'm guessing that the game shell probably

482
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:52,456
doesn't take too long to develop given that it's mostly just API calls and stuff, but simulating the actual Twitch environment, how long did it take to develop that tool?

483
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:59,617
So the question is, how long did it take to develop the extension debugger specifically that I showed during the talk?

484
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:05,000
That's kind of hard to answer because it's still an ongoing thing, I would say.

485
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:17,727
So basically, the way Twitch extensions work is that you include a helper script that Twitch provides, and that allows you to hook into Twitch API features like requesting a follow, requesting your identity to be shared, all of that stuff.

486
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:27,556
So it's basically a matter of me looking at that helper and kind of, like, reworking that to work locally, basically just mimicking all of its functionality.

487
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:30,519
So it did take quite a while to develop.

488
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:39,467
If you're a game developer and not really, like, niched down into this, I would recommend not even starting on that because it is quite a lot of work.

489
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:40,448
Fair enough.

490
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:41,268
Thank you very much.

491
00:40:43,629 --> 00:40:43,869
Hi.

492
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:55,380
I was wondering, as a UX researcher, what kind of, to come up with the cool shit that you guys made, like, what kind of, you know, what did that ideation process look like?

493
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,246
Was there some concept testing with users from the soft launch or beforehand?

494
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:04,149
You know, was there like play testing of the integration?

495
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:04,910
Yeah.

496
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:10,372
Yeah, so the question was like, was there playtesting and whatnot?

497
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:15,214
How did we come up with the ideas and stuff for the Twitch integration, if I heard correctly?

498
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:19,516
Well, I wasn't really a part of the actual initial design.

499
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:24,417
I think it was a lot of communications between Thomas and the directors with the design, maybe a bit of Devolver as well.

500
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:27,999
When it comes to the updates for the Twitch integration,

501
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:32,322
We did a lot, I kind of went through a bunch of streamers playing Call of the Lamb.

502
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:35,324
I was like, hey, what would you like to see in the Twitch integration?

503
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:47,734
And as well as we have like a community manager that, yeah, like brings all that information in and you kind of just hear as the game exists, people like, hey, we want mobile support for the Twitch integration and whatnot.

504
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:50,656
So that's kind of how we come across the ideas for updating it.

505
00:41:50,896 --> 00:41:56,958
Specifically for coming up with the initial feature set, I would say that there was no, like, formalized process, let's say.

506
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:01,919
We pretty much just came up with features that I ended up pitching in an initial meeting.

507
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:04,219
That is pretty much what we ended up with.

508
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:16,082
So I think it's also a matter of just looking at the game, what fits into the spirit of the game, and basically just finding a natural fit for integration features rather than, like, trying to shoehorn them into the game.

509
00:42:16,342 --> 00:42:16,442
Right.

510
00:42:16,562 --> 00:42:17,403
What works for a cult.

511
00:42:18,383 --> 00:42:18,703
Thank you.

512
00:42:18,923 --> 00:42:19,223
Thank you.

513
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:21,585
Hi.

514
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:23,826
Similar question, or kind of off of that.

515
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:30,788
Do you know which features possibly had the most impact on viewer retention and stuff like that?

516
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:37,850
And then kind of more extrapolated from that, are there any kind of advice you can give to those of us looking to do a Twitch integration?

517
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,571
Like, don't bother focusing on X, Y, Z features.

518
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:44,012
These are the ones that will probably be the most bang for your buck if you have a limited time.

519
00:42:44,716 --> 00:42:49,897
Yeah, so the question is, what features basically was the best in a way for Twitch integration?

520
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:57,219
I would say the viewer followers were absolutely the best, because that just made the viewers really connected with the streamer.

521
00:42:57,279 --> 00:43:01,180
They were in the game, there was like a million reasons for them to come back and keep watching the streamer.

522
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:10,622
So if there's any way that you can implement the viewers, I guess permanently, into the game that the streamers are playing, then I reckon that would probably be the best bet.

523
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:19,226
Yeah, allowing viewers to express themselves in game through NPCs or something is, I think, the best feature you can go for if you only get to choose one.

524
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:27,389
In terms of success, I would rate the feature set for Call of the Lamb as viewer followers, then help or hinder, and then totem contributions.

525
00:43:27,669 --> 00:43:34,872
They all kind of feed into each other, but if you have to pick one, pick something that allows viewers to become visible in the game in some kind of way.

526
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:35,432
That's cool.

527
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:35,893
Thank you.

528
00:43:36,253 --> 00:43:36,533
Thank you.

529
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:50,302
Hi, I'm working on my own little itty-bitty Twitch integration project and I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the thought process behind like balancing between the average three viewer Joe and like the handful of really big streamers.

530
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:51,863
I think much.

531
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:53,564
Oh, I need to repeat the question first.

532
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:59,606
So the question was how do you balance a Twitch integration compared to basically the balance of the game, right?

533
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:00,806
I think it's

534
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:08,874
Much like game balance, I guess it's, I'm not a game designer myself, but I think it's more of an art rather than like a science.

535
00:44:09,294 --> 00:44:19,497
So in general, like I said, during the talk, I would stray away from, for example, giving the streamer or during the Twitch integration, like a lot of resources or something like that.

536
00:44:19,577 --> 00:44:28,579
So if anything, make things harder for them, make them suffer a little, it's probably gonna cause viewership to increase anyway, because people like to see people suffer.

537
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:31,460
Well, apparently not because people like to help instead of, you know.

538
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,202
So, yeah, no real tangible answer there, I'm afraid.

539
00:44:36,262 --> 00:44:37,683
It's basically just an art.

540
00:44:38,663 --> 00:44:39,063
Yeah.

541
00:44:39,463 --> 00:44:39,764
Thank you.

542
00:44:41,024 --> 00:44:41,204
Hi.

543
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:42,245
Thanks for the talk.

544
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:43,005
It was fantastic.

545
00:44:43,045 --> 00:44:43,925
Loved every minute of it.

546
00:44:45,146 --> 00:44:58,372
So, can you go a little bit more in depth about what you would have done if you had more time for testing, either tech side, like what processes you would have taken, or design wise, like how you would have used that data?

547
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:05,434
Yeah, so the question is, what would we have done a bit better if we had more time for testing or if we just tested better, really?

548
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:07,816
So we didn't have a QA at the time.

549
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:16,022
So we had like a QA company, but they were focused on testing the game because we still had quite a couple of little bugs in the actual game itself.

550
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:17,684
So yeah, that was the focus.

551
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:22,507
So we didn't test the Twitch integration too much besides just playing it ourselves, I'd probably say.

552
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:27,651
And the issue with the integration was, yeah, the high server load and whatnot.

553
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:33,856
And I hadn't actually really done server-related code stuff before, so I was sending way too many calls and things.

554
00:45:34,157 --> 00:45:36,779
So that's something that I've learned now is to not DDoS the server.

555
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:40,742
But yeah, I guess we would just test thoroughly.

556
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:44,324
Maybe we would test how many calls we're sending a bit more as well.

557
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:48,868
Maybe debug that a bit better, because I know there was points where I'm like, oh, yeah, you're right.

558
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:50,409
I am sending 1,000 calls a second.

559
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,832
And yeah, like the traffic, I'm not really sure.

560
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:55,993
Do you have a way to like simulate?

561
00:45:56,013 --> 00:46:05,620
There are ways to like simulate a lot of traffic, but nothing can really get you to production level type of traffic, even like with the big tools out there.

562
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:13,966
Plus also just simulating traffic in of itself isn't enough because you're always going to run into weird edge cases that only happen in production.

563
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:17,988
So yeah, in a nutshell, more play testing, I guess, and

564
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:26,290
at least trying to simulate production traffic using tools like artillery or I think there's one called K6 or something, so yeah.

565
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:26,772
Okay, thank you.

566
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:27,113
Thank you.

567
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:28,863
Hello.

568
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:32,206
First of all, I really want to thank you all for doing the talk today.

569
00:46:32,546 --> 00:46:33,507
I really appreciate that.

570
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:52,661
As a visual UI artist, I'm curious on how you implement a lot of the UI stuff in terms of really making it clear to streamers how to be able to use these features as well as also be able to really use them to interact with their viewers.

571
00:46:53,874 --> 00:46:56,457
Yeah, so the question is around developing the UI.

572
00:46:57,058 --> 00:47:02,445
Would you say that developing the UI of both the game or the integration on the Twitch side, or just the game?

573
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:04,007
Mainly just the game.

574
00:47:04,307 --> 00:47:04,687
Just the game?

575
00:47:04,928 --> 00:47:09,313
Yeah, so with the game UI, we kind of just use the UI in Cog the Lamb is very

576
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:11,095
We use it everywhere.

577
00:47:11,135 --> 00:47:13,576
We try to use the same stuff, if that makes sense.

578
00:47:14,136 --> 00:47:14,937
I didn't do the UI.

579
00:47:16,237 --> 00:47:18,859
The developer Will did, so I can't answer too much about it.

580
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,941
But in the sense that we try to do less is more, really.

581
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:24,061
We keep it really clean.

582
00:47:24,562 --> 00:47:32,686
One of the things that we implemented, which you probably didn't see in that video because we didn't launch with it, I don't think, is that when the viewers are creating a follower,

583
00:47:33,446 --> 00:47:36,227
The streamer actually sees their little follow being updated in real time.

584
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:44,909
This was super handy because sometimes the viewers have like they're left They've left the channel and they've won the raffle and the streamers just sitting there like what do we do now?

585
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:45,810
I were just waiting for him.

586
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,091
So by having the little viewer follower update in real time.

587
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:50,051
It was just it was a good way of

588
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,892
Keeping that going, yeah.

589
00:47:52,192 --> 00:47:53,372
Hopefully that answered it a little bit.

590
00:47:53,412 --> 00:48:00,856
In terms of initial discoverability from within the game for the Twitch integration, you basically can't miss it.

591
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:05,559
It's in the pause menu, like a big-ass Twitch purple button, so it's kind of hard to miss.

592
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:17,605
I would definitely add an in-game section on that where you basically just connect your game, manage settings and all that, and from there you can send them to the extension on Twitch itself, which you can just link to and have them install it that way.

593
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,326
Awesome, thanks so much.

594
00:48:19,526 --> 00:48:19,806
Thank you.

595
00:48:21,957 --> 00:48:23,278
Hi there, great talk.

596
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:31,926
So you said that Devolver approached you and gave you a couple of games that they thought would be good for Twitch integration.

597
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:48,560
So was that something that Massive Monster had planned from the beginning, was to have Twitch integration, or was it something that Devolver approached you with and said, hey, we think that Twitch integration would be good for you, and then y'all accepted it, or was it something that was pushed on you?

598
00:48:49,028 --> 00:48:56,033
Okay, so the question was, did Devolver approach me with Massive Monster wanting to implement Twitch integrations beforehand?

599
00:48:56,454 --> 00:48:56,634
Right.

600
00:48:56,894 --> 00:48:57,675
Okay.

601
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,117
I can't speak to that, but I assume no.

602
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:10,144
It's been a while, but I don't think Twitch integration was on their roadmap at all, because like Harrison said, they were just still very focused on just finishing the game and polishing it.

603
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:15,929
So it basically was Clara's idea from Devolver, and she kind of pitched it to them.

604
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:19,614
while I pitched the ideas to her, and then we all got into a meeting together.

605
00:49:20,235 --> 00:49:20,515
Got it.

606
00:49:20,676 --> 00:49:20,956
Thank you.

607
00:49:21,156 --> 00:49:21,597
Thank you.

608
00:49:22,678 --> 00:49:23,339
Hi, great talk.

609
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:25,743
I'm doing similar thing in Japan.

610
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:29,889
So did you think about any monetization through these streaming features?

611
00:49:31,276 --> 00:49:31,357
I'm

612
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,138
the extension gets a little bit.

613
00:49:51,158 --> 00:50:00,304
So an extension developer, any bits that are used within the context of an extension, the extension developer gets 30%, if I remember correctly, and the streamer gets 70% of that.

614
00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:06,509
Like Harrison said, we had to disable bits transactions, especially at launch, because there were too many issues with it.

615
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:10,292
And obviously, cheating people out of their money feels bad for everyone involved.

616
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,475
I would also probably not count on

617
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:21,587
How did you decide to, with limited resources, do a desktop extension versus a mobile extension, and how should other gamers or developers plan that?

618
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:52,447
Yeah, so the question was, like, why did we decide to do desktop rather than mobile or not doing mobile additionally?

619
00:50:54,148 --> 00:51:02,933
Mostly everyone is, or I'd say, what, like 90% of people are using Twitch on their PC when they're interacting with, like, in the chat and stuff.

620
00:51:02,953 --> 00:51:05,214
I feel like mobile, it's not as easy.

621
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:08,436
You kind of have to, like, hide the stream to interact.

622
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:17,664
Yeah, it just makes more sense for us to do it for PC and not worry about Mobile too much for the game integration.

623
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:18,825
It's nothing at all me.

624
00:51:18,985 --> 00:51:30,434
It's up to him to do them the mobile So it was like I guess it was just not really something that we needed to worry about too much to start with Yeah, but then we did get a lot of people requesting the extension of mobile.

625
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,455
So like yeah sure and

626
00:51:31,815 --> 00:51:46,105
The people requesting it were probably a vocal minority, so I would say Twitch doesn't make this information public, so I don't know for sure, but definitely the overwhelming majority of the people who are interacting with your integration do so on desktop.

627
00:51:46,185 --> 00:51:52,970
So people were asking for mobile, but I would recommend against implementing a mobile integration, at least at launch.

628
00:51:53,130 --> 00:52:00,776
Just launch with another type of extension, see how people interact with it, and then you can add mobile down the line if people are actually asking for it.

629
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:01,977
Perfect, thanks.

630
00:52:04,504 --> 00:52:08,667
Hello, I thank you for like the talk and also your game is like super funny.

631
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:34,004
I have seen myself die and all of my friends streams But I just wanted to ask you guys like like since after launch was was your like Connection between streamers like enhanced and have you taken like more feedback from streamers particularly in like the twitch integration features and have you implemented like Any changes or has it influenced any of the design choices that you made with these twitch integrations?

632
00:52:34,724 --> 00:52:42,128
Yes, so the question was, like, did we interact with the streamers that were using the Twitch integration, and did we listen to some feedback and stuff like that for future updates?

633
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:43,429
No, no.

634
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:45,190
The answer is yes, we definitely did.

635
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:51,794
Like I said, we have a community manager that, you know, that's, like, their job is to discuss and chat with streamers and whatnot.

636
00:52:52,454 --> 00:52:55,476
Of course, streamers, whenever streamers have issues with the Twitch integration,

637
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:56,036
to

638
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:14,775
talk with as many streamers as we can really.

639
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:29,467
I think it's mainly a combination of both just talking to streamers but also like kind of instinctively feeling what kind of features would work well and what kind of features would need to be updated at some point to be valuable to streamers and viewers.

640
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:29,887
Yeah.

641
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:31,108
Thank you so much.

642
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:31,669
Thank you.

643
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:34,614
Hi.

644
00:53:35,656 --> 00:53:36,617
Thanks for the talk.

645
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:47,474
I was wondering, how do you manage feedback, especially when it's negative, when you have such a short period for testing and fixing before launching?

646
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:51,510
So the question was, how do we manage feedback?

647
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,231
What was the testing?

648
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:57,177
Yeah, like, how do you manage feedback when you have, like, such a short period of time?

649
00:53:57,698 --> 00:53:58,099
Oh, yeah.

650
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:05,648
Yeah, so it was hard, because we were, like, fixing lots of bugs from Kotlin as well as, like, oh, there was these Twitch integration issues.

651
00:54:06,729 --> 00:54:11,931
So it's really just prioritizing the feedback, getting as much of it as we can.

652
00:54:12,071 --> 00:54:18,733
At the time, we didn't have a community manager, so it was all of us just listening to people streaming and stuff like that.

653
00:54:19,473 --> 00:54:32,497
During that week of soft launch, we were all basically sitting in Twitch streams and just watching and stuff like that, just getting all the feedback in, fixing stuff basically as quick as we could, and then just pumping out updates straight away once we fixed stuff.

654
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:33,537
for you.

655
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:54,857
Fortunately, when it came to the actual design feedback, we got a little bit.

656
00:54:54,997 --> 00:55:02,041
That thing I was mentioning about the followers and updating, that was a big one because streamers were like, I don't know what's going on.

657
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:02,702
It's just like a wheel.

658
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:03,642
They're just waiting.

659
00:55:03,962 --> 00:55:07,405
And sometimes viewers take five minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and they're just waiting.

660
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:09,506
So yeah, that was pretty important.

661
00:55:10,887 --> 00:55:11,227
Thank you.

662
00:55:13,148 --> 00:55:14,009
He was there first.

663
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,112
Thank you for the talk, very eye-opening.

664
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:23,020
Thomas, are you taking appointments this week?

665
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:23,861
I am.

666
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:25,184
Find me outside.

667
00:55:25,224 --> 00:55:25,945
That's why he's here.

668
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:27,128
Thank you.

669
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:28,330
Sponsored.

670
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:40,646
I was curious if there were any features for the Twitch integration that were scrapped while testing or maybe after post-launch.

671
00:55:41,386 --> 00:55:42,467
And there's a second part.

672
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:48,992
Are you thinking of using these integration features for any other streaming platforms or is it just Twitch?

673
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:55,246
So the first question was, did we scrap any features we came up with at the start?

674
00:55:55,867 --> 00:56:01,134
And the second question is, are we looking into providing this integration for other streaming platforms?

675
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:04,218
For the first question, I don't think we scrapped anything.

676
00:56:04,258 --> 00:56:07,903
I think we pretty much just hit the nail on the head right away with the features that we wanted.

677
00:56:09,104 --> 00:56:11,426
I can't think of anything that we had to scrap.

678
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:28,280
Probably some of the weirder help or hinder options that I suggested during the pitching stage, because obviously they need to be implemented by Harrison and the team at some point, so I usually think pie in the sky when I pitch stuff, but obviously there's also the real life world where they actually need to be coded and implemented.

679
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,220
Yeah, I don't think we actually scrapped anything.

680
00:56:30,321 --> 00:56:37,343
We kind of just... I think Calderland was fortunately quite an easy game to do Twitch integration for, like with the design.

681
00:56:37,383 --> 00:56:40,224
So we were pretty set in stone with the features, yeah.

682
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:49,226
As for the second question, providing this integration on other platforms, like I mentioned during the talk, Twitch is kind of really ahead of any competitors when it comes to this kind of stuff.

683
00:56:49,286 --> 00:56:57,049
So while you could do some of these things, for example, help or hinder by just voting through chat commands on YouTube or Kick or whatever,

684
00:56:57,529 --> 00:56:57,749
Thank you.

685
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,169
Hey guys, great talk.

686
00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:23,051
I'll be using a lot of this information to convince some stakeholders later, so thank you.

687
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,852
I just want to ask one question.

688
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:30,895
Thomas mentioned the server, so do you need a server to use these Twitch extension features or is it kind of an extra just to make it run smoother?

689
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:39,566
It kind of depends on what you want to build, how you're building it, and if you're working with me or not.

690
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:47,972
Because if you're just building your Twitch integration on your own, there certainly are tools that allow you to just connect directly to Twitch.

691
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:53,696
For example, with the channel points thing, they have a whole event subsystem that your game can connect to directly.

692
00:57:53,996 --> 00:57:59,961
They're also working on a, basically just like a Twitch SDK that you can use in your game.

693
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:03,503
I think it's in closed beta right now, but don't quote me on that, but it does exist.

694
00:58:04,904 --> 00:58:13,731
The way I approach it is that I write all of these backend services to make talking to Twitch, let's say, as easy and frictionless as possible.

695
00:58:14,112 --> 00:58:22,078
So for example, if Harrison were to have to implement Twitch authentication himself, meaning linking a Twitch channel to the game,

696
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:26,219
He would have to run a redirect server himself locally.

697
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:29,320
There's a whole OAuth flow you need to take into consideration.

698
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:36,982
So being able to abstract that away to separate backend services makes the game integration a lot easier for the developers I work with.

699
00:58:37,022 --> 00:58:40,904
But it certainly can be done yourself if you're just going at it solo.

700
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:42,164
Thank you very much.

701
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:42,224
Hi.

702
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:48,062
You mentioned game balance.

703
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:56,907
I suppose it's pretty complicated to give power to the viewer while at the same time maintaining the game balance.

704
00:58:57,627 --> 00:59:05,252
After this first experience, if you have to do it again, would you still try to really maintain the game balance and maintain the game as it is?

705
00:59:06,112 --> 00:59:14,057
Or at the opposite, maybe try something a little bit more crazy and say, okay, let's develop another way to play the game if you are a streamer and

706
00:59:14,597 --> 00:59:16,358
Yeah, keep the game balanced in some way.

707
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:34,191
do with

708
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:57,461
I guess if you tell the streamer that that's going to be the case and you make it obvious that, yeah, I guess it's, um, you want it to be fun.

709
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:59,602
So screw it, right?

710
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:01,562
But yeah, balance is pretty important as well.

711
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:02,482
Yeah.

712
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:02,762
Sorry.

713
01:00:02,842 --> 01:00:09,564
Also, if you make things that make the balance go out of whack, you're probably designing features that are like really crazy.

714
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:14,705
But then that goes back to my earlier point where you don't want to alienate players who aren't streaming.

715
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,225
So they don't get to experience that.

716
01:00:16,285 --> 01:00:18,366
So I'd probably advise against that.

717
01:00:18,506 --> 01:00:18,746
Yeah.

718
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:19,666
Okay.

719
01:00:19,746 --> 01:00:20,046
Thank you.

720
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:20,526
Thank you.

721
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:23,213
I think that's it.

722
01:00:24,095 --> 01:00:24,997
Cool.

723
01:00:25,037 --> 01:00:25,839
Thanks, everyone.
