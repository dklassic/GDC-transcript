1
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:17,111
Hello, everyone. Nice to see you here. We are very honored to give this talk at the

2
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:24,236
GDC. Our topic is hair art in games, aesthetics difference between Eastern and Western. Thanks

3
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:29,059
for coming our speech. So first, let me introduce the speakers.

4
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:36,404
I am Nora Xiaoying Fu, is currently the lead character artist in Justice Mobile project

5
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:43,068
and the character specialist in Justice Online project at NetEase Thunderfile Studio.

6
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:50,333
I used to work at Digital Extremes as a character artist in Warframe project

7
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,555
and at EA Mobile Canada as a 3D artist.

8
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:58,846
Hi, I'm Hao, and I'm now currently a senior research

9
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:02,688
researcher at NetEase Thunderfire UX department.

10
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:06,589
Recent projects I have worked on includes Justice Online,

11
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:11,311
Mobile Duel, Uno Mobile, and Naraka Playpoint.

12
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:16,174
Nora will give the first half of the speech,

13
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:18,835
and Luo will give the next half.

14
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:21,976
Thanks for coming.

15
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:22,856
So let's start.

16
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:22,977
Yeah.

17
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,072
Yeah, okay, let's start our speech.

18
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:30,597
So as a media art loved by people all over the world,

19
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:32,980
games show different art styles.

20
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,204
When we make next generation games,

21
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:40,188
we often pay attention to the effects of characters

22
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:43,031
and the hair is a very important part of it.

23
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:48,709
What's interesting is there are many aesthetic similarities

24
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,570
and differences between Western and Eastern themes games

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,211
based on cultural background.

26
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:59,191
I'm fortunate to have worked in different game companies

27
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:02,492
in Canada and China, and have participated

28
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:06,473
in games of different art styles in different game fields

29
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:07,673
from East to West.

30
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:12,934
Here, I have collected some experience.

31
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:24,199
I have collected some working experience and find some interesting points to share with you with my partner.

32
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,462
There are many points and this talk will focus on the aspect of the hair.

33
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:37,106
So first, let's review the trends of hair design in video games in recent decades.

34
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:41,135
With the development of the technology,

35
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:43,696
especially the hardware improvement,

36
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,458
the game performance have been rapidly developed.

37
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,019
Therefore, artists are all allowed

38
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,741
to present their design more freely.

39
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,442
So hair has been shown very differently

40
00:02:57,442 --> 00:03:02,285
at different historical stages of the game development,

41
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:04,946
becoming more refined and diverse.

42
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:13,844
We can see this changing trend from the tumble ride in 1990s

43
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:17,307
to the metal gear solid in 2000s

44
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:19,889
until the recent last of us.

45
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,231
In the games of 1990s,

46
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:28,896
since the hardware can only support very few triangles,

47
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,799
the hairstyles are also very simple

48
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,721
without the texture of hair.

49
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:39,399
With the improvement of hardware, in the 2000s,

50
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:42,441
the games have been able to support

51
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:47,805
a small number of haircuts with transparent hair textures.

52
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:52,448
And now, the hardware have been able to support

53
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,631
very high triangles and a large number of alpha test

54
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:58,613
and alpha blend transparent maps.

55
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,996
So artists are also better able to design and create

56
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,717
more complex hairstyles.

57
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:09,783
The same changes have been experienced in the Eastern game

58
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:17,725
industry, from Audition Online to Nalika Blade Chop Point,

59
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:21,166
and Justice Online Mobile in development stage.

60
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:25,986
The hair design is becoming more and more complex,

61
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:29,107
and the details, both on the texture

62
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:33,408
and its dynamic performance, are increased rapidly.

63
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:45,437
So, games have accompanied many players since their childhood.

64
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:53,042
We can see that in most games, the hair designs are mostly derived from hairstyles used in people's

65
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:59,987
daily life, extracting the elements from reality and using it for characters.

66
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:03,510
Whether in the early games like Resident Evil,

67
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:10,366
or the games released in recent year, such as Cyberpunk 2077.

68
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:17,151
The hairstyles of the characters are very common

69
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,494
in real life, which makes the players feel

70
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:24,737
that these characters are the people living around them,

71
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:27,239
looks familiar in appearance

72
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,380
and creates a sense of immersion.

73
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:36,517
At the same time, the design of character in games

74
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:40,578
is not only extracting elements from real life,

75
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:44,419
but some special designs are also affecting

76
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,080
the public aesthetics.

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,141
In 2000s, when Audition Online was the most popular game

78
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:57,182
in Chinese market, many stars have the similar haircuts

79
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,683
with Audition Online style.

80
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,493
Similar hairstyles can often have been seen in street,

81
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:11,836
becoming a very fashionable style of the era.

82
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:16,218
Today's gamers have more requirements for game quality.

83
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:19,760
They not only want to customizing the face

84
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,221
and the body in the game,

85
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:24,243
but also matching the different hairstyles

86
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,483
with their temperament.

87
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:34,070
Therefore, hairstyle art is very important to highlight the personality of the character.

88
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:41,454
Take Natty's Nalika Blade point as an example. In this game, players can not only customize the

89
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:49,199
character's face, but also can choose different hair colors and styles to increase the sense of

90
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,879
immersion.

91
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:56,283
And some games, such as NetEase Tianyu Mobile,

92
00:06:56,283 --> 00:07:01,686
go a step further to providing more diversity,

93
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:07,689
such as custom sub-regional dyeing function for hair color.

94
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,392
Many players are willing to spend much time on it.

95
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:20,777
In terms of hair styling design and production,

96
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:25,801
there are many interesting similarities and differences

97
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:28,883
between Eastern theme and Western theme games.

98
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:33,626
Next, I will use several games produced by our net ease

99
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,828
as representative of the Eastern game

100
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:42,892
theme to compare with the game cases from Western theme.

101
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:45,114
Let's look at the similarity first.

102
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:53,239
In terms of art design, hair style design is implementable in game.

103
00:07:53,239 --> 00:08:00,982
Whether Eastern or Western, the designs are all extracting from the elements of actual hair styles in life.

104
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:06,905
Then we are creating, like blades and short hair.

105
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,677
In the ancient Chinese theme games Justice Online,

106
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:17,921
which background is in Song dynasty a thousand years ago,

107
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:21,424
there are also some design elements

108
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:27,209
extracting from daily life, such as the blades

109
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:28,631
and the curly hair.

110
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:32,230
The examples go on and on.

111
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,833
From above, we can easily feel that whether it's

112
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,796
Eastern or Western, the design of hairstyle

113
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:44,039
are not rhythm or baseless, but created

114
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,161
with elements in real life.

115
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:54,286
Moreover, the biggest similarity in game industry

116
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,568
is the application of technology.

117
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:04,121
No matter which project, the main way to make in-game hair is haircut method.

118
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:14,275
With the improvement of the hardware, some game developers also use dynamic hair simulation to present better dynamic effects.

119
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:21,208
The hair cut method is a mostly wide use practice

120
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,389
in the game industry.

121
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,172
The vast majority of in-game hairstyles

122
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:30,455
use this technique to create hair.

123
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:34,638
Hair cuts can make very rich and complex shapes.

124
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:37,080
At the same time, especially combined

125
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,602
with a close simulation or dynamic ball,

126
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:44,205
it makes the movement of the hair more natural and smoother.

127
00:09:45,067 --> 00:10:10,901
So let's take a look at this video for our Justice Mobile project first to see how it works.

128
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:18,447
Come on, little tiger, let me tie a knot for you.

129
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:25,250
In this real-time rendering video,

130
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,971
the cat's fur and the girl's hair

131
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,072
are made with hair cut method.

132
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:33,994
In combination with Unity cloth simulation,

133
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:37,976
which achieves a natural motion effect

134
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:40,016
when hair touching the body.

135
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:44,475
And the calculation amount is also very slow,

136
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:52,380
making it easily running on the mobile phone.

137
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,162
Another method is dynamic hair simulation,

138
00:10:56,162 --> 00:11:01,425
best known as AMD Tracefax Hair, an Unreal Engine hair

139
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:03,486
rendering and simulation system.

140
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:09,038
Use a bundle-based workflow to rendering each hair

141
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:11,420
with physical accurate motion.

142
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,282
It enables the creation of hairstyles

143
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:19,926
to be simulated in real time, rendering hundreds of thousands

144
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,927
or more of the realistic hair.

145
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:27,932
In this video, the hair is used AMD Transpax technology.

146
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,371
Although the technology is the same,

147
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:42,752
when making different hairstyles in different themed games

148
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:46,934
between West and East, the focus on hair design aesthetics

149
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,396
and the gameplay in the game are different.

150
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:54,178
So what is the aesthetics difference

151
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:57,179
between Eastern and Western hairstyles?

152
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,761
Before showing the case, please allow

153
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,702
me to extend some Eastern and Western differences

154
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,003
in traditional painting.

155
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:10,382
I believe that everyone who has visited

156
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:11,983
a Western classical painting

157
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:14,684
and an ancient Chinese painting in a museum

158
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:19,606
will find that there are great differences between them two.

159
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,528
It's two completely different systems.

160
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:27,866
Relatively speaking, Western classical painting

161
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:30,347
focus on lighting and shadow,

162
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:33,549
perspective and anatomical structure,

163
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:38,492
which tend to present the reality in painting.

164
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,134
Whether figures or landscapes,

165
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:43,415
Western classical painting express

166
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,676
the material world and the reality.

167
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:52,374
So to speak, Western aesthetics mainly focus on creating,

168
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:56,696
recreating and attaches great importance to realism.

169
00:12:56,696 --> 00:13:03,100
In contrast, the Eastern ancient painting

170
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,042
are not more about describing the real world,

171
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:11,384
but a kind of expression of personal feelings.

172
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:14,006
Take ancient Chinese painting as an example.

173
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:17,409
This is a part of China's national treasure,

174
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:21,911
a thousand miles of rivers and mountains

175
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:25,472
from Northern Song dynasty more than a thousand years ago.

176
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:31,915
When we feel the beauty of the, we can feel the beauty of the landscape

177
00:13:31,915 --> 00:13:35,596
from painting, but the landscape are completely

178
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:40,719
inconsistent with light and shadow, perspective and structure.

179
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,720
This is the most important point of Chinese painting.

180
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:46,598
Feeling expression.

181
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:50,499
Realism is neither needed nor value

182
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:52,819
in Chinese traditional painting.

183
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:56,400
In fact, you can't find such a mountain like that at all.

184
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,521
And this blue color on the top of mountain

185
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:03,562
is also impossible in natural reality.

186
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:06,743
But we can still feel the same feeling

187
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:10,124
as when the author painting.

188
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:10,924
That is beauty.

189
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:15,556
Due to this difference in Eastern and Western aesthetics,

190
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:20,359
the difference between reproducing reality

191
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:25,183
and the expression emotions, the difference in hair design

192
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:27,945
aesthetics is caused.

193
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:31,107
And it is also the difference in players' acceptance

194
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:34,890
of hair aesthetics between Eastern and Western-themed

195
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,190
games.

196
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:41,855
Therefore, Western themed games focus on realism,

197
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:44,298
restore the shape in real life,

198
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:48,144
and pay more attention to the sense of reality,

199
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:50,908
such as the main character's hairstyle changing

200
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:52,791
during the fighting process.

201
00:14:53,387 --> 00:15:00,351
Taking Last of Us 2 as an example, the shape of the hair is consistent with reality.

202
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:08,035
The hair roots are distinct. The material is very realistic. The surrounding broken hair is

203
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:12,998
clearly shown. And some shorter hair are struggled after the battle,

204
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:17,480
which is very realistic and physically true.

205
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:25,097
When seeing this, players will price the sense of reality.

206
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:28,638
On the other hand, many Oriental-themed games

207
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:33,061
consider the styling and the production of hair

208
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:36,983
from another direction, and will pay more attention

209
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:41,305
to the silhouette, outline, and the beauty of the styling,

210
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:45,947
while sacrificing part of the realism and the rationality.

211
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:56,979
Take three Chinese style games produced by our NetEase Thunderfire Studio, for example.

212
00:15:56,979 --> 00:16:04,503
They are Justice Online, Narca Blade Point, Wangchuan Fenghua Lu.

213
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:12,847
So whether it is a realistic art style or a two-dimensional art style game,

214
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,070
The hair design tended to pay more attention

215
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,391
to the beauty of the silhouette, shape, and the line,

216
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:25,253
sacrificing part of the realistic feel.

217
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:29,274
In Justice Online, on the left, her hairstyle

218
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:33,395
is using lines to form a silhouette.

219
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:36,776
But if it's in real life, shouldn't it

220
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:39,637
hand down under the influence of gravity?

221
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:44,559
Narika played in the middle as another example.

222
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,921
So many decorations look so heavy.

223
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:52,383
Isn't she afraid that her precious golden accessories

224
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:56,185
will falling off during a fight?

225
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:58,866
How can the hair accessories be insert

226
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:01,367
from the bottom up against the gravity?

227
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:05,575
and Wang Chuan Feng Hua Lu on the right.

228
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:08,397
In order to create the silhouette,

229
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:10,639
the hair is floating in the air,

230
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:13,302
which is completely against the physics.

231
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:18,066
These designs are completely non-realistic,

232
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:22,129
but who can deny they are beautiful?

233
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:25,733
In fact, these hairstyles are widely priced

234
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:26,834
in players' group.

235
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:34,235
Through the feedback from various social media and questionnaires,

236
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:41,556
we draw a conclusion of our games player. Players don't care much about whether the hairstyle is

237
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:48,618
realistic and reasonable. They care more about whether the appearance is beautiful or not.

238
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:50,458
Therefore, in those projects,

239
00:17:51,732 --> 00:18:05,209
Artists make a choice, giving up part of the reality of haircuts when we designing and producing hair, which is different from the realistic style in Western game.

240
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,632
After brief.

241
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:15,288
After briefly talking about the similarities and the differences mentioned above,

242
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:19,873
let me introduce how we design Oriental hairstyles.

243
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:28,543
As mentioned earlier, both Eastern and Western games have one thing in common in terms of aesthetics.

244
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:36,926
That is, many hairstyle elements are based on the extraction of hairstyle elements in life.

245
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:43,833
But in oriental-themed games, many hairstyles can hardly be found in real life.

246
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:49,398
Many shapes cannot be restored in real life because of the antigravity.

247
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:51,400
So how do we find elements?

248
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:54,975
This goes back to Chinese painting.

249
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:58,538
We pick the specific elements from historical painting

250
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,860
and then recreate to our works.

251
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,203
The traditional Chinese ink painting

252
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:06,805
is formed by one stroke.

253
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:09,448
Due to the characteristic of the brush,

254
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:13,411
there will be different thickness changes in one stroke.

255
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:16,994
The line drawn with the tip of the brush is thinner

256
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:20,397
and the line drawn with the brush obliquely is thicker.

257
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,628
At the same angle, the grass ratio of the falls different.

258
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,373
The lines are completely different.

259
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:31,198
The rhythm of ink painting is also drawn

260
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:32,761
within a single stroke.

261
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:38,202
Therefore, the line is the most important aesthetic element

262
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:40,203
of Chinese painting art,

263
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:42,425
and it is also a watershed

264
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:46,168
between Chinese and Western painting.

265
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:51,251
Changes in the thickness, shade, lightness, speed,

266
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:55,134
dryness, and wetness of a line under the stroke

267
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:58,537
can express emotion, ups and downs,

268
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:01,299
convey feelings, show character,

269
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,504
and publicizing individuality.

270
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:12,467
With the concept of lines, when we design and make hairstyle,

271
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:16,711
we will consider each strand of hair is a line

272
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:20,153
and pay more attention whether the lines of the hair

273
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:23,656
are smooth and whether each strand of hair

274
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,938
has a reasonable thickness change.

275
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:34,333
and whether there is enough tension in the outline of the styling that the hair strays out.

276
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,974
Take a look at this hair as an example.

277
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:44,136
Here is a haircut created in the collaboration between Nalika BladePoint and Justice Online.

278
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:48,677
Each strand hair in this hairstyle has ups and downs,

279
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:51,479
through the change of the thickness

280
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:54,202
and the shade of the silhouette.

281
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:58,005
The character's gritty personality is clearly shown.

282
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:03,930
Women's hairstyles are different from men's,

283
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,833
although they are using the curly lines as well

284
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,235
and have thickness changes.

285
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:14,463
In women's hair styles, we will pay more attention

286
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:18,604
to whether the curvature of the curve is soft or not,

287
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:21,905
and whether the falling strands are distributed

288
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:26,347
in a rhythmical change rather than an even distribution.

289
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:29,968
Through the changes of the outline and the silhouette

290
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:34,829
of the line, as well as the changes of the curling radium,

291
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:38,010
a completely different temperament can be reflected.

292
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:43,267
Curly hair and curly lines not only mean soft and feminine,

293
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:47,149
but also can show the power and the flamboyant personality.

294
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:50,511
This is the magic that lines bring in.

295
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:54,153
Therefore, when we make hair, we're

296
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:56,575
concerned about the beauty of the line shape,

297
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:59,597
the thickness change of hair strands,

298
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:02,118
the shade change of the hair pieces

299
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:04,599
shows on the UV distribution.

300
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:08,292
and the change of the curved radium

301
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:12,115
to the outline of the silhouette.

302
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:15,657
In addition to extracting design inspiration

303
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:18,939
from the lines of ink painting,

304
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:22,701
we also extract elements from traditional painting.

305
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:26,403
For example, this picture is a painting

306
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,625
of Tang Dynasty 1,300 years ago.

307
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:33,327
We're extracting the main hairstyle elements,

308
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:33,988
panhandle.

309
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,960
and the big peony flower,

310
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,341
combined with our understanding of the curve

311
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:40,642
to design this style.

312
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:45,564
Although it's kind of against gravity,

313
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,885
how can the hair pieces on the left

314
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:49,626
not fall down in the real world?

315
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:54,107
But it does not affect the beauty of this shape

316
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,008
in the game at all.

317
00:22:57,814 --> 00:23:02,017
From perspective of aesthetics, hairstyle

318
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:04,438
is a very important part of the character

319
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:06,580
appearance of a certain era.

320
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,363
Hair can act as a gateway to bring us back to the old time.

321
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:16,742
In a way, hairstyle can connect our imagination of the past

322
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:19,845
with real tradition, forming bridges

323
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:22,267
across the time and the generations,

324
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,529
and reach thousands of households

325
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,711
through films, games, and other works.

326
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:31,355
After talking about some aesthetics discussion,

327
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:34,758
we then entered the focus on our speech.

328
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:38,261
It's also a summary from our teamwork experience.

329
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:44,065
how we can better achieve interesting and beautiful hairstyles in the game,

330
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:51,674
and what we can do. Next, we will summarize four key thoughts about hair design in video game,

331
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:54,698
as well as our understanding of design methods.

332
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:01,495
The four key points are history experience.

333
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:05,059
The game hair design in line with the character era

334
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,823
will give players a better sense of immersion.

335
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:12,647
In this part, we will talk about the historical immersion

336
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:16,651
of hairstyle through a series of Eastern and Western artworks

337
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:17,412
and games.

338
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:21,782
Part two, diversity personality.

339
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:25,747
From perspective of user experience,

340
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:29,872
we discuss how to present a diversity and a personality

341
00:24:29,872 --> 00:24:33,656
by haircuts, as well as how to bring players

342
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:36,199
a variety of hairstyles design,

343
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:39,022
when allowing using their creativity.

344
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:42,516
Part three, contrast memory.

345
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:48,120
Although the main purpose of most hairstyle

346
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,384
is attractive appearance, some hairstyles

347
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:56,568
could express very strong personality characteristic.

348
00:24:56,568 --> 00:25:01,792
We will discuss how to create some strong memory points

349
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,074
by creating hairstyles contrast.

350
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:09,630
Part four, label breaking, universal value.

351
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,791
We will discuss how to break the design concept

352
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:16,712
of labeling character with hairstyle labels

353
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:20,593
and try to use game art exploration

354
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:23,114
to convey universal value.

355
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:25,574
In addition, the work we have done

356
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,795
to realize the ideal of label breaking.

357
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:31,456
The third and the fourth part

358
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:34,257
will be introduced by my partner, Luo Hao.

359
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:39,351
So let's start with a brief review in the history of hair design.

360
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:46,535
In many cases, it's easy to identify the background of the character's era without

361
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:50,677
looking at the character's clothes, just by styling his hair.

362
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:54,839
The first one, Ancient Greece hairstyle.

363
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:59,301
The middle one is Baroque hairstyle.

364
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:03,823
And the last one is Qing Dynasty, China.

365
00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:11,348
hairstyle.

366
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,990
Hair can symbolize person,

367
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,732
hair can symbolize personal identity,

368
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:20,294
status, cultural identity, and so on.

369
00:26:20,294 --> 00:26:23,095
The study of these ancient hairstyles

370
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:25,457
can go in many directions,

371
00:26:25,457 --> 00:26:29,079
from history books, statues,

372
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,801
frescoes, and ancient painting.

373
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:35,963
that have been passed down to the present.

374
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:39,965
We can get information about how ancient people dressed up

375
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,586
in the era when they lived.

376
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,827
In game design, we can make full use

377
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:49,568
of hairstyles with historical characteristics of the time

378
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,529
to better tell stories.

379
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:55,350
The hairstyle design in the game that

380
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,492
is in line with the character's era background

381
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,553
will give the players a better sense of immersion.

382
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:10,840
Here is a character from TV series Qingping Le in a collaboration with our Justice Online project.

383
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,066
Even if the audience have not tried this game or watched the TV series,

384
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:21,732
they can easily locate the historical background through her hair.

385
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:28,007
ancient China, and her identity, a well-educated woman

386
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:30,769
with a higher status, and so on.

387
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:34,051
The beautiful accessories on her head,

388
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:37,113
which is not over decorated, shows

389
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:41,556
that she is very rich, but with a restrained personality.

390
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:45,999
The hair was neatly combed back, indicating

391
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:50,482
that she has the habits to control her appearance, which

392
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,483
tell us her social status.

393
00:27:53,495 --> 00:28:01,240
In fact, this woman is a queen in the game and TV series,

394
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,984
who dislike luxury and has reserved and quiet personality.

395
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:11,948
Another example, in this case,

396
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:14,470
through the hairstyle we see

397
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,813
and a sweet young girl in ancient China,

398
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:21,916
the accessories on her head are exquisite.

399
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:34,514
many small flowers and peels, showing her gentle and soft character. She is keeping Ben's hair

400
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:42,601
in front, looking neat and cute. In fact, this girl is a lovely princess with a tragic love story.

401
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,737
The right hairstyle can tell a story.

402
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:51,518
It can also allow players to evolve in the game

403
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:56,380
at the beginning with a good sense of immersion, experience,

404
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:02,743
and they will not feel inconsistent and strange.

405
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:05,204
In the game Total War Three Kingdom,

406
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:09,426
the developer has restored the historical background

407
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:13,028
in a high degree, and the reboot's unique hairstyle

408
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:13,908
is impressive.

409
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:20,395
The sense of historical immersion

410
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:26,319
is not only well represented in Oriental-themed games,

411
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:33,784
but also well reflected in many other culture themes.

412
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:37,687
As soon as a hairstyle in Assassin's Creed Oranges

413
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:38,847
is displayed,

414
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:44,025
Without any text introduction, players

415
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:47,787
know that the background of this game is ancient Egypt.

416
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:53,671
Similarly, as soon as this hairstyle comes out,

417
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:57,733
even people who have not played the God of War series

418
00:29:57,733 --> 00:30:01,496
can know that the story takes place in ancient Greece

419
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:04,598
and a total warm Rome.

420
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:11,547
Hairstyling is used to express the background of the history.

421
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:15,892
To sum up, the hairstyle design in the game

422
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:19,515
that is in line with the character's era background

423
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:24,700
will make the players have a better sense of immersion.

424
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,783
Part two, diversity and personality.

425
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:31,190
After finishing the previous part,

426
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,131
let's talk about the diversity and the personality

427
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:36,452
of hairstyles.

428
00:30:36,452 --> 00:30:39,553
This image is from Fallout 4.

429
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:43,335
I'm quoting this image here because it

430
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:45,436
fits my point of view.

431
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:48,737
We can change hairstyles in our daily life,

432
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:50,818
just like characters in games.

433
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:54,153
When people change their hairstyles,

434
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,855
sometimes the temperament is also changed.

435
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,959
The variety of hairstyle provide more display

436
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,860
or personality and temperament.

437
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,905
Therefore, in the game, as in daily life,

438
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:13,368
a variety of hairstyle options to change at any time,

439
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:16,250
providing a feeling of freshness,

440
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,892
as well as a deeper sense of involvement.

441
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:27,462
On the other hand, the specific outfit of some game characters shows a strong personality.

442
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:33,684
People remember those who impressed them with personalized appearance.

443
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:42,886
For example, Tagami Takayuki in Lost Judgment with a unique hairstyle which impressed people

444
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:43,206
easily.

445
00:31:44,622 --> 00:31:49,727
This is a strong memory point that the feature of the haircut

446
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:53,431
brings to the player.

447
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:56,274
In another category of games, this

448
00:31:56,274 --> 00:31:58,896
provide games with a greater variety

449
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:01,619
of different customized looks.

450
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,342
It can give players a better experience

451
00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:06,604
and increase users' sickness.

452
00:32:09,252 --> 00:32:12,194
In addition to the diversity of hairstyles,

453
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:16,876
individual customization can also

454
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:21,958
be improved through adjustments such as hair color dyeing.

455
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:25,300
Diversity and personality are two sides of a coin.

456
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,843
Whether it is a personalized design or diversified design,

457
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:34,765
the main purpose is to better provide the players

458
00:32:34,765 --> 00:32:35,985
with memory points.

459
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:43,938
a sense of immersion, and a better game experience.

460
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:50,584
So what's NetEase Games did to provide the players with hairstyle diversity

461
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:54,928
while it's generating personalized and impress the character?

462
00:32:57,421 --> 00:33:02,005
The variety of hairstyle highlights the richness of the game character.

463
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:09,953
At the same time, the personalized hairstyle design shows the special characteristics of players in the game.

464
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:15,838
Take Nalika Braid Point as an example.

465
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:22,945
Could you feel impressed when you saw this character for the first time?

466
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:32,676
If so, are you curious what elements make it impressive?

467
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:36,479
This comes to personalizing designs

468
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:39,542
to enhance the character's traits.

469
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,524
So what kind of personalized elements

470
00:33:42,524 --> 00:33:43,805
are used in the design?

471
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:51,019
This hairstyle that combines a very muscular

472
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:56,500
mohawk hairstyle with long curly hair, that is family.

473
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,141
The designer combines two completely

474
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,621
opposite temperament hairstyles,

475
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:07,562
and they design the shape match the male face,

476
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:11,723
which have a very strong memory and personality.

477
00:34:11,723 --> 00:34:15,124
Make one remember this look at a glance.

478
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:22,858
Different hairstyles in the game show different personality.

479
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:28,199
These three characters have the same facial feature,

480
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,800
similar clothing style, and are decorated

481
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,881
with similar bead necklace on their chest.

482
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:38,061
Sorry.

483
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:41,702
But because of the different hairstyle,

484
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:46,323
they show completely different personalities.

485
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:50,564
The one in the left feels tough and strong.

486
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:53,466
The one in the middle is more gentle.

487
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:57,548
And the one in the far right is between them too.

488
00:34:57,548 --> 00:34:59,809
Why do people feel so different?

489
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:03,051
This is because the short, sharp line

490
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:05,532
gave people a sharp and strong feeling

491
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:09,914
with a certain aggression.

492
00:35:09,914 --> 00:35:13,156
While the long curly lines show a certain gentle

493
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:14,236
and a mild natural.

494
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:19,786
The characteristics of the line are applied to the hairstyles,

495
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:23,787
which brings the character attributes unique with the lines

496
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:24,687
to the character.

497
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:32,048
It's also a good way to show personality.

498
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:36,769
If it is matched with different facial features, skin color,

499
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:39,690
and clothing, the character's shape

500
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,570
will have a more distinct personality.

501
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:54,448
After this other way to enhance the aesthetics richness

502
00:35:54,448 --> 00:36:00,073
of character other than the personalization of the design,

503
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:03,757
of course, we can provide a more variety of hairstyles

504
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:05,959
in addition to personalized styling.

505
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:16,652
In the Tianyu mobile game, players can always find their favorite hairstyles to show their personality.

506
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:24,799
But within the same personality temperament, hairstyles can also be changed in different ways.

507
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:30,744
For example, the player's hair in the picture is a very cute and sweet one.

508
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:38,070
In the category of cute and sweet hairstyles, there are still varieties of haircut designs.

509
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:43,447
So diversity is also provided in personality.

510
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:49,651
In the same category of personality and temperament,

511
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:54,114
with similar hairline elements, different shapes

512
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:58,758
can design to better provide the players with rich diversity.

513
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:03,901
The same long hair curve shape through the different design

514
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:07,444
can also provide rich diversity in the category

515
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:08,805
of mild temperament.

516
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:16,427
The decorative items on the head are also

517
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:20,750
extremely important part in hair styling design.

518
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,773
Developers will design a lot of hair accessories

519
00:37:24,773 --> 00:37:27,095
to provide more choice.

520
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:31,318
Some small accessories can make the player's image

521
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:34,241
in the game much more personalized,

522
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:36,983
such as cute fox ear accessories.

523
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,700
and the design of hairstyle and hair accessories

524
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,682
can better increase the beauty.

525
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,764
Below is a brief overview of the variety

526
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:53,006
of hairstyles and accessories.

527
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:56,409
In Justice Online, diverse customization

528
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:59,071
of traditional hairstyles gives the game

529
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:03,073
more possibility of better richness of characters

530
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,715
and the player space.

531
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:09,518
So let's take a look of the hairstyle and the decorations.

532
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:26,895
I am finishing my part of the speech, so let my partner Luo Hao introduce the next part of the speech to everyone. Thank you.

533
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:27,655
Thank you, Nora.

534
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:48,499
Hi, I'm Hao Luo. Thanks for listening to our speech. And I will be presenting the next two parts. So let's dive into the third part, which is about contrast and memory.

535
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,050
So most hairstyles are designed for beauty as the main purpose,

536
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:02,034
and the good hairstyle design makes the game character look with basic stylistic guidelines.

537
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:10,498
However, some hairstyles themselves have different characteristics, such as strong temperament.

538
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:16,981
For example, a long curly hair is naturally associated with a feminine and gentle temperament.

539
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,524
When looking at this curly hair, it's normal to think,

540
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,225
okay, she's probably a female.

541
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:29,327
Maybe because many women choose to keep long hair,

542
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:33,648
although they all have their own choices.

543
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:37,850
But if a male character keeps a big beard

544
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,391
along with the long curly hair,

545
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:44,292
it will conflict with the stereotype in our mind.

546
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:47,916
and it will definitely be impressive

547
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:52,719
because it brings a strong point for audiences to remember.

548
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,701
And the audiences or players will immediately feel

549
00:39:56,701 --> 00:39:57,941
that this is a character

550
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:04,004
who has an interesting background story.

551
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,405
Let's take a look at this picture.

552
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:09,887
What kind of imagination do you have when you see it?

553
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:14,859
you probably would think she's a lovely girl

554
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:16,220
with gentle characteristics.

555
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,621
And she might be a gentle character in a game,

556
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:24,662
but that's not always the truth.

557
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:29,784
With the same hairstyle, he can also be a strong warrior.

558
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:33,545
So different face gives a different interpretation

559
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:35,466
of this same hairstyle.

560
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,967
But which one do you think is more impressive?

561
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,371
Looking at the picture in the middle,

562
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,773
the long hair matches the feminine feature

563
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:46,534
and looks totally part of it.

564
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:50,677
But the hairstyle impression in people's concept

565
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:53,639
conflicts with the character's temperament

566
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,720
in the third picture,

567
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,483
making it extremely impressive to most people.

568
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:02,925
Compared with the middle one,

569
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:05,187
audiences will more look forward

570
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:07,748
to the subsequent story content

571
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:09,410
brought by the character on the right.

572
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:15,471
We have not entered any maps with this character

573
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:18,431
with big beard and long hairstyle.

574
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:22,052
His image makes us eager to discover more about his story

575
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:25,352
and know more about his journey along the way.

576
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:34,634
Let's look at another example, a star in China.

577
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:36,815
What is your feeling when you look at this picture?

578
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:43,644
Her temperament is relatively mild, tender and soft.

579
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:47,485
And this used to be her daily hairstyle.

580
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:54,547
And it's beautiful, but maybe less memorable.

581
00:41:54,547 --> 00:42:01,209
The middle one and the right one both changed to short hair,

582
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:04,830
which conflicted with her own soft looks and temperament.

583
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,331
The visual impact immediately make people

584
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:16,723
memorized so the star in reality actually keeps short hair for the most of the time

585
00:42:16,723 --> 00:42:28,530
and we probably want to know more about her story and how she's doing when we see these two pictures

586
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,812
and when it comes to games

587
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:38,601
This is a boss from NetEase game Justice with a bald plus braided hairstyle design,

588
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:45,129
which has a strong memory point and fits the evil character aura that a boss should have.

589
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:51,196
By the way, this hairstyle also can be obtained by the player when you defeat the boss.

590
00:42:53,796 --> 00:43:03,320
So if in this game, the player's customized face is relatively mild and soft with the evil hairstyle,

591
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:11,524
he will not only no more have evil temperament, but becomes a little funny to some players.

592
00:43:11,524 --> 00:43:15,165
So that players around him feel very impressive.

593
00:43:16,321 --> 00:43:26,851
and that is how you become a person remembered by everyone inside the guild or a player community.

594
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:31,335
Some players will use this hairstyle which cannot be purchased in the game

595
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:35,519
to communicate and to socialize with other players.

596
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:41,901
And there will even be players who have this hairstyle

597
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:45,142
and they will customize the color of this hair

598
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:47,463
to get a much more different effect.

599
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:54,166
In this way, he's also naturally remembered by other players

600
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:57,547
and this is exactly the effect

601
00:43:57,547 --> 00:44:00,468
of having a huge constructing hair design.

602
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:08,620
And another example is in Naraka Playpoint of NetEase.

603
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,861
Some players will also customize their characters

604
00:44:11,861 --> 00:44:14,582
with various hairstyles.

605
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:17,422
At the same time, they will also combine

606
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,963
the game's face customization settings

607
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:23,464
to make their characters into unique images.

608
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:24,464
Why do they do this?

609
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:29,925
The answer is that it is easier to be remembered

610
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:30,725
by other players.

611
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:37,252
Of course, in the process of hair and face customization,

612
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:40,574
players can enjoy the fun of their own creations.

613
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:44,437
But ultimately, they get more sense of accomplishment

614
00:44:44,437 --> 00:44:48,139
because the very recognizable and constructing image

615
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:50,380
stays in people's memory.

616
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:58,390
So after talking about contrast and memory,

617
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,272
I will be moving on to the fourth part, which

618
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:04,514
is about label breaking and the universal values.

619
00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:11,019
So in many cases, games artists and designers or directors

620
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:17,584
of movies often use hairstyle to directly define a character

621
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:19,845
and even his or her personality.

622
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:24,347
which has been mostly successful

623
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,748
because hairstyle leave players

624
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:29,809
and audiences great impression

625
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:33,370
and they just remember the character.

626
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,451
However, sometimes such a design

627
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:39,372
can have some unwelcome effects.

628
00:45:39,372 --> 00:45:42,673
The reason for that is because

629
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,995
using a specific hairstyle to define a character

630
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:49,116
will make the game or film lack of variety.

631
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:55,367
A certain personality or characteristic should match only a certain kind of style.

632
00:45:55,367 --> 00:46:04,255
If you think so, you have to find the person or the character with just a simple label.

633
00:46:04,255 --> 00:46:11,001
But this character can also have a lot of other rich and varied hairstyle designs.

634
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:18,167
And through other aspects of character design to highlight the specific characteristics.

635
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:32,140
Therefore, sometimes it needs to be transferred to not using certain hairstyles to get characters labeled easily in-game,

636
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:38,682
and not defining a certain character or background with just a specific hairstyle,

637
00:46:38,682 --> 00:46:41,583
because it bans diversity and discriminates.

638
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:52,810
And we can see that certain hair styles also have certain impressions in people's minds.

639
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:59,132
For example, this slicked back hair gives people the first impression that

640
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:06,835
they are related to gangsters or mafia. This is actually a natural label added to such characters.

641
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:11,096
However,

642
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,627
In fact, this kind of hairstyle used by some people reflects just cool characters

643
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:23,971
and has nothing to do with their occupations.

644
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:32,399
This kind of stereotype should not be labeled on a person or a character so easily.

645
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:36,563
And let's take a look at these pictures.

646
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,305
What do you imagine when you see them?

647
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:44,512
So these dirty braids give people the first impression

648
00:47:44,512 --> 00:47:47,693
that they are related to street art, hip hop,

649
00:47:47,693 --> 00:47:51,274
or other cultures, or cool new trends.

650
00:47:51,274 --> 00:47:53,235
Just like this guy.

651
00:47:53,235 --> 00:47:57,617
He can be a popular rapper.

652
00:47:57,617 --> 00:48:01,338
But in fact, some dirty braids or dreadlocks

653
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:05,400
are connected with mysterious religions in some places.

654
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,917
Among the ethnic minorities in China,

655
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:13,718
there is a religious belief of Buddhism,

656
00:48:13,718 --> 00:48:16,359
and the hairstyle of believers

657
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:20,180
are actually very similar to dreadlocks.

658
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,861
They do not represent street culture, hip hop art,

659
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:29,222
but rather a faith and reverence for the Buddhism.

660
00:48:29,222 --> 00:48:33,023
Underneath these labels we just saw,

661
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,324
there actually lies a very different truth.

662
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:44,199
So for these two pictures, which one is more impressive?

663
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:48,507
Or which one makes us expect more stories behind it?

664
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:52,554
I think the answer might be the left one.

665
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:59,011
If we break the stereotype and add some other rich features

666
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:01,372
to the specific characterization,

667
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:04,875
for example, the old and devout believer

668
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:09,619
will be more storytelling than the features of the hairstyle

669
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,701
itself.

670
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,862
We can use this method of peeling off

671
00:49:13,862 --> 00:49:19,627
those labels in game design to give the characters richer

672
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:21,228
and fuller information.

673
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:26,781
and it will have a more impressive impact

674
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:30,345
than just designing a defined hairstyle label

675
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:32,407
for a certain character.

676
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:35,510
And such character appearance designs

677
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,153
as an overturn to the traditional stereotype

678
00:49:38,153 --> 00:49:42,738
may give players more memorable and impressive points

679
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:44,700
as well as greater impact to them.

680
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:53,268
but how to peel off or break these labels in game design.

681
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:58,114
Here, I would like to share what NetEase have done with you.

682
00:49:58,114 --> 00:50:03,520
Firstly, we developed and applied a diverse headwear system.

683
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,585
We know that in a specific historical context,

684
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:14,852
Game designers are prone to labeling when designing character hairstyles.

685
00:50:14,852 --> 00:50:20,577
For example, the golden hairpin for rich people and the helmet for warriors.

686
00:50:20,577 --> 00:50:26,182
However, if you have a various and varied hair decoration system,

687
00:50:26,182 --> 00:50:31,347
the effect of labeling will be largely reduced.

688
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:32,688
Why?

689
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:33,649
Because bringing a...

690
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:48,358
A lot of different hair accessories for players consequently reduces the stereotype that a certain character should have a certain hairstyle or wear a certain hair accessory.

691
00:50:48,358 --> 00:51:01,462
In this game Justice Online, which is a big title of NetEase, we designed and implemented a diverse hair wear system.

692
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:22,922
As you can see in this video, the character has a rich variety of hair decorations and a wide variety of hair accessories that allow players to have many different combinations, even based on the same hairstyle.

693
00:51:22,922 --> 00:51:28,587
And players can choose from many more other hairstyles to change combinations.

694
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:33,414
In this way, it's much more difficult to say,

695
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:35,916
in terms of hairstyle and hair accessories,

696
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:40,038
to give him a specific label, because the character is not

697
00:51:40,038 --> 00:51:43,880
only limited to a certain hairstyle appearance.

698
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,842
On the other hand, it also enhances

699
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:52,145
the richness of the character, so that other players have

700
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:53,366
more desire to.

701
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:59,914
um, explore the story behind the character or to communicate and

702
00:51:59,914 --> 00:52:02,095
socialize with the player behind him.

703
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:15,345
So we can change many decorations, Henny and headwear in this video.

704
00:52:32,656 --> 00:52:37,437
And secondly, a creative hair shape customization system

705
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:39,258
was designed and implemented also,

706
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:43,079
according to the historical background of the game

707
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,540
and the characteristics of roles.

708
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,920
As mentioned before, we don't want

709
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,862
a game in which the warriors are only bald or with short hair.

710
00:52:54,862 --> 00:52:59,203
The hairstyles can all be customized by players freely.

711
00:53:00,406 --> 00:53:06,251
This kind of experimental function also allows players to be more inclusive about characters'

712
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:12,796
appearance, rather than limiting their perceptions to a certain character should only have a

713
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:13,697
certain hairstyle.

714
00:53:13,697 --> 00:53:22,544
And some more examples can be found in Naraka Playpoint of NetEase.

715
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:30,279
So long hair of this regional culture,

716
00:53:30,279 --> 00:53:35,360
the ancient Chinese updo, and the adjusted Western style

717
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,622
Mohican hairstyle, also use the male warrior in this video.

718
00:53:39,622 --> 00:53:45,624
In this way, the male warrior is no longer exactly equal

719
00:53:45,624 --> 00:53:48,325
to the bun or short hairstyle.

720
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,185
The game instead provides players

721
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,466
with more different options and collocations

722
00:53:53,466 --> 00:53:55,487
so as to overcome the stereotypes.

723
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:26,346
And thirdly, what we did to break those labels is the design of the hair coloring system

724
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:30,688
based on diversity and high aesthetics.

725
00:54:30,688 --> 00:54:39,153
And this has allowed netis to make some other achievements in breaking the stereotype as

726
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:39,413
well.

727
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:44,596
For example, in the Araka Playpoint,

728
00:54:44,596 --> 00:54:48,096
it is also possible to use the hair coloring system

729
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:50,977
to match any hair color you like,

730
00:54:50,977 --> 00:54:53,837
allowing players to create freely

731
00:54:53,837 --> 00:54:57,178
and to be remembered by others.

732
00:54:57,178 --> 00:55:02,119
Male characters should not die red in traditional concept.

733
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:06,340
Such inherent stereotype have been formed by so many people,

734
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,120
but in Araka Playpoint,

735
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,820
we have no such traditional stereotyped images.

736
00:55:15,736 --> 00:55:23,421
In Tenryu Mobile, we give players more hair color customization options,

737
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,584
including highlighting parts of their hair as they like,

738
00:55:26,584 --> 00:55:33,929
dying in gradient color, and some other options. Of course, the game

739
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:39,012
also provides the most basic coloring function,

740
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:43,055
which provides a variety of colors for players to

741
00:55:43,055 --> 00:55:43,395
to choose from.

742
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:52,159
The player chooses this lovely young girl with two ponytails as his or her character.

743
00:55:52,159 --> 00:56:01,464
And it's possible for the player to avoid a specific label by dyeing her hair into a favorable color.

744
00:56:01,464 --> 00:56:09,449
Force

745
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:17,424
When designing games, based on the premise of conforming to the time background,

746
00:56:17,424 --> 00:56:23,067
we try to do cultural integration and multifaceted display of different cultures.

747
00:56:23,067 --> 00:56:28,609
And this means a lot, and we will continue to do it, because cultures and civilizations all

748
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:33,632
over the world are the heritage of the development stage in human history.

749
00:56:33,632 --> 00:56:39,235
And if those cultures can be integrated into games, that's an awesome thing to do.

750
00:56:41,835 --> 00:56:43,537
So here is an example.

751
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:46,801
In Naraka Playpoint, we have incorporated

752
00:56:46,801 --> 00:56:50,344
the characteristic hairstyles of other regional cultures

753
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:53,788
and allowed players to create their own faces

754
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:56,931
in character face customization,

755
00:56:56,931 --> 00:56:59,394
either Western or Eastern style.

756
00:56:59,394 --> 00:57:01,716
And everything is possible.

757
00:57:02,774 --> 00:57:11,100
And this game is not only to match the tastes of players from different regions in the world,

758
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:17,405
but also to achieve the integration of various cultures into the game.

759
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:25,331
This is also reflected in the design of hairstyles in Naraka Bay Point and some other games of Nereid.

760
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:31,767
So I think that's all what we want to share in terms of this topic.

761
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:35,810
And please allow me to summarize a little bit here.

762
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:39,633
Firstly, every background in game design is important

763
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:44,277
and do consider player experience and how to make them immerse more.

764
00:57:44,277 --> 00:57:49,782
Secondly, get players into your hair design process, if possible,

765
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:51,603
and try to listen more to them.

766
00:57:52,657 --> 00:57:59,040
And thirdly, while providing diversity and remember to allow freedom for personality.

767
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,023
Fourth, cultural blending can get you fans of different backgrounds.

768
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:15,229
And finally, sometimes it is worth to try label breaking and let's do more about it.

769
00:58:15,229 --> 00:58:17,570
That's all. Thank you for listening.

770
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:17,830
Thank you.

771
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:21,092
And if you guys have any questions, we would like to answer these.

772
00:58:24,263 --> 00:58:32,045
Okay, we're sorry that there's no time left for questions maybe.

773
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:37,206
And thank you guys for coming to our speech and bye. Have a nice day.

774
00:58:37,206 --> 00:58:39,167
Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye.
