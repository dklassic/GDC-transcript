00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:05,295
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,100
Just as a reminder before I start my talk, turn off your

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,785
cell phones and fill out the surveys that they

4
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,108
give you through email.

5
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:17,331
And so I'm going to get this talk rolling.

6
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:21,108
So I'm going to be talking about single player versus

7
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:24,150
multiplayer level design, and the paradigm shift that kind

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,771
of occurs when you're thinking about

9
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:26,931
designing between each one.

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,312
First of all, who am I?

11
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:31,074
My name is Elizabeth Beinke-Schwartz, and I'm a

12
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,215
level designer at a company in Austin, Texas called

13
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:34,836
Certain Affinity.

14
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:38,597
and I got my start working on the MMORPG,

15
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:41,457
Lord of the Rings Online, the Minds of Mora expansion pack.

16
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,458
And since then, I've worked on a bunch of different

17
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:46,098
single player and multiplayer titles,

18
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:49,279
including Bioshock Infinite, Mafia III and Doom,

19
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,039
and Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remaster.

20
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,360
And so what I will be covering today

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,521
is what is based on my own experience

22
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:00,301
coming from a single player,

23
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,101
highly narratively linear background.

24
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:06,403
designing stuff like for Bioshock Infinite and then

25
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:15,030
moving over to working at Certain Affinity and designing more multiplayer levels, especially for a first-person shooter design like for the

26
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,454
new Steam game that came out. Certain Affinity helped with

27
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,596
with some of the multiplayer for that and so

28
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:26,479
I came from a very narrative-heavy single-player background,

29
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:30,062
and I was very surprised when I started designing levels for multiplayer

30
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:31,343
about a lot of the differences.

31
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:35,106
There are some similarities, but there was a lot of things

32
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:39,250
I was used to putting a lot of time into in single-player levels

33
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,191
that I didn't need to in multiplayer.

34
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:47,857
And comparatively, things where I found out need to be paid a lot of attention to

35
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:49,758
when you design for a multiplayer level

36
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:51,460
that you don't really need to think about as much.

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,721
when you're designing a single player level.

38
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:56,244
So this talk is based on my own experiences,

39
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,986
kind of a, if you're gonna switch in between the two

40
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,908
and learn what similarities there are

41
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:02,989
and what differences there are.

42
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,690
So first of all, when you are starting to design the layouts for a space, obviously,

43
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,572
you need to plan for the size of your level.

44
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:17,997
And in single player, the things that go into figuring out how you'reâ€”

45
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:21,139
the size that you're going to design for is, you know,

46
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:24,381
how many combats are you going to be supporting in that space?

47
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:26,523
What are the sizes of those combats?

48
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,446
Are there going to be any big narrative set pieces in that level?

49
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:35,288
any traversal conversations, like for example if you need to support

50
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:40,190
smaller narrative moments where maybe, for example on Bioshock Infinite,

51
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:48,013
the player as Booker is talking with Elizabeth and they're walking and having a conversation and you're learning narrative moments

52
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:52,275
and so you want to think about designing a space that's a quiet moment.

53
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:57,938
where it doesn't intersect into combat or other elements like that.

54
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,999
And so thinking about the sizing there

55
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,461
and any additional side quests or content that you might want to add in there.

56
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:10,083
Whereas in multiplayer, the biggest thing when you're thinking about the level size is obviously

57
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:13,425
what is the game you're working on, how many players does it support,

58
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:18,107
are you designing for like a 2v2 level or a 64x64,

59
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:21,729
and also what is the intended time until engagement.

60
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:28,552
Is the game you're designing a game like Doom where it's almost immediate interaction and combat

61
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,593
and you just go, go, go?

62
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:37,316
Or are you designing a level for a smaller, slower, sorry, larger, slower-paced level

63
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:42,918
where you want to have a bit more space before the player encounters another enemy

64
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:48,121
so that they can get a sense of the battlefield and their options and a bit more of a tactical feel?

65
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:54,265
And once you've had a general idea of how big you want to

66
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:54,866
make your level.

67
00:03:56,216 --> 00:04:02,218
There's a couple differences between the things you have to think about when you are designing

68
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:07,180
and framing and composition of the level overall.

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,243
So the biggest focus in single player, especially if you're working on a very narrative level,

70
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,384
is storytelling.

71
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:17,104
Storytelling is really important.

72
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:21,926
As some of the previous speakers talked about, trying to find any little moment that you

73
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:25,128
can tell the story in the level is really important.

74
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,573
and also supporting any gameplay objectives.

75
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:32,078
Steve touched on this a little bit about making sure the player knows

76
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,703
where they're going, like where they're trying to get to,

77
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:39,068
and making sure that's clear for the player is really important.

78
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,871
Whereas in multiplayer...

79
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:44,673
the biggest things isn't really storytelling as much,

80
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:46,514
and that was a big change for me.

81
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,055
Coming from working at Irrational,

82
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:51,216
it was all like, story, story, story,

83
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,777
how can we put story into every little bit element

84
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,978
of the space, whereas in some multiplayer games

85
00:04:57,018 --> 00:05:00,019
do have a bit of story, but it's not as important,

86
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,800
and it's almost a waste of time to spend.

87
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,384
spend your time working and thinking about that element.

88
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:10,566
Whereas the more important things in multiplayer are more,

89
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,468
what are your player routes and paths

90
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:16,631
and options for the player to move around the space?

91
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:19,893
And also, something that's more important in multiplayer,

92
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,635
but not as important in single player,

93
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:24,117
is tightening up all the sight lines

94
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,979
and making sure that you fix any and all exploits

95
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,880
that you can before it gets out there live.

96
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:32,323
And so I'm gonna kind of break this down a little bit more.

97
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,812
So when I was talking about telling a story,

98
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:40,576
and using any opportunity you can to tell a story,

99
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:46,281
is you need to identify or create situations that really

100
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:47,743
frame narrative moments.

101
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:52,167
And so think about when you are designing a level that

102
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:53,868
doesn't have cut scenes.

103
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,909
what are the times where the player will definitely

104
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:01,690
be looking at a certain location and identifying those

105
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,932
and making sure that you use the crap out of that moment.

106
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:09,833
So some examples of this would be like in the image here,

107
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:12,014
when the player is exiting a room,

108
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:15,655
you know that the player is going to be looking at that door

109
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,336
and putting all this narrative moments.

110
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:25,885
around the door or say you're exiting the door, what do you see when you exit that door?

111
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:31,091
And some more examples of this are if the player is stuck in an elevator moving up or

112
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:36,097
down, maybe they are climbing up a ladder and that moment where they exit the ladder,

113
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:37,238
what will they see?

114
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,601
Identifying those moments is really important when you're designing a level.

115
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:44,463
either creating those moments or using those moments.

116
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:48,925
Also, when you are designing the space

117
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,545
to support narrative moments,

118
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:53,587
thinking about using things like a T-junction

119
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:58,728
to have an opportunity to show narrative.

120
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,632
bits to the player. For example, here, this is a T-junction where the player has entered

121
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:09,758
and they have the option of going left or right, and so putting the narrative elements

122
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:14,182
right at the base so the player will see it no matter which path they choose is a better

123
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:20,027
option than putting it in one area or another because you don't know whether the player

124
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:21,588
is going to see it or not.

125
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:30,001
And besides narrative, also making sure gameplay objectives are clear is super important in single player.

126
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:34,102
There's this idea that was coined by Walt Disney called weenies.

127
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:41,445
It's based on the concept that his dog used to follow him around when he had a hot dog or weenie,

128
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:44,486
and he noticed that the dog would follow him around and it would...

129
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:48,168
it was a way to guide the dog to certain places he wanted to.

130
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,891
So he used that terminology when designing theme parks,

131
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:56,295
like for example, Cinderella's Castle in Disney World, etc.

132
00:07:56,795 --> 00:08:00,478
It's this visually distinctive thing that you can see,

133
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:02,599
and you can use that as a point of reference.

134
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,362
So in this example from Infinite,

135
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:09,364
you are exiting this small space.

136
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:13,246
the first thing you see is this statue of an angel,

137
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:15,387
and you know from past knowledge that

138
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:19,889
the young woman, Elizabeth, is in that tower,

139
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,690
the angel tower, and that's where you need to get to.

140
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,512
But you don't really, might not know how to get there yet,

141
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,533
but at least you know where you're going.

142
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:29,193
And on the image to the right,

143
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,654
it gives you an idea of the fact

144
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:34,115
that you can kind of see this angel statue from anywhere.

145
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:37,358
you are guided towards that space.

146
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:40,861
And so making sure you identify moments

147
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:46,846
like exiting rooms or things to display relevant narrative

148
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:50,769
or gameplay objectives is super important in single player.

149
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,211
Whereas in multiplayer,

150
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,354
framing is still really important,

151
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:58,335
but you're kind of framing different things.

152
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,377
You are thinking about

153
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:06,755
Making clear the player path options that they have so that players when they're running around the space

154
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:13,440
They can make split-second decisions of where they're going to be going and also it's really important to

155
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,580
guide

156
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:18,423
To make clear where the paths are going to be leading

157
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:25,027
Some some multiplayer levels you you might turn a path and you think you're going a certain direction and you get frustrated

158
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:30,391
Because it leads you somewhere else where you don't intend and that's not really the best

159
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:35,273
design of a space when you're designing a multiplayer level.

160
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:42,337
But for example here, this is an image of Zanzibar from Halo, and on the bottom right

161
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:47,379
you can see that there's a path framed on the side with the sand that kind of leads

162
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:47,600
up.

163
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,163
giving you the impression that you're going into the second layer of this building here,

164
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:58,727
but you also know that you can see the path up on the left coming out from the building,

165
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:03,971
so you know that somebody might be coming into the building from that left upper path as well.

166
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:11,196
Making sure that the options the player has to move around the space and strategically

167
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:15,999
where other enemies will be is the most important thing when designing a multiplayer level.

168
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:23,760
And the biggest change that I had to think about when I started designing multiplayer levels

169
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,842
is really paying a lot more attention to sight lines.

170
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:33,186
In single player, it can be kind of fun to find that teeny little spot where you can get an advantage

171
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:38,529
over an NPC and they don't see you and you feel like...

172
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:43,651
It's rewarding and fun because the enemy doesn't have feelings.

173
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:48,954
But in multiplayer, the enemy you're killing has feelings, they're a real person, and they

174
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:53,456
get frustrated if they don't, they die and they don't understand why.

175
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:58,699
In a multiplayer game it's important to understand why you died and...

176
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,981
feel like the players should feel like it's their fault that they made a mistake that they died and

177
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:10,184
not that there's some gaming of the system that feels unfair and so watching out for untimely

178
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:17,008
sight lines is super important and I have an example here of one of an early level I had done

179
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,408
and there was a small room.

180
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:22,011
where you could enter from either door,

181
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,692
which is the brown blocks there.

182
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:25,934
But if you enter down from the bottom

183
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:30,197
and walked up the stairs around those hexagonal pillars,

184
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:33,159
the player could have an unattended sight line

185
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,380
where they could look in between the two pillars

186
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,182
and get this teeny little sight line out of the door

187
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:40,464
and just snipe or shoot anyone

188
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:42,145
who was running around outside the door.

189
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,607
And the people who are running around outside were like,

190
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:45,208
what the heck?

191
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:46,088
Where did I die from?

192
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:46,649
I don't know.

193
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,153
And because the people outside can't really see in, and they

194
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:54,035
don't really see that there is an enemy in there.

195
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:57,999
And so I had to adjust this to block off that sight line.

196
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:03,623
And so a lot more time goes into really nailing down these

197
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:05,625
sight lines when you're designing a multiplayer map.

198
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:09,758
And once you have the base map designed,

199
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,700
obviously you want to start thinking about optional

200
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,782
or more advanced player routes.

201
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,744
And so in single player,

202
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:21,467
the additional routes can be used to.

203
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:25,167
give additional story elements to the player.

204
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,989
For example, this is a small basement

205
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:32,050
in a bar in the level Finkton,

206
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,611
and it's very out of the way,

207
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:37,713
but what happens is there's a guitar that's...

208
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:41,014
on a chair and the player can interact with it.

209
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,375
And what happens if you interact with it

210
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:45,996
is the player Booker starts playing,

211
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,116
strumming a guitar and Elizabeth there,

212
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:50,977
she starts singing this kind of melancholy song

213
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,878
about how the circle will never be unbroken,

214
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,420
kind of talking about like the chain of oppression

215
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,001
and people being poor and it being really difficult

216
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,402
to get out of that situation.

217
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:02,722
And she...

218
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,603
takes this orange and gives it to this little kid here.

219
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:10,884
And so it's a really poignant little teeny side moment

220
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:12,544
that a lot of players might not see,

221
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:17,866
but it can be fun to design and add these little elements

222
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:18,326
in your game.

223
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:20,206
And it can feel very rewarding as a player

224
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:21,827
to find these teeny little tidbits

225
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,587
and support additional narrative initiatives

226
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:26,748
or the feel of the level.

227
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,970
But you also have to think about what happens if the

228
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,271
player misses this.

229
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:35,331
Do we have the money and the resources to

230
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:36,612
support these moments?

231
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:41,353
Because in single player, at least more linear single

232
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:44,553
player levels, players often only play once.

233
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:48,534
And so is it OK if players miss this content?

234
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:50,695
And that's something that you have to think about a lot more

235
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,695
than when you're designing a multiplayer game.

236
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,829
game level because people will be playing those over and over again.

237
00:13:56,849 --> 00:14:00,736
And obviously you can also use additional areas

238
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:06,065
in single-player to additional loot or other narrative elements as well.

239
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,501
Another thing that you have to consider

240
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,882
when designing a single-player level

241
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:15,645
is will the AI play nice if you add different types

242
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,726
of ways of interacting with the levels.

243
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,389
So it's great in single-player and multiplayer

244
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,191
to design spaces that support multiple play styles.

245
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:29,233
Maybe you want to design for stealth players

246
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:31,634
or you want to design for run-and-gun.

247
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:35,156
just go and shoot everyone, action folks, or sniping,

248
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:37,717
but you have to think about,

249
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:38,997
will the AI play nice with that?

250
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:42,898
So an example I use here on the left is Deus Ex,

251
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:46,720
where you can go in the vents and run around

252
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,281
and use those as a stealthy way of getting around.

253
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,562
And it's appealing to add these additional routes

254
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:54,482
to support stealth gameplay,

255
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,283
but you have to think about,

256
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:59,184
is the game you're making, will...

257
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:02,266
that support this type of play style,

258
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,987
because what happens if you shoot the enemy

259
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,368
through the vents, but the enemy can't get to you?

260
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:08,909
What happens then?

261
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,270
Is that okay?

262
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,392
Is your game, is your levels supporting

263
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:15,693
that kind of gameplay style?

264
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,515
And on the right side over here,

265
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,796
I'm using this example from Far Cry 3,

266
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,257
because this is something that,

267
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:23,778
when I was playing through it, I,

268
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,120
felt kind of frustrated at.

269
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,842
There are these defensible areas that you have to go into

270
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:32,683
in the map and try to take them over.

271
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:36,406
But once I got the sniper, I would just sit on the ridge

272
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:39,748
and shoot every enemy before they could even get to me

273
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:43,951
because the AI didn't really play nice with the sniper

274
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,353
because the combats weren't designed

275
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:49,335
with AIs having snipers.

276
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,216
And so I had an advantage over them.

277
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,344
And the AIs would try to run towards me,

278
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:57,366
like in the path that you can see kind of in the back left,

279
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:58,407
there's like a route up.

280
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,909
But they have to take so long to get to you

281
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,691
that you just have so much of an advantage,

282
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,352
it's not really fun anymore.

283
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,474
And so when you're thinking about

284
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,155
adding sniper vantage points,

285
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:12,097
trying to restrict the spaces

286
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:16,020
that the players can have those sniper moments,

287
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:19,022
or thinking about how the AIs

288
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,524
will respond to those moments accordingly.

289
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:30,758
So when you're designing optional routes in multiplayer,

290
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:34,899
it's pretty much a necessity that you have to design more

291
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:35,499
than one route.

292
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,560
Because if players encounter each other, the same route over

293
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,261
and over again is really boring.

294
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,502
And because players are playing these levels over and

295
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,262
over again, you need to provide multiple routes and

296
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,423
options for the player.

297
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,923
And so I have a couple examples here.

298
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:55,424
The player can jump up on that platform and then double jump

299
00:16:55,524 --> 00:16:55,964
onto the platform.

300
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:59,907
platform on the right, or they can just run straight on the ground and then

301
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:04,491
jump and then ledge grab up onto the right, or an even more advanced player

302
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:12,478
could jump onto that platform and then do a much more difficult jump to get to a very small side ledge and

303
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,278
have a different

304
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:17,642
angle and advantage over the players, but it's a lot more difficult

305
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,520
for players to get onto that ledge without falling off.

306
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,601
And so providing both simple and advanced ways

307
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:28,662
for players to get around is really important

308
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:29,343
in multiplayer.

309
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:34,265
Now, when you're thinking about pickups

310
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:36,586
in single player and multiplayer,

311
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:40,427
in single player, oftentimes you can design the level first

312
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:41,628
and add pickups later,

313
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:46,009
weapon placements or power-ups or

314
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,531
ammo to replenish

315
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:51,313
Any anything that you've lost

316
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:58,598
Which often is designed so that that happens after a big combat scene or right before a big combat?

317
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,162
The good thing about in single-player is you can use pickups to tell stories

318
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:10,587
You can instead of just plopping them anywhere thinking about okay. How did these items get here?

319
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,589
Who was here and you know?

320
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,371
Why are they gone now?

321
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,353
And using those to tell stories

322
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:20,216
and to support the overarching story of your game.

323
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:24,088
Whereas in multiplayer, you pretty much

324
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,630
have to design pickups at the same time

325
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,331
that you are designing the layout.

326
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:34,694
So pickups in multiplayer like a power-up or a power weapon

327
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:35,414
or something.

328
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,395
Like in this example in Doom here,

329
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,456
there are these things called runes

330
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:43,638
where they appear randomly after a certain amount of time.

331
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:52,282
in a level and players rush to it and once they the first person to pick up the rune turns into a

332
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:58,945
giant demon who has a lot more power over everyone than just an individual player would and so

333
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:04,067
the thing to consider when you're placing these is that they will change how the space

334
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,609
that the pickups are in and how they play. They will be both a draw

335
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,878
where a lot of combat will happen around these pickups and a lot of different angles

336
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:20,346
will need to be supported for entering to get to those pickups and

337
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:25,894
to support a larger combat space than just this teeny little teeny little location

338
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:31,319
And exploits is probably one of the biggest things to think

339
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:35,001
about when you're designing a level for multiplayer.

340
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,662
In single player, it's not super important.

341
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:42,904
If the player finds an exploit, besides people posting

342
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:45,125
silly videos and then it getting on Polygon or

343
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,527
something, there are pretty low consequences.

344
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,008
And sometimes it can even be fun to get those teeny little

345
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:50,548
exploits.

346
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:53,750
But in multiplayer, especially if you're designing a level

347
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,410
that might possibly be used for.

348
00:19:56,491 --> 00:20:01,977
for competitive gameplay someday, it's critical to fix and it's super high consequences.

349
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:08,424
Players will find any exploit, it's just a matter of time and it's only fun for the individual,

350
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:13,449
but frustrating for everyone else and unfair for everyone else involved. And so a lot more time

351
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:18,494
and play testing needs to be taken to find and fix these exploits.

352
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:24,975
And now we get into playtesting, because playtesting for a single-player level

353
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:29,184
and playtesting for a multiplayer level are pretty different.

354
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:33,427
So when playtesting for single player, you really,

355
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:35,508
especially if it's a narrative linear game,

356
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,789
you only get one shot.

357
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,132
Each playtester only gets one first impression

358
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,175
of your level and how they initially react to things.

359
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:47,718
And that's very applicable to the fact that

360
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:50,640
players in the end game

361
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:56,776
The final product will only play at once and so you need to find more people to play

362
00:20:56,936 --> 00:21:02,683
But you need to take more time to polish your level before you show it to anyone

363
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:05,066
Because a lot of playtesters

364
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:11,492
you know, normal gamers don't have the skill set to extrapolate earlier levels

365
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:15,916
into a more polished state, so they might get distracted by little elements,

366
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:19,939
and taking more time to polish a level before putting it in front of a player

367
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,825
will make sure to see if the subtle, nuanced level design structures,

368
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:30,268
or lighting, or framing, etc., will lead to them understanding...

369
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:34,511
what they're doing and why and the narrative of a level.

370
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,593
And so keeping them as pure and untainted as possible

371
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,734
is really critical.

372
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:43,837
I mean, one way to get around this is to find

373
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,499
find other devs on your team,

374
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:48,820
especially other level designers

375
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,721
who are good at extrapolating.

376
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:53,483
So if you need to, and you should,

377
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,764
get people to look at your level early,

378
00:21:56,784 --> 00:22:00,708
then you should find those people who have the skill

379
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:04,091
to look at the base bare bones framework of a gray box

380
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:06,953
and being able to imagine what it's going to be

381
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:11,398
in its final state and not get distracted

382
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,019
by all the nitty gritty details

383
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:15,461
that don't really matter at that stage.

384
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,510
And so overall, when you are playtesting for single player,

385
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:23,792
you should make sure that players should

386
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:26,414
know what their motivation is, and they should always

387
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:27,095
know where they are.

388
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,078
They might not know how to get to where they are supposed

389
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:32,859
to be going right away, but they should always

390
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,283
have a frame of reference as to where they're going and not

391
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:37,883
get lost.

392
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,806
And so if players are lost, then you should probably fix it.

393
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:47,190
Whereas when playtesting for multiplayer, you really need

394
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,251
to playtest often and iterate often.

395
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:54,212
It's really necessary to get loads and loads of playtests

396
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:57,973
done, preferably every day if possible, get people in and

397
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:58,994
just playing through it.

398
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:03,395
You don't really need to spend as much time on polish as

399
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:07,916
compared to single player, because the biggest thing in

400
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:10,617
multiplayer is the layouts themselves.

401
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,738
And so you can get people in earlier on.

402
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:21,221
play testing. And the earlier you get players in, the more players can have the opportunity

403
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:27,144
to experience your level over and over again, because that's going to be closer to what the

404
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:31,766
polished end-shipped game is going to be like, where players are going to play over and over again.

405
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,392
So for multiplayer, first impressions aren't a huge deal.

406
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:40,634
If players aren't really sure where they're going, or if

407
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:43,536
they're slightly lost, or they aren't able to make a mental

408
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:47,899
map of the whole layout of the level, it's not a huge deal

409
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,479
because most.

410
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:56,102
A well-designed multiplayer map will guide players to the combat anyways,

411
00:23:56,202 --> 00:24:01,383
and so as long as players initially encounter other players, it's fine.

412
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:05,104
And if they don't have the skills the first game that they play

413
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:08,305
to understand what the layout is, they'll get that.

414
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:10,825
They'll get that after playing it many times.

415
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:15,006
And so in singleplayer, it's a big deal to fix if players are lost,

416
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:16,307
but not as much in multiplayer.

417
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:21,354
So in summary, the biggest things to think about

418
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:24,476
when you are designing for single-player

419
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,917
and multiplayer levels, and where you should put

420
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:29,098
more of your time and your priorities.

421
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,239
So in single-player, you should really make sure

422
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,481
to sell the narrative, whereas in multiplayer,

423
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:37,302
narrative is generally low priority.

424
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:40,984
I got, this is one of the things that I had to unlearn

425
00:24:41,384 --> 00:24:42,885
when designing for multiplayer levels.

426
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:45,846
I was designing a level and I,

427
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:53,335
I like to, when I first design a level, to think about a space of what is it?

428
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,216
What is the structure?

429
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:58,238
Who was there before the player got there?

430
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,703
What is the whole history of the design of the space and what was it being used for?

431
00:25:03,983 --> 00:25:09,047
And in multiplayer, I got really bogged down with thinking of all those teeny little details

432
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:13,451
that don't really matter and don't have a huge impact on the end result.

433
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:18,014
Not to say that teeny little narrative elements can't add a little bit to a level, but

434
00:25:19,456 --> 00:25:26,822
you don't need to spend much time on that in multiplayer. But in single player and multiplayer,

435
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:31,826
they do share a similar element that they both need to make sure that they frame, you know,

436
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:35,829
optional routes and gameplay objectives.

437
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:41,917
And in single player, you need to design optional routes

438
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:45,679
to support any rewards that you give the player,

439
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,463
whether that's a narrative tidbit, or a pickup,

440
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:53,565
or something like that, and support optional play

441
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:54,485
styles as well.

442
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:56,747
And in multiplayer, you also need

443
00:25:56,787 --> 00:26:01,090
to support multiple play styles, and that's even more important.

444
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,223
and make sure to design routes for more advanced players

445
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:07,845
so those advanced players feel a sense of progression

446
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:09,767
and that they're not just playing the same level

447
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:12,349
over and over again, but they can find additional routes

448
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,272
to evolve through the level

449
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:18,194
and get a fair advantage over players,

450
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,717
not like the sightline issue I was showing earlier,

451
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:24,800
but fair and visible advantages over other players.

452
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,607
And when you're playtesting single player, you playtest

453
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:31,851
less and polish more in between.

454
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:35,452
And in multiplayer, you playtest as often as possible

455
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:37,512
and make sure to repeat your playtesters.

456
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:41,053
And most important, fix exploits and sightlines

457
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:43,354
in multiplayer, because in single player,

458
00:26:44,074 --> 00:26:45,135
they're pretty low priority.

459
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:47,915
And so these are a bunch of the things

460
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:50,356
that you have to think about when

461
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:53,457
you are designing for different experiences

462
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:54,577
in single player and multiplayer.

463
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:57,798
And a lot of the skill sets you learn from one

464
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,479
are applicable to the other, using a lot of

465
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,482
architectural and framing techniques that you've learned,

466
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:07,186
or thinking about what makes a fun layout in space.

467
00:27:07,246 --> 00:27:10,130
And those can definitely be interchanged

468
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,972
in between the two, but there's a lot of

469
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,355
slightly different things that you have to think about

470
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:18,239
in terms of where you place your time

471
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,001
in thinking about them.

472
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:21,903
So thank you.

473
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,649
So we have like three minutes, so.

474
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:38,892
So yeah, if there's any questions,

475
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:40,253
might get one or two in.

476
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:43,976
Hi, that was a great talk, thank you.

477
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:46,718
I was just curious how you think of

478
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,720
cooperative level design,

479
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,402
because this seems focused mostly on multiplayer.

480
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:54,244
So I'm thinking, would you place cooperative

481
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:56,045
closer to single player or multiplayer?

482
00:27:57,048 --> 00:28:00,890
So I haven't personally designed any cooperative multiplayer

483
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,993
levels yet, but I imagine that it probably takes into account

484
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:07,975
kind of both of the elements that I was talking about in

485
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:09,015
single player and multiplayer.

486
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,116
Obviously, you're right.

487
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:11,577
I was designing.

488
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:16,039
I was talking about specific examples, and there are a lot

489
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,441
of multiplayer experiences or single player experiences that

490
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:20,902
don't fit in between the two things I was talking about.

491
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:22,804
But cooperative play.

492
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:35,883
Yeah, there's definitely some similarities, like there might be framing objectives and maybe narrative moments that the cooperative team wants to experience together.

493
00:28:35,903 --> 00:28:47,687
Those would be important to design and frame, but you don't have the issue of a single-player level where you only get one chance to understand what's going on.

494
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:48,708
Thank you.

495
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:51,863
Hi, thanks for the cool talk.

496
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:55,326
I would like to stick with the single player levels right now.

497
00:28:56,187 --> 00:29:00,110
Before you're going to start with, I don't know, basic block out, whatever environment you're working on,

498
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:03,133
how much story, in terms of the storytelling-wise,

499
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:07,517
how much story do you need to start working on the level you're thinking about?

500
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:09,759
It really depends.

501
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,162
I would say the biggest thing to think about is...

502
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:16,226
what is the space.

503
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:20,269
Obviously, you might have varying amounts of data

504
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:23,211
as to what the story will be in the space,

505
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,532
but at least thinking about,

506
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:28,574
instead of starting out with just plain shapes,

507
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:31,096
thinking about what are those shapes and structures

508
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,918
and building small stories based on that

509
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,220
that might support the overall theme

510
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,501
of the game you're working on.

511
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:46,077
And so even if you don't have the full idea of what the story is yet,

512
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:49,618
you probably have a good idea of the general theme of the game.

513
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:53,660
And I mean, single player, you're going to rework your level multiple times.

514
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,561
And especially if it's a narrative game,

515
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,762
you're probably going to remake a bunch of the levels

516
00:29:57,802 --> 00:30:00,883
to support new narrative elements that get put in.

517
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:03,985
And so you're just going to have to start somewhere

518
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:06,926
and then add stuff in later when you get more data.

519
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,366
Thank you so much.

520
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:14,705
Hello. Thanks for the talk first of all. I wanted to talk about multiplayer level design.

521
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:19,308
I guess my question is what's your opinion on asymmetry in multiplayer level design and

522
00:30:19,348 --> 00:30:23,991
how you like handle giving players different advantages in a situation or would you rather

523
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:29,134
have like a completely symmetrical map where both teams like have no advantages over each

524
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:33,077
other? So I think symmetrical multiplayer levels

525
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:41,138
are, I don't prefer them because players can get easily mixed up and confuse us where they are.

526
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:46,743
But asymmetrical multiplayer, I hate using the word asymmetrical because they still are

527
00:30:46,823 --> 00:30:51,948
symmetrical in terms of balancing. You need to figure out, like if you give advantage on one

528
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:56,192
side, you need to figure out a different way to give a similar advantage on another side.

529
00:30:57,233 --> 00:31:02,954
provide locations that give advantages that are equidistant between the two players

530
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:07,936
and maybe supporting, like, maybe one route on one side is more stealth-oriented

531
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:12,917
whereas the other side is more open, direct combat.

532
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:17,178
And so, I prefer more asymmetrical multiplayer levels.

533
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:18,319
Thank you.

534
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:21,560
I think that's all the time we have, so thank you.
