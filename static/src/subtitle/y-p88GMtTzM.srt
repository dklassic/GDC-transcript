1
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:08,563
Okay everybody, settle down, settle down.

2
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,303
It's the final day of Game Developers Conference.

3
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:13,144
Everyone have a good conference this year?

4
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:13,244
Yeah!

5
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:17,704
Surprisingly good, amazingly good.

6
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:22,665
I have no complaints except for maybe how late I was out last night.

7
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,806
I'm sure like many of you.

8
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:32,067
So before we get started on the Game Developers Conference, a few quick words about something

9
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:33,648
else that's happening at the Game Developers Conference.

10
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:34,668
That's the metagame.

11
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:37,430
Any players of the metagame here in the audience?

12
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:38,512
Yeah!

13
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:39,434
Thank you.

14
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:43,661
Well, on behalf of Local No. 12, which is Mike Edwards, Colleen Macklin, John Sharp,

15
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:48,909
and myself, we want to thank all of you for a really fabulous, incredible conference game

16
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:49,270
this year.

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,550
I think...

18
00:00:49,957 --> 00:00:53,080
I've been doing conference games at the Game Developers Conference every year for the last

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,644
12 years, and the metagame I think really is a sort of unqualified success.

20
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,185
It's really been a great time.

21
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:03,228
And you guys have been so great, and we've gotten so many requests from people that want

22
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:07,411
full decks of the metagame, that as of this moment, I am prepared to announce...

23
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:11,697
that just about 15 minutes ago we launched our Kickstarter page

24
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:15,499
to raise money to print metagame decks for all of you to order.

25
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,022
So look for us on Kickstarter and thank you

26
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,944
of Players and Game Developers Conference and our sponsors

27
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:26,486
the NYU Game Center and BBC and the IGDA

28
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,447
for helping make that happen. You've been fabulous.

29
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:33,561
After this session, immediately after this session at 1.30 at the IGDA booth in the South

30
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,222
Hall is the final tournament.

31
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:39,225
Even if you don't have a lot of cards, you might qualify for a local number 12 t-shirt

32
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:40,766
just for showing up.

33
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:44,168
And if you show up, you definitely will help determine the winner because like all the

34
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:47,690
other metagame matches, it will be a vote by the bystanders.

35
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:49,912
All right, without further ado, let's get down to it.

36
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:54,155
The Game Design Challenge GDC 2011.

37
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,316
Now, yeah, let's hear it.

38
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:57,237
Okay.

39
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:00,148
Game Design Challenge.

40
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:08,793
We have an absolutely sort of like face-melting roster of Game Design Challenge on stage here today.

41
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:09,873
You know...

42
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:16,023
The Game Design Challenge is about challenging game designers, how about that, to think about

43
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:20,484
really unusual, difficult game design problems.

44
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:25,665
It gives us a glimpse into how these incredibly talented and brilliant designers think about

45
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:31,126
problems and it also gives us a glimpse into new ways of thinking about games that might

46
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,387
spark ideas in their work or in your work or in the industry as a whole.

47
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,768
I've been doing the Game Design Challenge for a long time.

48
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:38,228
We've looked at...

49
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:44,053
It seems like the love story last year was real world permadeath where Jenova Chen, our

50
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:47,155
returning champion, had the winning entry.

51
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:47,816
Here's how it works.

52
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:54,670
About a month or two before the Game Developers Conference, I let our panelists know about

53
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,431
our theme, and they have to put together a concept that they're going to pitch to you.

54
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:04,393
The only restrictions are that it really has to be for present-day technology, and other

55
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:07,374
than that, they can present it however they wish, and I think we're going to have some

56
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,855
unusual and interesting presentations today.

57
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:15,937
I always try and pick a theme for the Game Design Challenge that somehow is a riff or

58
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:20,558
parody or reflection of something that's in the air of the game industry at large.

59
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:25,248
And, you know, some of the things that are going on this year really have to do with

60
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:32,575
the explosive growth and maybe controversy of games played on social networks, like Facebook.

61
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:37,179
You know, these games are pervading our lives in unusual ways.

62
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,400
They take over our time.

63
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,323
They're sort of appointment-style, asynchronous gameplay.

64
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:42,324
They make us...

65
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:55,622
The idea that games are potentially a lens for looking at everything and the entire world

66
00:03:55,662 --> 00:04:02,806
and all of our social relationships and societal structures and cultural artifacts as games,

67
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:04,227
within the lens of games.

68
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:06,548
The funny thing is that human culture has had...

69
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:13,751
An idea of putting a sort of metaphysical frame around everything that we do and who we are

70
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:18,032
and how we behave and what we should and shouldn't do and kind of grading and judging our actions.

71
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:20,793
And some might call that religion.

72
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:28,396
And so the theme this year of the Game Design Challenge was merging these two ancient forms

73
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:29,456
of human practice, right?

74
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:32,997
Merging games and religion.

75
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:34,077
And what would that mean?

76
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:35,278
So the challenge that I gave...

77
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:43,477
Our intrepid designers was create a game that could also in some way be a religion.

78
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:45,738
And not a game about a religion, right?

79
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:54,104
Not a game which tells a story of a priest who has a spiritual journey or something,

80
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:59,228
but rather a game that really in its practice and in the way it operates on its players

81
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:03,351
or in society is also in fact in some way a bona fide religion.

82
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:07,459
I can't wait to see what these guys have come up with, and I'm sure you can't wait as well.

83
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:11,299
You all have a really big part in the Game Design Challenge every year, which is to vote

84
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,080
on the winner through applause, so listen carefully.

85
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,181
And I think that I want to share with you guys the prizes.

86
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:22,722
So the winner will get to pick which of the three prizes they want, but everyone gets

87
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:23,202
a prize.

88
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:30,383
First, we have this New Testament Pocket Edition, which I can now...

89
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:34,830
I've done some Bible thumping at the Game Developers Conference.

90
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,932
We also have the Book of Mormon, another great book,

91
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:42,553
and L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics, just for a different flavor.

92
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:47,435
So, this is what they'll be competing for.

93
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:51,237
Alright, without further ado, we are going to bring up Jason Rohr.

94
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:54,058
Jason Rohr is a legend in the art games movement.

95
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:57,239
He's made wonderful games like Passage that have moved many of us,

96
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:58,860
and recently released his game,

97
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:02,517
inside a star-filled sky. Let's hear it for Jason Rohrer!

98
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:33,219
And also the Dianetics Prize is awesome because I actually went to the college library and was reading all the Scientology books that they had there

99
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,881
when I was thinking about this.

100
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,785
So yeah, so Scientology is close to my heart.

101
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,068
Okay, so Chainworld.

102
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:47,735
So a very old purpose of religion was to explain

103
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:51,754
physical mysteries in the world, you know, like these huge mountains, they're so impressive,

104
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:54,816
they fill us with these spiritual feelings, like where did they come from, how did they

105
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:55,216
get here?

106
00:06:56,057 --> 00:07:00,520
A good example of this comes from Aboriginal Australians, which have this spiritual idea

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,802
of a dreaming or dream time that kind of existed before humanity.

108
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:10,567
This is a painting by a famous Aboriginal artist, Clifford Possum, of a dreaming, of

109
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:16,571
a particular dreaming from Aboriginal spirituality, and if this painting looks like a map, that's

110
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:17,692
because this painting is a map.

111
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:24,212
So, over time that purpose of religion seems like it's mostly been replaced by science,

112
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:28,255
and like this particular sub-purpose of religion has been replaced by technology, right?

113
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:32,998
So maybe as a coincidence or maybe because of this, I'm not sure, religion kind of turned

114
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:33,839
inward, right?

115
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,202
So we don't explain physical mysteries anymore, we explain non-physical ones.

116
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,624
Mysteries about death, mysteries about how one should live one's life and things like

117
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:40,884
that.

118
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:44,747
But we still have physical mysteries, and I'm not talking about like gravity or unified

119
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:46,829
theory of physics or anything like that.

120
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,562
We still tell stories to explain them, very simple physical mysteries, not complex, esoteric

121
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:51,742
ones.

122
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,064
As an example, this is my grandfather.

123
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:57,965
This is the guy holding the pen, pointing at the map.

124
00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:58,765
This is from 1961.

125
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:05,668
He's standing next to the Ohio Highway Director and two Ohio State Senators, and he's pointing

126
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,449
at a map because they were talking about this.

127
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:12,932
This is I-77, Interstate 77, goes all the way from Cleveland down to South Carolina.

128
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,625
and as Google Maps shows at the blue line here.

129
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:17,806
And back then in the 60s, they were building this thing.

130
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,387
Part of the interstate highway system.

131
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,388
And my grandfather was the first mayor of Fairlawn, Ohio,

132
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:24,268
a tiny little village.

133
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,909
And right after incorporating, they were like,

134
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,129
well, here comes this highway.

135
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,610
We're going to put it through the center of your village.

136
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,930
We're going to bisect your village with it.

137
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,331
And he, of course, as mayor, said this was going to ruin our village

138
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:34,752
and put up a fight with the state and so on.

139
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,092
It lasted a number of years and there were some lawsuits

140
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:38,093
and that kind of thing.

141
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,033
But in the end, he won.

142
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,394
So this is where they wanted to put the highway,

143
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,274
where those red dots are.

144
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:46,224
And this is where they ended up putting it, in the circuitous route around Fairlawn

145
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:49,986
into some countryside that then became the fastest growing commercial area

146
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,528
in the country back in the 80s and 90s

147
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:58,371
because this big highway passed through farmland right near a populated center.

148
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:02,754
So now, to this day, millions of people who drive on this road every year

149
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:06,856
take this long circuitous route because of my grandfather.

150
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:09,057
It's like my grandfather's dog leg in I-77.

151
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:09,238
So, uh...

152
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:19,454
So I knew my grandfather and I remember him, but he died when I was like eight or something like that.

153
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:23,676
My real memories of him have become vague and these larger-than-life stories like this have grown in importance.

154
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:28,418
There was recently a newspaper article that got passed around my family about this thing my grandfather had done,

155
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:29,578
which is how I found out about it.

156
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:32,440
And the physical traces he's left behind have grown in importance too.

157
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,902
As another example, at a recent family reunion, we took a drive around Fairlawn.

158
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:41,924
As the first mayor, the legend has it in my family that my grandfather designed this sign.

159
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,219
If you go to the Fairlawn City website, you see the sign.

160
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,120
And if you drive around Fairlawn, you see it today.

161
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,702
And we took a trip to this park where

162
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,764
there's a big stone edifice with a sign embossed on it.

163
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:52,605
And we all stood in front of it and got our picture taken

164
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:53,466
at this family reunion.

165
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,128
On that same trip, we also drove past the house

166
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,449
that my grandfather built.

167
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,631
At least that's what we always said when I was growing up,

168
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:04,174
double brick construction in an era of timber frame and so on.

169
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,838
So how are these places not like shrines?

170
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:11,020
And how are these visits that we take to them

171
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,920
not like pilgrimages?

172
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:16,647
My grandfather has become less of a man and more the idea of a man, as the real details

173
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:21,369
have faded and been replaced with these imaginary details that we're kind of filling in.

174
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:27,410
You know, remaining photographs of him become like religious icons, and we also hold on

175
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,871
to these supposed utterances.

176
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,832
I never heard him say this, but we'd say that he said it, right?

177
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:37,773
And I actually gave Chris Hecker this piece of advice at the top just last week.

178
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:38,393
So...

179
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:39,914
Uh...

180
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:47,383
Anyway, yeah, so I still treat this as kind of this holy wisdom passed down from my grandfather

181
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,644
that I'm willing to foist upon a friend, right?

182
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:51,664
Like Proverbs.

183
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,806
And so what is an idea of a man, an ideal man, but a god?

184
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:58,067
And our connection with him becomes very spiritual and religious as time passes.

185
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:01,408
And this is more dramatic the farther we go back in time, like I never even knew my great

186
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:07,270
grandfather but I've driven past the house that he built and I've seen a couple of photographs

187
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,971
and I have all these imaginary details that have filled in about him, all these stories

188
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:11,692
that I've heard about him.

189
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,332
So, the same process happens for historical figures, like if you're really into Abbeck's

190
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:22,114
painting, you know, you go off to Long Island and visit Jackson Pollock's barn, where he

191
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:26,496
did his famous splatter painting, drip paintings, and you know, it's like this shrine, all these

192
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:29,698
things are preserved, the paint splotches that he left right when he died, his cigarette

193
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:32,159
butts, his shoes, they're sitting there, you can walk up to them.

194
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,941
And it really is like a pilgrimage for people who are into this kind of thing.

195
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:40,063
And taking this process to the limit, we get deep human mysteries like...

196
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:44,485
Stonehenge, we imagine the druids, when we think about Stonehenge, we really do imagine

197
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,966
them somehow magically lifting these things up or figuring out technology to do this.

198
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:52,087
You know, I guess even though supposedly the druids didn't really build the thing, but

199
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:52,907
we still think of them, right?

200
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,248
So here's my summary of this humanistic religious practice that I'm observing in the world.

201
00:11:57,688 --> 00:11:59,689
We become like gods to those who come after us.

202
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:04,960
Okay, so what I want to do is foster this kind of religious practice through a game design.

203
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:09,324
So, here's a metagame that sort of comes close to doing that.

204
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:12,386
A game where, instead of everyone playing the game at the same time out in the world,

205
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,648
one person in the world plays the game at a time,

206
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:17,290
and they're the only person playing it, and then when they're done,

207
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,151
they pass the game on to the next person, and they play it,

208
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:22,854
and they're the only one in the world, and they pass it on, and pass it on, and so on.

209
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:28,838
So, this also, along with starting to get close to this predecessor-successor relationship that I'm talking about,

210
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,059
this spirituality has the properties.

211
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:32,843
of religious practice like the chain could be a secret practice.

212
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:37,424
There's mystery about the nature of the game because you don't get to talk to everyone

213
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:37,885
who's playing it.

214
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:40,305
There's this one person, mysterious person out there in the world playing it and you're

215
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,045
waiting your turn.

216
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:42,146
You're waiting to be chosen.

217
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,306
There's this anticipation.

218
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,527
You might get to have this experience sometime in your lifetime and you might not.

219
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:52,948
But it doesn't really foster the predecessor-successor spirituality and the connection that I wanted.

220
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:57,409
When you start a game normally, you sort of assume that the start state that you get when

221
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:59,189
you start the game is the start state.

222
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:00,270
When you start playing The Witness...

223
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:03,483
and this is like the reality for you.

224
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:04,643
This is what has been laid out for you.

225
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:05,664
It's your in-game foundation.

226
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,904
It's like, you know, like the game designer is God,

227
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:10,165
and they create the start, like that's Jonathan Blow there with the crown,

228
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:12,126
and he creates the start state and the witness.

229
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:16,407
And understanding the witness is in a lot of ways like understanding that one God.

230
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,948
Like, what did he put here for me?

231
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,188
Why, what is this supposed to mean?

232
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:20,288
What's he trying to communicate?

233
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:22,829
And we really do think about the game designer a lot of times

234
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:24,270
when we're playing a game and trying to understand it.

235
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,791
But what if your start state wasn't actually a start state?

236
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:29,872
What if it was someone else's end state?

237
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:38,502
And as an example of this, I mean, this is a simple reconnection of that chain game I talked about before.

238
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:43,046
Like when you start a Mario level and you're in there, you see some configuration of blocks,

239
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,367
and so you sort of think of it as a given.

240
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:47,229
And when you see this, you might say, well, that must be put there for a reason.

241
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:48,890
I'm small, I can't break the blocks.

242
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,232
Maybe I'll look for some coin blocks right under the bottom,

243
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:54,194
or maybe I'll get big and try and slide under there and break through to see,

244
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:56,135
there must be something up there, that must be there for a reason.

245
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,757
You assume it's a start state created by the designer.

246
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:01,138
But what if it was really somebody else's end state

247
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,120
from a start state that looked like this, right?

248
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,941
So there's a story here about how that tunnel came to be,

249
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:09,404
and it wasn't really put there by the designer on purpose.

250
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:12,866
It was sort of a side effect of how the previous player got through the level.

251
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,348
I think a chain platform is a really bad idea

252
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:17,629
because the challenges can be spent, right?

253
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:18,630
This turtle is spent,

254
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,931
and the second player gets maybe a less interesting game

255
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:22,052
or maybe a confusing game.

256
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,409
The previous player pretty much ruined that part of the level for the next player.

257
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:29,110
But what about a game that has these properties?

258
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,310
So you have a goal to accomplish.

259
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,471
Modifying the game world is a natural side effect of pursuing that goal,

260
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:36,632
but modification simply changes the terrain that the next person will face

261
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:39,953
without ruining the terrain for the next person.

262
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,193
It's being modified, but it's not being ruined.

263
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,074
It's like creating maybe new challenges along the way.

264
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:49,475
And the platformers may be too simple to have those side effects have that property.

265
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:54,558
So in a game with those properties, you might not realize how your modifications of the world will be perceived by the next player

266
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,822
as you're playing along doing what you're trying to do, or you might realize it and modify the world's intention.

267
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:05,205
The way my grandfather might have been thinking about what successors would think about the state of Farallon

268
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:08,127
when he made the choices he did about how to redirect the highway and so on.

269
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:10,056
He might have been thinking about posterity.

270
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:13,177
And as the next player, you'll wonder how the world came to be in the state that it's

271
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:13,417
in.

272
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:17,458
You know, like, wow, what was the previous player doing that left these grooves in the

273
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,038
game state?

274
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,559
These gouges in the train?

275
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:20,759
You know, what's this road for?

276
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,420
Where does it lead?

277
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,480
What was this, what was, what did it mean?

278
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,542
And you'll tell yourself stories to explain how these things came to be.

279
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:31,923
Just the way, just the same way that we tell stories about Stonehenge and have this sort

280
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:33,223
of spiritual connection with these people.

281
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:38,760
So I ran in circles for a while trying to come up with a primary game to plug into this chain metagame.

282
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:42,802
I tried to invent a new game with these properties, but my mind kept circling back.

283
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:46,484
I was trapped in the gravity of an existing game.

284
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,085
A game where you modify the world as a side effect of pursuing your goal,

285
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:52,966
and a game where you leave traces behind and discover other people's traces.

286
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:57,448
And it also happens to be, and I think it's probably true for a number of people in the audience,

287
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:01,090
one of the most spiritual experiences I've ever had with a game.

288
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:06,036
in my entire life, I think, and I think a lot of people agree.

289
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:11,699
So my game design is a Minecraft mod.

290
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,842
Or a Minecraft metagame, a game that's played with Minecraft.

291
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:18,263
So you receive the game on a USB stick.

292
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,425
In fact, it's this USB stick right here.

293
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:22,666
This is the only one in the world.

294
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,988
And I've written some scripts that are on this stick

295
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:27,649
that make the game, glue the game together,

296
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,090
but Minecraft is also on this stick,

297
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,051
and it's the only Minecraft world that's on this stick.

298
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,582
So this is kind of like the ark. This is the sort of holy object that gets passed down.

299
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:38,103
And here are the rules.

300
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,704
So this is the canon law of ChainWorld.

301
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:45,807
So you plug this into your computer, you run Minecraft via one of the included scripts that's on here.

302
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:47,107
You don't just run Minecraft directly.

303
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:51,789
You start a single player game when Minecraft starts up and you pick ChainWorld as the world you're going to go into.

304
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,070
And you play until you die exactly once.

305
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,051
And while you're playing there's a couple of sub-rules.

306
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,572
You can't erect wooden signs with text.

307
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,921
to communicate to somebody in the future.

308
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:02,322
And suicide is permissible.

309
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:03,822
So you don't have to keep playing until you die naturally.

310
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:07,204
Maybe you play for a while and say, I'm done, I'm going to commit suicide.

311
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:11,866
And immediately after dying and respawning, you quit to the menu.

312
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:15,888
So after dying, you respawn, you've lost all your items, you're back to the default state,

313
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:19,069
and you're back to the spawn point, and then you quit to the menu.

314
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,712
And then allow the world to save, because Minecraft does that automatically.

315
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:27,265
and you exit the game and then my script is kind of waiting in the background there and

316
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:32,150
it will automatically copy the world that you've modified back onto the USB stick, replacing

317
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,512
the ones on there, and it also deletes it off your hard drive.

318
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:38,556
So then you pass the USB stick onto someone else who expresses interest, not just like,

319
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:39,737
hey, you want to play this?

320
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:40,878
I don't even know if you play Minecraft.

321
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:44,021
You've got to find someone who's already sort of interested in the idea and interested in

322
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,643
the idea of participating in this religion.

323
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:47,125
Find a seeker.

324
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:47,825
Right?

325
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:51,190
Um, so, and then you never discuss what you saw or didn't in ChainWorld with anyone,

326
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,373
although I'm going to break that rule here in a second a little bit.

327
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:56,138
Um, and you never play again.

328
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:58,021
You're only allowed to play once in your lifetime.

329
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:01,586
Um, so, I was player one.

330
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:10,029
And I had all these plans and I wanted to construct these things for the next person to discover.

331
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:14,010
And my seven-year-old child was with me and he's coming up with ideas and we're playing along and then...

332
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:18,012
I'm not going to tell you how it happened because you'll probably run into it too because it's still waiting for you there.

333
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:25,894
But I had one of the most heart-breaking and poignant deaths that I've ever...

334
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:26,895
way too soon...

335
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:29,736
that I've ever experienced in a video game in my entire life.

336
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:31,996
And my child who was sitting there was in tears.

337
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,302
And he wanted to tear this out of the back of my computer and stomp on it.

338
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:40,565
We didn't do anything for them. We didn't leave anything for them to discover.

339
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:41,545
Oh my god, what do we, you know...

340
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:46,468
Yeah. So, someone in the audience is going to get to be player two.

341
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,610
But, you know, according to rule number seven,

342
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,132
you know, it has to be someone who expresses interest.

343
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:55,033
I didn't just want to throw it into the crowd or have it taped to one of the bottom of your seats.

344
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:56,434
That would break rule number seven.

345
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:59,676
So I need, you know, someone in the front row who's gonna...

346
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:03,669
I can't give it to a friend, it can't be a friend.

347
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:04,570
Yay!

348
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:19,039
So, that's Chainwhirl. Thank you, everybody.

349
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:31,437
I think I might be a convert, although I've also been told I'm a religious slut, so maybe

350
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:34,861
I'll experience a few religions before the end of the session.

351
00:19:36,022 --> 00:19:39,605
Okay, that joke did not, maybe not comprehensible.

352
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:44,030
We'll all wake up in the middle of the night chuckling about it.

353
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:53,180
Next I'd like to bring to the stage someone who truly is a legend of the game industry,

354
00:19:53,481 --> 00:20:00,729
John Romero, who among other things is responsible for games like Doom that helped invent what

355
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:03,552
we know as the contemporary computer and video game.

356
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,716
Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, John Romero!

357
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,153
All right. I'm not walking around this time.

358
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:24,775
Got to get my thing up there.

359
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:28,456
OK, I'm glad that I didn't do the same thing.

360
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:31,337
I think it's a great idea.

361
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:38,340
OK. DPI. It's a DPI button right there.

362
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,900
Yeah.

363
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:45,903
OK. Awesome. OK. Here it is.

364
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:58,645
What is a religion? I'm asking that question. A religion is a deity. It has worshippers.

365
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:06,852
There's a lot of devotion. There were some religious events in history that were game-like,

366
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:14,058
such as the Crusades, which excelled at deathmatch. Did a great job.

367
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,741
But I decided, you know, I kept on coming back to the Trinity, to the deity, to the

368
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,442
worshippers, and to the devotion.

369
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:26,663
Nice.

370
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:32,505
In the beginning, there was...at God.

371
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:36,867
And actually, there were a whole lot of gods.

372
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,028
Lots of numbers.

373
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:44,429
But then, rose the one true God, God 6502.

374
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,881
located in Cupertino.

375
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:52,983
But then God 6502 had a son. It was Messiah 6502

376
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:54,804
here in San Francisco.

377
00:21:56,604 --> 00:22:00,566
And the Messiah 6502 soon collected followers.

378
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:04,568
First,

379
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:09,950
the first twelve are the apostles. Now follow on Twitter immediately

380
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,451
Messiah 6502. Anybody that's on Twitter.

381
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:19,107
We only have 12 apostles.

382
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,749
We have, actually, let me check it out.

383
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:26,051
Because I know that some people already kind of jumped on the

384
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:31,254
Messiah was discovered a little bit earlier by several people.

385
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:36,517
And we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 right now.

386
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,119
Messiah is trying to get followers.

387
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,640
And you guys can't see that right now?

388
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:42,980
OK.

389
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,640
Okay, that's okay, I don't need to show everybody.

390
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,783
Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six, I think we have twelve.

391
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:55,424
All right, wow, we have way more than twelve.

392
00:22:55,784 --> 00:23:02,807
For those of you that can't see, John is looking at a Twitter page with followers of a Twitter user called...

393
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:04,188
Eleven, twelve, okay.

394
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,789
All right, I got the first twelve.

395
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,771
Let's, I'm going to need the...

396
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:13,492
Let me pop this up real quick.

397
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:17,596
Okay, we have 12 apostles.

398
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,838
They need to come down to the front of the stage, so I'm going to need the lights to come up a little bit.

399
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:27,700
And those apostles are Christine and Norman Truffle.

400
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,821
FF Paladin, if you guys are in the room.

401
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:34,442
So we know that there should be people in the room.

402
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,684
More internets? Is more internets in the room?

403
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:40,945
I need my colored stuff here.

404
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:54,736
Okay, each of the apostles is going to get a stack of paper.

405
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:04,483
Squirrel tweets? That's alright. Alright, squirrel.

406
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:05,784
Ian Bogost.

407
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,607
Chelsea Howe. Is Chelsea Howe here?

408
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,090
Jane McGonigal.

409
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:17,538
Yes, you made it.

410
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:26,921
Let's see, Paul Rylands, Richard Lemarchand, Brian Cash,

411
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:28,962
John Sharp, and Colleen Macklin.

412
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:30,683
Did we get all 12? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

413
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:33,424
Is that 11? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

414
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:35,965
The 12 are all here?

415
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:36,445
All right.

416
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:36,805
All right.

417
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:40,467
No, no, each of the 12.

418
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:52,791
needs to come up and get one of these and then stand right in front here.

419
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:56,654
Over this way. Here you go.

420
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:57,274
Okay. You're ready.

421
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:19,893
All right, now, let's go back.

422
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:21,074
OK.

423
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:27,737
So the apostle rule is you each have a pad of sticky notes

424
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:30,038
to gather followers in the audience.

425
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:32,459
And you have to find followers and return here

426
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:33,800
after precisely two minutes.

427
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,660
Go now.

428
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,981
All right.

429
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:36,181
All right.

430
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:36,381
All right.

431
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:36,581
All right.

432
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,182
All right.

433
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:40,043
All right, they're going to try and convert everybody

434
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:41,403
as fast as possible.

435
00:25:42,844 --> 00:25:45,385
If you've been converted, you can resist conversion.

436
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:48,655
You know, you can be atheist.

437
00:25:48,995 --> 00:25:50,076
Don't take a piece of paper.

438
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,099
Sometimes it's involuntary.

439
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:57,502
You know, you don't have to stick to one apostle.

440
00:25:57,542 --> 00:26:00,324
You can trade paper with other people if you like.

441
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:06,269
All right, you guys can crusade if you want.

442
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:08,070
Crusade all over this room.

443
00:26:10,772 --> 00:26:13,334
Feel free to check into Mecca GDC on Foursquare.

444
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:14,855
It's right here in this room, Mecca.

445
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:21,921
You can meditate in silent prayer if you're not getting converted.

446
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:24,883
I see some paper getting shredded up and thrown in the air.

447
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:31,107
You can drop your beliefs immediately if you want to be converted.

448
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:32,629
You can throw that paper down.

449
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:36,051
Start a holy war mentally with somebody else.

450
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:36,791
Stare them down.

451
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:42,275
Everybody's got almost like a minute left.

452
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:52,584
Alright, when you're done converting people, come back up to the front.

453
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:58,567
I feel that, uh...

454
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:03,170
Remember, you guys can resist this conversion.

455
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,973
Maybe if you don't like the Apostle, you can throw away the paper.

456
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:16,837
Okay, time's up.

457
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:19,946
All apostles come to the front.

458
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:32,928
All right.

459
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:37,509
If you didn't hand out all of you, if you didn't convert everybody, that's great.

460
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,950
Everybody back.

461
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,751
Don't be desperate.

462
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:50,254
Oh, you can't convert the Messiah.

463
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:50,875
Ha ha ha ha!

464
00:27:50,975 --> 00:27:51,375
Oh my God!

465
00:27:51,415 --> 00:27:51,535
Yeah!

466
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:56,557
Alright.

467
00:27:58,738 --> 00:27:59,599
Is everybody back?

468
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,400
As a impartial judge.

469
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,861
Colleen...

470
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:07,222
you're not supposed to get them all converted there.

471
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:08,403
Ha ha ha!

472
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:11,784
Ok, that might have been disobedient.

473
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,005
Ha ha ha!

474
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,046
Um, ok, now the winner...

475
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:21,559
is the apostle with the most miracles.

476
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:23,540
And the apostles are all up front here.

477
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:29,644
If your apostle marker has a star on it, then you've received a miracle.

478
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:32,806
Hallelujah!

479
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:33,827
Yes!

480
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,669
Disciples with miracles, come to the front.

481
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:42,332
Yeah.

482
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:44,253
Everybody come up to your apostle.

483
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:49,714
So we have to kind of spread out if everybody's been converted.

484
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,193
Now everybody, all apostles count your miracles.

485
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:20,189
Gather your followers with the miracles.

486
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:30,774
Lime is over here with the squirrel.

487
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:42,118
Okay, count miracles.

488
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:55,645
Okay, the apostles have to count the miracles, stack them up, like gather the miracles.

489
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:07,975
All right now, has everybody counted miracles?

490
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:09,976
Have all the apostles counted?

491
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:11,217
Okay, then.

492
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:18,846
Alright, all the followers can go back if you've handed off your miracles to the apostles.

493
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,190
Then the apostles can come out front.

494
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:31,815
Um, I guess, if you've, well, if you've counted them, you know how many?

495
00:30:33,016 --> 00:30:33,956
Need to know how many.

496
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:41,641
Okay, you have three?

497
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:42,402
Nice, okay.

498
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:47,157
What are the, let's find out who the winner is.

499
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:49,158
So, so,

500
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:49,819
You're, uh,

501
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,900
Pink, you have, you have three?

502
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,060
Three?

503
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,202
Oh, well that's not, that's not real. It's a real sticker.

504
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:54,142
Six real ones.

505
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:54,363
Five?

506
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:55,644
Okay, six is the, six is so far?

507
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:16,697
Anyone else?

508
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:17,578
Five.

509
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:17,678
Five.

510
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:18,898
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

511
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:19,599
Maybe I missed a count.

512
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:20,079
Huh?

513
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:21,579
Right, right.

514
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,360
Six.

515
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,820
Anyone else with six?

516
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,920
No.

517
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:26,662
Oh, Squirrel?

518
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:28,282
No.

519
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:33,024
All right, the winner is Squirrel, the apostle.

520
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:37,806
Yes, but Squirrel, don't go away yet.

521
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:41,788
Of course, we all know that that's not the end.

522
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:43,729
You're going to have to come up here on stage because...

523
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:49,158
To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero.

524
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:54,540
And now, I present to you the new Messiah.

525
00:31:58,362 --> 00:31:58,762
Thank you.

526
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:03,384
And while I believe that Lime is the only true path, all paths lead to truth.

527
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:11,588
All right, thank you, John Romero!

528
00:32:16,913 --> 00:32:20,836
For that truly unique entry into the annals of the Game Design Challenge history.

529
00:32:22,377 --> 00:32:33,404
Next we have our returning champion, one of the founders of That Game Company, responsible for favorites like Flower and Flow, the man standing just beside me, Jenova Chen!

530
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:34,845
Ladies and gentlemen!

531
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:47,399
All right.

532
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,823
So first of all, I resist this, because it is not

533
00:32:55,863 --> 00:32:57,744
religion to my standard.

534
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:03,707
OK, so when I was presented this challenge,

535
00:33:03,727 --> 00:33:05,408
I found it's particularly difficult,

536
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:09,010
because I am supposed to be an atheist from China.

537
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:14,363
So I was trying to guess what is a religion,

538
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,484
and did a lot of research.

539
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:18,685
In fact, I did so much research that I

540
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:21,107
realized this is the final opportunity for me

541
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:24,248
to put everything straight about my own belief.

542
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:27,410
So I take this presentation very seriously.

543
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:31,272
In China, we do believe in gods.

544
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,573
And we have gods who created the world, gods who created humans.

545
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,087
But it's the believing part.

546
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:40,308
We don't necessarily believe in a god of Earth.

547
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:41,768
What can we believe about?

548
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:46,129
I mean, in my opinion, the Chinese gods

549
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:48,210
and the Egyptian gods, all the old religions,

550
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,311
they represent the unknown.

551
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:52,931
Why is certain things a certain way?

552
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:53,372
We don't know.

553
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,452
Well, there's a god for that.

554
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:54,532
But.

555
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:04,018
According to Wikipedia, a religion is not really about having gods.

556
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:09,220
It's more about creating truths and values that can change people's lifestyle.

557
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:15,181
They can define morality, promote certain behavior, disregard certain behavior,

558
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,122
and really change our life values.

559
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:24,164
So if you look at the religious map, I find it interesting that all the Western religions,

560
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:28,325
they have God as a symbol to represent those values.

561
00:34:28,977 --> 00:34:31,619
While the Eastern religion, like Buddhism, Daoism,

562
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,941
all these things, they more focus on the actual life value

563
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:36,802
and what is the way you to live.

564
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:37,823
I mean, gods are there.

565
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:39,684
Some of them has mythical characters,

566
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,466
but they don't really represent the way of living.

567
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:48,530
So Daoism is actually, Dao means the way of life,

568
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:49,971
how you're supposed to live.

569
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:54,354
In my opinion, I think that is what religion is.

570
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:55,975
It's about how you're supposed to live.

571
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,940
And there's confusion.

572
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:02,902
Confucius is more considered as a philosopher,

573
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:05,283
but many people in China believe in its value

574
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:08,225
and living based on the moral standard he created.

575
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:16,730
So for a while, I was a believer in socialism, Marxism, Maoism.

576
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,372
And eventually, it's replaced.

577
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:23,613
Chairman Mao failed at convincing everybody

578
00:35:23,653 --> 00:35:24,774
that's the right way to live.

579
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:31,070
Then comes Chairman Deng. He promotes Dengism, which is pragmatism.

580
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,414
He really thinks we should develop economy to make everybody happy.

581
00:35:35,874 --> 00:35:41,198
And for a long time, people believed in that. They put economic growth ahead of everything.

582
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:47,743
And until today, I think not just in China, but also in America, there's this new religion.

583
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:51,706
Actually, I see this on some online dictionaries that consumerism is a religion.

584
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:55,369
I think there's a way. It does promote certain value.

585
00:35:56,744 --> 00:36:01,267
When they say, the consumerism beginners, right?

586
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,890
And I noticed that all these philosophies or religions

587
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,651
essentially are trying to lure people

588
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,732
into some kind of happiness.

589
00:36:13,193 --> 00:36:16,755
Even the socialism, look at the propaganda they have there.

590
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,016
But they actually failed.

591
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,038
This is more of a kind of recreation of that.

592
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:28,126
My understanding, my view on religion,

593
00:36:29,227 --> 00:36:33,549
is that it is a core value that, through a particular set

594
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:37,512
of practices and dogmas, that's developed

595
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:40,814
based on the time and the environment it is in.

596
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:43,555
I mean, the final goal is really to make people

597
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:44,796
who believe in it feel happy.

598
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:49,539
And to do that, all religions have

599
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,121
to address two of the biggest problems a human can face,

600
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:53,642
which is.

601
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:56,798
Number one, the boredom from a lack of purpose.

602
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:59,179
Many people kill themselves when they don't have a purpose.

603
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,121
The other one is the fear for death.

604
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:05,523
That's the most common issues that religion has to solve.

605
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:07,925
And in order to do that, religion

606
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:10,646
has to explain the origin and the meaning of life

607
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:13,388
and to create a belonging towards something that's bigger.

608
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:16,090
So even if you do die, you're not afraid.

609
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,491
There's something else that continues.

610
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,521
Of course, as a religion, it is an organization

611
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,181
and it needs to spread this ideology to many people,

612
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:28,562
to spread the way of life and their values.

613
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,243
And it needs to adapt to the changing environment

614
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:33,903
and to survive the test of time.

615
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:38,264
And that's what other religions left today so far.

616
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,666
So as a designer, I want to construct

617
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:46,866
my own religion, which itself is very insulting.

618
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:53,176
So my inspirations are usually from mythologists.

619
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:56,058
Everybody knows the hero's journey, monomyth.

620
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,702
From psychologists, the founding father of positive psychology,

621
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:02,603
people researching on what makes people happy.

622
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:07,006
And this guy, because we need to survive

623
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,868
and we need to create something that is better,

624
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,210
that is more adapted to the current environment,

625
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,973
will be a religion that can really survive today.

626
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:20,564
And then other thing is what's happening around.

627
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,126
You know, that's my inspiration.

628
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:25,188
But as a designer, I want to make something simple

629
00:38:25,248 --> 00:38:27,330
and intuitive because kids today don't have time

630
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,451
to read manual, they don't have time to read Bible.

631
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:31,153
It has to be very simple.

632
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:31,933
Right?

633
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:34,155
We all just figure it out.

634
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:37,358
So,

635
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,661
I wanted to make sure this religion

636
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:42,982
definitely create happiness.

637
00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:45,804
There's a very famous chart about happiness.

638
00:38:46,044 --> 00:38:46,425
This is,

639
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:53,875
At the bottom is the GDP of the country, and at the top is the country that has the most happiness.

640
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:57,278
And a lot of people who believe in consumerism say,

641
00:38:57,518 --> 00:39:01,882
see, you need to consume more so you can create a higher GDP so you will become happier.

642
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:08,067
But what they don't see is the other map, which is often shown in the positive psychology.

643
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:13,872
This is a map about the percentage of Americans who are very happy, which is about 30%.

644
00:39:14,975 --> 00:39:17,617
And you can see from 1955 to today,

645
00:39:18,257 --> 00:39:21,540
the economy has skyrocketed like five times.

646
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,941
People are making a lot more money.

647
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:24,002
They can consume a lot more.

648
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:26,544
But the happiness percentage is now increasing.

649
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:29,206
What does that mean, then?

650
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:32,849
Another chart from psychology.

651
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:36,471
This is the average income of America and the happiness

652
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:36,812
curve.

653
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:39,534
And you can tell that once you have over 60,000

654
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:39,874
annual income.

655
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:47,799
The happiness level does not increase at that point.

656
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,760
But if you are making lower than that, yeah, more money

657
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,421
does make you feel slightly happier.

658
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:57,326
But this chart addresses a point that is, once people have money,

659
00:39:57,366 --> 00:39:58,126
that's not enough.

660
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:01,709
That money doesn't drive the happiness

661
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:03,590
to a higher percentage.

662
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,811
There needs to be something else.

663
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,355
And if you look at the science of happiness,

664
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:12,697
everybody familiar with Maslow's basic needs of human?

665
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:14,318
And

666
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:17,296
All the lower stuff can be addressed by money.

667
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:20,379
Once you have money, you have shelter, you have food,

668
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,160
you have a family, you can afford something.

669
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,882
And if you do make money, you do have a respect from others.

670
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:30,906
But there is a top one, the self-actualization,

671
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:31,626
the purpose.

672
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,728
That happiness, the money doesn't address.

673
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:38,751
In Joseph Campbell's work, every single mythical story,

674
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:42,494
every religious story that's been told about a human, which

675
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:43,889
He calls us hero.

676
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:45,170
Hero is really everybody.

677
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,991
Has to go through this path.

678
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:51,572
And what's important is that the hero, in the end,

679
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:55,394
has to bring something back to his community,

680
00:40:55,814 --> 00:40:57,554
to something that's bigger than himself.

681
00:40:57,975 --> 00:41:00,595
If the hero goes through all this journey

682
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:04,077
and only benefit himself, this story would not be told.

683
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:05,517
And this is not a happy story.

684
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:07,038
But then.

685
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:10,251
If we do say our goal is finally contributing

686
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,273
to our community, many people don't get to do that

687
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:13,374
until they retire.

688
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:16,136
What about the rest of their life?

689
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:19,199
How can you make sure the rest of your life is actually happy?

690
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:22,422
And we are designers.

691
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:23,242
We make games.

692
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:28,047
So we know how to make a life activity very fun, very happy.

693
00:41:28,227 --> 00:41:31,069
And we use flow as flow theory.

694
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:34,512
We want to create something that is, you know,

695
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:39,358
that has a balance between your own ability and the things you're pursuing.

696
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:43,562
But then what is this thing in my religion that is really worth pursuing?

697
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:49,087
The religion has to address this next problem, which is the purpose of life.

698
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:51,069
Where are you heading to?

699
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:52,650
What is worth living?

700
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,273
Very difficult issue.

701
00:41:57,294 --> 00:42:00,297
Okay, I'm trying to address this here.

702
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:05,162
So there are various religions, various things that

703
00:42:05,282 --> 00:42:06,663
tells you why you are born.

704
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:09,404
In a certain scene, like when I was in China,

705
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:13,466
I was told that we are born to really realize communism

706
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:20,169
and really defeat the capitalism and the imperialism.

707
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,891
But that didn't really gel with myself.

708
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:27,132
The consumerism says you should consume more.

709
00:42:27,152 --> 00:42:28,093
You should make more money.

710
00:42:28,273 --> 00:42:29,634
And then that's more successful.

711
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:30,554
You will be more happy.

712
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:33,745
But I think that might work in today,

713
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:35,646
because we have all this knowledge.

714
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:37,568
But I think it wouldn't work for people

715
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:38,609
from a million years ago.

716
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:40,590
I mean, the human existed for a long time.

717
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:42,692
Before they could even use language,

718
00:42:43,513 --> 00:42:45,374
how could they understand the discount?

719
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:48,417
All right?

720
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:52,380
So I think even before human, there's other lives.

721
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,642
A lot of people think religion is only for human.

722
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:58,785
But doesn't every life deserve to have a purpose in order

723
00:42:58,805 --> 00:42:59,086
to live?

724
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:02,140
Many people who lose their purpose

725
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,421
wanted to kind of throw their life away.

726
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:07,382
But I wonder what animal does these days.

727
00:43:08,162 --> 00:43:11,964
So I think if there is something that is so intuitive,

728
00:43:12,684 --> 00:43:15,745
it needs to survive through the test of time.

729
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:18,527
So if it works for today's people,

730
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:20,367
it needs to work for people who don't speak.

731
00:43:22,408 --> 00:43:24,909
So I think that purpose is so primitive,

732
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,950
yet has to be so profound.

733
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:30,636
And I'm trying to compare the simplest life form,

734
00:43:30,696 --> 00:43:32,396
like a single cell and a human,

735
00:43:32,717 --> 00:43:34,897
and try to see if there's anything shared between them.

736
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,859
And I think there's something in common.

737
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:42,080
You know, for life, it needs to have the right to be born,

738
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,041
to grow, and to propagate, and to die.

739
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:48,622
And I think if we really want to find a purpose,

740
00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:50,903
we could say propagation is probably

741
00:43:51,283 --> 00:43:53,724
the most interesting part of the purpose of life.

742
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:55,365
Okay?

743
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:56,465
So...

744
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,916
It's not wrong to say we're born to give birth to children.

745
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:04,699
But I think as the technology and the society evolve,

746
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,280
there's a better way to propagate these days,

747
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,682
which is the propagation of ideas.

748
00:44:11,123 --> 00:44:12,383
You can do way faster.

749
00:44:12,543 --> 00:44:15,045
Like I'm propagating to, what, how many people here? 1,000?

750
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:18,547
Can I give birth to 1,000 people?

751
00:44:19,788 --> 00:44:23,690
So I think propagation is a good purpose for life.

752
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:25,571
But then what's the bigger purpose?

753
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:31,822
I think on the macroscope, everybody is trying to spread their ideas.

754
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:35,644
So, you know, this is kind of like a natural selection.

755
00:44:35,745 --> 00:44:39,928
I mean, everybody tries to spread their ideas as much as possible,

756
00:44:39,948 --> 00:44:45,372
but then the idea that survives and the most adapts to the environment will stay,

757
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:46,873
and it will be most optimized.

758
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:48,114
I mean, that's how evolution works.

759
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:50,475
That could also be how idea works.

760
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:58,161
I think it's a refining process in a macroscope that everybody contributes to make the best

761
00:44:58,201 --> 00:45:03,424
thing they could do to this world and the best and most adapted idea will survive.

762
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:10,229
And it's a cycle, you know, once you are done, someone else would continually propose ideas.

763
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:13,151
It's a refinement of mankind.

764
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:17,874
It could be also a refinement for, you know, the definition of life in the future.

765
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:20,135
But then...

766
00:45:21,113 --> 00:45:23,774
How is the selection being made?

767
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:25,815
And who is making these selections, and why?

768
00:45:27,095 --> 00:45:28,895
This is the area of unknown.

769
00:45:29,455 --> 00:45:31,556
And this is probably what the god is there for.

770
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:36,837
And god has been always this image

771
00:45:36,897 --> 00:45:39,057
to explain things we couldn't understand.

772
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:43,758
But people always associate god with the technology

773
00:45:43,798 --> 00:45:45,499
and the knowledge they have at the time.

774
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:46,919
Initially, gods are animals.

775
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,440
And then they become elemental, like Earth's mother.

776
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:53,666
and then become the stars, and then they become the human.

777
00:45:53,726 --> 00:45:57,647
But now, up to today, I mean, our knowledge right now

778
00:45:57,947 --> 00:46:00,267
says we can chase everything back to the Big Bang,

779
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:02,128
but we don't really know what happens before that.

780
00:46:03,288 --> 00:46:05,008
So it's almost something happening

781
00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:06,149
in the other dimension.

782
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,189
So I don't think the god in my religion

783
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:09,910
is going to be a human character anymore.

784
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,190
It's the other dimension.

785
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:17,692
So for every religion, it needs to have a value and a dogma.

786
00:46:18,372 --> 00:46:19,612
What do we do for this religion?

787
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:24,687
Well, we promote anything that enhance the opportunity

788
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:26,609
for propagation on ideas.

789
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:33,174
Instead of making you feel happy by consuming,

790
00:46:34,354 --> 00:46:37,717
we make you feel happy by influencing each other.

791
00:46:39,158 --> 00:46:44,582
We wanted to enable a flow experience of everybody

792
00:46:44,942 --> 00:46:47,704
to be in their life to propagate ideas.

793
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:50,446
to others, trying to influence others.

794
00:46:51,526 --> 00:46:54,927
We also want to protect the rights and the fairness

795
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:57,588
of everybody's, you know, we are all life.

796
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,189
We all have rights to propagate.

797
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:02,750
So there are things that we don't like, such as monopoly.

798
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,512
And especially, you know, like when the company monopolized

799
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:11,313
the market and not really propagate and evolve itself.

800
00:47:11,493 --> 00:47:13,533
It's really slowing down the whole process

801
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:16,234
of human ideas, evolution.

802
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,760
So then what is this game?

803
00:47:23,061 --> 00:47:25,702
I'm very happy to find someone already believing

804
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:29,923
what I believe, but they're just not good game designers.

805
00:47:32,544 --> 00:47:35,424
So what I'm trying to do is to give them a little bit help

806
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:37,705
and make their things into a game.

807
00:47:39,586 --> 00:47:43,147
First of all, how many people actually watch TED videos here?

808
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:46,128
Yeah, we have all these people already.

809
00:47:47,725 --> 00:47:50,666
But how many of you find it's very difficult

810
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:51,867
to navigate the website?

811
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:53,868
Right?

812
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:55,908
It's a problem.

813
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:58,310
I think they should be watching my talk.

814
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,971
So it's a very passive site.

815
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:05,473
And you can see the slogan is a nun, right?

816
00:48:05,593 --> 00:48:06,673
Ideas was spreading.

817
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:07,354
It's not cool.

818
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:11,275
And if you look at the speakers, all the people

819
00:48:11,295 --> 00:48:13,336
who represent ideas, there is no.

820
00:48:15,866 --> 00:48:17,147
There's nothing to represent them.

821
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:18,828
I mean, the speaker don't have an account.

822
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:20,509
It's just basically a database.

823
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:25,512
So first thing I want to do is to make this thing active.

824
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:26,112
Make it a game.

825
00:48:26,152 --> 00:48:27,033
It needs to be interactive.

826
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:28,314
Everybody needs to be involved.

827
00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:32,036
I will change the slogan into a verb,

828
00:48:32,716 --> 00:48:34,297
like influence with your ideas.

829
00:48:34,337 --> 00:48:36,459
This is going to be a platform where everybody

830
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:37,679
will have their own account.

831
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,442
What I want to do is to make the spreading of idea

832
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:44,143
into a flow experience on the TED website.

833
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,513
And to do that, there are a couple of things

834
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:47,234
I need to address.

835
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:50,034
First of all, TED has no immediate feedback.

836
00:48:50,154 --> 00:48:51,575
How could that be fun as a game?

837
00:48:53,035 --> 00:48:56,276
If you look at all these videos, there's not even a view count.

838
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:58,337
You can't even tell which idea really spread it.

839
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:01,818
We can learn something from YouTube, right?

840
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:02,998
At least there's a view count.

841
00:49:03,118 --> 00:49:04,998
You can sort all the TED videos to see

842
00:49:05,038 --> 00:49:06,899
which video is the most popular, which I couldn't even

843
00:49:06,939 --> 00:49:07,359
do right now.

844
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,180
And the second thing is, view count

845
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,761
doesn't represent whether you actually

846
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:13,701
influence each other.

847
00:49:14,102 --> 00:49:17,643
Maybe we need to do something like, I'm inspired by this video.

848
00:49:17,683 --> 00:49:20,424
Then you can really track how many people have

849
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,745
been influenced by your idea.

850
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:25,606
Then the other thing is, we need to have personal page

851
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:27,547
accounts, like Twitters.

852
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:29,128
I mean, people have followers.

853
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:30,908
But instead of followers, we need

854
00:49:30,928 --> 00:49:32,749
to have people who is influenced by you.

855
00:49:33,629 --> 00:49:36,771
We really need to be able to track that, have some charts,

856
00:49:37,171 --> 00:49:38,931
really doing all the Web 2.0 stuff.

857
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:43,213
So you know the video and the ideas you posted there

858
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:43,793
actually.

859
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,704
So this is a demo of a game that I'm working on.

860
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:53,987
I'm using the Chinese version of Twitter.

861
00:49:54,047 --> 00:50:01,153
On the top right, there's a pop-up that basically tells you how many people are starting to follow you.

862
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:03,995
I think it's a lot better than the email spam I'm getting from Twitter.

863
00:50:04,956 --> 00:50:09,600
The other thing is they implemented the badge system, which is kind of like the fourth...

864
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:13,167
You know, what people are doing in augmented reality

865
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:14,928
is they just give you additional incentive

866
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:16,989
to try to create more influence.

867
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,611
And the Chinese Twitter actually have a very complicated level

868
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:22,992
up system for the badgers.

869
00:50:25,453 --> 00:50:28,195
So the other thing is, for a game to really work,

870
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:30,956
to really promote a certain behavior,

871
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:32,517
we need to have a feedback loop.

872
00:50:33,837 --> 00:50:36,018
Just having badgers is not a real game.

873
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:39,660
It's just kind of fake, impractical feedback.

874
00:50:40,252 --> 00:50:42,813
But if the feedback actually contribute back

875
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:46,214
to the core gameplay, it will make the game fun.

876
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:49,515
A racing game, you drive faster and you win more matches.

877
00:50:49,555 --> 00:50:51,776
You can buy a faster car so you can drive faster.

878
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:54,697
People who play Diablo 2 get addicted

879
00:50:54,757 --> 00:50:57,998
because killing is actually making you kill better,

880
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,719
and you just continue wanting to do more.

881
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:03,160
So for TED, I wanted to implement a feedback

882
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,641
group of people spreading ideas.

883
00:51:05,842 --> 00:51:07,022
Then they win badges.

884
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:07,982
They win honors.

885
00:51:08,022 --> 00:51:09,043
They win points.

886
00:51:09,752 --> 00:51:12,954
And then these points convert into a bonus system,

887
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:16,057
which actually help enhance the promotion of the idea.

888
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,939
They can be cross-promoting.

889
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:21,721
If you really have a badge, you can

890
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:24,863
use that to maybe send an advertisement to 100 people,

891
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:27,124
really get more people to watch your videos.

892
00:51:27,425 --> 00:51:29,266
And then people would really want to do more

893
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,467
and to win more badges.

894
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:33,549
And they have more influence they could do on the website.

895
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,891
And the last thing is, TED doesn't have any social

896
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:38,432
mechanics and operation.

897
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:39,073
So these days.

898
00:51:39,655 --> 00:51:44,057
Online games and the online community requires operation to drive people to want to do more

899
00:51:44,097 --> 00:51:44,538
gameplay.

900
00:51:45,498 --> 00:51:51,982
I think one thing people can do is to do the most influential people of the year based

901
00:51:52,022 --> 00:51:53,323
on the TED website instead.

902
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:57,586
I really drive people to want to push more and want to be able to influence more.

903
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:08,252
So basically, I haven't even named my religion and name yet, but here's TED, the game, and

904
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,750
Sorry.

905
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,535
OK, well, whatever.

906
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:22,998
It's a game for, right now I'm going

907
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:25,119
to name it Propagationism.

908
00:52:26,379 --> 00:52:26,720
That's it.

909
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:34,264
Thank you, Genova, for that highly philosophical

910
00:52:34,324 --> 00:52:35,265
and enlightening.

911
00:52:35,801 --> 00:52:43,442
Presentation. Now, we have a few minutes left for our three panelists to get questions from you, the audience.

912
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:49,424
So, this is your opportunity to ask questions, because again, you are going to be deciding who wins the game design challenge.

913
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:53,824
Is it going to be Jason with Chain World? Is it going to be John with Messiah 6502?

914
00:52:55,025 --> 00:52:58,445
Or is it going to be Jenova with Propagationism? Yes.

915
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:02,806
Go ahead.

916
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,427
I have a question for Jason.

917
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:11,599
Are you worried about people maybe charging money for the propagation of your pen drive,

918
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:12,940
or is it all fair in religion?

919
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:16,882
Panelists, mics on?

920
00:53:17,582 --> 00:53:17,923
Thank you.

921
00:53:22,905 --> 00:53:23,506
Ah, there we go.

922
00:53:23,946 --> 00:53:25,647
I actually thought about it.

923
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:29,889
You know, the collection basket or something.

924
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:33,791
There's no rules about that, I guess, and religion doesn't seem to have rules about that either.

925
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,327
Okay, John, this is for you. How come you're still alive?

926
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:45,688
How come you're still alive, John?

927
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:49,589
I'm just a myth sitting up here.

928
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,230
Alright, well, I finally understand your haircut, by the way.

929
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:58,251
That's not an insult!

930
00:53:58,271 --> 00:53:59,191
I almost wore a robe.

931
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:02,152
Hi, for Jason, another question about rules.

932
00:54:02,192 --> 00:54:04,372
What happens when people game your religion?

933
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:06,533
Dig a big lava pit underneath the spawn point?

934
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,521
or play more than one time after dying. What happens then?

935
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:12,303
Oh wow, yeah, someone could cause an apocalypse.

936
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:15,464
Yeah.

937
00:54:15,484 --> 00:54:18,086
There's actually a lot, I mean, I'm not supposed to talk about what I saw in ChainWorld,

938
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:22,228
but it just so happened, you know, passed down from Notch's procedural generation algorithms,

939
00:54:22,248 --> 00:54:26,650
that there is a lava pit right near the spawn point, which makes suicide convenient at least.

940
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:31,493
So yet another question for Jason.

941
00:54:31,953 --> 00:54:34,455
How do you feel about the potential of...

942
00:54:34,966 --> 00:54:37,787
False chain worlds propping up in the world.

943
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:43,030
Right, those would be like the 12 theses nailed to the church door or something, right?

944
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:43,550
Exactly.

945
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,231
Yeah, no, that's sort of maybe anticipated.

946
00:54:47,112 --> 00:54:47,452
Thanks.

947
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:49,993
This is for Propagation.

948
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:52,294
Negative feedback loop.

949
00:54:53,015 --> 00:54:55,896
You had a positive feedback loop, but what about a negative feedback loop

950
00:54:55,936 --> 00:54:57,297
so we don't get a bunch of Microsofts?

951
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:00,074
Oh, jeez.

952
00:55:00,454 --> 00:55:03,135
I think there is a lot of things to talk about.

953
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,555
I personally was talking with my coworkers.

954
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:08,536
We didn't really talk about netting loops,

955
00:55:08,636 --> 00:55:11,316
but we did talk about what thing we should support,

956
00:55:11,336 --> 00:55:12,476
which thing we shouldn't support.

957
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:15,837
And I realized creative religion is just the beginning.

958
00:55:16,637 --> 00:55:18,498
If you are the pope, there are many issues

959
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:19,558
it's very hard to address.

960
00:55:19,598 --> 00:55:20,858
For example, like patents.

961
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:23,438
In gaming industry, we don't like patents

962
00:55:23,498 --> 00:55:25,799
because, in my opinion, it stops propagation

963
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:26,799
of other people's ideas.

964
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:31,007
uh... in limit other people to be able to do things but at the same time patents

965
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:31,948
are trying to protect

966
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:35,571
the people who tried their really hard to propagate

967
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,193
if i'm the pope for propagationism

968
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:41,716
i will have a hard time to tell whether we should support that

969
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:46,260
or disregard that and uh... i have to look into more like negative loops

970
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,703
to really say something is wrong is very difficult

971
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:52,125
that'll happen in vatican two or something

972
00:55:53,444 --> 00:55:55,486
All right, those were excellent probing questions.

973
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:57,108
Unfortunately, we're going to have

974
00:55:57,128 --> 00:56:01,732
to move to the voting section of the game design challenge.

975
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:03,654
Now, I'm going to ask up, as I sometimes

976
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:09,299
do in past years, previous game design challenge participant

977
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:10,280
to help me judge.

978
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,382
Steve Moresky, you have me sitting conveniently

979
00:56:12,442 --> 00:56:13,042
on the aisle.

980
00:56:13,883 --> 00:56:15,184
Why don't you come up and you can listen?

981
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:18,407
And this way, if something goes wrong during the judging,

982
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:19,648
here's the guy to blame.

983
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,370
So here's what I want you folks to do.

984
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,111
Think about who you want to applaud for.

985
00:56:26,151 --> 00:56:30,853
You can obviously applaud for all three, but we're going to be listening to who gets the loudest applause

986
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:37,556
as I stand behind each of our panelists, and I'll stand behind them in the order that they present it.

987
00:56:38,256 --> 00:56:41,178
Okay, are we ready? Here we go.

988
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:44,339
Jason!

989
00:56:56,701 --> 00:56:57,381
John!

990
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:07,570
Jenova!

991
00:57:19,163 --> 00:57:21,705
I would like to announce the winner of the Game Design Challenge.

992
00:57:22,746 --> 00:57:25,669
But before I do, I really want to thank all of our panelists.

993
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,973
Let's thank all of them.

994
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:38,210
I think in many ways this was an unprecedented year in terms of the really the scope and kind of philosophical

995
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:44,333
depth of the challenge and I also think that we we had an unprecedented depth in terms of actual

996
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:51,257
playable games two out of three and also real real deep thinking I think from all three of our

997
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:55,759
all three of our panelists so let's let's really thank them all once again it's really been a fantastic year.

998
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:08,509
And I want to remind all of you that people on the stage should not be the only ones thinking about these strange, interesting, and important and crucial ways that we can invent new games.

999
00:58:08,749 --> 00:58:11,391
We all can be doing games that challenge all of us.

1000
00:58:12,132 --> 00:58:19,118
I'd like to present the Game Design Challenge 2011 award to Jason Rohr. Jason!

1001
00:58:28,124 --> 00:58:33,508
I get offered the Book of Mormon all the time for free, so I gotta take Dianetics.

1002
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,112
Dianetics! What did I just say?

1003
00:58:38,132 --> 00:58:44,937
Okay, and our other two panelists will get their conciliatory prizes.

1004
00:58:46,338 --> 00:58:51,202
And let's give them all one final round of applause for 3XM Presentation.

1005
00:58:51,502 --> 00:58:54,885
See you next year! Game Design Challenge 2012!

1006
00:58:56,647 --> 00:58:57,087
Thank you!
