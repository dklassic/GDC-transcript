1
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:14,228
Welcome to Changing the Game, Cultivating Female Talent in AAA Studios.

2
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:17,830
I'm Victoria Setian, Senior Producer at Avalanche Studios.

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,111
So, why are we here?

4
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:25,073
Well, in 2019, the gaming audience is almost 50% female,

5
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:28,094
but only 22% of game developers are women.

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,572
It's important to have more of our audience reflected in our development teams.

7
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:38,594
And keep in mind, of that 22%, even fewer of those female developers are in leadership

8
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:44,357
roles, which is extra important to note because according to the study by Merida L. Johns,

9
00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:50,080
companies that have the best records for promoting women outstrip their competition on every

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,000
measure of profitability.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,402
In other words, your company will be more lucrative.

12
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:57,998
So how do we make this happen?

13
00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:01,559
Well, it's easier to de-bias organizations' practices

14
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,620
and procedures than to de-bias mindsets.

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,621
Which brings us to this talk.

16
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:07,862
We'll cover three areas.

17
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:10,943
The first is adjusting outreach methodologies.

18
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:14,291
The second, retaining and fostering female talent.

19
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:17,993
And the third is developing that talent into leadership.

20
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:20,235
This talk is largely research-based

21
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:22,077
and references will be provided.

22
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:24,318
And before we begin, here's a little bit more about me

23
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,660
and what brought me here today.

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,041
I'm a lifelong gamer.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,404
a comic book enthusiast, and on my weekends I'm an Armenian folk dancer. I've also worked in AAA

26
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:41,367
for a while in creative and production roles, most recently Just Cause 4 and its DLC. As I mentioned

27
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:46,911
before, I work for Avalanche Studios as a senior producer. Let's take a look at how Avalanche is

28
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:53,174
doing on the road to 5050. Avalanche has three offices, Stockholm, MalmÃ¶ in Sweden, and New

29
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:54,655
York City in the United States.

30
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:59,244
We haven't solved the problem yet, but we are taking steps to change things.

31
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:05,208
Change is a process, and I'm proud to be a female developer at Avalanche Studios Group.

32
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,771
The fact that Avalanche is supportive of this talk and showing these numbers demonstrates

33
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:14,035
their commitment to improving female diversity, starting with a fun fact.

34
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:20,119
The design documents of Just Cause 4 refer to our player as she and her.

35
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:20,999
Another fun fact.

36
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:24,233
Two years ago, I couldn't have given this talk.

37
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,674
In 2018, I was promoted to senior producer.

38
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:30,636
That day, the studio manager called me aside

39
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:33,757
to congratulate me on being the first female developer

40
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,458
to become part of a leadership group

41
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,339
in the history of the New York studio.

42
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:41,101
So change is happening, but it can be slow.

43
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:45,323
So let's kick this off and see how we can get to 50-50.

44
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:48,425
One, reach out to younger female audiences.

45
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:53,629
The end goal is increasing our female talent pool and getting more resumes.

46
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,372
And it starts with adjusting our outreach methodologies.

47
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:59,756
One of the primary reasons women are underrepresented in technology

48
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:02,920
is schools don't encourage girls to pursue tech careers.

49
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,551
Remember that phrase we all used to use when we were kids?

50
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,973
What am I going to be when I grow up?

51
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:11,255
Well, kids start thinking seriously

52
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,377
about their careers in middle school, which

53
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:15,559
is also when girls begin losing interest in STEM.

54
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,501
They continue to lose interest as they

55
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:21,764
go through high school, which is when many outreach programs

56
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:21,885
begin.

57
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,287
So action items.

58
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,489
Like I said, I am a producer, so this talk

59
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,991
will end each section with action items

60
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,832
that you can start making change today.

61
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:37,552
So the actions here are start outreach efforts with middle schools and educate girls on the

62
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:42,776
various roles in the industry. On top of our poor timing, girls don't think of game development as

63
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:47,400
a possible career path because they don't know what it means to work in games and the sort of

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,384
positions available to them. How could they? We're not educating them young enough on the potential

65
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:57,829
careers in games. For the record, these are about 9 to 12 year old girls we're talking about.

66
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,161
And even during this young age range,

67
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:03,043
they consider factors like gendered expectations

68
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,746
and even family planning as they wonder

69
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,427
what they're going to be when they grow up.

70
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:10,310
Female representation in games.

71
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,592
So we've educated girls that games is a career path

72
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,073
and the types of roles available to them.

73
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:17,316
Now let's show them that they have a voice in the medium

74
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:19,458
and they exist in the games themselves.

75
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,420
It's a well-trodden topic at this point,

76
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,101
so I'm not gonna hang too long here.

77
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:26,568
You may be familiar with the actress, Gina Davis.

78
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:30,449
She's been in incredible movies like Thelma and Louise,

79
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,650
Lego of Their Own, my personal favorite, Beetlejuice.

80
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,251
She's also the founder of the Gina Davis Institute

81
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,352
on Gender and Media.

82
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:40,693
There's a ton of great research at the Institute site

83
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:42,493
that goes further into the importance

84
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:44,994
of seeing yourself reflected in media.

85
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:47,275
And the motto of her Institute is,

86
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:49,456
if she can see it, she can be it.

87
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,677
These are the women of Avalanche Studios.

88
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:57,659
I did a poll asking what characters in games you identify with.

89
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:01,643
That when you play as these characters, you see yourself reflected back.

90
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:06,428
And when I look at this slide, it fills me with joy because I see my colleagues and friends

91
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:08,350
staring back at me.

92
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,015
But it also makes me a little sad because quite a few women felt they didn't have a

93
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,637
character they identify with.

94
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:18,698
So the action here is keep it up.

95
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:21,319
There's still so many types of female characters

96
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,719
we haven't seen yet.

97
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,980
So many of my colleagues that aren't represented.

98
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,421
Give them a voice.

99
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,701
Combat unconscious bias.

100
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:31,622
So now that we're showing young girls

101
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,003
there's jobs for them in the industry

102
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:35,403
and we see them as exemplified

103
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,424
by all these great characters.

104
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,745
Let's help them get in the door of our studios

105
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:41,645
by combating unconscious bias.

106
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:46,907
Unconscious bias is attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and

107
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:48,890
decisions in an unconscious manner.

108
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:54,676
These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated

109
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:59,362
involuntarily and without an individual's awareness or intentional control.

110
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:02,105
The critical takeaway of the study is...

111
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:08,159
Women were less likely to believe they belonged in a particular job when the advertisement

112
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,402
used masculine wording, and they rated masculine jobs as less appealing.

113
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:18,004
The image here from the study is an example of one job ad done in two ways, with masculine

114
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:19,865
wording and feminine wording.

115
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:23,467
It's also important to note that feminine wording had no impact on the amount of male

116
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,468
applicants.

117
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:28,550
You'll get the same amount of male applicants, but you'll get an increased amount of female

118
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,950
applicants.

119
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:35,476
At Avalanche, we are taking strides to address unconscious bias by training our hiring staff

120
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:40,180
on best practices on biases and reviewing job postings for masculine wording.

121
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,663
This is due to an initiative started by a lead male developer who wanted to root out

122
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,344
implicit bias wording in our job descriptions.

123
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:50,266
Visible presence of female developers.

124
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,737
Now that we've got these women in the door,

125
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:54,861
let's restart from step one,

126
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,845
but this time incorporate our female developers

127
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:57,948
in our practices.

128
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,273
It's not enough to show that there are women here.

129
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:06,308
But we also need to highlight women in senior and leadership roles to show two important things.

130
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:08,949
One, women are part of this industry.

131
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,191
And two, it's possible to get to the top.

132
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:16,855
Some of the ways you can apply this research and thinking is include women in your outreach efforts.

133
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:20,358
Have them join for school visits and recruitment off-sites.

134
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:23,280
In your press events, marketing materials, and conventions.

135
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:28,545
Let's see more women on the E3 big stages and big presentations where lots of young

136
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:30,207
women can see them.

137
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:35,072
If you're posting team photos on your social media or website, make sure it includes at

138
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,674
least 50% female developers.

139
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:41,038
And include developers of all levels to show girls the full breadth of the career ladder.

140
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:45,668
When I was working in Los Angeles, I volunteered with WIGGY and Girl Scouts of America on a

141
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:50,393
game design patch, teaching middle school girls about how to make a game and all the

142
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:53,416
various roles in the industry from QA to audio.

143
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:58,361
It was hosted by a panel of women in various roles in the industry and all over the career

144
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:58,622
ladder.

145
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:03,906
And at Avalanche, we have school visits to the studio where we explain the different roles in

146
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:08,189
game development. We have off-site recruitment sessions that include female members of the dev

147
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:13,332
team, and we work with game design schools on figuring out how to admit more women.

148
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:17,255
The actions here are include more women in off-site recruitment,

149
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:23,059
marketing, press, and games, and make women in senior and leadership roles more visible.

150
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:29,033
Part two, retaining and fostering female talent.

151
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,214
Okay, we've got more women in the industry,

152
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:34,395
but our work has only just begun.

153
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:37,036
One, internal support networks.

154
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:38,977
Internal support networks are internal groups

155
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,037
within your studio that encourage people to connect,

156
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:43,838
learn from each other, and grow.

157
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:44,938
Involvement is elective.

158
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,071
Group settings are valuable because we support each other,

159
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,532
we can be sounding boards, learn from each other,

160
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:53,412
host workshops, or sometimes just ask questions

161
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:55,413
that our male colleagues wouldn't be able to help us with.

162
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,714
It's great if you can get women in senior roles involved

163
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:00,954
to get access to role models within the network.

164
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,935
All three Avalanche offices have women's meetup groups

165
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:05,435
and dedicated Slack channels.

166
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:06,636
In our New York office,

167
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:09,036
we have a bimonthly dedicated meeting

168
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:11,717
where we've twice hosted our Respect and Assertiveness

169
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,997
in the Workplace workshop.

170
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:17,704
Actions create internal support networks for female employees.

171
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:21,585
Two, mentorship.

172
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:26,127
According to 48% of women, the number one top barrier in tech

173
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:27,908
is lack of workplace mentorship.

174
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:29,268
And that's sad.

175
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:33,670
There's many ways to mentor, including education,

176
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,692
identifying skills, listening, offering guidance,

177
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,593
career planning.

178
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:43,214
And if you're mailing want to mentor, go for it.

179
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:48,598
Research shows that a mentor's level, not gender, impacts career advancement.

180
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:51,700
Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to have mentorship, primarily from men.

181
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,224
They've helped me in various ways, sending me books and literature,

182
00:09:56,224 --> 00:10:00,127
helping me plan my career path and aspirations, to helping my voice be heard

183
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:05,091
by senior management. Mentor or recommend mentorships.

184
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:10,752
Now we've got all these excellent ways of supporting our female developers.

185
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:12,192
They're going to take on the world, right?

186
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:15,653
Oh, three, master suppression techniques and strategies.

187
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:18,393
Well, that sounds scary.

188
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:21,574
So what are master suppression techniques?

189
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:25,575
Master suppression techniques are strategies people or groups of people

190
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:29,796
can use to dominate or humiliate others in a subtle, indirect way.

191
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,737
In the 1940s, Norwegian psychologist and philosopher Ingeld Nisen

192
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:36,137
first published research on master suppression techniques.

193
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:42,380
Decades later, in the 1970s, Norwegian social psychologist Berit Aas did further work on

194
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,524
the framework, establishing that they are used in specific combinations and situations

195
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:48,485
in regards to women.

196
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:53,709
There are five techniques, and thanks to the Institute of Gender Equality in Sweden,

197
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,593
research was conducted on how to combat these techniques using counter-strategies.

198
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:01,495
I also want to give a quick shout-out for those who don't know,

199
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:07,219
Alloynich was founded in Sweden, so it's pretty great to see that the gender equality in Sweden

200
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:09,481
made such excellent strides in this area.

201
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:15,885
I'm quickly going to give an overview of each master suppression technique and its counter-strategy.

202
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:18,387
The first is making invisible.

203
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:22,618
It's acting like what the speaker is saying isn't important or valuable by drawing attention away.

204
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:28,219
This can be done by interrupting or doing more subtle things like making noises with your chair

205
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:34,401
or being on your phone, lack of gestures or response. The counter strategy is called

206
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:39,042
take place. Stay calm and self-assured and highlight the unacceptable behavior.

207
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:42,002
Hey, would you mind putting your phone away?

208
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,647
Next is ridicule, mocking and laughing at the other person, infantilizing or otherwise degrading them.

209
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,760
An example of something like this is the phrase,

210
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,581
hysterical women or silly girls.

211
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,642
I remember shipping a project.

212
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:03,383
It had taken a lot of time and energy and effort

213
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:05,944
and we shipped successfully.

214
00:12:05,944 --> 00:12:08,505
The game did very, very well.

215
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:11,506
And shortly after I was called in a meeting

216
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:13,867
with a room full of all of my peers.

217
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:16,718
And there were two male executives in the room.

218
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:21,259
And one male executive decided to call attention

219
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:24,180
to the effort that I had put into the project.

220
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,742
And the other male executive turned to me

221
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:30,883
and patted me on the head.

222
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,484
I didn't know what master suppression techniques were,

223
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,925
and I certainly didn't know the counter strategy

224
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:40,207
for what to do in the moment while I was being ridiculed

225
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:41,607
by someone in leadership.

226
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:47,498
The counter-strategy is question.

227
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:50,339
Stay calm and ask, why would you say that?

228
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,202
Or in my case, what did you mean by that?

229
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:56,263
Withhold information.

230
00:12:56,263 --> 00:13:00,586
Not getting access to meetings, documents, news, invitations,

231
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:01,006
et cetera.

232
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:03,888
The counter-strategy is require cards on the table.

233
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,354
Point out the pattern and why it's necessary to have this information to do your job.

234
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:12,656
Request that if you can't attend something to please reschedule.

235
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:13,857
Double bind.

236
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:16,519
Whatever you do, you are wrong.

237
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,800
If you're direct, you're a bitch.

238
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,523
If you're a good listener, you're too passive.

239
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:25,405
The counter strategy here is called change the pattern.

240
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,188
Recognize what your priorities are and what's important to you.

241
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:31,350
Then clarify the rules.

242
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,790
For example.

243
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:37,952
Maybe you can't stay late. You have to pick up your kids or you have some errand to run.

244
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:45,816
So clarify the rules. Say, hey, I need to pick up my kids, but I know that this is due tomorrow

245
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:51,320
at two o'clock and you'll have it by the time that you've asked for it. So you're clarifying

246
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,562
that you understand what the rules are and that you're working within the bounds of your

247
00:13:54,562 --> 00:14:00,825
constraints. Heap blame or sometimes put to shame. Someone making you feel bad for something that's

248
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:01,326
not your fault.

249
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,802
An example applicable to the workplace is getting a task that's too big for the timeline,

250
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:10,344
and the woman blames herself for not completing it in time, even though that's an impossible

251
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,224
scenario.

252
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:13,646
The counter-strategy is intellectualize.

253
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:18,228
This is one of the more difficult counter-strategies because it's mostly internal.

254
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:22,810
Try to become aware of these feelings of guilt and objectively take a look at them and ask

255
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,711
yourself, why do I feel guilty?

256
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,795
Try to put yourself in other people's shoes.

257
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:28,956
How would they look at the situation?

258
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:34,123
Take it a step further back and see if there's something that maybe happened before that's

259
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,246
making you feel guilt or shame about the current event.

260
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:41,391
I just want to point out that most people who use master suppression techniques are

261
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:44,175
not consciously trying to be destructive or hurtful.

262
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:47,278
Remember what we said about implicit bias earlier?

263
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,441
These are generally some conscious maneuvers.

264
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,663
So it's really important to give people

265
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:55,426
the benefit of the doubt when employing a counter strategy.

266
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,108
And even the research goes into that as well.

267
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:00,331
So if you or the woman on your team

268
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,753
are trying to employ a counter strategy,

269
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:06,256
I encourage you to please come from a calm and neutral place.

270
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:12,740
We are all human and we all make mistakes. The actions here are understand master suppression

271
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,764
techniques. Only by learning about these can we become aware of them and educate women on counter

272
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:25,147
strategies. Be a champion. You don't have to commit to being a mentor or running a whole

273
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:30,410
internal support network to make an impact. The opportunities to be a champion are endless and

274
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,571
typically spontaneous.

275
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:37,904
We learned about the concept of being a champion in the workshop of our women's group that I mentioned earlier in the presentation.

276
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:41,007
For example, if you see a woman getting interrupted, say,

277
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:44,449
Hey, I think Tori was going to say something. What's up Tori?

278
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:47,072
Tori, we haven't heard from you yet. What are your thoughts?

279
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:51,235
Or remember those master suppression techniques and counter strategies we just talked about?

280
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:55,519
Well, some of those counter strategies actually require having somebody as a sounding board to talk to.

281
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,788
Be that sounding board.

282
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:59,969
Or teach a female colleague about what master's

283
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,971
impression techniques even are and introduce them

284
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:03,432
to the concept of counter strategies.

285
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:06,153
If maybe you don't think you're up to the task of mentorship,

286
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:09,115
but you see someone who might be a really good mentor,

287
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:11,757
broach the topic with them and then connect them,

288
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:16,640
if they're open to it, with the person who could be the mentee.

289
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,121
The action is be a champion.

290
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:21,463
Part three, developing talent into leadership.

291
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:26,458
We've empowered our female developers with support systems, mentoring them and educating them.

292
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,539
Now, how do we get them into leadership roles?

293
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:31,780
One, sponsorship.

294
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,341
So real quick, what is sponsorship?

295
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,681
Sponsorship is a program.

296
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:41,023
High-performing women need to be identified by senior and executive team members.

297
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:45,284
These senior team members then need to seek out opportunities for these women

298
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:46,685
and then advocate for them.

299
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:51,179
Highlight their qualifications and why they'd be a great fit for the opportunity.

300
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:53,161
Help them climb the ladder.

301
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,323
It's also really important to note that this is dedicated work.

302
00:16:55,323 --> 00:17:01,348
It needs to be tracked and followed up on to ensure that steps are being taken to help

303
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:03,310
move these women through the sponsorship program.

304
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:06,317
As you move up within an organization,

305
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,539
it's important to have the sponsorship of someone

306
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,800
who has enough leverage in the organization

307
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,820
to make things happen.

308
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,642
Otherwise, it won't be effective.

309
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:17,063
In most senior level jobs, you need sponsorship

310
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:18,464
to make it to the very top.

311
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:21,206
This action is probably pretty clear.

312
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,587
Start a sponsorship program.

313
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:24,868
Shift leadership framework.

314
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:28,226
For this section, I will be referencing the fantastic paper

315
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:30,089
from the Harvard Business Review,

316
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:32,351
Women Rising the Unseen Marriers.

317
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,193
Becoming a leader involves much more

318
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:37,417
than being put in a leadership role, acquiring new skills,

319
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:40,560
and adapting one's style to the requirements of that role.

320
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,244
It involves a fundamental identity shift.

321
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:47,807
Organizations inadvertently undermine the process when they advise women to proactively

322
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:54,012
seek leadership roles without also addressing policies and practices that communicate a

323
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:59,476
mismatch between how women are seen and the qualities and experiences people tend to associate

324
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:00,176
with leaders.

325
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:04,619
These women make it into leadership roles, then essentially get pushed off a cliff into

326
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,702
a framework where it is difficult for women to succeed.

327
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:12,025
It's like getting dealt a hand of cards and realizing everyone is playing a different

328
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:12,545
game.

329
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:17,768
These policies and practices that require a shift are due to something called second

330
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:19,330
generation gender bias.

331
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,636
powerful but subtle and often invisible barriers for women that arise from cultural assumptions

332
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:30,621
and organizational structures, practices, and patterns of interaction that inadvertently

333
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:37,267
benefit men while putting women at a disadvantage. So why does this happen? Well, the lack of women

334
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:42,192
in leadership positions means women climbing the career ladder have no one to model who has dealt

335
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:43,734
with the same barriers as them.

336
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,326
And if they model themselves after men,

337
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,989
they're more likely to run into these invisible barriers.

338
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:51,930
Some jobs are inherently geared towards men

339
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,772
because they require flexibility

340
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,794
that a mother might not have,

341
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:59,217
such as extensive travel or consistently long hours,

342
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:02,599
or undervaluing skills typically exhibited by women,

343
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,663
such as building a team or avoiding a crisis, soft skills.

344
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:10,126
This leads to the double bind master suppression technique

345
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:13,689
where whatever you do, if you're a woman, you are wrong.

346
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:16,030
If you're direct, you're a bitch.

347
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,331
So how can organizations help?

348
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:20,874
Research states that mentoring and leadership programs

349
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:23,936
are necessary, but not enough.

350
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,517
I'm gonna repeat that statement

351
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:26,958
because I think it's really important.

352
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:33,390
Research states that mentoring and leadership programs are necessary, but not enough.

353
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:39,314
There are critical additional steps that must be taken to level the playing field.

354
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:42,997
First, second-generation gender bias education.

355
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:47,840
Teach both men and women about these biases so they become more visible and can begin

356
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,082
being addressed.

357
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:51,563
Craft safe spaces for leadership identity.

358
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:56,928
Women should be able to focus on the job, not overthink these invisible barriers.

359
00:19:56,928 --> 00:20:01,553
A coaching relationship, a women's leadership program, a support group of peers in which

360
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:05,597
women can interpret messages is critical to their leadership identity.

361
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:07,719
Anchor development in leadership purpose.

362
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:12,925
Focusing on purpose can also lead women to take up activities that are critical to their success.

363
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:17,009
It allows them to look past what might make them uncomfortable or insecure

364
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,473
and engage in building new skills in a way that feels authentic to them.

365
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:21,454
Imposter Syndrome

366
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:25,519
Research shows that imposter syndrome is highest in high-achieving women.

367
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:27,781
So that means women in these leadership roles.

368
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,503
So what is imposter syndrome?

369
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:35,778
It's women who experience the imposter phenomenon maintain a strong belief that they are not intelligent.

370
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:41,020
In fact, they are convinced that they have fooled anyone who thinks otherwise.

371
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,462
The action here is understand imposter syndrome,

372
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:47,283
because this is largely something internal that women have to overcome.

373
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:53,136
However, peers can help by being aware of its existence, and if you see someone who

374
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:57,360
might be struggling with imposter syndrome, connect them to a mentor, an internal support

375
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,765
network, send them literature, send them a book, be a champion.

376
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:04,206
Family leave and parenthood.

377
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:08,971
Earlier we discussed how girls as young as 9 are considering having a family and raising

378
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,973
kids when they begin thinking about careers.

379
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:16,410
And the reality is society is teaching them they should be.

380
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,052
In a 2018 survey conducted by the Center for American Progress,

381
00:21:20,052 --> 00:21:23,215
mothers were 40% more likely than fathers

382
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,736
to report that they had personally

383
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:27,258
felt the negative impact of child care issues

384
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:28,018
on their careers.

385
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,873
Women are still doing the heavy lifting when it comes to childcare.

386
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:36,797
The graphs here are from Women's Work, Mothers, Children, and the Global Childcare Crisis.

387
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:40,720
They illustrate the difference between time spent on childcare by men and women.

388
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,242
Sweden ranks the best.

389
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:47,486
It also has the least difference in weeks in a year spent on unpaid childcare for men and women.

390
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:51,849
But even the best ranked countries still skews towards female caregivers.

391
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:57,013
And the US? It's one of the only countries in the world that doesn't have mandatory paid

392
00:21:57,013 --> 00:22:02,617
parental leave. Unsurprisingly, this is having an impact on the careers of women and their career

393
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:07,181
trajectory. So you can see here, even if women have access to flexible work arrangements,

394
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:11,384
they're not necessarily going to use those flexible work arrangements.

395
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:14,706
According to the paper, Breaking Gender Barriers, and where this graph is from.

396
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:20,307
Having a policy and allowing women to use it without penalty are two different matters.

397
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:26,031
Researchers call this the flexibility stigma, and it arises because women are effectively punished

398
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:30,835
if they take advantage of flexible work options to raise children and work simultaneously

399
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:36,138
or take a time out from tenure to have children. The moral here is that it is not enough to simply

400
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:40,841
offer flexible options. The options must be exercisable without consequence.

401
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:46,549
Real quick, let's take a deeper look at the government offerings of Sweden and the United States,

402
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:50,952
both because that's where the different avalanche offices are based, but also because Sweden did so

403
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:57,117
well in the rankings. In Sweden, both parents receive 480 days, that's 16 months of paid

404
00:22:57,117 --> 00:23:02,881
parental leave, at roughly 80 percent of their salary. The days don't expire until the child

405
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:09,526
turns eight. In the U.S., maternity leave is three months and it's unpaid. For fathers, you get one

406
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:10,647
month, also unpaid.

407
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,046
So you may be wondering what we can do on an organizational level if this might be a government issue.

408
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:22,812
Well, our New York office has taken a cue from the culture of our Swedish counterparts via our flexibility policy.

409
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:30,220
At any time, we may see a colleague let us know they have to go help their child or work from home due to child care related responsibilities.

410
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,202
There is no guilt. If you have to leave early to take care of your child,

411
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:35,384
Avalanche trusts you're going to do what you have to do.

412
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:40,209
Some colleagues have also made specific arrangements to work from home on certain days.

413
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:42,711
This is equally important for both parents.

414
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:47,556
Consider if a father goes to take care of a sick child so that the mother can continue working for the day

415
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,998
versus the traditional vice-versa scenario.

416
00:23:50,198 --> 00:23:55,622
The actions here are pay for parental leave for both male and female employees.

417
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:59,404
Paternity leave is just as important as maternity leave.

418
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,965
Support a flexible work policy.

419
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,527
And create a culture that normalizes child care.

420
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,609
These are critical for female leaders.

421
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:13,492
As their responsibilities increase in the workplace, they do as well at home.

422
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:16,254
Okay, we've made it through all three parts,

423
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,615
so I'm quickly going to summarize what we spoke about today.

424
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,381
According to the paper, breaking the glass ceiling,

425
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,983
companies that have been successful in breaking down

426
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:26,865
barriers have programs with the following characteristics

427
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:27,425
in common.

428
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,767
They are specific to the organization.

429
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,348
They are inclusive.

430
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:33,570
They address preconceptions and stereotypes.

431
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,052
They track progress.

432
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:37,253
They are comprehensive.

433
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:40,595
And they have CEO support.

434
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:46,220
This is Pam Hulfe, CEO of Avalanche Studios Group.

435
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:49,980
Diversity of perspectives and experiences

436
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,622
make both our games and workplace better.

437
00:24:52,622 --> 00:24:54,864
As an industry, we can and must do much more

438
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:58,387
to empower and inspire those who identify as women

439
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:00,709
to consider a career in gaming.

440
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,350
Only by doing so on every level

441
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,793
will we as game developers start to reflect the diversity

442
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:07,755
of a global player demographic.

443
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,216
Thank you, PIM.

444
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:13,720
Here is a quick overview of all of the action items

445
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,902
we have discussed today.

446
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:19,806
If there's one takeaway from this talk, I hope it's the slide that you screen cap or

447
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:21,346
take a picture of.

448
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:21,947
Be a champion.

449
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:25,448
Is there any one of these that you can bring back to your organization?

450
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:26,388
Maybe more than one.

451
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:30,270
After watching this talk, if someone asks you what's the point of a talk like this,

452
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,031
or is this even a real problem, consider this.

453
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:37,573
System justification research has demonstrated that injunctification,

454
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:43,117
People's tendency to defend the status quo via considering whatever currently is as natural

455
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:49,780
and desirable and the way that things ought to be is an individual-level process that can account,

456
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:55,563
at least in part, for women's continued under-representation in male-dominated areas.

457
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:59,025
Just because things are the status quo doesn't mean they're okay.

458
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:03,147
And remember that quote from the start of the talk about how companies that have women in

459
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:07,149
leadership ranks outstrip their competition on every measure of profitability?

460
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:12,389
There's no reason why we shouldn't be trying to change things.

461
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:17,793
So if someone asks you about this talk, tell them, yes, this is important.

462
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:20,574
And I'm really glad you asked me.

463
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:23,576
Let's have a conversation about it.

464
00:26:23,576 --> 00:26:26,778
Change the conversation by having the conversation.

465
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:28,199
Change the game.

466
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:32,942
And maybe one day, we can go from this to this.

467
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:33,323
Thank you.
