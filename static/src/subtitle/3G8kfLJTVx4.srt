00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:07,640
Hello, so hi, I'm Rob.

2
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:10,606
I'm a senior software engineer at Niantic.

3
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:13,431
I'm a graduate of UC Santa Cruz's

4
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:16,477
computer science, computer game design program, Go Slugs.

5
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:22,240
And so I've been working at Niantic Labs since late in 2015.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,941
And so I've been working on Pokemon Go,

7
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,922
and I've touched nearly every feature that's gone into it

8
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:28,263
in some way or another.

9
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:31,104
Also, previously, I've been the technical lead

10
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:34,286
on our AR Plus encounter, which was our implementation

11
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,647
of Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore

12
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:40,669
to create an even more real augmented reality interaction

13
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,010
that people can have with Pokemon.

14
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:48,517
Also, although not Pokemon, I also recently spent some time working on a demo called Neon

15
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:52,919
2.0 that we showed at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona just a few weeks ago.

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,382
This was a real-time augmented reality experience where multiple players could play an arena

17
00:00:58,462 --> 00:00:59,903
shooter in a shared space.

18
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:04,306
It's a really cool example of what we can do with AR in modern technology.

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,127
But today I'm here to talk to you about Pokemon Go.

20
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:11,208
So Pokemon Go, for those who don't know,

21
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:14,110
is a game where you walk around in the real world

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,672
and try to find virtual Pokemon on your phone.

23
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:22,415
So a lot has happened since we initially launched the game

24
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,115
in the summer of 2016.

25
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:27,058
And just to get people kind of quickly up to speed,

26
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:28,959
we've...

27
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,903
added in Pokemon from the Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions

28
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:37,646
into the game, so a bunch more Pokemon

29
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,507
in addition to what we originally launched with.

30
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:42,570
We did a large revision to the metagame system

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,872
of how our Pokemon gym locations work,

32
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:48,075
allowing a cooperative raid mode

33
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:50,457
where multiple players can come to the same location

34
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:54,360
to team up against boss Pokemon and catch legendary Pokemon.

35
00:01:55,644 --> 00:02:01,408
We added in a quest system where players not only get direction for play, but also can experience storylines.

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,352
Pokémon Go has always been about real-world social connections,

37
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:12,776
and we expanded on those with a friend system and trading integrated into the game.

38
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,728
We have also had a number of live events,

39
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:20,630
including our flagship Pokemon Go Fests in Chicago

40
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,232
the past two summers, and what we call Safari Zones, which

41
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,814
have been our special non-ticketed events

42
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:29,776
in areas like Yokosuka, Japan and Dortmund, Germany.

43
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:34,379
Also, this past December, we added in our player

44
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,561
versus player directly competitive feature

45
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,162
that we called Trainer Battles.

46
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,584
So what are Trainer Battles?

47
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:45,259
There are version of Pokemon battles

48
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,920
for real-time competitive play.

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,300
In a trainer battle, two trainers each choose a team

50
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,300
of three Pokemon.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,741
Trainers utilize mechanics like fast and charged attacks,

52
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,542
the classic Pokemon type effectiveness,

53
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:01,522
and swapping between Pokemon,

54
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,183
along with new tools like protect shields

55
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:06,023
to try and best their opponent.

56
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,063
A player needs to knock out

57
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:10,924
all three of their opponent's Pokemon to claim the win.

58
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:16,807
And our goal with Trainer Battles was really to infuse the spirit of Pokemon Go

59
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,610
into the classic mechanic of Pokemon battling,

60
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,632
creating something new and more competitive

61
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,774
for players to really sink their teeth into.

62
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:30,058
And when we made them, we really wanted them to feel

63
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:32,460
like a truly meaningful addition to the game.

64
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:36,572
We wanted this feature to create a new action in our game,

65
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:39,856
something that both builds from the existing game loop,

66
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:44,020
but also something that more smaller potential features

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,222
could build on top of,

68
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,844
something that felt truly foundational.

69
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:51,824
And we knew that trainer battles and battling Pokemon

70
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:54,787
is such a core experience to the Pokemon franchise.

71
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:59,232
Virtually every Pokemon game has some form of battling,

72
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,454
and it's such an essential mechanic

73
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,577
to have those two trainers facing off head to head.

74
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:08,974
Now, prior to this, our only competitive elements

75
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:13,057
were either asynchronous or parallelized against AI.

76
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:15,858
And so we really wanted somewhere for players

77
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:19,921
to go to have that real-time competitive experience,

78
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,583
because we knew how important this was to our player base.

79
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:25,484
And they told us a lot.

80
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:30,336
But of course, that's not the only reason

81
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:32,938
we decided to build this feature at this point in time.

82
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,820
There were a lot of factors that went into figuring out

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,481
really why to do this now.

84
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,582
And one of the biggest things was the current metrics

85
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,943
that our game, that we were focused on.

86
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:47,768
So what we were really looking for most of all

87
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:50,209
was to increase our number of players.

88
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:54,850
We really wanted to reacquire our lapsed players who

89
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,211
hadn't seen the game in a while.

90
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,352
And we especially felt that launching something

91
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:01,972
that's been in such demand and long awaited

92
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:04,433
would reignite a passion in a lot of those players,

93
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:08,374
and hopefully also strike a chord with new players

94
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:11,135
who hadn't been interested in the existing gameplay

95
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:13,195
and continue to grow the player base.

96
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,692
We wanted to increase retention of the game,

97
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:19,233
and so we looked at this as a way

98
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:21,553
of deepening our metagame structure,

99
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,834
so something that would be more interesting

100
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:26,754
to keep players coming back for repeat play.

101
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:31,875
We also wanted to increase the length of our game sessions,

102
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:33,936
have players stay in the game longer.

103
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:38,237
So we looked at this as a way to complement our gameplay

104
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:40,918
of players walking around and catching Pokemon together

105
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,938
by giving them something that they could do

106
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:44,498
after those sessions.

107
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,535
We were also happy with how our game was monetizing,

108
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:52,617
and so we knew that we didn't need a feature

109
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:54,398
that focused on monetization.

110
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,819
This was something of a perfect recipe

111
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,160
to do something competitive,

112
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,961
because we know that forcing monetization

113
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:04,423
into competitive play is a recipe for an unhappy community,

114
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:06,864
and we wanted to make sure that our game

115
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:09,345
and whatever we added for players to compete with

116
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,466
didn't feel like it was pay to win.

117
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,793
These reasons were also complemented by a few other things

118
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:21,454
that happened in recent times.

119
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:23,874
So the friend system that we built,

120
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,874
that we launched earlier in 2018,

121
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,955
gave us the infrastructure for players

122
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,895
making direct interactions with each other.

123
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,896
And it's worth noting here,

124
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,436
that our friend system in Pokemon Go

125
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:37,017
isn't just a list of other players that you know.

126
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,917
Players actually level up their friendship

127
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,958
with each individual friend on their list

128
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:46,738
by sending GIFs or playing in cooperative modes together.

129
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,252
This gave us another avenue that we could reward players

130
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:52,893
for playing this new feature,

131
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,715
and something that we could tie in

132
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:56,557
and kind of bring the game all together

133
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:57,357
to make it feel whole.

134
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:01,421
We also have a rule that anything that might be part

135
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,782
of our summer event series,

136
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,883
like those GoFests that I talked about earlier,

137
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:07,926
needs time to soak in the game client

138
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:09,147
for at least six months

139
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:12,850
to make sure that it's bug-free and working well

140
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,172
by the time we actually get to hosting events.

141
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:16,934
This...

142
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,661
meant that we made December our goal

143
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:21,562
for building and shipping the feature

144
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:23,023
so that it could be in consideration

145
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,404
for those events this coming summer.

146
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:31,969
Now, we had a lot of design challenges

147
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:32,949
going into this feature.

148
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,231
First and foremost, our combat needed

149
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:37,792
to appeal to all players,

150
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,335
not just hardcore, longtime Pokemon fans

151
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,257
or even new players that have kept on playing Go

152
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:44,877
since day one.

153
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:48,645
We needed to make sure that entrenched players,

154
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:51,547
people with high-level accounts and powerful Pokemon,

155
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:55,130
didn't have so much of an advantage against other players

156
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,592
that lower-level players didn't wanna play the feature

157
00:07:58,632 --> 00:07:58,912
at all.

158
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:03,455
We also had to come up with rewards that would hold value

159
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:05,997
for all these different players,

160
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,799
and not something that those well-entrenched players

161
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,440
would already have a stockpile of,

162
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,541
or something that was only valuable

163
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:14,163
to those high-level players.

164
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,532
We also have a strong commitment to our concept

165
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:19,653
of real-world gaming.

166
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,475
And we really had to think about how a directly competitive

167
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:26,036
feature would look in Pokemon Go,

168
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,478
what it would mean to battle another player,

169
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,199
and how players would engage with each other

170
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,220
inside and outside the app.

171
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,902
We also had some challenges with figuring out

172
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:38,863
how to teach new players the gameplay.

173
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,262
And lastly, we had to really keep in mind

174
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:45,324
how we would keep things open-ended

175
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:47,966
so that we could keep building on top of the feature

176
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:48,947
in the years to come.

177
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,972
So, in order to shape the feature,

178
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,494
we really had to know our audience.

179
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:57,536
And this is something that's a big advantage

180
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,118
when you're building something for an existing game.

181
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:04,464
you already know a lot about who's playing your game,

182
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,466
and you can figure out a lot about

183
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,887
who stopped playing your game.

184
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:11,010
This is a big place for us where focus groups came in,

185
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,193
and bringing in players from those different groups

186
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,275
and talking to them and figuring out

187
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,977
what their wants were from the game.

188
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,987
So our lapsed players were our first main group

189
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,448
that we really had to think about.

190
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,151
Because these players hadn't been playing the game actively

191
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:28,453
and they don't have the most up-to-date Pokemon,

192
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:30,895
they might not have played since that very first month.

193
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,956
And so we needed to make sure that they

194
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:35,378
had fun with the feature and they

195
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:36,819
felt like they had a chance.

196
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,753
A lot of the rest of our player base can be split up

197
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,214
between casual and hardcore players,

198
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:46,435
but we really use those terms more to describe

199
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,316
people's history with the franchise of Pokemon

200
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,637
rather than how they directly play the game.

201
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,638
For our more casual players,

202
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,459
this means that it's their first Pokemon game.

203
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,981
It's a lot of people who knew about Pokemon,

204
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:04,182
but they didn't actually play one of the games

205
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,083
until they were able to get one on their phone.

206
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:10,861
A lot of these people actually liked some of the simplicity

207
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:13,143
that our earlier battle system had.

208
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,286
So we knew that we had to keep our mechanics in a way

209
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:18,048
that were easy enough to understand

210
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:20,610
for an audience that isn't hyper game literate.

211
00:10:22,032 --> 00:10:24,354
Then we also had our hardcore players,

212
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:27,778
those longtime Pokemon fans who've memorized

213
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,060
every type's advantage against another,

214
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,881
that whole 18 by 18 grid.

215
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,867
And we knew those players were always pushing us

216
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,429
to create a game with more strategic depth

217
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:42,230
to offer them the chance to prove to their peers

218
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,431
how good they are.

219
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:50,195
This led us to the eternal task of creating something

220
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:52,757
that's easy to learn, but hard to master.

221
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:55,538
So we started at approaching this

222
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,739
by trying to keep our base mechanics

223
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,040
as similar as possible

224
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,041
to the original earlier battle system.

225
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,134
This meant keeping our tap to attack interaction.

226
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:07,355
Even though it's fairly simplistic,

227
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:10,837
a lot of players find it really approachable

228
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,537
and really easy to understand.

229
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:17,040
We also didn't want anything too complicated happening

230
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,601
during the release of the feature.

231
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:22,583
So we didn't want any large-scale inventory changes

232
00:11:22,643 --> 00:11:24,263
to happen, so we wanted to make sure

233
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,366
that Pokemon kept their existing moves and abilities

234
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,106
when we moved into this system.

235
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:37,879
Now, we did, in order to bring in some fresh mechanics,

236
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,901
allow players to unlock an extra move

237
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,121
for each of their Pokemon.

238
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:47,763
This gave us more strategic depth in the battle system.

239
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:52,999
and a way for players to have a different edge

240
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,161
or change their Pokemon in different ways.

241
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,684
We locked this behind something that was unlockable

242
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,466
for each individual Pokemon,

243
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:04,409
so that players would experience this over time

244
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:08,272
and people wouldn't log on to see that their Pokemon

245
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,094
had more complications overnight.

246
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,575
Also, instead of having something that was based on timing,

247
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,697
like our previous defensive mechanic was,

248
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:23,201
we decided to go for something that focused more

249
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:25,203
on the strategic side of battle.

250
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:28,245
So we created a mechanic called protect shields,

251
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:31,068
where players got two protect shields per match

252
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:33,550
that would block an entire charge attack.

253
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:36,983
This is actually a really big example of something

254
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,664
that came out of our focus groups.

255
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:43,409
This feature actually changed a lot pretty late

256
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,592
in development because we got feedback

257
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,174
from the people playing our game that the mechanic

258
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:51,696
that we had before just wasn't satisfying enough.

259
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:55,239
And so we put in something that would really give

260
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,801
a strategic trade-off.

261
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,633
Now that Pokemon could have both a low-energy, low-damage charge attack and a high-energy,

262
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:08,356
high-damage charge attack, players had to really think about what their opponent could be doing

263
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:13,599
next and really helped elevate the game to more than just the type-effectiveness gameplay

264
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,661
and added that little bit extra to make the combat properly interesting.

265
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:26,155
In order to keep players on similar levels

266
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:28,176
for combat between them,

267
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,277
we created a system of battle leagues

268
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:33,860
where we made a system of tiered leagues

269
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,982
that put a maximum cap on participating Pokemon's

270
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,923
combat power, or CP.

271
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:42,805
This way, new and returning players

272
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:44,847
who came to check out the feature

273
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:48,329
wouldn't be completely obliterated by long-time players.

274
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:52,444
And because in our game, the CP values

275
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,965
are a stat accumulation, this means

276
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:57,186
that Pokemon at those particular tiers

277
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:59,607
are roughly equivalent in terms of power level.

278
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:04,849
This gave way for three drastically different metagames

279
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,611
for players to participate in that really change

280
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:08,791
what it feels like to play.

281
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:11,852
At the lowest level, nearly all Pokemon

282
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:14,614
can reach that CP level, and players are really able

283
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,655
to play with Pokemon that are their favorites.

284
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,548
We created the Ultra League as a higher tier

285
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:26,552
that culls some of the Pokemon out of the possible play space.

286
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:29,314
We hoped that this would create a space

287
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:34,137
for a more serious competitive environment

288
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:37,680
to have fewer choices so that they could hone in more

289
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,281
on a metagame of what Pokemon are the most versatile.

290
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,360
Then we created our Master League,

291
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,361
so our players that have really played a lot

292
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:48,402
and reached the really high power levels

293
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:50,643
could use those powerful Pokemon

294
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,463
that they've worked so hard to raise.

295
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,644
One of the really interesting things

296
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:58,065
that came out of this actually

297
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:00,686
was that even though we designed the Ultra League

298
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:03,266
to be our space for competitive play,

299
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,542
our biggest fan community in America, the Silph Road,

300
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:09,983
hosts all of their community tournaments

301
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:11,304
using the lowest league.

302
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,425
Because for them, it's just as important

303
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:17,207
for the gameplay to be as accessible as it was for us.

304
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:23,809
For players to actually engage each other,

305
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:27,591
we had to think a lot about how something like matchmaking

306
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:31,453
or playing against other players would work.

307
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,139
And what we settled on was to go with something

308
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,999
that would really support our communities

309
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,099
and immediate gameplay with each other.

310
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,600
So we created a system of QR codes

311
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,720
where players can scan each other's phone

312
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:48,341
to immediately jump into a battle with each other.

313
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,282
This really supported community-oriented tournaments

314
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,162
and players being able to jump into the feature

315
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:56,803
without jumping through hoops

316
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,463
and adding people as friends,

317
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:00,403
going through a bunch of dialogues.

318
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,299
players were able to get straight to it.

319
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:06,780
But we also wanted to support our social systems

320
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,621
and reward people who've developed real friendships.

321
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:12,823
One of the developers on the team early on said,

322
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,163
you know, I've got this friend who lives

323
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:15,604
halfway around the world from me,

324
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:17,805
and we never see each other in person anymore,

325
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:20,246
but we send gifts in Pokemon Go every day.

326
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,703
And so we decided to create remote play

327
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:28,625
as a special feature once players

328
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:31,306
have reached the ultra-friend level with each other,

329
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:33,908
which means that they've interacted for 30 days.

330
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:37,511
This also helped us prevent online communities

331
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:41,494
from forming networks for their own tournaments

332
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,516
so that we could keep the focus on local communities

333
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:46,317
and real-world gameplay.

334
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:55,976
When it came to figuring out rewards,

335
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:58,538
one of the really important things to us

336
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,521
was that players had as few possible reasons

337
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,122
to say no to a battle.

338
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,385
So we made sure that win or lose,

339
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,548
players draw from the same loot table.

340
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,191
This really helps players feel

341
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:14,912
like they're always advancing in the game

342
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:17,915
and they always have a reason to try and play the feature.

343
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:21,658
We did put in a daily limit, of course, to prevent abuse.

344
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,661
We used our Stardust resource as our base resource

345
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:29,241
in that loot table because it's our core resource

346
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,702
for powering up our Pokemon and helps tie together

347
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:34,823
a loop of battling Pokemon in order to improve them

348
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:35,803
and make them stronger.

349
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:38,684
It also directly tied into the costs

350
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,565
for unlocking that third move that we added.

351
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,967
We also added in a new item called the Sinnoh Stone,

352
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,249
which is an evolution item necessary

353
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,273
for a bunch of the new Pokemon that we've been releasing

354
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,016
over the past month, over the past few months.

355
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,160
This helped us lead more collection-oriented players

356
00:17:57,881 --> 00:17:59,983
to try out the feature and give it a shot

357
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,606
and incorporate it into their routine gameplay.

358
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:06,075
Then on the longer term end of things,

359
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:08,536
we brought in new avatar items as something

360
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:11,276
that players could unlock through our achievement system.

361
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,377
We spread out the pieces of each full costume

362
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:18,138
across the three battle leagues, requiring players

363
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:19,879
to have wins in all three of them

364
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,499
in order to unlock the full set.

365
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,160
And this means that when you see a player

366
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,740
with one of those full costumes,

367
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,341
you know that they're really dedicated to the feature.

368
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:34,935
When it came to teaching players,

369
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:37,736
because we had a limited development schedule,

370
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:39,516
we had to weigh the opportunity cost

371
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:42,637
of making a tutorial versus making NPC battles

372
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:44,438
where players could play against an AI.

373
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:47,659
And we only had enough time beyond our core feature set

374
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,239
to cover one or the other.

375
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,220
And what we decided on was that tutorials

376
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,821
are just too one-time use.

377
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,520
to too many players, especially in the mobile space,

378
00:18:58,061 --> 00:19:00,143
a tutorial is something that they'll tap through

379
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:02,506
as fast as possible, not read,

380
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,649
and not internalize or learn from.

381
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,262
Instead, NPC battles gave us a chance for players

382
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,523
to learn the ropes and learn the mechanics

383
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,404
and fail without punishment.

384
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:18,526
We took away any sense of resource costs or punishment

385
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:23,008
for play in this mode so that people could keep playing them

386
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:25,389
even beyond getting a daily reward for them

387
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:27,850
in order to keep learning the systems better

388
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,651
and do things like test out team compositions.

389
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:36,059
Also, creating these NPC battles was a better thing

390
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,560
for our foundation that we could keep building on

391
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,041
in the future.

392
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:44,623
We also coordinated some of the information

393
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,504
that we would have put in a tutorial

394
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,926
with our marketing team, who used our social channels

395
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:52,768
to disseminate this information in the week leading up

396
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:53,688
to the feature watch.

397
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:58,444
This wound up being really good to help not only educate our player base,

398
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:04,526
but use those teachings as something to get them excited for the feature launch as it approached.

399
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:12,768
And this also meant that by the time the feature came out, a lot of players had a good idea of how they wanted to play and how they wanted to approach the feature.

400
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,009
And that's something that worked really well for us.

401
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,831
On the side of keeping things open-ended,

402
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:24,054
we tried to make sure that the engineering supported that.

403
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,075
And we did this through having a really

404
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,036
significant prototyping phase

405
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:30,058
before we started the proper development.

406
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,540
This way, we were able to test out a lot of ideas

407
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,101
and more features and complications

408
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:38,643
that we knew weren't going to make it in the first version,

409
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:40,564
but then keep those in mind

410
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:43,266
as we were building the engineering and systems

411
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:46,288
so we knew that we could support them in the future.

412
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,888
Also, because of our large casual audience,

413
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:53,011
we wanted to make sure that we weren't overwhelming players

414
00:20:53,112 --> 00:20:55,374
with new things to learn on the first day

415
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:56,236
of the feature launch.

416
00:20:56,536 --> 00:20:59,560
And instead, we could meter out improvements

417
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,064
and complications over time, developing a metagame

418
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:05,347
that always feels like it's changing and evolving.

419
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:08,909
And we saw this evident with our February community day.

420
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,590
Every month we have an event where for three hours

421
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,370
we feature a particular Pokemon,

422
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,891
and February was particularly special

423
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:19,712
because we launch moves with a chance of activating buffs

424
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,193
on the Pokemon that uses them.

425
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:24,434
And this helped us get a lot more players excited

426
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:26,855
about the event than would have normally

427
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:27,655
been interested in it.

428
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:27,715
So.

429
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,662
Where did this all actually leave us?

430
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:40,165
Well, we saw a substantial bump in daily active users

431
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,727
and monthly active users from the feature launch.

432
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,949
And returning players and new players

433
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,811
came to the game in considerable numbers.

434
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:50,893
Our metrics on retention went solidly up.

435
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,135
We got longer play sessions.

436
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:57,158
And we had some significantly positive interactions

437
00:21:57,478 --> 00:21:58,199
on social media.

438
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:01,082
One of my favorite posts I saw on launch day

439
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:02,963
was something along the lines of,

440
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:06,603
wow, this is way more strategic than I expected from Niantic.

441
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:09,764
And I chose to take that as a compliment.

442
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:17,146
The lessons we feel like we learned and took away from this

443
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:20,667
are that when we focus on making new features a meaningful

444
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:23,808
addition to the game, they continue

445
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:26,008
to add to your game past what you first put in.

446
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:30,077
And when you know your players and know your community,

447
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:33,779
you can come up with something that they'll really enjoy

448
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:34,860
and have fun with.

449
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,002
And make sure to keep new features approachable

450
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:41,704
and accessible so that they can be something

451
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:44,446
that your entire player base can enjoy together.

452
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:49,289
I also want to give a big thank to the team

453
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,209
that helped build this.

454
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,570
This wasn't just me.

455
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,452
A lot of people's time and blood, sweat, and tears

456
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:55,913
went into building this feature.

457
00:22:57,058 --> 00:22:58,559
So thank you all for listening.

458
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,179
And any questions?

459
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:12,725
All right, so there are mics up here for anybody

460
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:13,526
who has questions.

461
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:15,387
It looks like we have some time.

462
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:16,447
Hello.

463
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:18,568
Markus Montola from Next Games.

464
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,530
What kind of interactions did you

465
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,951
see of client between players playing PVP?

466
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,672
So the question was what kind of interactions we saw out of client.

467
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:35,457
We saw actually a lot of players kind of teaching each other the game.

468
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:42,683
Outside of, so we did see community tournaments and things like that, but outside of those,

469
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:47,027
a lot of players who were kind of curious about those or interested in them, because

470
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:52,812
for a lot of people, this is the first game that had systems like that that they had played.

471
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:55,953
So we saw a lot of people playing together

472
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,093
as a way of teaching the feature to each other.

473
00:23:58,113 --> 00:24:01,694
So no toxic or hostile interactions?

474
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,095
Yeah.

475
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:04,735
I think one of the things that really

476
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:07,336
helped with preventing the hostile interactions

477
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:10,177
was the fact that we gave the same reward

478
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:11,897
loot table to both players.

479
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:16,058
So there wasn't any sort of win trading or like,

480
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,859
oh, you told me I could win and then you beat me

481
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,739
and I'm never going to get that loot roll.

482
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,140
Thank you.

483
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:26,086
Hi, first of all, great presentation.

484
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:30,587
Just related to the XR, extended reality demo

485
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:33,088
that you guys have showcased at MWC,

486
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:37,709
is there any future plan to convert this trainer battle mode

487
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:41,169
into more of the extended reality type of format?

488
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,670
Because it seems like that's the natural fit for it.

489
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,830
I can't actually talk about future future plans.

490
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,591
Sorry.

491
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,231
Okay, got it.

492
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:49,531
All right, thank you.

493
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,091
Yes.

494
00:24:51,732 --> 00:24:53,514
Hi, Rosa Villegas from Zynga.

495
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,737
Kudos on the feature.

496
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:58,361
What I really enjoyed about your presentation

497
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:01,064
was you talked about how you structured incentives

498
00:25:01,104 --> 00:25:01,525
in the game.

499
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:04,869
And one thing I'm interested in learning about

500
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:05,991
is whether any

501
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,655
things that happened organically in the community

502
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,716
upon launch that you maybe didn't anticipate

503
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:14,539
that were perhaps perverse incentives

504
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,042
or something that you were afraid

505
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,943
that could be abused within the community

506
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:21,224
and how did you combat this?

507
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:27,510
So I don't think we actually had any adverse things happen

508
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,252
because we had a small daily limit

509
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:33,175
on the number of times that players could get rewards.

510
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:39,308
I think players got the rewards kind of very similarly to how we planned them out.

511
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:51,403
Hi, Kai from Pocket Gems.

512
00:25:51,723 --> 00:25:54,964
So this question is regarding the timing of this feature.

513
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:58,446
So I played the game about maybe two years ago,

514
00:25:58,986 --> 00:26:00,287
and then I stopped playing after a while

515
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,268
because there was no PvP battles.

516
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:04,749
And I think a lot of players actually

517
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:08,070
expected this feature to be built way before it's currently

518
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,852
being built. So my question is, if you guys

519
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:14,093
have to do it all over again, would you

520
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:16,074
have built this feature earlier?

521
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:22,317
Hmm.

522
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:30,279
I'm not sure, because I don't know.

523
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,019
I may have made the same choices

524
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,239
if we had to do it all over again.

525
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,640
Is that okay to ask?

526
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,781
Like, what was kind of the considerations

527
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,722
that put into not building it upon launch, for example,

528
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:45,082
because there were like the most number of players

529
00:26:45,463 --> 00:26:46,083
at the same time?

530
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:51,764
Well, we had a lot of things going on as we were trying to launch the game, and we only

531
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:52,905
had so many developers.

532
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:04,838
I have a question about the NPC kind of ones.

533
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:07,219
So in the game, I've been playing since day one,

534
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,339
so you can challenge any of the three kind of NPC leaders,

535
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,040
and I was wondering if there's ever gonna be placed

536
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,761
more incentive on that in the future?

537
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,521
Because right now it's kind of like between

538
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,161
one to three rewards per day,

539
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:20,822
and the medal is like you battle them a thousand times,

540
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:23,223
which is a little insane because I haven't even played

541
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:24,223
the game for a thousand days.

542
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,424
So I was wondering if you're planning to evolve that

543
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:27,144
in any sort of way.

544
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:33,548
So, again, I can't talk about future feature plans, unfortunately.

545
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:34,569
Okay, sorry.

546
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:40,512
I have a quick question.

547
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,495
I don't know how much metrics you actually track on things like this,

548
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:50,577
but do you know how many people actually buy the, or spend the Stardust and stuff

549
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:53,379
to get the extra move sets on Pokémon?

550
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,239
We do have the numbers, but I haven't looked at them recently.

551
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,180
Okay. I was just curious because, like, I play the game and I mostly get, you know,

552
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:13,002
the battles to get the Sinnoh stones and stuff, but, you know, the system itself didn't seem really that exciting to me.

553
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:17,263
I use it, but it's more to get the loot, but I was just curious about that.

554
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:29,080
First off, if anyone has a Relicanth or a Tropius, I'd love one.

555
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:31,722
We all got tons of unknowns.

556
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:40,830
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the initial decision to move from the traditional turn-based battles to the real-time battles that you have in the game.

557
00:28:41,612 --> 00:28:44,294
Yeah, so one of the big reasons that we did that

558
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:47,136
was because we were designing the game for a mobile audience.

559
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:50,838
We wanted something that was quick, snappy,

560
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:52,179
and kept the game flowing.

561
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,381
Turn-based means that you're always

562
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,782
kind of waiting for an opponent.

563
00:28:57,383 --> 00:28:59,264
And in a mobile game, that means that's

564
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,386
an opportunity for someone to background the app

565
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:02,847
and maybe not come back to it.

566
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:05,028
So we wanted to make sure it was something

567
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:08,271
that players were always interacting with immediately.

568
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:09,592
Thank you.

569
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:21,291
Hello. I was curious how much the limitations of your technology really kind of drive your decision making.

570
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:27,533
Obviously, like for the new PVP system, you guys had to remake a new networking solution for all that.

571
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:37,195
Has there been features that you guys have completely scrapped just because modern cell phones or even the average cell phone just really doesn't support that?

572
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:45,938
I think this is another case where I can't talk about

573
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,921
features that we haven't announced or talked about.

574
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:49,861
Sorry.

575
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:50,682
So it's a yes.

576
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:53,905
I didn't say that.

577
00:29:57,526 --> 00:29:59,167
Hi. Can you hear me?

578
00:29:59,487 --> 00:29:59,687
Yes.

579
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:02,128
I've got a question regarding monetization,

580
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:04,348
which doesn't exist for that feature.

581
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:09,010
When you've got a game as popular and huge as Pokemon Go,

582
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,231
the expectations in terms of revenue must be huge.

583
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:17,173
So how do you go about and convince top management

584
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,133
that you're going to build that huge feature

585
00:30:19,314 --> 00:30:23,115
and just not monetize it or indirectly,

586
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:24,335
maybe if you're through retention, but...

587
00:30:25,272 --> 00:30:25,852
How do you do that?

588
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:28,353
Well, what was your strategy about that?

589
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,815
So those were actually the goals that,

590
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:33,476
the metrics goals that kind of came from us,

591
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:35,418
from up, to us, from up top.

592
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:39,620
So it was actually, we wanted more players playing the game

593
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,882
for longer periods of time.

594
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:47,025
Because there's also, the bigger your player base is,

595
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:48,806
if you still have the same percentage of people

596
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:52,428
buying in-app purchases, you're still growing revenue.

597
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:54,649
Okay, thank you.

598
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:58,696
All right, and I think that's about all the time we have.

599
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,327
So thanks, everybody, for coming.
