1
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:10,813
It's a little bit late in the afternoon but we'll try to keep you entertained.

2
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:17,661
So the name of this talk is the Paradox DLC model, planning for the long term.

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:23,551
And the astute among you might notice that there has been a change of speakers.

4
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:29,175
I was supposed to do this talk together with Johan Andersson, but unfortunately he had

5
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,257
to cancel pretty much at the last minute.

6
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:37,042
So instead, my esteemed colleague Shams Georgiani will be jumping in and doing this together

7
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:37,262
with me.

8
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:43,027
All right, so does everyone know who we are?

9
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:45,088
What is Paradox?

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,883
No one?

11
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:52,843
Some of you guys, anyway.

12
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:54,345
So I can take this off.

13
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:56,586
Again, thanks everyone for being here.

14
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,988
So we're going to go through this presentation,

15
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:01,690
and we'll be talking a little bit about our DLC model.

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,172
And hopefully towards the end, we'll do a bit of a Q&A.

17
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:05,553
You can kind of ask us if we have.

18
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:08,755
are head screwed on straight or what the hell is going on.

19
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:10,555
Tell us if this makes sense or not.

20
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:13,977
But one of the reasons why we are here

21
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:19,619
is that we get a fair amount of shit for our business model,

22
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,639
to put it mildly.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,182
If you go and check out any of our user scores on Steam

24
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:29,163
right now, you'll see a lot of thumbs down,

25
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,163
and all they write is the DLC model.

26
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,770
So that's part of the reality, but we also

27
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,914
have an equal amount of people that defend it and support it

28
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:39,455
quite a bit.

29
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:41,216
And we have an even greater amount

30
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:43,638
of people who just buy the games and DLC.

31
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:45,698
to hell and back.

32
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:51,162
So we're not here to defend the DLC model, but we're here to

33
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:55,806
explain and elaborate a bit about why the business model

34
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:59,048
looks like this, and to shed a bit of light behind it.

35
00:01:59,108 --> 00:02:02,972
And hopefully there's a bit of takeaways that you guys can

36
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:06,374
take with you as you go on and make a ton of money, hopefully,

37
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:07,595
off of your DLC plans.

38
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:10,703
Right, so it's kind of a two-part talk.

39
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:13,888
We're talking a little bit about the business model.

40
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:15,631
And that's more your area, I guess.

41
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:18,355
And I'm going to talk about our design practices

42
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:20,819
and how we decide how to do features

43
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,022
and what kind of features we do in these expansions.

44
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:27,287
So my name is Henrik Foreus.

45
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:28,869
I'm a game director at Paradox.

46
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,172
These days, I usually do, or mostly do,

47
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:35,795
game design, creative supervision, and product

48
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:36,255
management.

49
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:40,038
But I've had my hand in our games since 2001

50
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,981
as programmer, scripter, and all kinds of things.

51
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:48,986
And I'm probably best known for Crusader Kings II and Stellaris

52
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:49,887
most recently.

53
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:51,968
Yeah.

54
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:52,769
So.

55
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:53,189
Cool.

56
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:58,007
My name is Shams Jorjani. I've been with Paradox about eight years.

57
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:03,492
I work on the publishing side, so I'm very much the corporate douchebag in that sense.

58
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:09,218
So where Hendrik makes the games fun for you, I'm on the other side doing other things.

59
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:10,519
We'll get to that.

60
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,801
I've done mostly about just about everything at Paradox from marketing, production side,

61
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:19,404
but most notably I've run, been in charge of our game's portfolio for the past seven

62
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,624
years.

63
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:25,107
So all the bad stuff we've released and signed, that's my fault, and all the good stuff I've

64
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,008
been just partially responsible, you could say.

65
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:29,689
I've also been part of the management team,

66
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:32,291
and I'm very much in charge of running

67
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:35,674
part of the business models stuff.

68
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:39,476
So I could do like a five hour talk about the business models

69
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:40,857
straight up today.

70
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:42,739
So I was happy to jump in.

71
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,120
But I'll take it all from here.

72
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,580
Thanks.

73
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:48,943
So Paradox 2.

74
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:51,525
How many here have played a Paradox game?

75
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:52,646
Please keep your hands up.

76
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:53,546
Fantastic.

77
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,328
How many of you have played a Paradox game

78
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:55,988
for more than 10 hours?

79
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:02,170
How many of you have played a Paradox game for more than 100 hours?

80
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,451
More than 500 hours?

81
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,973
More than 1,000 hours?

82
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,514
More than 2,000 hours?

83
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:10,275
More than 3,000 hours?

84
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:11,396
Okay.

85
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:12,336
So.

86
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:13,477
Awesome.

87
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:14,558
Fantastic.

88
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:15,819
First of all, thank you.

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,183
Secondly, this tells the rest of you who haven't played a Paradox game, who hasn't played a

90
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:22,643
Paradox game?

91
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,124
Oh, there's a few of you.

92
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:24,484
Okay.

93
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:24,845
Poor.

94
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:30,714
So Paradox Games have, since their inception,

95
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:32,375
always been niche games.

96
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,496
One of our unofficial slogans has been,

97
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:38,177
a game for everyone is a game for no one, essentially.

98
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:42,799
And we've created these very hardcore sandbox procedural

99
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,820
games that have been very much focused

100
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,421
on historical settings.

101
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,182
This is where Paradox started.

102
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,083
Paradox made these historical games

103
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,545
and worked with regular publishers.

104
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,287
This was in 2004 before there was digital distribution,

105
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:57,068
before Steam.

106
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,590
So we worked with Atari.

107
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,152
And Atari published our games the same way

108
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:04,373
they would have published any old action game.

109
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,755
And after a while, we realized these guys have no idea

110
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:10,638
how we weirdo strategy historical gamers behave,

111
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,540
talk about games, and enjoy them.

112
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,721
We have to stop working with that publisher

113
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,302
and become our own publisher.

114
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:20,225
So many of you may be standing in front of that challenge

115
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,846
right now, do I self-publish or not?

116
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:24,328
We asked ourselves that question in 2004.

117
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:28,270
There was a gentleman called Fredrik Wester, who's now our

118
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,672
CEO, who came in and presented a business plan to the people

119
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:32,613
who owned Paradox then.

120
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,415
And he said, you've got to become your own publisher.

121
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,976
They looked at the plan and said, get out of here.

122
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:39,157
We're closing everything down.

123
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:42,959
And they actually closed everything down and gave it to

124
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,321
Fred, who bought the company for one Swedish crown.

125
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:50,345
From that point on, Paradox started becoming a self-published company.

126
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:54,188
And once in a while, these games did fairly well.

127
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,530
We had our niche audience, they cost next to nothing to make,

128
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,372
and we kind of scrambled to survive during those harsh years.

129
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,535
And after a while, we kind of had a bit more success and decided,

130
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:05,517
hey, we're pretty good at publishing these weirdo niche games.

131
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,400
How about we find other weirdo niche games and publish those?

132
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,741
And that's what we started doing.

133
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:13,103
But we had a shoestring budget, so most of those games

134
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:14,544
were actually not that amazing.

135
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:17,766
So over the years, we've released about 120 games.

136
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:19,467
Most of them are not amazing.

137
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,449
We've had, that doesn't mean that people didn't work really

138
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,572
hard on a lot of these games, but we had to do what we had

139
00:06:27,592 --> 00:06:28,292
to do to survive.

140
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:33,116
So that's a kind of a background that Paradox has had.

141
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:35,578
Nowadays, we've grown quite a bit.

142
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,640
We're still, we consider ourselves very much still a

143
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,981
niche publisher in that sense.

144
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:44,044
But we've had a lot of success.

145
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:48,548
Depending on what AAA game is failing currently on Steam,

146
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:51,190
we'd be considered top five or top 10 publisher, depending

147
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,670
how you do it.

148
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,612
And we've done that by sticking to our guns and kept doing

149
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:58,193
those kind of really weird niche strategy games.

150
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:00,895
Over the years, we've branched out.

151
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:04,016
And sometimes we've done stuff that's been more mainstream,

152
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:04,737
like Magicka.

153
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:06,818
And that did fairly well.

154
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:09,739
And that allowed us to keep pouring more resources into

155
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,780
our core business, which was the strategy games.

156
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:16,443
So nowadays, we have about 200 internal developers who are

157
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:18,164
making strategy games of different sorts.

158
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:21,365
And then we do a lot of publishing worldwide.

159
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:26,628
And we'll get back to the type of what that essentially is

160
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:28,389
meant for the design side of things.

161
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:31,510
Most recently, we released Surviving Mars last week,

162
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:33,611
which went well.

163
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:38,934
We also quite recently bought Triumph Studios, a Dutch

164
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:41,655
studio who makes the Age of Wonder series.

165
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,836
And two and a half years ago, we bought White Wolf from

166
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:47,278
CCP, who were not doing that much with the IPs.

167
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:50,399
We're big fans of vampires as well.

168
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:54,663
So over the years, we've kind of developed a secret sauce.

169
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:56,904
And it's not so secret, essentially, because we talk

170
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:57,704
about it all the time.

171
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:02,505
But we have a basic formula for what we consider is a

172
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,405
paradox game.

173
00:08:03,445 --> 00:08:06,826
And as I've kind of tried to maintain focus for the

174
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:09,787
portfolio over the years, we try to stick to these pillars.

175
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:13,128
We feel that these pillars are the

176
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,594
the thing that makes a Paradox game a Paradox game.

177
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,301
And not only that, we think that these games,

178
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:22,405
the games that follow these pillars,

179
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:26,392
fundamentally result in a stronger business model.

180
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:28,917
And this is a really important aspect of this.

181
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:32,300
Most of us, I don't know about you, Hendrik, but I started in

182
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,302
the games industry because I wanted to make games.

183
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,704
And then I ended up not making a single game, of course.

184
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:39,925
But that's how things go.

185
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,747
Most of us, our first passion is maybe making games.

186
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:46,990
But then we quickly encountered the realities of

187
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,252
making games, which is ultimately it's a business.

188
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:52,374
It's a business and an art, but without paying for your work.

189
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:58,241
it, you know, very quickly becomes something else. So Fred, our CEO's main focus has always been

190
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:04,048
building a business and he's always built a business for the long term. It's always we always

191
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:08,793
view games and our function in the games industry as a marathon, not a sprint.

192
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:11,995
We're quite confident that if we make it to the tenth game,

193
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:13,656
it's probably going to be good.

194
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:15,917
The challenge is to get to keep to make games

195
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:17,938
so you get to that tenth game.

196
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,479
I don't know if anyone here plans on retiring

197
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:22,440
after they make their next game. I don't think so.

198
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,861
A lot of us want to keep making games.

199
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:29,524
So we retain focus on what makes the business model kind of work.

200
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:32,485
So we talk a lot about the business model,

201
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:36,588
and it's something that's deeply ingrained into our games.

202
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,088
It's a fundamental part of it.

203
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,274
And we feel that games that do follow these pillars actually just result in a stronger

204
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:45,596
business model that allows us to make more money.

205
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:48,239
And more money allows us to make more games and better games.

206
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:54,558
We think that these type of games are largely underserved,

207
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,680
and we also understand them fairly well.

208
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,282
And just briefly, I'm not going to run through them

209
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,483
in terrible detail, since most of you

210
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:04,164
are already familiar with the type of games we do.

211
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:07,186
But a paradox game should be infinitely replayable, ideally.

212
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,408
I just checked the numbers yesterday.

213
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:13,711
The median play time for Hearts of Iron 4 is 202 hours.

214
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,152
Median play time.

215
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,695
If you look at, again, Hearts of Iron.

216
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,049
About 34% of everyone who's bought the game has played it

217
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,850
more than 100 hours.

218
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:32,353
Half of the people who ever bought Hearts of Iron, since

219
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:33,994
it was launched almost two years ago, still

220
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:34,754
play it once a month.

221
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:38,296
So we have crazy retention numbers, mostly because I

222
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:39,937
don't think those players have anywhere else to go.

223
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,288
So the games need to be infinitely replayable.

224
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:47,589
We want the games to be intellectually challenging in some form.

225
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,790
We want them to challenge the mind, not the reflexes, although they do also have that

226
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,450
inaction component from time to time.

227
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,811
We want the games to cater to some kind of creative aspect.

228
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:01,193
We want you to tell us a story in our games rather than us tell you a story.

229
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:05,514
The games are not made beautiful necessarily by graphics.

230
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:07,155
but by the gameplay.

231
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:12,418
So we feel that graphics are there to serve a purpose.

232
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,979
They're not the ends themselves.

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,141
And we like the games to be accessible in some way or form

234
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:17,982
so you can get into them.

235
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,583
We fail quite at this often.

236
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:22,344
We also want the games to be something

237
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:23,425
you can nerd out about.

238
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:27,628
If you have real world knowledge about Flak 88 canons,

239
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,948
that should help you in the game somehow.

240
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:34,055
A number of games that I just want to show you briefly

241
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:36,797
that we think that really live up to these kind of pillars

242
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:38,438
and we draw a lot of inspiration from

243
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,301
and are humbled before the fact that we can learn a lot

244
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,622
from these type of games.

245
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:46,185
Literally every single game here that is not currently

246
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:48,026
published by us, a lot of them aren't,

247
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,428
we'd consider paradox games.

248
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:53,351
It's just failures on my part that I didn't manage

249
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:55,593
to sign Tera or Hearthstone.

250
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:56,453
That would have been a pretty hard game.

251
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:01,397
So I'm coming back to the business model.

252
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,697
And this is the really important part.

253
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:08,620
So by having a game that somebody can play 1,000 hours

254
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,482
in, if you've spent 1,000 hours playing the game, it's

255
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,883
probably not going to be that hard for me to convince you to

256
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:15,183
spend one more dollar in it.

257
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:19,746
If you look at the average spend you've had over the

258
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:22,767
lifespan of the game, you're getting quite your money's

259
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,508
worth compared to most other forms of entertainment.

260
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:30,268
I argue quite heavily, and nobody listens to me again, hope, luckily, that we should

261
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:34,835
put a big, fat, juicy number in the main menu of every single Paradox game which tells you

262
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,618
how much money you spend per hour of entertainment.

263
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,684
And I'll dare you to find any other premium game that can beat our numbers.

264
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,752
Maybe free to play games, but I don't think you can find that

265
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:45,553
in the premium space.

266
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:50,099
So we just see people spend more in games where they are

267
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:50,940
spending more time.

268
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:55,065
It sounds very simple, and it is true.

269
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:56,908
It's harder to make.

270
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:07,472
Games that do not focus on art or games that focus on systems and procedural stuff just get better mileage out of development resources.

271
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:13,955
SimCity 5 had about 80 artists that were working on it. City Skylines was made by a team of 8 people.

272
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:20,598
By not focusing on art, we focus on stuff that gives us more mileage.

273
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,956
By having modding in our games, we actually are pushing the

274
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:27,237
costs to other people, which are fans.

275
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,199
They create variants of our games.

276
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:33,422
Ultimately, we think that every single game has a Dota

277
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:36,084
or a DayZ locked inside of it somewhere.

278
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:37,905
But we as developers can't find it.

279
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:41,768
It can only be found once it's put in the hands of you

280
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,789
players, because you guys are much smarter than we are.

281
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,192
I mentioned that already.

282
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:48,693
Actually, duplicates, sorry.

283
00:13:50,274 --> 00:13:50,714
We also.

284
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,861
By having games that follow this model, I actually see also recurring revenues.

285
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,022
People come back and spend money over time.

286
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:04,665
People that actually spent a thousand hours in our games are less likely to go to a competitor

287
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:09,307
as well because they're locked in because of the sunk cost fallacy or whatever reason.

288
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:12,689
If you invested that much time in the game, you don't want to let go of all that.

289
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:15,510
This is why I still play Magic the Gathering after 20 years.

290
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:21,726
And finally, these games are quite hard to make, which, at

291
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:24,127
least in the grand strategy space, we consider ourselves

292
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,108
not having any real competitors.

293
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:31,130
So this has led us to a position where we still keep

294
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,192
making niche games, but we know that niche games don't

295
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:35,792
mean small by any means.

296
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:38,554
Our basic philosophy is that if we create something that

297
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:39,314
is niche, we can make it small.

298
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:47,578
very pure and uncompromising. We will create such a satisfactory game experience in the

299
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:52,900
core audience that they can't find anywhere else. And they will, after a while, start

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,222
talking about the game in terms that you might not recognize. And then other people will

301
00:14:59,282 --> 00:14:59,642
actually...

302
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,437
not maybe relate to the game, but they will relate to the player fantasies.

303
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:09,219
And while the core gameplay is pretty niche, the core fantasies that we have in our games,

304
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:13,961
the player fantasies, ultimately the reasons why people play the games are quite strong.

305
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:15,522
I'll give you a good example.

306
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:23,486
Crusader Kings 2 is about running a medieval royal house in an obscure part of Europe.

307
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:28,290
The game does not necessarily look that amazing, it's quite hard to play.

308
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,072
The game has still sold almost two million copies.

309
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:35,475
And the reason for that is that it has a pretty basic and relatable...

310
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:39,496
player fantasy, which is to rule as a king or queen.

311
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:42,639
And that's something everyone here has experienced or

312
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,382
fantasized about at some point during their childhood.

313
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:46,943
That fantasy is strong.

314
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:52,609
And through shows like Game of Thrones, that fantasy is

315
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:54,751
enhanced, and it's there, and people can relate to it.

316
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:57,932
Other examples is EVE Online, for instance.

317
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:00,533
You hear these amazing stories about EVE Online,

318
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:01,833
that people have gameplay experiences.

319
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,634
And you're like, that sounds super cool.

320
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:04,714
I want to experience that.

321
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:05,594
And people try it out.

322
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:08,455
And then it's like doing your taxes for three hours.

323
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:10,756
And then you maybe discover that, hey, I like doing

324
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:11,796
my taxes for three hours.

325
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,897
So one thing we know that niche does not

326
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:16,638
mean small by any measure of the word,

327
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:18,718
as long as we are uncompromising and really

328
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,719
try to stick to the basic tenet that a game for everyone

329
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:22,520
is a game for no one.

330
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:29,749
And I'm going to hand it over to Henrik in a bit.

331
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,471
But this model has developed over a few years.

332
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:36,892
Henrik will describe what our DLC model looks like today.

333
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,993
But in the past, it didn't work this way.

334
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:42,943
We used to release a game, and then six months later,

335
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:43,944
we had an expansion.

336
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:47,365
And that more or less replaced the old game.

337
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:50,266
And we did another expansion six months later,

338
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:52,907
and that made the last expansion obsolete.

339
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,548
So it was a very serial way of approaching things.

340
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,890
And we know that our games had a life cycle of about two,

341
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,951
three years, and then they became obsolete, more or less.

342
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:11,277
So I've harped on about the business model because it's something that drives a lot of the design decisions that we make,

343
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:15,881
and it's one of the fundamental things that ties the company together.

344
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:20,425
And we'll be able to come back and talk about, you know, as we wrap up,

345
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:26,910
on why we think this DLC model is literally the best thing for us as a money-making company,

346
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,093
but most importantly, it's the best thing for our fans and the players.

347
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:36,286
People who want more content and DLC from our products

348
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,849
are benefited by the fact that we work with our current DLC

349
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,271
model compared to the old one.

350
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:45,594
It's quite easy to look at the product page for Crusader Kings

351
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:48,496
and just see that, oh my god, these guys have $270 worth

352
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:48,636
of DLC.

353
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:49,037
They're evil.

354
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:57,819
Well, on the other hand, you could have bought the base game of Crusader Kings in 2012 and

355
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:03,042
never bought a single piece of DLC and you'd still see multiple updates every year and

356
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:04,863
tons of content for free.

357
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:11,118
So our usual kind of what we say to people is that you don't want the DLC, don't buy it.

358
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:14,761
And that works, you know, in some respects.

359
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,203
So I'll hand it over to you now.

360
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:16,703
Cool, thanks.

361
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:22,668
I'm going to harp on a little bit more about the business model, unfortunately, but stay with me.

362
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,311
This is from the perspective of the development studio.

363
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,871
So we've already mentioned that our fans are pretty hardcore.

364
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:32,092
They play our games for a very long time.

365
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:34,133
And they used to do that even in the old days, with Europa

366
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:36,494
Niversalis 2 and Victoria 1 and so on.

367
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:40,235
But we didn't really capitalize on that.

368
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:45,057
So the long tail existed, but we didn't make any money off

369
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:46,918
it, really, which is sad.

370
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:55,101
So we came up with this new DLC model. Instead of every other, every new release of an

371
00:18:55,141 --> 00:19:00,063
expansion obsoleting the previous one, they would all be modular. So it's like going into a

372
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:05,345
candy shop and picking up the stuff you like into your little bag. And they would be able to

373
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:09,187
play nice with each other regardless of the combination of expansions or DLC that you

374
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:09,407
bought.

375
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,745
And we thought that games should have an indefinite life cycle.

376
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:17,128
If people keep playing it, we want to keep supporting it

377
00:19:17,428 --> 00:19:19,650
and keeping it fresh and releasing new stuff for it.

378
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:22,892
We thought that, actually at the time

379
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,173
we didn't think that we learned that,

380
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:29,136
that we can go as high as 50-50 free and paid features,

381
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:32,799
when you think of our development time for an expansion

382
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,160
and the patch that goes along with it.

383
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,661
And that's fine.

384
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,044
People will perceive it as one whole experience anyway.

385
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:46,035
So these days we release both expansions and something we call immersion packs or story

386
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:54,461
packs, which are less heavy on the code content. And here is actually the current downloadable

387
00:19:54,501 --> 00:20:01,346
content page on Steam for Crusader Kings 2. It's not that bad actually, because we've come to

388
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,750
the realization that we should bundle up our stuff. It used to be like 80 different DLCs

389
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,391
there, which was extremely off-putting and hard to navigate.

390
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:12,321
So we've taken some flak for the model,

391
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,302
but what I say to everyone is basically

392
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:19,724
that all these DLCs, even if you just buy one or two of them,

393
00:20:20,224 --> 00:20:23,225
will allow us to keep developing and improving

394
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:25,626
the game for an indefinite period, basically,

395
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:26,606
which is great for everyone.

396
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:34,064
So instead of tailing on, we're tailing, or tailing off, we're actually tailing on. This is

397
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:42,568
monthly active users for Europa Rosales 4 since, what is it, July 2014. And as you can see, it

398
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,469
just keeps growing. It's pretty amazing.

399
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,891
I don't know if I know any similar game that has a similar curve, to be honest.

400
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:57,413
Our games models end up having a very similar curve to free-to-play games that are run as games as a service.

401
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:01,114
So our premium games come pretty close to actually just replicating that.

402
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:07,856
We're spending more, I think we're spending like triple the amount we're spending now, today, on Crusader Kings

403
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:11,137
compared to the year before the game was finished for release.

404
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:12,446
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

405
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,527
I mean, these games are getting quite old now,

406
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:15,468
especially Crusader Kings 2.

407
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,248
And it still looks like this.

408
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,630
So Shams talked a lot about the business case.

409
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:25,672
And from my perspective or the studio perspective,

410
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:29,673
it's more like expansions drive up the monthly active users.

411
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:31,014
No question about that.

412
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:37,256
Old expansions keep selling so that the base game sales are

413
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,678
actually quite eclipsed by all the expansions and DLC

414
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:41,198
that we release.

415
00:21:42,964 --> 00:21:44,785
And we want to cater to different types of players,

416
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:49,087
find new demographics and target groups for our existing games.

417
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:52,750
And of course, it gives us some sales and marketing flexibility

418
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,712
to do pre-order bonuses and other gimmicks

419
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:58,473
that we can throw out there.

420
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:02,722
And as for that first point, that expansions actually

421
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:06,264
drive up mall, here's that same graph again

422
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:10,286
with the various expansions and content packs

423
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:11,406
for European Resolvers 4.

424
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,267
And you can see that they coincide quite nicely

425
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:15,288
with all these bumps.

426
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,129
Now, there are some other bumps as well.

427
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,230
And they are actually sales campaigns and holidays

428
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:22,051
and stuff like that.

429
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:23,772
So there is a reason for them too.

430
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:27,093
And they probably contribute as well in keeping interest

431
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:28,974
and driving up monthly active users.

432
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:34,009
But expansions are extremely effective to get this tail

433
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,250
or curve that we like so much.

434
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:42,632
And as for old expansions that they keep selling,

435
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,152
here is two examples.

436
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:46,933
The Old Gods for Crusader Kings 2.

437
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:50,154
It was released in 2013, and you can see there

438
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:53,815
how many units in thousands that it's sold since then.

439
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:57,176
And we see the same pattern, even better actually,

440
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,677
for European Resolves 4 with Common Sense.

441
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:05,550
And when you have 15 expansions, that's starting to

442
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,571
get to be a lot of money.

443
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,635
And we want to cater to different play styles,

444
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:13,675
different types of players.

445
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:17,017
It's particularly suitable for a game like Crusader Kings 2,

446
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:20,538
which is almost a hybrid between a strategy game and an RPG,

447
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:25,360
in that different expansions can take a different tack.

448
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,880
Some of them can be pretty RPG.

449
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,181
Others can be more internal politics.

450
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:32,902
Some are even into the supernatural and fantasy stuff,

451
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:36,724
which is slightly controversial, but appreciated

452
00:23:36,744 --> 00:23:37,264
by all our fans.

453
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,681
And about sales and marketing flexibility, well,

454
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:46,183
we can whip up things like this, some with more effort

455
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:47,103
than others.

456
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:49,184
And it's quite neat.

457
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:51,645
You can give it away at fan gatherings and stuff like that,

458
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:56,007
since it's all neatly modular and plays nice with the base

459
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:56,207
game.

460
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,615
But of course, there's a player case as well.

461
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:03,677
And I already mentioned that I think

462
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:08,460
it's good for players to see their beloved game live

463
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,841
pretty much forever, or for a very, very long time at least.

464
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:14,304
And also the fact that they can buy and pick and choose

465
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:15,825
whatever expansions they like.

466
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:27,442
It's just a sad fact that there are so many completionists out there who feel that they have to own everything and that we are thus, you know, doing a con job or something.

467
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:29,083
It's too bad.

468
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:34,868
So the idea with longevity anyway is that games should never feel abandoned.

469
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:42,435
We will keep improving the base experience as long as people keep playing the game and buying our expansions.

470
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:46,657
So even if you don't buy any expansions,

471
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,258
we're going to keep it fresh, and people

472
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,140
are going to notice that the game is actually getting better.

473
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,203
If you come back to it two years after stopping playing,

474
00:24:55,723 --> 00:24:57,525
it will be a better experience.

475
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:03,241
And the other point was modularity.

476
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,063
You buy what you like.

477
00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:08,767
And with our model, you can actually try things out in

478
00:25:08,827 --> 00:25:12,390
multiplayer, because what the host is running,

479
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,692
everyone can use.

480
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,575
So that's pretty neat as well.

481
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:21,199
It goes back to learnings from watching our fellow Swedish

482
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,020
developers at Dice.

483
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:27,705
famously released map packs that divided the player community.

484
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:32,630
So we kind of decided that we want to have inclusive DLCs that allow more people to

485
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,853
experience the DLC without dividing the player community.

486
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:41,078
Yeah, it was also kind of a technical challenge to get that to work.

487
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:43,060
But I think it's a great, great idea.

488
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:48,178
Right, so let's take a look at the design approach here,

489
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:50,881
because it is quite a challenge to churn out

490
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:54,045
this many expansions and come up with new features that

491
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,547
are perceived well by players.

492
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,390
And I think that it's all about player perceptions, really.

493
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,892
It's not about what the developers want to do.

494
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,517
So first off, if you want to do this,

495
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,880
you've got to have a very solid base game.

496
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:10,468
And the trick there is to make the game feel absolutely

497
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:13,709
complete, even if you don't own any expansions.

498
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:17,030
It's going to feel, it's going to have to feel like a

499
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,790
complete experience, basically.

500
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,210
Or it'll come back to bite you.

501
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,392
And you're going to have some fun core loops.

502
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:28,613
That's what you should focus your efforts on, making sure

503
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,194
that the base game you release has excellent core loops that

504
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:33,034
are addictive and fun.

505
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:37,608
And you can save all those darlings, all the extras, for

506
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:40,931
later, because you can rest easy in the knowledge that you

507
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:43,113
will probably release a lot of expansions.

508
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:49,318
Of course, you also need to prepare for that fact.

509
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,421
You should think about all the expansions you want to release

510
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,983
over at least the first couple of years.

511
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,086
So you should have design outlines for that and the code

512
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:58,906
base to support it.

513
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:07,486
And if you boil it down to two principles, when you design

514
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:11,927
features for expansions that people pay for, principle

515
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:14,248
number one is that they have to be visible.

516
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:17,370
It has to have a visible impact, or people will not

517
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,351
understand that you put a lot of effort into it.

518
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:24,072
So no matter how much work you do under the hood, it's not

519
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:25,833
going to be well received unless it's

520
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:26,693
immediately visible.

521
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:28,946
So here's an example of that.

522
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:32,970
We added something called Aegis to Europa and Rosalis 4.

523
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,653
Once you install that expansion, you

524
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:38,815
can immediately see in the main interface

525
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,456
that there's a little thing there.

526
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:43,219
You're in this age of reformation, for example.

527
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:51,336
The other main principle is that good expansion features should be atomic in a way. They

528
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:56,662
should be standalone, unentangled, and independent from as many systems as you can

529
00:27:56,682 --> 00:28:03,809
possibly make them. This can be very hard, of course, but if you can't make the features

530
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:09,214
atomic and standalone, you should put them in the free patches and updates instead.

531
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:15,200
One big no-no, another tempting thing, as a designer especially,

532
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,844
is to add a paid feature that you don't

533
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:22,866
want to build on in a subsequent expansion after that.

534
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:24,748
That's going to be very tricky.

535
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:27,270
You're going to be limiting the number of people who actually

536
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,854
can buy and enjoy that second upgrade to those features.

537
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,056
So don't paint yourself into a corner.

538
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:41,204
And with that in mind, we have found

539
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:43,867
that there are certain types of features that are

540
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,950
excellent material to make paid.

541
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:52,375
First off, features that add new ways of playing,

542
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,877
of achieving old goals in a new way.

543
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,721
Say that you take territory through military means

544
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:00,463
in the base game, but then you add

545
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:03,045
a way of doing it diplomatically in an expansion as well.

546
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:10,539
progression is super good as well. If you can add a system where you can level up or gain new

547
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:17,646
ranks or rank up in some old system, that's also perfect. It's pretty stand alone atomic.

548
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:23,697
And then there's customization stuff, like we made a DLC for Crusader Kings 2.

549
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:28,539
It's a barber shop, basically, where you can change hair and beard of your character.

550
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,341
And it's a little thing, but it's kind of cool and it's extremely standalone and not

551
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,662
entangled in anything else.

552
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:38,082
Purely cosmetic.

553
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:45,752
And then there's faction unlocks, which is, it's not just us doing this, I think other companies

554
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:52,533
have also found that it's perfect for this. And the reason is that there is a risk when you add

555
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:57,874
more features to the game, that you get feature creep, the interface gets cluttered with new

556
00:29:57,974 --> 00:30:04,876
things, but if you do faction unlocks that doesn't happen because it adds a different way of

557
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:08,217
playing the game with mutually exclusive interfaces basically.

558
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:12,219
And then you can do quality of life UI things.

559
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,623
And I have an example of that coming up.

560
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,751
So here's an example of a faction unlock in Crusader

561
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:20,812
Kings 2 on release.

562
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,796
You could only play Christians.

563
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:25,460
And that had a distinct play style.

564
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:30,350
But then with expansions we added things like Muslims in sort of Islam.

565
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:35,035
And with this expansion, the old gods, we made it possible to play pagans.

566
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:37,237
And it's a completely different experience.

567
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:41,421
The Christians mostly play nice and abide by diplomatic rules.

568
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:45,565
They have to use... they have to have a reason to go to war and all that boring jazz.

569
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:49,405
But the pagans, they're all about raiding and pillaging

570
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:52,688
and just declaring war, taking concubines, having a good time.

571
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:56,391
We also added 200 more years to the gameplay,

572
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:57,772
which was quite appreciated.

573
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:02,516
But the cool thing about this is if you don't play as the pagans,

574
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:03,877
it's the same old thing.

575
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:06,700
So the pagans are a different way

576
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,181
of experiencing the same game.

577
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:13,508
Here's another example.

578
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:16,229
It's the diplomatic macro planner

579
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,410
from European Missile List 4.

580
00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:22,693
It basically gathers up all diplomacy in one place,

581
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:24,353
and it was very appreciated.

582
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:28,115
So it's a new interface that you get with this expansion

583
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:28,816
mandate of heaven.

584
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,150
But it's very separate from everything else.

585
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,811
It's just a convenience thing.

586
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:35,792
You don't have to have it.

587
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:37,973
The game works just as well without it,

588
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:40,855
which means that it's standalone and very modular.

589
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,317
So a perfect feature for a paid expansion.

590
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:49,147
And there's one more example of progression.

591
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,549
Instalaris, which has a really cool tech system.

592
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:55,910
The technology system Instalaris is basically

593
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,370
a collectible card game almost.

594
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:00,832
So it's very easy to slot in new technologies.

595
00:32:01,952 --> 00:32:05,513
And what we did here is basically we added a new layer

596
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:08,935
of late game technologies for progression and ranking up.

597
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,217
And in this case, it's very visible in some cases,

598
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:16,238
like the Planet Destroyers and the Titan class spaceships.

599
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:21,864
All right, so those are some good types of features

600
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,385
that you can actually charge money for.

601
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,707
But there are also bad features.

602
00:32:26,787 --> 00:32:29,908
And trust me, we've made plenty of these as well,

603
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:31,389
plenty of mistakes.

604
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,112
So you can do these things, but the point

605
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:37,873
is you cannot charge money for them.

606
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:41,995
So you shouldn't try to make core gameplay changes that

607
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:45,557
alter the experience for players who have the expansion.

608
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:47,058
That's a big no-no.

609
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:53,343
You shouldn't try to make or charge money for minor improvements. Balance and bug fixes of

610
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:59,868
course should be free. And you should not try to make features that mess with a thousand

611
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:03,551
other features in the game. That's a pretty bad idea.

612
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:08,324
So here's an example from CK2.

613
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:12,726
In Crusader Kings 2, armies are not standing around on the map,

614
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,787
and they are mobilized or called up when you need them.

615
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,548
So they're peasant levies, essentially.

616
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:21,129
But I thought it would be a really cool idea

617
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:23,930
if the professional troops that actually existed at the time

618
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,471
could also be represented in the game somehow,

619
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:30,552
and that as the eras progress, the peasant levies

620
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:32,613
would be phased out, and people would start

621
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:33,853
using retinue troops more.

622
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,831
However, while this was well received,

623
00:33:38,372 --> 00:33:42,134
it also messed with the core gameplay in significant ways.

624
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:46,377
It's completely upset the balance of warfare,

625
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,239
if you had the expansion or not.

626
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,400
And it was also a feature that we really

627
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,942
wanted to build on in subsequent expansions,

628
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:55,004
but we couldn't because we painted ourselves

629
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:55,925
into a corner.

630
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:07,474
And here's a more recent example, a Blitz combat tactic from Hearts of Iron IV, which caused pretty much an uproar on the forums.

631
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:16,837
In itself, it should be pretty suitable as a paid feature, but it was kind of a minor thing.

632
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:22,539
It was one combat tactic among many, and it was perceived that this should have been part of the base game.

633
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,628
It was also unfortunate that it was called Blitz.

634
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,554
You know, it's pretty iconic for a World War II game

635
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:30,838
to have a Blitz command or combat tactic.

636
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,563
So it kind of backfired on us.

637
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:39,287
We've also done some entangled features.

638
00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:43,608
This is a system we added in EU4 called Estates.

639
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:47,249
It's basically internal political factions

640
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:49,269
that create gameplay for you as a ruler.

641
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:52,470
You need to keep these political factions happy,

642
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,450
or they will start causing you all kinds of troubles.

643
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,511
But they can also give you bonuses.

644
00:34:58,811 --> 00:35:01,071
The problem with this feature, or one of the problems with it,

645
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:04,832
is that it kind of messes around with every other thing

646
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:05,432
in the game.

647
00:35:06,344 --> 00:35:10,908
whenever we release something new, we have to consider, well, what will happen to the

648
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:16,753
estate's mechanic if we do this, etc. So, pretty bad idea. Should have been free.

649
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:21,912
Which brings us to free features.

650
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,793
There is nothing wrong with this.

651
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:27,835
And I think we spend at least 50% of our development time

652
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:29,716
actually doing free features.

653
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:34,078
As long as you have a strong theme for your expansion,

654
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:36,999
they are perceived as a whole thing.

655
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,541
The free and the paid part make for one experience.

656
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:43,002
And that's also how I see it as a designer.

657
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:48,671
I really ideally want people to kind of mix them up and not

658
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:50,171
know what is free and what is paid.

659
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:52,712
Doesn't really work that way, but you can dream.

660
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:57,114
So free features, using them, you

661
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,435
can replace old mechanics that you don't like much.

662
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:01,696
You can mess around with the core gameplay.

663
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:05,558
And people will still perceive that the game

664
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:09,059
is kept fresh and cool, and you're doing interesting shit.

665
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:15,251
So everything I said was bad in a paid feature, you can

666
00:36:15,713 --> 00:36:16,878
probably do as a free feature.

667
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:26,547
There are some other pitfalls that don't have to do specifically with the types of features.

668
00:36:27,907 --> 00:36:35,011
You should remember to stick to what the game is. This is also something we've forgotten sometimes.

669
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:44,157
And what is the game? Well, it's partly what we think it should be, what we thought when we created the game originally.

670
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:46,098
But it's also what the players think that the game is.

671
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:52,075
And the biggest mistake you can make

672
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:54,897
is probably add new restrictions on players.

673
00:36:56,118 --> 00:36:59,381
Now, there is a case to be made that our games, at least CK2,

674
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:02,163
is hard to learn and easy to master.

675
00:37:03,144 --> 00:37:06,627
And that's kind of the pyramid upside down, right?

676
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:10,430
So I had the brilliant idea that let's crank up the challenge

677
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,551
and make the game a bit harder.

678
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:17,617
So we added defensive alliances and other things to the game

679
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,498
that were supposed to crank up the challenge.

680
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,420
But people just felt that they'd been

681
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,741
put in a straitjacket instead.

682
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,622
And that's not a good place to be.

683
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:31,185
So don't mess with agency, the player's freedom to act.

684
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,188
And then there's, of course, feature overload and UI

685
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:35,508
clutter.

686
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:42,532
And it's a challenge because it completely contradicts the high visibility requirement

687
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:43,793
of paid features, right?

688
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:49,518
But if you have a lot of visible features, what are you going to end up with?

689
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:51,959
Well, it's going to be a pretty overloaded interface.

690
00:37:54,321 --> 00:38:01,546
Another huge mistake is to, as developer, think that, yeah, I like the Black Sheep Turks.

691
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:03,568
You know, we should expand on that experience.

692
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:04,809
It's an awesome faction.

693
00:38:06,424 --> 00:38:09,025
But unfortunately, most players will not see it that way.

694
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:10,545
They have their preferences.

695
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:13,646
And we know that there are certain countries that are a

696
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:14,886
lot more popular than others.

697
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:15,787
Germany.

698
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:20,608
Germany, Prussia, the Confederate States of America,

699
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:24,889
the Eastern Roman Empire, all of these are super popular.

700
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:26,830
For some reason, don't ask me why.

701
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:31,280
But when we do an expansion about India or something, yeah,

702
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:32,681
no.

703
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:35,364
So just don't go there.

704
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:36,725
It's a sad fact.

705
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:44,773
So what actually, what do players value?

706
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:49,178
Well, initially we thought that, hey, let's

707
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:50,239
look at Steam review scores.

708
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:52,135
That's a great metric.

709
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:57,757
And it was a pretty good metric originally, but then less and

710
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:01,519
less so over time as there was more and more rage about our

711
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,819
DLC model particularly.

712
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,441
So there's a correlation between steam review score and

713
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:10,762
actual revenue, but it's weaker than you might expect.

714
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:17,605
So as designers, we look more at actual revenue now than we

715
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,605
do the steam review scores.

716
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:24,256
And we also came up with a neat little formula or spreadsheet

717
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:29,058
that we employ to estimate the value for money

718
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:30,478
for our expansions.

719
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:32,839
So these are some CK2 expansions.

720
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,121
And we've divided up the features into different sizes.

721
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:41,422
And each size gives you a different sort of score.

722
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:46,364
So we then sum up that score, and we divide it

723
00:39:46,424 --> 00:39:47,404
by the price point.

724
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:55,819
and then we get a pretty arbitrary value for money. It works pretty well. We want that value

725
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:02,182
for money value to be at 2 or above ideally. But as you can see some of our more popular

726
00:40:02,222 --> 00:40:08,984
expansions are actually way below that or a bit below that. So old gods had 1.8, it still did

727
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:14,626
extremely well. So the flaw with this formula is it doesn't really consider the free

728
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:17,427
features that we release along with the paid ones.

729
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:23,521
I mean, I know for a fact that the Reapers do, which didn't really contain that much paid

730
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:30,906
content, was extremely well received, mostly due to the free stuff. So people keep mixing this

731
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:37,890
up and it's to our advantage, of course. So we're still working on improving this formula or

732
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,411
spreadsheet.

733
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:43,469
And now we come to Johan's part of this presentation.

734
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,653
So sadly, I'm not going to do it justice.

735
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:50,819
But it has to do with other types of challenges that are

736
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,381
not related to design specifically.

737
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:56,507
About the architecture.

738
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,722
Well, the code base will keep evolving all the time.

739
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:04,784
And that's interesting in many ways.

740
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:08,187
But it's going to help, at least in our position it

741
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:10,149
helps, because we have so many live projects.

742
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,311
We can do a lot of improvements in the engine.

743
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:15,713
We have the close of its engine, and we have a middle

744
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:16,754
layer called Gemini.

745
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,717
And if you can do improvements there, it's going to benefit

746
00:41:20,817 --> 00:41:21,538
all the games.

747
00:41:24,362 --> 00:41:29,286
And Johan really wanted to stress that you should keep the code simple and readable and not

748
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:35,491
over engineer it. And that's very important for us because in our organization we have to

749
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:40,515
move the programmers around a lot and you know they need to understand the code pretty much at

750
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:42,556
a glance. So don't get too clever.

751
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:45,673
You also got to keep the code maintainable.

752
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:49,776
And I know one thing he wanted to bring up was a simple

753
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:50,317
little trick.

754
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:54,840
If you have a get function, for example, you can pass

755
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,902
along a text string as an argument or

756
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:59,023
pointer to get the tooltip.

757
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:00,605
So you only have one function.

758
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:02,466
You following, Chance?

759
00:42:02,526 --> 00:42:02,726
No.

760
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:07,470
You only have one function to work with.

761
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,292
And you don't have to have a separate tooltip function.

762
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,394
And you should try to have a clear programming guideline

763
00:42:15,774 --> 00:42:17,655
or standard that everyone follows.

764
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:22,139
As for the technology itself, well, it's

765
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:23,260
a virtual file system.

766
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,802
We treat our DLCs exactly like mods.

767
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:28,664
They're pretty much the same thing as far as the game is

768
00:42:28,704 --> 00:42:29,104
concerned.

769
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,427
They're packages that are treated as modular changes.

770
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:36,908
And you can toggle them on or off at load time, which is

771
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:37,369
convenient.

772
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:43,254
So if you buy House Lords or full plate music or whatever,

773
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:45,636
you can turn it off if you don't like it or if you get

774
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:45,956
tired.

775
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:51,421
And then there's the process, the project

776
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,483
management of it all.

777
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:56,185
And it's very important, of course, to plan ahead.

778
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,542
should have the design ready in time. The designers should be,

779
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:05,403
you know, one step ahead all the time. And you should have a

780
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:10,905
scalable UI that is easy to work with and make room for more

781
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:13,906
stuff because you will add more stuff to the UI. It's

782
00:43:13,946 --> 00:43:19,708
guaranteed. And it's important to remember that you have to

783
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:20,909
repay tech debt.

784
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:24,787
We have a pretty aggressive schedule

785
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:26,508
when it comes to releasing these expansions

786
00:43:26,548 --> 00:43:28,289
and we don't have an infinite amount of people.

787
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,691
So sometimes we have to cut some corners

788
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:34,233
and accept the fact that we will have to do some hacks

789
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:35,374
and hard-coded solutions.

790
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:38,376
And these accumulate and get worse over time.

791
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:42,639
So it's worthwhile to take some time to catch up.

792
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,480
And we usually schedule a couple of weeks

793
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,243
in between certain expansions to catch up on our tech debt.

794
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:56,898
Most importantly though, you need to understand your players.

795
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,284
And if you can use reasonable metrics, do so.

796
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:04,647
You know, if you have telemetry, use it.

797
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:06,169
If you don't have telemetry, add it.

798
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:10,455
And you should listen to your hardcore fans.

799
00:44:12,377 --> 00:44:14,578
to some degree, I suppose, don't listen to them too hard

800
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:17,860
because they are a pretty vocal minority.

801
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:20,322
But as long as they keep it constructive and positive,

802
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:22,724
you should listen to their stories and what they tell you.

803
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:25,986
And you will understand them, probably,

804
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:28,568
if you play the game yourself.

805
00:44:29,148 --> 00:44:31,810
And sadly, not all people actually play the game

806
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,011
and enjoy it.

807
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,693
So how can you expect your players to do so?

808
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:49,748
Right, so if I were to summarize this somewhat unfocused

809
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:56,913
subject, it would be keep your design modular and stand alone.

810
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:00,375
And this is for the paid features, of course.

811
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,017
And you should think about.

812
00:45:03,855 --> 00:45:09,761
player perceptions more than the time you spend developing

813
00:45:09,821 --> 00:45:11,903
something or how hard or complex it is.

814
00:45:12,664 --> 00:45:15,266
The only thing that matters is how players perceive it.

815
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:19,130
So remember to make your features visible and to be

816
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,672
perceived as giving high value.

817
00:45:22,994 --> 00:45:24,776
And you need to have a maintainable architecture.

818
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,852
There's probably something here to add on the business

819
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:29,633
side of things as well.

820
00:45:30,153 --> 00:45:31,995
I think that you touched on something that's really

821
00:45:32,015 --> 00:45:35,858
interesting in the sense that we built the company by having

822
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:39,701
a very transparent and open and very close dialogue and

823
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:41,543
relationship with a lot of our fans.

824
00:45:41,603 --> 00:45:42,584
We try to listen to them.

825
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:46,047
We have our forums that have over a million active users.

826
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:51,751
And what's happened over the years is that not only has

827
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,957
a lot more people have come into the Paradox ecosystem

828
00:45:57,217 --> 00:46:00,760
that are not familiar with the games or don't...

829
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,021
Everyone has their different types of stories.

830
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:07,163
So the vocal minority is...

831
00:46:08,104 --> 00:46:11,906
They get a critical mass in their voices.

832
00:46:11,926 --> 00:46:14,168
That's heard in a completely different way today.

833
00:46:14,248 --> 00:46:17,690
And it's heard differently because they also have tools

834
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:18,931
which allows them to get...

835
00:46:19,772 --> 00:46:25,775
hurt. So on one hand, I mean, we're getting a lot of complaints on the DLC model. On the

836
00:46:25,856 --> 00:46:31,098
other hand, we have more people than ever that not only buy the stuff, but they keep

837
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:38,983
buying it. And, you know, we end up with a silent majority that are in the game, enjoying

838
00:46:39,023 --> 00:46:42,645
the features, and not shitposting on the forums.

839
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,338
So there's always this balance of trying to find,

840
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,002
how do we keep in touch with the players

841
00:46:49,122 --> 00:46:50,484
and listen to what they have to say

842
00:46:50,945 --> 00:46:52,186
and balance that out against.

843
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:57,396
what we're doing and what the silent paying majority is doing, because at the end of the

844
00:46:57,456 --> 00:47:00,678
day, they are the people we need to please, because they keep paying us.

845
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,702
If somebody doesn't agree with some of our practices, it's somewhat hard.

846
00:47:06,263 --> 00:47:10,026
There's another interesting point that I think we could make as well.

847
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:15,970
I took the point here, is that I can't stress enough, and I've said it a million times,

848
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,211
but it's really what I love.

849
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,072
It's the business model.

850
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,662
Games that follow these give us a robust protection from

851
00:47:25,462 --> 00:47:26,343
changes in the market.

852
00:47:26,383 --> 00:47:27,563
And I'll give you a good example.

853
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:30,924
When Steam rolled out their refund policy, and for those

854
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:33,966
of you not familiar with it, the Steam refund policy said

855
00:47:33,986 --> 00:47:36,587
that if you played the game for less than two hours, you

856
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,107
could refund it, no questions asked.

857
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:41,048
And this was rolled out without informing a single

858
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,910
publisher or developer, as far as I know, and nobody I've

859
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,370
asked had heard of it before.

860
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:50,637
And they even had a big grace period of six months back, you could just refund anything.

861
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:57,105
If you had a game, let's say you had an indie game that was very narrative and story driven,

862
00:47:57,146 --> 00:48:02,152
you could start and finish it in less than two hours, you were utterly and completely screwed over.

863
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:04,775
by that policy change from Steam's side.

864
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,917
It's ultimately a good policy change.

865
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:10,361
It protects the consumer and makes our positions as gamers a lot better,

866
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,684
but that developer's business model is completely screwed.

867
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,026
And when it comes to a Paradox game,

868
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:19,350
well, good luck getting past the main menu in two hours.

869
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:27,859
So it's a silly example of how the business model or the way

870
00:48:27,899 --> 00:48:31,201
we do things actually allow us a fair bit of protection

871
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,602
from stuff on the outside.

872
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:35,044
I think a lot of us have seen the

873
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:43,090
The image of Mona Lisa being cut into small pieces and they're selling the pieces in separate

874
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:49,833
pieces as an analogy of how games are destroyed today and discrete parts being sold.

875
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:55,015
Pieces that people should be in the game and belong in the game.

876
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:00,237
And I don't want to get into this big discussion about entitlement, but it's something that

877
00:49:00,277 --> 00:49:02,738
we end up thinking a lot about and talking a lot about.

878
00:49:03,178 --> 00:49:04,319
It's also feasibility.

879
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:08,261
If that was true, it would take us 10 years to develop a game.

880
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:11,563
And it would look bad at the time we released it.

881
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:15,485
And ultimately, I think that whenever

882
00:49:15,545 --> 00:49:19,908
we have a good balance between quality of life improvements

883
00:49:19,948 --> 00:49:24,291
that we would give away for free and do screw-ups where we charge

884
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:26,932
for features that feel like they should be in the game,

885
00:49:27,453 --> 00:49:28,573
that's where we get more hate.

886
00:49:28,994 --> 00:49:32,555
But ultimately, I mean, the game is called Crusader Kings, not Muslim rulers.

887
00:49:33,155 --> 00:49:39,877
So I don't feel that necessarily if we charge, if we put that into the kind of Mona Lisa DLC like we described,

888
00:49:40,198 --> 00:49:43,839
that's not necessarily a comparison that I feel is kind of fair.

889
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:48,801
But it's, perception is ultimately reality and I think that...

890
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:55,284
The issue we have today, perhaps, with a lot of people that are upset with the DLC model,

891
00:49:55,384 --> 00:50:02,387
is a lack of us explaining the rationale for why the model exists,

892
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:08,230
and what, ultimately, what kind of additional value they get thanks to this model.

893
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,991
A lot of people might just now simply just not want it.

894
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,058
Other people in the community complain that we just do too

895
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:18,519
much stuff that's nice, and they want everything, but they

896
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:19,180
can't afford it.

897
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,061
And we should stop doing stuff, therefore.

898
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:23,442
But I have a hard time getting behind that argument.

899
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:27,565
Coming back to my original statement about the key metric

900
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:32,028
of having a number in the main menu that tells you how much

901
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:35,390
you spent per hour of entertainment, I think we

902
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,191
should really do it every time the

903
00:50:37,231 --> 00:50:38,211
complaints become too loud.

904
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:40,553
I even argue that we should increase

905
00:50:40,593 --> 00:50:41,273
the price of the game.

906
00:50:42,057 --> 00:50:44,899
And this is, of course, everyone just wants to shoot me when I say this.

907
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:48,140
But arguably, if you bought Crusader Kings six years ago,

908
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:51,422
it's a much, much, much better game today.

909
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:53,603
And we're still only charging 40 bucks for it.

910
00:50:54,003 --> 00:50:56,744
People go nuts when we don't lower the price of the game.

911
00:50:57,505 --> 00:50:58,505
I think we should raise it.

912
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:00,986
It has arguably more value.

913
00:51:01,026 --> 00:51:04,148
And the concept of we should lower the price of things over time

914
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,209
because it's old.

915
00:51:08,675 --> 00:51:09,556
it doesn't hold up to me.

916
00:51:10,117 --> 00:51:11,618
People, I think, look at how,

917
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,220
you know, and this is the reality,

918
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,144
we have to deal with people's and players' behaviors

919
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:19,646
and conditioning through other games,

920
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:22,089
and then they apply that to the lens of our game.

921
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:24,622
And it doesn't really jive to me.

922
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,784
But again, I can't change perception and reality.

923
00:51:27,824 --> 00:51:29,524
I can just try to explain the model

924
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:32,186
and show them how they get additional value.

925
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:34,547
And I can, black and white, show why

926
00:51:34,987 --> 00:51:38,769
we would have never been able to create all this cool content

927
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:42,831
if it wasn't for the fact that we'd created all the DLC.

928
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:45,052
Cool.

929
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:48,714
I don't think we have anything else to add to that.

930
00:51:48,794 --> 00:51:50,575
We'd be happy to take questions.

931
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:03,799
Hi, my name is Carl Henrik.

932
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,064
And two years ago, Johan played me for your coding style.

933
00:52:08,345 --> 00:52:08,945
Sorry about that.

934
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:10,327
I worked with him a long time ago.

935
00:52:11,288 --> 00:52:13,611
My question is, how do you manage

936
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:16,314
QA-ing so many different combinations of the game?

937
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:18,818
So the question is, how do we manage

938
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:21,861
to QA so many different combinations of the game?

939
00:52:23,898 --> 00:52:29,884
well I don't have a perfect answer for you except that our QA department is doing a really good

940
00:52:29,924 --> 00:52:35,549
job. But they have like a smoke test protocol that they go through where they don't exactly

941
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:41,214
try every combination of DLCs. That would be redundant because we're confident enough in

942
00:52:42,015 --> 00:52:48,141
um the architecture that most of them will work together. But they have a protocol for that.

943
00:52:51,207 --> 00:53:15,636
Hi, I'm Oliver. I've really enjoyed Paradox Games over the years. My question is, how do you plan for what you want your modders to be capable of, knowing that some of your community won't have all the expansions, and the modders will probably be assuming you have all the expansions? I know in my own mod work that I just click all the boxes, yes, you must have this, this, and that. How do you plan for that?

944
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,444
All right, so if I understood you right, your question is,

945
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:23,755
how do we plan for modders wanting to use features from

946
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:26,500
all expansions or different expansions?

947
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,801
Well, that's a really good question.

948
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:32,242
We actually talk about it a lot right now.

949
00:53:32,883 --> 00:53:38,246
If we should, for example, have the cosmetic stuff be in

950
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:42,508
the base game, so basically for free, but it's not shown

951
00:53:43,088 --> 00:53:46,050
in the game unless you have the expansion.

952
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,891
So that's one approach.

953
00:53:48,111 --> 00:53:49,612
And I think we're moving towards that.

954
00:53:49,732 --> 00:53:53,734
So for example, event pictures from expansions might be in

955
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:55,755
the patch, in the base game.

956
00:53:56,796 --> 00:54:03,422
but you don't see them. But modders can use them then for whatever mod they want to do. So it's a

957
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:10,409
complicated situation if you will. We don't think further than that at the moment but it's a

958
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:10,889
good question.

959
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:30,056
Hello there. My question is, when working with other developers for titles like Tyranny or Surviving Mars, how do you work with those studios to have their DLC model?

960
00:54:31,724 --> 00:54:36,588
So the question was, how do we work with third-party studios when it comes to the business model and DLC model?

961
00:54:36,608 --> 00:54:44,114
So a bit of insight on how it works. We get about a thousand, I get about a thousand pitches every year and we say no to almost all of them.

962
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:46,736
We end up maybe signing five games per year.

963
00:54:47,757 --> 00:54:51,480
The process that we have, obviously being a niche publisher, ends up saying...

964
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,822
We only do games that are RPG management or strategy games ultimately.

965
00:54:57,162 --> 00:55:02,445
Another factor is that we only work with people who buy into this and think this is a great way of working.

966
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:10,869
We never try to force down IP or business models or culture or way of working with developers.

967
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,771
But what we do is that we explain how we work

968
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:14,972
and why we work that way.

969
00:55:15,352 --> 00:55:17,433
And if that's something that's attractive to people,

970
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,216
they pitch and approach us on the same basis.

971
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:23,417
And we learn from their experience

972
00:55:23,457 --> 00:55:24,198
and try to change it.

973
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,200
So what we do is that we do more or less this talk.

974
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,921
But we do it with each and every developer.

975
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:32,923
And we do it many times over to try to help educate and help

976
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,664
people understand why it's a more.

977
00:55:35,675 --> 00:55:36,858
robust way of doing things.

978
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:39,824
And especially for the development partner studios,

979
00:55:40,305 --> 00:55:43,933
this means that they'll be funded for six years

980
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:44,915
working on a project.

981
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:48,575
instead of making a game and then hope it sells so they can

982
00:55:48,615 --> 00:55:49,095
keep working.

983
00:55:49,336 --> 00:55:52,439
This fundamentally gives more job security

984
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:54,262
to the third party developers that we work with.

985
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:57,325
So hopefully, they think it's an attractive model

986
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:58,266
for that reason alone.

987
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:03,252
But ultimately, we never sign a game

988
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,355
unless it has this potential.

989
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:07,380
There are exceptions.

990
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,761
We published Pillars of Eternity with Obsidian, and

991
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,362
it's a linear narrative story-driven game.

992
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:15,863
And I said, not every game lives up to the pillars

993
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:18,565
perfectly, as the grand strategy games

994
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:19,305
that these guys make.

995
00:56:20,486 --> 00:56:21,606
But we do exceptions.

996
00:56:22,827 --> 00:56:25,187
for the benefit of thinking long term,

997
00:56:25,368 --> 00:56:27,788
we'll be able to make a game that fits the game more.

998
00:56:27,868 --> 00:56:30,369
So Pillars of Eternity, while it doesn't match the pillars

999
00:56:30,409 --> 00:56:32,330
quite perfectly, the second game we

1000
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,091
made with Obsidian Tyranny, we felt

1001
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:37,332
lived up to the pillars more and should

1002
00:56:37,372 --> 00:56:41,053
be able to adapt to this business model better.

1003
00:56:41,473 --> 00:56:43,254
But that didn't quite play out either.

1004
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:46,375
Turns out it's really expensive making RPGs.

1005
00:56:48,936 --> 00:56:49,716
So happy to hear that.

1006
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:50,216
Thank you.

1007
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:50,796
Thank you.

1008
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:53,775
Hi, my name is Rutger.

1009
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:54,795
I work at Abbey Games.

1010
00:56:55,075 --> 00:56:56,596
We also make strategy games, so this

1011
00:56:56,636 --> 00:56:58,757
sounds really interesting to us to be

1012
00:56:58,777 --> 00:57:01,819
able to support the game for longer than we can do now.

1013
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,961
So I have experienced this new DLC model of yours.

1014
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:07,842
I bought Hearts of Iron 4 at launch,

1015
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:10,304
and I bought a few DLCs, the ones I liked.

1016
00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:10,824
Thank you.

1017
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:13,225
And I felt it worked really well.

1018
00:57:13,265 --> 00:57:16,847
But I was wondering how you can deal with, for example, players

1019
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:18,248
that come in late, basically.

1020
00:57:18,628 --> 00:57:20,289
that enter the cycle halfway through.

1021
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:24,413
I have experienced this myself with Europa Universalis.

1022
00:57:24,453 --> 00:57:25,734
I was like, I want to play this game.

1023
00:57:25,794 --> 00:57:27,816
But there are so many things to choose from, and I don't know.

1024
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,621
what to do, basically.

1025
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:30,762
That's a great question.

1026
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:32,904
The question was, so what happens with the players that

1027
00:57:32,964 --> 00:57:35,846
don't get on the train from the get-go when it's just $40

1028
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:37,508
by get into it now?

1029
00:57:37,748 --> 00:57:40,290
Somebody who comes to the Crusader Kings page, and this

1030
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,150
is a really good point.

1031
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:43,693
A lot of the hate, I think, comes from those people

1032
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:45,394
because they're just overwhelmed with what they're

1033
00:57:45,414 --> 00:57:48,036
seeing, because they've been conditioned, again, by other

1034
00:57:48,076 --> 00:57:51,239
games that I'm getting an incomplete experience unless I

1035
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:51,939
buy the other stuff.

1036
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,621
But it's still a car you're getting.

1037
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,262
Leather seats is not a part of the core experience.

1038
00:57:57,702 --> 00:57:58,843
That's the kind of comparison.

1039
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:00,843
And I think that there's an issue there.

1040
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:04,105
And this is something we talk to Steam, too, all the time

1041
00:58:04,165 --> 00:58:08,647
about how can we create product pages that more clearly explain

1042
00:58:08,687 --> 00:58:12,569
to people what is necessary to be able to play the game.

1043
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:15,890
The most common thread I see on our subreddit

1044
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,351
is which expansions are essential.

1045
00:58:18,772 --> 00:58:22,133
And I wish that people said, you don't need to get any of them.

1046
00:58:22,613 --> 00:58:23,273
They're optional.

1047
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,134
And that's the half answer some of the times.

1048
00:58:26,554 --> 00:58:29,555
But clearly, you get a better Crusader Kings experience

1049
00:58:29,755 --> 00:58:30,995
if you buy more expansions.

1050
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:32,156
We design it that way.

1051
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:37,597
But it's a good enough experience at that level.

1052
00:58:37,837 --> 00:58:40,838
So in part, we need to do a better job of explaining

1053
00:58:40,898 --> 00:58:42,439
this in our product pages.

1054
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,780
But another part of it is also.

1055
00:58:48,122 --> 00:58:52,265
you know, and this comes back to the business model, a lot of the times people come to the

1056
00:58:52,305 --> 00:58:56,649
pages when they want to buy a game, and this applies to anything we do, most of the time

1057
00:58:56,689 --> 00:59:01,513
we just, we've consciously made the decision that we want to buy the product. That's the

1058
00:59:01,573 --> 00:59:05,917
main pain of actually making the purchase, we want to talk about psychology. Once somebody's

1059
00:59:06,037 --> 00:59:11,161
made the choice and conscious effort to, that they want to buy the game, what they're then

1060
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:14,905
presented with, which of these different options will give me the greatest value?

1061
00:59:15,688 --> 00:59:18,891
And if you're looking at one that is priced at about $280,

1062
00:59:18,971 --> 00:59:22,654
which is the total of the CK2 DLCs.

1063
00:59:23,325 --> 00:59:26,166
You kind of feel like, I can't afford that, that's too much.

1064
00:59:26,586 --> 00:59:27,947
And you kind of feel like you're losing out.

1065
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:30,488
So there's another layer of psychological pain.

1066
00:59:30,928 --> 00:59:34,050
But we do counter this by having frequent and quite deep

1067
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,691
discounts and sales through promotions.

1068
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:39,392
So that person that comes back and says, holy shit,

1069
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:43,414
everything is 75% off, they're buying that DLC, the total

1070
00:59:43,474 --> 00:59:47,636
package that would have been $300 is much cheaper, but

1071
00:59:47,656 --> 00:59:50,457
we're still making a healthy chunk of change.

1072
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,881
So one more question, they tell us.

1073
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:55,103
But we'll be available for questions outside afterwards.

1074
00:59:55,123 --> 00:59:55,684
Thank you.

1075
00:59:57,085 --> 00:59:58,026
Hi, I'm Scott.

1076
00:59:58,406 --> 00:59:59,527
I have a kind of similar question.

1077
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:03,751
You mentioned the phrase, hard to learn, easy to master.

1078
01:00:04,272 --> 01:00:06,814
Do you worry that with the infinite life cycle that you

1079
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:09,917
mentioned, that problem will just be exacerbated?

1080
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:15,777
You ask so the question was do we think that the games become harder and harder to learn over time?

1081
01:00:16,017 --> 01:00:21,798
Yeah, as you add more and more features even free ones for example. Yeah, well, that's a that's an excellent question as well

1082
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:26,759
And it's definitely true rights, but that's another reason to keep

1083
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,441
To do like faction unlocks and to add new new ways of playing that are

1084
01:00:35,142 --> 01:00:38,482
preferably mutually exclusive with other ways of playing,

1085
01:00:39,163 --> 01:00:43,344
rather than overloading players with oh, so much stuff.

1086
01:00:43,984 --> 01:00:47,625
So if you start as a pagan, it's still a manageable experience.

1087
01:00:48,605 --> 01:00:50,505
And if you start as a Christian, it's also a manageable

1088
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:51,025
experience.

1089
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,686
But when you put all these things together,

1090
01:00:52,946 --> 01:00:55,167
it's a rich game with a lot of different ways to play.

1091
01:00:55,627 --> 01:00:58,348
So I prefer that way of doing things in general.

1092
01:00:59,848 --> 01:01:03,830
And I think that we've gone a little bit too far with the

1093
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,051
stuff we've added to both CK2 and perhaps

1094
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:07,372
even more so EU4.

1095
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:11,313
But you're correct in the fact that it's a greater challenge.

1096
01:01:11,433 --> 01:01:14,394
We need and do put more emphasis on learning,

1097
01:01:14,855 --> 01:01:15,515
teaching at the game.

1098
01:01:15,835 --> 01:01:19,156
The problem is we created Tutorial one time, and perhaps

1099
01:01:19,196 --> 01:01:21,357
the best example of where we failed horribly has been

1100
01:01:21,397 --> 01:01:24,018
Crusader Kings 2, or even Victoria 2, I think.

1101
01:01:24,399 --> 01:01:26,921
where everyone knew that the tutorial was broken

1102
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:29,142
and you couldn't finish it for like a good nine months.

1103
01:01:29,623 --> 01:01:31,624
But we didn't do anything about it

1104
01:01:31,664 --> 01:01:34,547
because that's not how people learn the game.

1105
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,849
They go on YouTube and watch Let's Play series.

1106
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:39,130
So it's been really lazy on our part.

1107
01:01:39,471 --> 01:01:42,553
Yeah, I mean, we've learned to do things properly

1108
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:44,194
with, I think, the Stellaris tutorial,

1109
01:01:44,495 --> 01:01:46,156
which is a huge step forward.

1110
01:01:46,596 --> 01:01:48,818
And that's the way we're going to do stuff from now on.

1111
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,580
As well as in the future games that we do.

1112
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:52,627
Thanks, guys.

1113
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:52,908
Love you.

1114
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:53,791
Thanks so much, guys.

1115
01:01:54,052 --> 01:01:54,293
Thanks.
