1
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:07,704
This is the Digestive Talk.

2
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:09,846
I hope you'll stay with me.

3
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:13,049
If you fall asleep, please don't snore.

4
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:17,574
If you can turn off your sound on your mobile phone

5
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:21,077
and other noisy devices, that would be very much appreciated

6
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:23,379
and we'll jump right in into

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,881
crowdfunding your video game in 2019.

8
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:33,651
My name is Thomas, Thomas Bideau. I'm French. I've been in the game industry for a while.

9
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:39,394
I'm a video game consultant. I consult on a variety of topics related usually to video

10
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:44,016
game publishing. I work a lot on free-to-play, PC, and console games, these sort of things.

11
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:49,539
But I also have crowdfunding addiction. I really like crowdfunding. I'm back.

12
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:55,146
To this date, 279 projects on Kickstarter and a few others

13
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:56,026
on other platforms.

14
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,709
But also, being in the game industry,

15
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,690
trying to make my addiction something useful,

16
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:05,232
I also work with people with a crowdfunding campaign.

17
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:07,373
I started with looking at data, because people were not

18
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:08,454
looking at data for crowdfunding.

19
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:09,575
They were looking at the big projects.

20
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:12,877
So I started to do data mining on Kickstarter,

21
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:17,560
able to provide a 10,000 feet view on the crowdfunding

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,620
state for video games.

23
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,684
And by providing data, I started to look at best practices.

24
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:23,325
People brought me on their project.

25
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:27,090
I've advised about 40 campaigns, most of them video games.

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,874
And I've worked directly into five campaigns, four of them

27
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:32,115
on Kickstarter, one of them on Hulu.

28
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,919
And I've been running workshops helping developers and creators

29
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:39,784
to basically try to make their crowdfunding campaign as

30
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:40,525
successful as possible.

31
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,631
This talk has four parts.

32
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,712
There's the first one is going to be the state of play.

33
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:48,333
How is crowdfunding right now?

34
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:51,854
There's then a part on what kind of projects are right

35
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:53,735
for crowdfunding and try to help you,

36
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:56,116
you know, establish whether or not a crowdfunding project

37
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:58,957
is what a crowdfunding campaign is right for your project.

38
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,058
I'll talk about choosing your platform.

39
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,059
Should be relatively brief.

40
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,760
And then I'll talk about best practices.

41
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,732
And before we go into the state of play,

42
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:13,114
so I love numbers, I try to spend not too much time

43
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,535
on numbers, I try to show like snapshots

44
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:18,096
and give you a sense of where we're at.

45
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:19,117
Sorry.

46
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:22,278
And I'm not going to see much of your hands,

47
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:23,439
but if you can try to raise your hands,

48
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,460
who has run a Kickstarter campaign before,

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,560
a crowdfunding campaign before,

50
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,602
who wants to do something on crowdfunding?

51
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:31,942
Yeah, that's why you're here, good.

52
00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:34,324
Who's not sure, is coming here to get an answer

53
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:35,224
whether or not they should do it?

54
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:38,346
Okay, a few people, excellent, excellent.

55
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,567
Who has never backed,

56
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:41,849
who has never backed a Kickstarter campaign

57
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,011
or any crowdfunding of any sort?

58
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,393
Good, shame on you.

59
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:49,276
So numbers.

60
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,541
I said numbers, yeah.

61
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:56,765
So this data is us crawling Kickstarter every day,

62
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:59,627
trying to see which products work.

63
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,869
This is all about video games.

64
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,951
Kickstarter is very useful to understand

65
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:04,932
the state of play for crowdfunding,

66
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,574
because this is the biggest crowdfunding platform.

67
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:07,534
This is not the only one,

68
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,735
we'll talk about a couple of those later.

69
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:10,297
But it's a very much...

70
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,321
There's so many of the crowdfunding for video games

71
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,443
that happens on Kickstarter that it might as well

72
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:17,865
be all of it here.

73
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,787
It gives you a sense of the numbers.

74
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:24,052
So last year, there was about $15 million

75
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:26,675
that was going through projects that were successfully

76
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,576
funded on Kickstarter.

77
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:29,678
It's a little bit less than the year before,

78
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:30,899
and a little bit less than the year before again.

79
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,521
It's a significant less than 2015.

80
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,803
these numbers are what they are.

81
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,004
There's 15 million, it's 15 million.

82
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:40,304
It's a good amount of money,

83
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:45,266
but it's not comparable to the vast amount of money like

84
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:47,726
big publishers or the industry is putting into video games.

85
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:52,988
But this is still money that comes with a few strings attached,

86
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:57,389
comes with the community and tend to have lots of added value to them.

87
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,030
What's more interesting as well is to look at the number of projects that get funded every year.

88
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:10,533
And if you look at, you know, back to 2011, before Double Fine Adventure kind of like rocked the crowdfunding boat,

89
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:17,075
there's been about, you know, between 350 to 400 projects a year that got funded on Kickstarter.

90
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,656
And what's interesting is that that number has not dropped significantly.

91
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:26,398
We see now about like, you know, a project a day, a video game project a day gets funded on Kickstarter.

92
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:30,802
What's also very interesting is to look at the number of total projects that are submitted

93
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:37,729
on the platform. The number of projects that fail is actually going down. Quick anecdote,

94
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,734
2014, there's a project called Potato Salad that launched on Kickstarter, and that's the

95
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:46,198
reason there's a big spike in low-quality projects that went there. So that's this Potato

96
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:47,620
Salad effect you're seeing it play here with the...

97
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:50,305
huge increase of projects that don't get funded.

98
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:54,830
Now we are back about the same ratio we were in 2013

99
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,671
before Potato Salad.

100
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:58,654
So we are probably in more like the natural state that

101
00:04:58,714 --> 00:04:59,915
crowdfunding should be for that.

102
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:03,579
So a project a day, you probably don't know most of

103
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,642
them, that means that there's a lot of projects that are

104
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,544
below the radar that actually get funded on

105
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:08,505
Kickstarter every year.

106
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:15,660
And last slide on Kickstarter purely, this is about the size of the project that got

107
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,242
funded last year and the year before.

108
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:20,506
So there were about like five projects last year that raised more than half a million

109
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:20,786
dollars.

110
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,209
There was like 25 projects that raised between $100,000 and $500,000.

111
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,651
And like 179 projects raised less than $10,000.

112
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:31,878
Again, this is, I think, useful for anyone who, kind of like,

113
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,018
try to understand, oh, Kickstarter, you will do a million easy,

114
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:39,339
or, you know, or you can't do more than $10,000 on Kickstarter.

115
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,700
These are the numbers.

116
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,620
This is the number of projects every year,

117
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,301
video games that get funded, and how much money they raise.

118
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,421
So, depending on what's your expectation,

119
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:49,382
this might be, like, very distressing,

120
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,102
it might be very good, I don't know.

121
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:53,983
But this is a tool for you to use to understand

122
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:57,503
where you sit in terms of expectation on how much money you can raise.

123
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:04,320
I want to talk very briefly about FIG as a crowdfunding platform that's dedicated to video games.

124
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,941
I think it's interesting to see how much they've performed in the past few years.

125
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:14,547
The first two years of FIG, they raised a significant amount of money, north of 5 million both years.

126
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:21,051
Last year was a low year for FIG. There was less than half a million total across six projects that got funded.

127
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:28,667
So Fig is still a small platform in comparison to Kickstarter for what video games are.

128
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,469
Enough numbers.

129
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,574
Let's talk about the serious stuff. Is your game good for crowdfunding?

130
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:46,200
And there's something you need to understand about crowdfunding is that it's all about love.

131
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:50,304
And it's such an important notion.

132
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,632
You need love to be successful in crowdfunding.

133
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,254
You need people to love your project.

134
00:06:58,076 --> 00:06:59,317
Before I go a bit more into that,

135
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:00,899
there's also a few projects that,

136
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,440
even with all the love in the world,

137
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:05,684
you probably won't be able to crowdfund them.

138
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:08,987
So these are my red flags of any project

139
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,649
that I immediately will say,

140
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,250
you're probably not going to make it.

141
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:18,017
So, so, and if you get the answer you wanted

142
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,659
in those like three slides and want to leave,

143
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:22,040
I won't take it personally, it's all good.

144
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:23,981
So, games for kids.

145
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,423
People don't back games for kids

146
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:29,426
because the time you get between getting the money

147
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,047
and delivering the product, the kid has grown,

148
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:34,170
changes taste, so people don't back games for kids.

149
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,203
Free-to-play games, people don't buy free-to-play games.

150
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:42,068
Free-to-play is the antithesis of crowdfunding.

151
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,690
You play the game first,

152
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,872
and then you decide if you spend money on it

153
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,314
because you played when it was free.

154
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:49,837
Trying to get people to spend money on a free-to-play game

155
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:52,400
before it's even out is very, very counterintuitive.

156
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,304
And the last category is mobile games.

157
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:58,626
This is a bit more complex.

158
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:00,187
I could go into more details about that,

159
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:01,989
but mobile games are very difficult to crowdfund.

160
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:05,511
The average pledge per backer is very low on mobile,

161
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:08,173
makes it more difficult to raise the amount required.

162
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:09,934
The distribution is very complicated.

163
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,716
And just the psychology of people,

164
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:14,498
they tend to back things that they feel is important

165
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:16,039
and something that on a small screen,

166
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,480
people feel like is less important,

167
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,362
so it's more difficult to commit them to back a mobile project.

168
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,880
So it's kind of like the three categories of games

169
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,021
that you probably should not do on crowdfunding

170
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:31,143
and can cause circus.

171
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:35,744
There's a last thing.

172
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:38,205
If there's no love in your game,

173
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,906
and by that, it's not bad.

174
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,888
You can have a game that's very good, but nobody loves.

175
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:45,928
Nobody has a passion for it.

176
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,149
Nobody's kind of like driven by.

177
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:53,789
game is good, I want it to happen. If you don't have love, you will fail. You need people

178
00:08:53,809 --> 00:09:02,174
who actually have an emotional connection to your game that they want to see exist for

179
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:06,977
a crowdfunding campaign to succeed. So there's lots of different ways to look at your game.

180
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:11,100
Is it loveless? But more important is, like, do you have people who know about your game

181
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:14,422
and the people who know about your game, how they feel about it?

182
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,661
Feel keen, interested, curious, or really excited.

183
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,142
You want that last category.

184
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:23,485
And that's all kind of like the green flags,

185
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:24,506
the things that you want to have.

186
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:28,389
An existing community that's incredibly

187
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:29,290
attached to your property.

188
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,191
How many people in the room know about Critical Role?

189
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:34,014
Okay, good, good, good.

190
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,315
You should all check out Critical Role.

191
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:36,355
It's a D&D show.

192
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,077
They've done a Kickstarter campaign.

193
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,238
They have like a month left.

194
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:41,239
They've already raised $7.6 million.

195
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,581
They have 56,000 backers.

196
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,003
And the rewards, if you look at the details,

197
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:47,844
there's not much in the rewards.

198
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:50,266
and people have backed the hell out of it.

199
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:52,567
The average pledge per backer is $130,

200
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,889
and there's pledges that do $25,000,

201
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,530
and every pledge that's limited,

202
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,271
that's more than $1,000, they're all sold out.

203
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,092
They've all been taken.

204
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,453
They have a lot of love.

205
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:08,294
People are passionate about it.

206
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:11,296
There's lots of Tumblr about it as well, which is good.

207
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,258
It's also easier if your project has come like a...

208
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:18,242
a drive behind it.

209
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:20,283
Like, I want that to happen.

210
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:24,507
Whether it's because it's so stupid it needs to happen,

211
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:25,527
or it's missing.

212
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,169
I want like a point and click in the old style

213
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,711
of, you know, Dare of the Tentacle and Magnet Mansion.

214
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,954
I want that game, because nobody else is going to do.

215
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:35,015
It's kind of like a drive.

216
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:38,758
So if this is present, you tick another box.

217
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,279
Like, you're probably going to be

218
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,582
in the right side of crowdfunding friendly campaign.

219
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:52,279
And then you need something that's communicable.

220
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,380
You need something that's easy to understand

221
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,001
and people to share, understand

222
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:57,883
why there's a passion about it.

223
00:10:58,483 --> 00:10:59,964
So yes, you have an existing community,

224
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:01,085
people love your project,

225
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:02,846
but for them to be able to recruit,

226
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,568
they need to be able to bring people to you.

227
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:05,969
I like Superhot.

228
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,792
Superhot is a category of game

229
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,574
that should not work on Kickstarter.

230
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:13,675
It's a first-person shooter.

231
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:15,982
First-person shooters, there's tons of them.

232
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:19,204
Why would I back a Kickstarter about a first-person shooter

233
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:22,146
when I can go to any store and buy the latest

234
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,067
iteration of one of the big franchises?

235
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:29,031
But Superhot has a unique style and a unique concept of,

236
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:34,888
the time moves when you move and nobody's done that and that's so easy to explain. I'll just

237
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:39,670
explain it in a sentence. It's easy to demonstrate just a couple of gifs and then suddenly you

238
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,552
understand the action. On top of that when Superhot launched their Kickstarter they had their

239
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:48,694
prototype from the game jam where the game was initially conceived.

240
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:52,219
And they just share that, and just like, if you don't get it, just play it.

241
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,141
You're like, oh my God, I understand it immediately.

242
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:56,745
That makes it very strong for crowdfunding campaign.

243
00:11:56,986 --> 00:12:00,030
It makes it more easy to be viral, more easy for people to recruit their friends

244
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,935
to support you because they love it and they want more people to support it.

245
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:06,359
So if you're all into the categories,

246
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,182
or if you think you can get into this categories, good.

247
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:13,506
I want to talk about a few projects from last year as well

248
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,949
and to explain a bit more what is a good project

249
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:16,669
for crowdfunding.

250
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,551
So the Good Life is a project I worked on

251
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,796
and that raised a bit more than $700,000.

252
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,581
and it has a unique art style,

253
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:30,063
and it's trying to do something innovative

254
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:31,204
into the RPG genre.

255
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,205
There's no combat, it's all about taking pictures

256
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:36,888
and solving quests by spying on people, maybe,

257
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:39,470
but at least you don't shed blood,

258
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,491
and there's murder mystery,

259
00:12:40,531 --> 00:12:42,152
and then you turn into a cat at night.

260
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:44,934
Like, it's a bit bonkers, it's a bit unique.

261
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:48,137
People also have an emotional relationship

262
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,278
with the games made by Swery, the creator,

263
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:51,960
as kind of like a unique style,

264
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,721
he has a fan base, people care about that.

265
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,251
But for the campaign to be successful, we had to show the game.

266
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,352
Midway through the campaign, we were at GDC a year ago,

267
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:05,214
and things had slowed down, which always happens on a Kickstarter campaign.

268
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:10,575
And we are like, okay, what can we do to basically give it a bit more life?

269
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:15,917
And it was very difficult to convince the studio to share the demo they had.

270
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:19,418
They had a little demo with like three quests they were using for press demos.

271
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:21,039
And we're like, no, it's very, very bad.

272
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,239
It's ugly. It's buggy.

273
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,800
We don't want to share it with anyone.

274
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,938
And so after long discussions, like,

275
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:28,419
if we want the campaign to succeed,

276
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,579
we need to share the game.

277
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,220
We need to give it to people into their hands.

278
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:32,901
And so we did it.

279
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:35,542
And then nobody complained about the quality.

280
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:37,643
Everybody's like, it's exactly what I expected.

281
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:38,324
It's quirky.

282
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:39,104
It's funny.

283
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:40,965
I understand the gameplay about taking the pictures

284
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:41,425
and all that.

285
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,447
And people streamed it.

286
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:44,387
People shared it.

287
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,869
And it was a second life into that campaign.

288
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:48,909
It really made it work.

289
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,451
And so that was very important component to actually...

290
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:58,847
Sometime you let it out and share what it is you are building because otherwise people will not be able to

291
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,048
follow you through a campaign that promises.

292
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:05,031
Another campaign I want to talk about is Iron Harvest.

293
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:06,852
Iron Harvest did

294
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,775
1.3 million dollars last year. It's one of the big campaigns from last year and

295
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:14,978
It's a niche game.

296
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,060
It's a real-time strategy.

297
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,361
We're talking about the drive of people

298
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,262
to support the campaign.

299
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,003
There's not that many real-time strategy games

300
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:22,924
around at the moment.

301
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:27,627
So actually doing an RTS is immediately going

302
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,569
to attract the attention of RTS fans.

303
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:36,249
And then they also choose to partner with a Polish concept artist that's very popular,

304
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,591
that did the art direction for Scythe, a board game that was also very popular.

305
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:43,733
Unique style, unique visuals, unique universe.

306
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:47,874
It kind of like increases, they multiply that attraction that you have for the project.

307
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:50,436
Not only it's RTS, and I wanted to do RTS for a long time,

308
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:55,018
but on top of that it's kind of like it's on universe, it has its own like world that's very attractive.

309
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:57,239
Good, that works.

310
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,180
Top of that, don't ignore that.

311
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,181
They did 1.3 million.

312
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,183
It's their fourth Kickstarter campaign.

313
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,404
They understood really well the environment.

314
00:15:04,484 --> 00:15:06,466
They understood really well their base.

315
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,468
But it's also mean that you can do repeat Kickstarters

316
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,030
and be successful.

317
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,331
You don't have to choose to do one

318
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,271
and then never do it again.

319
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:16,074
Actually, it's a tool they can repeat and get better at.

320
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:23,139
Omno is a campaign from last year as well.

321
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:23,880
They did almost 100,000 euros.

322
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:32,285
Omno's success is very much the success of the single developer behind it.

323
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:37,946
It's a solo dev and he is a former animator and he's very good at animation.

324
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:44,828
He did a lot of prep work on the campaign where he shared his GIF of the game on Twitter,

325
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:49,989
showing people all the things you can do into the game and the animation was really sleek,

326
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:52,410
so the GIF was really sleek and people were really intrigued.

327
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,110
But there's also a story.

328
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,050
People know that.

329
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:59,814
the developers alone so likely truly alone making that game with you know

330
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:02,734
couple of finances for music or a few things

331
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,535
he told the story you didn't say like i'm a studio making a game he says

332
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:11,296
i'm a person alone trying to make that game and i try to make it good and

333
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:15,157
any money i get and will make more time and you know get some help from

334
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:19,077
after parties and to get me to get better and stories important because you

335
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:20,018
create an emotional connection

336
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:24,038
the love on the home those as much as love for the project and

337
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,346
the kind of like support, like the crush you have

338
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:30,347
on that developer that kind of trying to tackle

339
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,269
making a game on its own, and we all know how hard it is.

340
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:45,717
So, I want to talk about a little intermission on timing.

341
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:48,939
2012, Kickstarter explodes, everybody does like

342
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,261
a Kickstarter campaign, and they all work very well.

343
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:55,106
But we're in 2019.

344
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:59,189
And over time, for the past seven years,

345
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,771
people's expectations on Kickstarter campaigns

346
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,231
have changed.

347
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:04,453
The excitement you have of, oh, we

348
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:08,256
can bypass the publishers and give power to the devs

349
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:11,799
and make them very creative is also like, OK, well, maybe we

350
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,860
want to see more of your game to understand

351
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,561
what you are backing.

352
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:18,003
And so we've seen when a game is ready for a crowdfunding

353
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:20,585
campaign move towards closer and closer

354
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,197
production and of production.

355
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:28,701
And 2019 we are very much like you need to be able

356
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,102
to show a vertical slice of the game.

357
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:31,584
You need to show the art direction,

358
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:34,006
you need to show something that looks like the final game.

359
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:38,290
You can fake it, but the closer you are

360
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,771
to what is your real vision,

361
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:41,873
the further away you are in your production,

362
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:42,714
the easier it will be.

363
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,158
Also means that Kickstarter is not really good

364
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,619
for the start of a project anymore.

365
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:54,308
But it's still, you know, an excellent tool to leverage

366
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:57,490
an existing fan base, get more funding into your project.

367
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,451
But it also means that the biggest competitor

368
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:04,412
for Kickstarter on crowdfunding

369
00:18:05,053 --> 00:18:07,173
is not the other platforms, it's early access.

370
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:10,597
And we're talking about what kind of type of projects

371
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:11,919
are good for crowdfunding.

372
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,323
And what happens is that if you have a game that,

373
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:16,186
by the time you have a vertical slice,

374
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:17,949
and maybe you have a short gameplay loop

375
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,774
because it's a very mechanic-driven game.

376
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:23,683
maybe you are ready for early access.

377
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:25,724
And a lot of people, rather than go to crowdfunding,

378
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,325
go to early access and like,

379
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:31,269
why would I spend so much time into building rewards

380
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:33,350
and presenting the campaign

381
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,812
and recruit people to back my game

382
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:38,714
and I've got 30 days of anxiety

383
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,656
when I'm trying to run the Kickstarter.

384
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:43,338
Let's launch on Steam on early access.

385
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:44,239
And that's fine.

386
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:47,761
I think that if you have a project that's of that kind,

387
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,383
maybe go to early access.

388
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,485
It also means that a certain project

389
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:52,746
are not good for all the access,

390
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,387
are the one that also go back to Kickstarter.

391
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:56,188
Anything that you can spoil

392
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:59,631
will more likely go to a crowdfunding campaign.

393
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,372
Like you have a story and you don't want to do any access

394
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:02,413
because then you spoil the story.

395
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,014
Well, maybe you present that story,

396
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,475
the concept of it on Kickstarter,

397
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:08,277
and that's where you raise the money

398
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,277
you need to finish the project.

399
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,062
Good.

400
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:19,505
Where do we launch our crowdfunding campaign?

401
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,345
I was going to be quick because there's not that many platforms,

402
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:29,408
but I'll review quickly what I recommend to people in terms of platform

403
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:31,489
where to launch their crowdfunding campaign.

404
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,213
So if you care about, if you think that the idea of asking money from people

405
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:39,596
for something that doesn't exist yet and them not getting any money back,

406
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:42,498
Fig is for you because, you know, revenue share.

407
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:45,200
They get something back from their investment, some of them.

408
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,362
Some just do like, you know, pre-order the game.

409
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,469
That's one reason to go on Fig, I think.

410
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,331
If you have a huge audience in France,

411
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:55,252
you should go to Uludaí.

412
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,394
You're laughing, you're laughing,

413
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,295
but there's some people who made $1.4 million

414
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,237
on that platform for a video game,

415
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:03,397
and you've never heard of it.

416
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:08,861
So some platform is really good for your very ultra-local

417
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:09,781
campaign.

418
00:20:10,722 --> 00:20:11,883
Most of you are not concerned by that.

419
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,585
If Kickstart is not available in your country,

420
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,849
Indiegogo is not a bad platform to go to.

421
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:20,109
It's more accessible than Kickstarter.

422
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:21,450
That's limited to certain countries.

423
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,911
But if you can, Kickstarter.

424
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:27,132
And it's not about,

425
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,353
Kickstarter is never going to do anything for you

426
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:30,853
in terms of making you successful.

427
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,574
I'm not talking the individual behind Kickstarter,

428
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:35,155
like Luke and Anya from the game team.

429
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:35,975
They will love you.

430
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,075
They will help you as much as they can.

431
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:39,076
But the platform itself, the nature of it,

432
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:40,576
there's no discoverability.

433
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:42,257
This is the discoverability track.

434
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,005
There's no discrepancy in crowdfunding.

435
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:47,446
The people you bring, you bring by yourself.

436
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,727
They can help, maybe put you in the newsletter,

437
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:53,447
products we love, maybe you get some organic traffic,

438
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:56,328
but 90% of the backers, they are your backers

439
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:57,308
you bring to the platform.

440
00:20:57,869 --> 00:20:59,749
And in that sense, you could bring them to any platform.

441
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,870
But the strength of Kickstarter is there's less friction.

442
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,310
People know the name.

443
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,011
The number of people who tell me,

444
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,551
Thomas, we want to do a Kickstarter campaign on Indiegogo.

445
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,248
because in their head, Kickstarter campaign means crowdfunding campaign.

446
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,390
It becomes like, you know, it's like googling something on Bing.

447
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,954
There's less friction. People already have accounts. People already have credit cards.

448
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:22,737
It's just easier. People understand the code.

449
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:26,520
So that makes, that's what makes Kickstarter the best platform for crowdfunding.

450
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:33,446
If you can get more support, excellent, but don't be naive in thinking that...

451
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,604
I'll launch it on Kickstarter and then magic happens.

452
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,366
People find my game and we get funded.

453
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:39,988
That never happens.

454
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,372
I'm very optimistic and nice, right?

455
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:46,714
Killer of dreams.

456
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:49,277
Best practices.

457
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:50,698
So that's the last bit.

458
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:53,681
This is where I give you advice on what makes

459
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,343
your practical advice to make your company successful.

460
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:00,628
It's not about likes, it's about love.

461
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,189
Anything you can do to induce love

462
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,990
on your specific project, do it.

463
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,551
So that kind of like a spectrum.

464
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:11,232
On one end you have like iron harvest,

465
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:13,792
super hardcore military RTS.

466
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:16,453
On the other end of my spectrum, I have a boyfriend dungeon.

467
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:20,114
Like quirky, dating sim, mixing Diablo,

468
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:21,615
dungeon crawling, wacky things.

469
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:26,074
you don't do the same thing to induce love into two different audiences

470
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:29,977
boyfriend dungeon you show like oh here's a body pillow here's like the new weapon

471
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,619
and you know here's the personality of the people you're going to date and here's the wacky thing we want to do

472
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:34,860
on

473
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:37,122
iron harvest end of the spectrum you say

474
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:41,064
oh we're going to do multiplayer and this is the kind of units we want to have

475
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:44,987
and this is the different factions we have and go more into like a nerdy geeky stuff

476
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:46,248
and to paramilitary

477
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:47,929
fantasy

478
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,771
armies and all that kind of stuff

479
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:52,354
But that's the kind of stuff you need to push to your audience.

480
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:54,175
Like, what is it going to tell them

481
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:55,836
that make them love your product?

482
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:57,597
And it's not like a USB thing.

483
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,678
It's going to be like images, going to be like lore,

484
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:00,939
it's going to be like little details

485
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,099
like that you can put into that

486
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,380
that make them care more about your project.

487
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,061
It could be also you. It could be your team.

488
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:07,022
Hey, we are 5, 10, 20.

489
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:08,943
Here's the people behind.

490
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:10,744
Maybe that makes them love you more

491
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:11,784
because it's more human.

492
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,827
The momentum is incredibly important.

493
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:22,444
incredibly important. If you don't have good momentum at the beginning of your campaign,

494
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:30,011
it's so hard to recover. You need 20 percent in the first 48 hours. So if you think you're

495
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:32,554
going to be clever and like, oh, we're going to have like, you know, announcements throughout

496
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:36,537
the whole months of the campaign and we're going to talk about, you know, different elements

497
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:40,441
we put into the game, over time, don't.

498
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:44,578
use as many ammunition as you can at the very beginning.

499
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:46,759
Maybe keep a couple, because it's always good

500
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:47,919
to have a few things up to your sleeve,

501
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,521
but don't use any of the big bullets.

502
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:53,442
Don't keep them for you.

503
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:56,743
Just use everything so that you have the best start possible

504
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:59,185
because a good start will make the campaign

505
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:00,445
overall more successful.

506
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:02,546
There's a corollary to that, you know,

507
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:03,727
20% in 48 hours is like halfway through

508
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:04,347
you have 50% of your funding.

509
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:12,999
Sounds like stupid, but because the pace of a campaign is like a lot of money at the beginning

510
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:16,861
and then very slow and then not many at the end, it's not that actually clear.

511
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:22,624
But we've seen that campaigns that do like 50% midway through were successful in most

512
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:23,124
of the cases.

513
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:28,229
So if you have like a bit of a slow start, but you manage to get to like 50% of the way through

514
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:31,211
You're on the you're on a good way. You are beyond track to be successful

515
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:35,075
It doesn't mean that you need to stop and to keep pushing and keep talking about it

516
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:41,761
You need to ask your fans to keep you know, asking nagging their friends about supporting you, but it's important that you

517
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:45,965
You know that that you are on track and it will it should work

518
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,520
Game needs gameplay and demos.

519
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,841
Talk about that a lot.

520
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:51,921
This is very important.

521
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:54,622
You can't get funded without showing your project.

522
00:24:55,303 --> 00:24:58,084
Like John Romero tried, he didn't succeed.

523
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,825
So do you think you are more successful

524
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:02,306
in terms of having fans than John Romero?

525
00:25:04,026 --> 00:25:04,266
Good luck.

526
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:07,288
Next one, super important.

527
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:09,729
I will just leave it there for like two seconds.

528
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:13,030
This is my number one pet peeve on campaigns

529
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,811
and the number one mistake people make

530
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:16,151
when they do crowdfunding campaigns.

531
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,501
did not announce the stretch goals.

532
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:21,845
It serves no purposes.

533
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:24,950
It changed the people's view about the campaign.

534
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,972
If you ask for 10,000 and the stretch goal is 20,000,

535
00:25:26,052 --> 00:25:27,354
the 20% psychological effect doesn't happen at 10,

536
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:27,935
it happens at 20.

537
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:35,725
so it's very important you get nothing and lots of people do it because what

538
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:37,406
they do is research all the companies and say

539
00:25:37,426 --> 00:25:40,768
all of that's result as a special as well and then they announced it from the

540
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:41,028
beginning

541
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:45,570
actually the company you've seen is finished maybe the announced a special

542
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,991
the beginning this and that's them as they were acting

543
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,134
much better do not announced a special if you have a friend's doing a quick

544
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:54,995
side company the one thing you don't need to not announce a special

545
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,818
you know luncheon begin of the months finish at the beginning of the months

546
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,254
People have payroll, that's good.

547
00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:03,395
It's easier to make the decision

548
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:04,616
to support something you love,

549
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:05,978
and it's a bit like an emotional decision

550
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,061
when you are not like struggling to feed yourself,

551
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:10,902
so it's always a bit better.

552
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,887
I recommend to launch between Monday from Thursday,

553
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:17,868
because you want the first 48 hours

554
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:18,809
to be during the weekdays,

555
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,832
and you want to end between Tuesday through Friday,

556
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,774
because you want last 48 hours to be during weekdays.

557
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,872
It's good to do 30 to 35 days campaign.

558
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:33,056
I think less than 30, you miss one of those payroll cycle.

559
00:26:33,236 --> 00:26:34,797
It also doesn't give the time for a campaign

560
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:35,497
to kind of like spread.

561
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,379
Longer, it's very taxing.

562
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:39,620
30 days is very long when you are managing the campaign.

563
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,341
I understand that.

564
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,663
But I think it's also important to let, you know,

565
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:46,125
the time to go, to get people to talk about your project

566
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:47,786
and share it and care about it.

567
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:51,607
and let the work happen.

568
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,088
And sometime midway through, like, nothing happens.

569
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:54,888
It's very frustrating.

570
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:55,969
But you have a number of people

571
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:57,669
who actually follow your campaign,

572
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,229
who push a little button on Kickstarter,

573
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:01,430
and get an email in the last 48 hours

574
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,810
that tell them that the campaign's about to end.

575
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,811
They're like, oh, my shit, oh, I need to back it now,

576
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:06,531
and they support you at the very end.

577
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:08,532
So actually all that time when nothing happens,

578
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:10,692
there's stuff in the background you can keep an eye on

579
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:13,013
that actually helps you for your campaign overall.

580
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:19,236
Nowadays, like 2019, I think Discord is a very good tool before the campaign,

581
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:23,598
because you can recruit your future backers, your fans, you can engage with them,

582
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:26,779
and then when the day comes, you can align them on Discord and say,

583
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,220
now is the day, back us!

584
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,401
It's good during the campaign to coordinate, like...

585
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:37,128
discussion for them to, oh, how are we going to recruit more backers, you know, where can we talk about the project and have them,

586
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:42,014
you know, be your little army, kind of like talking about you. It's good after the campaign as well to

587
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:47,742
reward them, give them a little like, you know, role into Discord that makes them look unique and also,

588
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:50,745
you know, inform them about, you know, the progress of the game and these sort of things.

589
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,257
I recommend to stream during campaigns,

590
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:57,158
just like sometimes just you talking about the project,

591
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:59,019
doing AMA, showing the game,

592
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:00,019
maybe showing some developments,

593
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,700
like, hey, I'm going to do animation,

594
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,560
I'll show you my rig and I'll show you how it all works.

595
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,921
So it's good stuff to show that you're actually

596
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:07,982
real people working on the real game.

597
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:09,262
It's a good tool.

598
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:12,844
Kickstarter have their own Kickstarter live tool to stream.

599
00:28:13,304 --> 00:28:16,245
It's horrible, but it's useful.

600
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:21,007
So I say try it and see how it goes for you.

601
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,199
I recommend you learn the ecosystem.

602
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:26,100
I recommend people to actually be backers themselves.

603
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,501
So anyone who tried to be, to launch a Kickstarter campaign

604
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:32,241
who never backed a Kickstarter is a little bit counterintuitive.

605
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:34,902
I think you should try to try that by yourself.

606
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:36,642
Understand what it is to be in the shoes of a backer

607
00:28:36,702 --> 00:28:37,923
and understand how it feels.

608
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:40,603
I've met people who actually don't like crowdfunding

609
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:42,324
after they realize that being a backer

610
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:43,424
was a horrible thing for them

611
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:44,844
and that make them like realize

612
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:45,825
they don't want to do that kind of stuff.

613
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:49,386
They were not right in terms of, they couldn't have done a good campaign because they would

614
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:50,866
have the wrong tone or anything like that.

615
00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:52,106
So that's important.

616
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:57,648
You also need to understand the lingo, the number of tools that exist.

617
00:28:58,188 --> 00:29:01,589
That graph I have here is from BiggerCake, biggercake.com.

618
00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:05,170
It's a very good website that have lots of stats on past campaigns.

619
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,951
It's a good tool to understand, oh, I like that campaign.

620
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,012
I think they did a very good job.

621
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:13,793
Try to understand how much money they raised in the beginning and what was the pacing of

622
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:13,893
it.

623
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,133
This is a critical role.

624
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:17,955
Because I like critical work.

625
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:19,595
It's good to spend money.

626
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:20,656
Do advertising.

627
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:24,278
You know, Facebook, Google Ads, maybe.

628
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,139
Don't spend too much money.

629
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:29,760
Kickstarter gives you tools to actually track referral links

630
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,821
and see if the money you spend actually

631
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:32,922
bring money to your campaign.

632
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:35,043
Ask for help.

633
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:37,984
There's no such thing as competition on Kickstarter.

634
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:39,385
All the other Kickstarter campaigns

635
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:41,046
are in the same situation as you.

636
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,993
People who back one campaign are more likely to back two campaigns.

637
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,975
They're not going to say, oh, the other thing is better.

638
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:48,137
I'm going to take my money out of yours and put it over there.

639
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:50,318
There's a lot of goodwill.

640
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:53,521
People who are into crowdfunding and the concept of crowdfunding

641
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:58,004
tend to be very benevolent and very open to look at other things

642
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,365
and support other creators.

643
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:02,447
So don't hesitate to ask for help.

644
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:05,189
Those two updates are from two projects that support each other,

645
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,731
Lunark and Chaindeco's.

646
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:10,493
I just like to say, hey, I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine.

647
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:13,268
And then there's the last slide.

648
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:17,609
I want to talk about failing.

649
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,691
If you fail a Kickstarter campaign,

650
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:22,992
it's not the worst thing that could happen to you.

651
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:25,453
You could have failed launching your game.

652
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:29,274
There's a lot of lessons to learn from failing there.

653
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:31,475
And you should embrace failure.

654
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:34,236
Forest of Liars is a project of a friend of mine.

655
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:35,177
It's beautiful.

656
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,237
He's a concept artist.

657
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:38,838
He has 40,000 followers on Twitter.

658
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:40,819
And then he get funded.

659
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,454
And we had a talk and say,

660
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,495
is it bad?

661
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:47,055
It's like, no, no.

662
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:49,196
You have a very bad start of your campaign.

663
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:49,816
Don't cancel it.

664
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:52,377
Try to understand why you didn't get funded.

665
00:30:53,197 --> 00:30:55,518
Comes up, it didn't show enough of the gameplay.

666
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:56,799
Game is beautiful,

667
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,460
but the game was not ready to be shown in terms of gameplay.

668
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:03,857
And so, there are like lots of fans being disappointed.

669
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:04,618
They were disappointed.

670
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:06,979
But they also created like bonds to that community.

671
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:07,820
They felt together.

672
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,181
And now the game is still in development.

673
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:11,121
They're looking at, you know,

674
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:12,742
maybe doing Kickstarter again,

675
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:14,743
maybe doing other ways to get funded.

676
00:31:15,804 --> 00:31:17,224
But the project is probably better now

677
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,605
because they failed at Kickstarter

678
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:21,126
than if they had not done the Kickstarter.

679
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,067
And that's my closing words.

680
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:25,489
I think I have no question, no time for questions.

681
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:26,049
I'm so sorry.

682
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:27,210
But you can see me afterward.
