1
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:06,235
Okay, first of all, before I begin,

2
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:08,495
could I see a show of hands?

3
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:11,716
How many artists are here?

4
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:12,576
Phew, okay.

5
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:16,357
And how many of you wish you were stood here

6
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:19,458
in front of all these people looking right at you

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,599
at this very second?

8
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:25,960
Yeah, I didn't think so.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,500
So my name's Grant Duncan.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,761
I'm the art director at Hello Games.

11
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:33,862
We're a very tiny little indie studio in England.

12
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:38,165
I'm very aware that I shouldn't be here right now because

13
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:39,626
I'm working on a game called No Man's Sky.

14
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:43,508
And the reason I shouldn't really be here is because,

15
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:45,110
first of all, the game's not finished.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,191
It's always a little bit strange talking about things like art

17
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:49,713
on a title that's not finished.

18
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:53,355
And obviously, the fact I'm here means the game is not getting finished,

19
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:56,398
and so it's getting delayed and all this kind of thing.

20
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,700
I've been to GDC in the past few years,

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,381
and I'm one of those people that always moans about

22
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:06,462
there's not enough art talks, there's too many tech talks,

23
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:07,783
everyone's talking about free to play

24
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:10,144
and all that incredibly boring stuff.

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,725
So when they asked me to come, I couldn't really say no.

26
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:15,746
So I'm gonna talk about No Man's Sky.

27
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:19,827
So No Man's Sky is a science fiction game,

28
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:24,069
and it's all about that kind of feeling of discovery

29
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,889
and about exploring the unknown.

30
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:32,174
that kind of feeling that you had when you were a kid and you'd go to the beach and

31
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:36,475
you'd just you'd be surrounded by sand dunes and you wouldn't know what is over the next hill or

32
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:40,776
you'd find a rock pool and you'd go poking it with a stick and a little crab would crawl out and

33
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:49,859
everything was new and everything was exciting. And it's inspired by fantastic artwork like this

34
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,900
science fiction covers from the 70s and why I love this is because it's not

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,861
you know it's not a great piece of artwork but

36
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:00,639
It's really weird, like, what are they doing?

37
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:01,419
Who are those guys?

38
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:03,640
Is that like some kind of jacuzzi?

39
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,820
I don't really know.

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,981
The perspective's all off.

41
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:10,981
Some kind of blue water, orange mountains.

42
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,902
But it's just, you just wouldn't have this these days.

43
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,343
Nobody would buy a book with this on the cover anymore.

44
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:20,163
If games had this kind of artwork,

45
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:21,763
I don't know if it'd sell many copies,

46
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:24,484
which is a bit worrying since I'm working on a game

47
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:25,384
with this kind of artwork.

48
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:29,209
So I'm going to spend the next few minutes

49
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,810
talking about, just kind of being self-indulgent,

50
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,931
talking about my favorite sci-fi artists.

51
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:36,512
This is a guy called Chris Foss,

52
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:40,274
and this is actually some of the first

53
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:42,255
sci-fi books that I got into.

54
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:43,855
The main reason I got into it is because

55
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:46,557
they had one of these cool three-way covers,

56
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,998
which just means I'm guaranteed to buy all three

57
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:50,338
because of my OCD and I just need to have them

58
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,839
arranged perfectly on the shelf.

59
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,460
Anyone who's played Homeworld,

60
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,159
you'll look at these ships and you'll realize that

61
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,079
they were clearly inspired by the same kind of artwork

62
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,200
that's inspired me.

63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,940
And what's great about Chris Foss is that

64
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,602
he actually began his career as a erotic artwork creator.

65
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,823
I think he worked for Penthouse.

66
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,243
He illustrated the joy of sex.

67
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:15,844
And apparently his understanding of the female anatomy

68
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:19,245
is what's led to him creating such incredible designs.

69
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:24,118
This is a perfect example of sci-fi art.

70
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:26,459
It's like, what even is this?

71
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,540
That's water, is it clouds?

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,981
I don't know, but it's absolutely incredible to me.

73
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:33,042
I can't even imagine what it must feel like

74
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,982
to go to bed after you've just created

75
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,203
that piece of artwork.

76
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:38,244
I don't think I'd be able to sleep.

77
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,685
This is another one.

78
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,405
What I really love about him is,

79
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:45,047
he created this kind of art when everyone else

80
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:46,868
was creating black star fields.

81
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,775
grey, dull, monolithic spacecraft.

82
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:53,437
And he'd created this, and people loved it.

83
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:57,680
And I can't imagine somebody just taking that kind of risk

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,381
and just doing something so different

85
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:01,383
to what everyone else is doing.

86
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:03,825
And I think that's why he's one of my favorite artists.

87
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,867
This is another guy, John Harris.

88
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:10,129
He's a little bit different.

89
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,832
He is quite formulaic in that he'll have,

90
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:15,093
it's always a sort of flat horizon line,

91
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:15,954
but he just has.

92
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:18,706
like the image on the left,

93
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,268
that could be Kenya, you know, those trees?

94
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:23,651
That could work, but then you've got this giant building.

95
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,892
Like, how big is that building?

96
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:25,873
It doesn't even make any sense.

97
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:28,976
The same on the right, like, those people are so tiny,

98
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,397
it's just, and the size of that planet,

99
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,259
it wouldn't even work, but it's just sci-fi,

100
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,780
and it's just beautiful.

101
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,463
And what I like about these is that

102
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,525
these vessels, they could be military vessels.

103
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,807
They're kind of bristling with what could be guns

104
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:42,888
or lasers of some sort, but.

105
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,950
It's the softness that he kind of gets

106
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,150
with his brush strokes and it just...

107
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,392
God, I can't even talk, it's so good.

108
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,013
Like, the green he's using on the left is just,

109
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:56,734
everyone else is using black in space.

110
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:59,975
He's done a giant green space and that blows my mind.

111
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:04,217
Another one who's slightly more unusual,

112
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:06,537
but I think every artist in this room probably loves this guy

113
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:08,958
and we were all gutted when he died a few years ago.

114
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:15,976
but Mobius, he kind of walks that line between science fiction and fantasy.

115
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:20,280
What I love about it is that it's a place you want to be.

116
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,443
So much science fiction, especially in games,

117
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:27,447
they're these horrible post-apocalyptic war zones.

118
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,709
There's not really...

119
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:33,322
Everyone's just trying to kill each other in different ways,

120
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,503
and every game that's set in science fiction universes

121
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,304
seems to be like, you're in this amazing world,

122
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,684
and you can kill each other there,

123
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:42,925
or you're in this spaceship, and you can kill each other here.

124
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,906
There's something about Mobius' work

125
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:46,046
that nobody's killing each other.

126
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,047
They probably could if they wanted to, but they're not,

127
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,828
and I find that quite refreshing.

128
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,249
And things like this, where you've got,

129
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:54,929
they're kind of whales, but they're also sharks.

130
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,330
I don't know if they're underwater, but...

131
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:00,096
It's just filled with questions.

132
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:04,699
You want to know the history, you want to know,

133
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,580
that guy's on a flying duck pterodactyl,

134
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,422
you want to know what they're doing.

135
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:13,624
Those diplodocus snails on the ground,

136
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,646
you want to fly down, you want to understand

137
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:19,408
what those creatures are and what they're doing.

138
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:21,149
And this image is just classic sci-fi.

139
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:25,953
a little man and some kind of giant interesting thing,

140
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,415
and that is just something I've been doing

141
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:29,335
far too much in No Man's Sky,

142
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,216
and getting away with murder.

143
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:33,919
And I didn't really want to include Ralph,

144
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,141
because it's almost too predictable,

145
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:39,903
but you can't pretend that Ralph McQuarrie

146
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:44,225
wasn't a huge influence, like his work on Star Wars,

147
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:46,807
and like X-Wings, TIE Fires.

148
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,189
It's that thing that all great artwork has.

149
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,477
especially art direction wise,

150
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:55,799
where everything fits together

151
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,200
and it just is coherent.

152
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,945
And even though the ships and the universe,

153
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:06,509
they're different and they're not like our universe.

154
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,071
You don't question it, you just accept it.

155
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,072
And this is some of the work that's not as well known,

156
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:16,357
but he just has that same sort of fantasy sci-fi softness.

157
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:23,764
And I think this is actually was one of Ralph McQuarrie's favourite pieces

158
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:28,785
which just has... it could be Earth, but you've got twin suns, you've got a mysterious alien landscape.

159
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:37,988
So to me, science fiction, it's not about war, it's about that feeling of the frontier, that feeling of adventure.

160
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:38,528
It's not.

161
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:44,048
post-apocalyptic, it's exciting, it's full of hope.

162
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:49,772
I also thought Star Trek, even though I've never been a massive fan, it had that, you

163
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:56,356
know, humanity had done okay, we'd managed to get to a place where we just had wonderful

164
00:07:56,356 --> 00:08:01,660
technology and there was wars going on, there were enemies, but as a species we were doing

165
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,602
really well and it was a place you wanted to be.

166
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,062
And another inspiration for No Man's Sky is this book,

167
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,083
which I read when I was a tiny little kid,

168
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,045
and it's great, it's that classic adventure sort of thing

169
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,747
where you've got, if you look at the cover,

170
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:17,527
what are we seeing?

171
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:18,588
We've got Pterodactyl in the sky,

172
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:21,210
got adventurers taking photographs,

173
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,312
we've got Iguanodon in the center there, Stegosaurus,

174
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:25,954
but if you look up in the tree,

175
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:27,475
some kind of wild Tarzan man.

176
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:30,977
The bottom left, we've got angry natives,

177
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,439
and if you look in the very middle,

178
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:35,301
you can see there's like a giant alligator fighting a,

179
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:43,140
some kind of prehistoric fish and I just I love that and it's just

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,704
books like this and movies that came around at the same time, Journey to the Centre of the Earth,

181
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:54,847
adventurers, explorers, going off into the unknown, movies like The Mysterious Island or

182
00:08:54,847 --> 00:09:00,511
Sinbad or The Odyssey where it's even though they're pioneers going to islands there's a

183
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:04,133
definite crossover with sci-fi where rather than going to an island you're going to a whole new

184
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:04,673
planet.

185
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:20,197
Obviously these movies are quite cheesy, they'd have giant crabs and things like that, but it definitely captured that feeling of, especially watching them as a kid, being like, you've arrived at this island, anything is possible.

186
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:22,879
I remember when we first announced No Man's Sky.

187
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:33,648
It was incredible how many developers and artists came up to us afterwards, and they're all saying like, ah, that's the game I've always wanted to be making or

188
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:40,019
I started working on a game a bit like this and it's that thing that we're not pretending like No Man's Sky is this

189
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:46,983
idea that nobody else has ever had because everyone has had this idea. It's just

190
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:52,086
ever since you were children probably if you've been thinking about working on artwork that

191
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:56,909
you'd build a world and then you populate it with your creatures, with your characters and

192
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:01,911
No Man's Sky is the ultimate art project for that. That I can create a planet and I can

193
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:05,986
do whatever I want and that is absolutely terrifying.

194
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:09,289
This is a piece of key art we created quite early on.

195
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:13,153
Hopefully you can see a lot of the influences

196
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:16,236
of what I just talked about, like Ralph McQuarrie,

197
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:18,999
Chris Foss, and all the lost world

198
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:21,641
and the journey to the center of the earth.

199
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,343
Mysterious floating islands,

200
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:24,864
the crescent planet on the horizon.

201
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,146
And we created this kind of artwork.

202
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,746
almost as something we could, as artists,

203
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,828
we can all look at and agree

204
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:36,811
that this is the vibe we're going for.

205
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:40,693
So we wanted that feeling of a world you want to explore,

206
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:43,976
a world that you don't know about,

207
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,997
and a world that has history.

208
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:48,199
It's very easy to kind of forget about history

209
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,661
on a planet that is a jungle,

210
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:54,544
but it's actually really important.

211
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:56,445
Like when we first started creating environments.

212
00:10:57,495 --> 00:11:00,017
you just add trees, rocks, bushes and things,

213
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:03,920
but unless you can see where they came from,

214
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,282
your brain kind of rejects it.

215
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,964
So you have to have little hints that,

216
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:13,248
you know, younger trees, signs of the,

217
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:15,049
like ivy and hanging branches,

218
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:20,594
just all these little hints that it hasn't just popped up.

219
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:22,595
Erosion has been involved.

220
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:24,857
Various sequences have occurred.

221
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:31,038
So with that in mind, the very first thing we did

222
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:34,079
was that we started with Terrain.

223
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,120
No Man's Sky is one of these projects that I can't,

224
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,660
I'd love to take full credit for,

225
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,681
but it is incredibly Coder-orientated

226
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,341
and I have had to work very closely with programmers

227
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:47,622
and since we're a room full of artists,

228
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:48,842
you can imagine what that was like.

229
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,386
But I spent the first year,

230
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,306
because No Man's Sky began as like a little prototype

231
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:56,327
within Hello Games, so there's four of us working on it,

232
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:59,129
me and three coders, and we stuck ourselves

233
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,970
in a little room together and noodled around,

234
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,071
and it started with a terrain engine,

235
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:06,452
which Sean, our main code dude, he was,

236
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:08,433
I shouldn't say dude, anyway,

237
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,994
he was in his bedroom, basically,

238
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:13,255
and in his spare time, he started working as terrain engine.

239
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:17,557
And one of the things we really wanted to do was,

240
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:22,961
really focus on the real world because it's so tempting when you're working on a sci-fi game

241
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:28,745
just to go straight in and make crazy alien landscapes and giant tentacle trees and all

242
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:34,969
this kind of thing which we all love drawing but what we tried to do was look at the real world

243
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:39,692
and understand things like landscape and why things occur and this is why I wish I'd paid

244
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:46,016
more attention to geography because I vaguely remembered all these terms like glaciers and

245
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:51,765
limestone caves and coastal erosion

246
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:54,507
and all these kind of things which I now know

247
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,267
I'm an absolute expert in now.

248
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:58,648
So what we tried to do was,

249
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,289
we're not simulating these things

250
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:03,670
because doing that in real time would be pretty crazy.

251
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,372
What we tried to do is get a similar result.

252
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:13,754
So we have limestone caves, we have lava caves,

253
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:16,155
we have wind erosion, coastal erosion.

254
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:20,498
glacial erosion and volcanic islands

255
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:23,279
At least we have things that appear to be those kind of things

256
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,302
I'm going to show you a little video of our terrain in action

257
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:36,807
So what you're seeing on the right here you have our lodding system

258
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:43,091
So if you watch this is all this terrain is being generated as you're traveling along the ground, so it's not stored anywhere

259
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:47,612
And on the right you can see three levels of LOD.

260
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,014
The top one is the far distance

261
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:50,757
and the bottom one is near distance.

262
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,500
So you'll see things like the little rocks,

263
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,045
little shrubs, they're all in the low LOD.

264
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,467
We're in a debug cam here flying along.

265
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,550
Obviously you wouldn't ever see this in game.

266
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:02,810
But what we can do is we can fly incredibly fast.

267
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,212
And when we do that, you'll see,

268
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,154
because this is faster than you'll ever fly in a game,

269
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:10,555
but you'll actually see the terrain can't keep up.

270
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:13,117
And that's because it's trying to calculate too much at once.

271
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,578
So if you slow down, you'll see that

272
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:15,799
that's like the visible pop,

273
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,060
and that's just the LOD trying to catch up.

274
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:24,384
And this is all created using noise.

275
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:25,285
So it's different.

276
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,284
algorithms that Sean and the code team have created to give this illusion of like a real place.

277
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:37,328
What you're seeing here is like setting it to something really basic which is a sine curve

278
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:42,532
as just an example of actually what's going on behind the scenes.

279
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:46,254
And this is fairly standard stuff in the world of procedural generation like Minecraft is a

280
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:52,539
similar thing but what we have is because we can have overhangs and caves and complex cave systems

281
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:55,161
and it means we can have a lot more believable terrain.

282
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:59,486
things like this, this shows like volcanic,

283
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:02,686
not volcanic, sorry, glacial, so you can sort of see

284
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:05,487
the sort of trademark spiky mountains.

285
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,747
But we can also do, by breaking these rules

286
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:10,408
that we've learned, we can create more interesting terrain,

287
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:14,528
so we can have floating islands or mysterious crystals,

288
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:17,989
and it's quite fun to play about with.

289
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:21,210
And the way we do things like textures,

290
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,090
we'll build a huge library of these.

291
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,730
This is,

292
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,217
in Zbrush we'll have tiling materials

293
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:30,579
and we can spit out height maps from that

294
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:31,059
and I was like

295
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:33,881
really proud of this system and I was talking

296
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:35,243
to Andrew from Naughty Dog

297
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,745
the other day and he was like, oh yeah we did that in

298
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:39,306
Uncharted 1 and I was like, oh okay

299
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,147
so maybe it wasn't that clever. But what it means

300
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:41,888
is we can have

301
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:46,251
cliff faces and we can have sand on the ground

302
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,693
and when the angle's correct

303
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:49,774
you'll get sand pooling in the cracks

304
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,876
and the mountains and it adds this

305
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,257
real believability to the world.

306
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:57,855
We have hundreds and hundreds of these materials

307
00:15:57,855 --> 00:16:01,577
and we can blend between them and we can tag them

308
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:03,859
to say how dense they are and how likely they are to erode,

309
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,521
which means we can create things like plateaus

310
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:08,982
and overhangs and that's all based on

311
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:13,145
how dense the material is and depending on how dense it is,

312
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:17,008
it'll kind of pick, it'll have different specular values

313
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:20,891
and have different, it's a good way to explain.

314
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:23,012
Essentially, it'll have finer detail if it's more dense.

315
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:30,258
So we had this system for creating all these different looking terrains with all these different materials,

316
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:37,103
but that wasn't really enough because that didn't get across that lost world, Journey to the Centre of the Earth vibe,

317
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:42,547
which they always had those kind of, you'd go to an island and it would always have something interesting,

318
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,468
interesting foliage, interesting jungles.

319
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:51,173
And especially once the guys started to talk to me about procedural generation and...

320
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,125
I was the only artist working on the game at the time,

321
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,727
and we were obviously, it was early days,

322
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:56,928
so they were experimenting,

323
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:59,991
and they started to use 64-bit seed values,

324
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:04,235
which meant that they could do 18 quintillion unique planets,

325
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:05,997
which was very scary to me at the time.

326
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:10,642
So there's four artists now, so it's not as scary.

327
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:14,886
But obviously, as an artist,

328
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:21,226
had to figure out a way of how you divide up 18 quintillion planets between four of us.

329
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:25,510
And that was quite a big task. So it turns out you have to be very methodical.

330
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,813
You have to divide things up. You have to become a little bit of a robot.

331
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:36,500
And the reason for that is without constraints, you just end up with a real mess.

332
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,281
So we kind of added our own constraints.

333
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:41,222
by dividing these things into different categories

334
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:44,883
so that we could actually tackle small problems at once,

335
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:47,184
because if we tried to think about everything all at once,

336
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:47,904
we probably would give up.

337
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:51,286
So, one of the things at the very beginning

338
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:54,947
we thought about doing was that we were gonna divide up

339
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:57,288
the kind of foliage system into biomes,

340
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:01,909
which is the way games like Minecraft and...

341
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:09,858
loads of different games do it. It's the equivalent of like playing Sonic where you have like a fire level, you have an ice level, you have a

342
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:14,523
you know a jungle level, but so you'd fly down to a planet and this one would be like a

343
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:18,286
sort of alpine, sort of coniferous forest kind of planet.

344
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:22,650
And so we're gathering lots of reference from the real world, again the logic being that

345
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,311
if we could...

346
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:29,398
mimic the real world and get the rules to be in that sort of believable universe, then

347
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:34,461
at the very end, or towards the end, we could do really fun things, break those rules and

348
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:40,464
get all the alien variation from that. So we had like woodland, which would be deciduous trees and

349
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:45,467
that kind of thing, which is more like Britain, which is what I'm used to, although it's normally

350
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:50,990
a lot greyer than that. And there's your jungle level, this weird little bird guy.

351
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:55,140
And this would be like a Sahara desert type planet,

352
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,201
or more like your American Nevada deserts

353
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:03,224
with your cacti and your harsh, spiky terrain.

354
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:06,005
Swamp planets, Dagobah, they're always good.

355
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:11,048
But what we found, by creating those sort of biomes,

356
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:12,868
those separate biomes that you'd...

357
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,697
human beings are really, really good at spotting patterns.

358
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,360
So you'd fly down to a planet and it would be a swamp planet and you'd go,

359
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,303
oh, it's a swamp planet. And instantly that breaks this illusion

360
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:27,426
and you just realize what's going on behind the scenes.

361
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:33,531
And the thing with video game artwork is so much of what we do is an illusion.

362
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:37,114
Like, you know, especially linear games where you can look out a window and you

363
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:38,535
can see a mountain in the distance but...

364
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:45,191
we all know that you can't get to that mountain and as artists work in the industry everything

365
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:52,355
we do is you know where it's all pretend and we don't want anybody to see behind the scenes

366
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:58,439
and having those separate biomes it absolutely revealed that and our game is so

367
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:02,121
it's incredibly important that you don't get that sense of illusion.

368
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:05,585
So what we ended up doing was

369
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,566
creating what I call a super biome,

370
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:13,008
which is a biome which covers all those biomes

371
00:20:13,008 --> 00:20:14,749
in one fell swoop.

372
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:17,690
And it's, what's a good way of explaining it?

373
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,391
If you imagine a,

374
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,352
if you've ever used like a terrain generation tool

375
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,032
where you'll have lots of different sliders

376
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:26,553
that control different things like

377
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:27,594
spikiness of mountains, trees,

378
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:31,435
we have that, but we have hundreds of different sliders.

379
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,824
and we have min and max values for all those different sliders,

380
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:39,088
but I don't have to go into every planet and manually move those sliders.

381
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:41,111
What happens is when a planet is terraformed,

382
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:43,574
those sliders are moved to different positions.

383
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:46,498
Now, originally those positions were random,

384
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:49,322
but what we found really interesting is if you...

385
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:54,252
start to link those sliders to things within the universe like

386
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,854
distance from a sun, whether the planet has a moon or not,

387
00:20:56,854 --> 00:21:03,820
then the results start to become believable and you start to spot patterns,

388
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,763
but it's patterns that you accept because you start to realize like,

389
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:10,245
oh, this planet's really close to the sun,

390
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:15,669
so the foliage is either going to be non-existent or it's going to be,

391
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:18,231
it's just not going to be very green.

392
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:19,472
And that's...

393
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:21,507
where the believability comes into it.

394
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:25,450
And another thing from looking at the real world

395
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,392
is I realized that our planet is a very strange place.

396
00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:32,856
Like these in the Philippines, they're called the Chocolate Hills.

397
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:36,659
There's a really cool folklore about this, which is

398
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,221
apparently two giants had a really big fight

399
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,844
and they were throwing boulders at each other

400
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,605
but then they made up and they walked away

401
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,126
but they forgot to take their boulders with them

402
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:46,968
and that's where the Chocolate Hills came from.

403
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:54,647
Angkor Wat. If you've ever been to Cambodia and seen these it's it is like something H.R. Giger

404
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:59,951
would make with these weird tentacle-like roots destroying the old ruins. I don't know how you

405
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:07,857
pronounce that, Guilin in China which are again a lot of these are natural formations and it does

406
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:15,743
make sense from a geography point of view but when you see them it's just it is like an alien landscape.

407
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:21,712
And I love these acid pools.

408
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:24,755
I've used two images because it absolutely blows my mind

409
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:26,736
that it's a real place.

410
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,398
And the conclusion from these images

411
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,400
is something we kind of realized quite early on,

412
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,743
that we don't actually need to go full alien.

413
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:40,046
We could actually just mimic the real world

414
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:43,329
and we get absolutely incredible spectacle

415
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,190
just from doing that.

416
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,631
At the Giant's Causeway in Ireland.

417
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:48,716
this has got a good folktale as well.

418
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:52,398
Apparently, there was an Irish giant and a Scottish giant,

419
00:22:52,398 --> 00:22:55,379
and I think it was the Irish guy

420
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:56,600
slagged off the Scottish guy.

421
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,301
So what happened is the Irish guy

422
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:01,061
started to build this causeway

423
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,522
because he was gonna go and beat him up,

424
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,963
and the Scottish guy started to do the same thing,

425
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:07,264
and they've actually got two examples of this causeway

426
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,105
either side of the channel.

427
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:13,386
I don't know who won, but I imagine it was the Scottish guy.

428
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,919
What we wanted to do was

429
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,081
create a few key concepts that would

430
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:25,801
capture the vibe of this

431
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:27,622
lost world, this no man's sky.

432
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:30,702
And if anyone's seen the video

433
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,623
we released years ago now,

434
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:34,984
the E3 video where you walk down

435
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:36,764
to the watering hole and the antelope run away,

436
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:39,825
this was the piece of key art that kind of influenced that.

437
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:44,177
These are real quick sketches, but

438
00:23:44,177 --> 00:23:45,998
all trying to kind of get across the vibe

439
00:23:45,998 --> 00:23:51,420
that we wanted to have each time you fly down to new planets.

440
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,861
And what this did, it gave us

441
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:57,382
targets, it meant we could

442
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,503
tweak things like slider values

443
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:01,503
to try to make these kind of

444
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:02,544
events more likely.

445
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:09,026
And you'll see they all, well, a lot of them have this kind of

446
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:11,172
these landmarks.

447
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:14,453
And we always wanted to have that sense that you fly down,

448
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,093
there's always something on the horizon

449
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:16,853
that draws you to it,

450
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:18,474
rather than just being a dull terrain,

451
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:20,394
there's always something you see that you want to go to.

452
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:23,395
And obviously that's fine,

453
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,136
having all these nice little pictures,

454
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:30,737
but actually getting that with a procedural system

455
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,798
has been probably the most challenging thing.

456
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:35,398
I should mention this project has been by far

457
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,439
the hardest thing any of us have ever done.

458
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:41,056
And if you're thinking about doing a procedural game,

459
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:42,297
I probably wouldn't, it's really difficult.

460
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:44,999
I was trying to, I did a talk on Monday

461
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:48,660
and I was surrounded by people much better than I am,

462
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,623
like Neil from BioWare, and I was asking him

463
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:56,625
if he might consider taking the strength of BioWare

464
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,827
and maybe creating some procedural tools

465
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:02,208
for the rest of us to use so we don't have to create

466
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,589
them all ourselves, because it's just too much work for us.

467
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:07,411
So procedural white-boxing, I'm getting distracted,

468
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:11,433
the idea being that you have props that get placed in a terrain,

469
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:14,275
just like any time you decorate an environment.

470
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,958
But because it's procedural, you don't necessarily know

471
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,620
what those objects are going to be,

472
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,703
because they get created procedurally.

473
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:24,284
So what we do is we...

474
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:28,688
like, we know that procedural props will be within a certain

475
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:31,510
scale or will have a certain silhouette,

476
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,112
and that's how we kind of control it.

477
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:33,652
So when we...

478
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,971
procedurally white box like this,

479
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:41,012
it means, even though these aren't props,

480
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:42,813
these are just rough versions of it.

481
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:46,114
It means when we're balancing min, max values,

482
00:25:46,114 --> 00:25:49,715
we kind of get a vague idea of what it might look like.

483
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,676
So if I was loading this environment

484
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:55,198
and replacing all these props with real procedural props,

485
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:57,799
they'd kind of roughly fill those shapes,

486
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,580
and it means we can ensure it's more likely

487
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,681
to look artistically pleasing.

488
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:07,902
and talking about procedural props,

489
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:10,944
we use our blueprint system to create these.

490
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:11,404
So it's not,

491
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:15,565
talking to, I've been talking to a few artists

492
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,046
over this, over the past week,

493
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:22,228
and they're all really interested in procedural artwork,

494
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:25,849
but also very skeptical of it, understandably so,

495
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:28,890
because a lot of the way it's presented

496
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,831
on the internet, I think, is just this magic button

497
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:33,152
that you click, and then artwork pops out.

498
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:38,423
But that's, and I imagine some people do that,

499
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:40,384
but that's not how we do it.

500
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:46,266
It's still incredibly artistic driven,

501
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:49,066
and it's, your procedural artwork's only as good

502
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,047
as the base template that we create.

503
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:52,867
I'm gonna talk about that.

504
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,228
So this is a tree trunk.

505
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:57,128
And this is the blueprint system.

506
00:26:57,128 --> 00:26:58,989
Adds a type of branch.

507
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,834
it then adds a type of leaf.

508
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:07,737
It then selects a bark type and a leaf type,

509
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:13,302
and it is then decorated to match the environment,

510
00:27:13,302 --> 00:27:16,844
and it is then skewed to be different.

511
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,387
And then we can see it for a different version

512
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:22,289
where we take the same trunk.

513
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:25,468
a different set of branches is selected,

514
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:27,049
different leaves, different texture,

515
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:27,729
and different shape.

516
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,850
And essentially, every single prop in the game

517
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,011
is created like this.

518
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:33,713
And what you're seeing here is,

519
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:35,934
in the same way I talk about the train

520
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:39,877
having all these different sliders,

521
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:41,578
we have the same for trees.

522
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:45,260
So all that's happened here is it's gone.

523
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:47,523
I'm going to add some branches.

524
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:48,704
How many branches shall I add?

525
00:27:48,704 --> 00:27:50,486
Select it based on a slider.

526
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:51,607
What kind of leaf am I going to have?

527
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:52,748
Select that based on a slider.

528
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:54,369
So these are just two examples,

529
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,210
and that's just one type of trunk.

530
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,072
We have hundreds of kinds of trunks

531
00:27:58,072 --> 00:28:00,333
and thousands of different leaves

532
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,594
and hundreds of different bark types.

533
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:06,678
And the way it feels is that we're actually,

534
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,382
if you've ever played like World of Warcraft,

535
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:11,103
where you load up the game and you spend

536
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,964
the first 10 hours fiddling around

537
00:28:12,964 --> 00:28:14,965
with the character creation, just scaling

538
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:16,526
bones, moving decals.

539
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:19,047
We have that, but for every single prop

540
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,428
in the game, so it's all based on this

541
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:23,089
set of parameters that we custom

542
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:23,950
make for each thing.

543
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,111
And what's cool with that as well

544
00:28:27,111 --> 00:28:29,072
is that we can have

545
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:30,813
what I'd say here about the age of a prop,

546
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:31,413
but that's...

547
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,327
I hate the word proper.

548
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:34,728
It can be the age of anything.

549
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:36,710
So we can have trees, and you can say,

550
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,493
you know, if you want a tree to be within a certain age,

551
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:42,195
you know that the trunk will be thinner,

552
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,396
it'll have less branches,

553
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:45,218
and the same with a creature,

554
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:47,840
you know that the head stays roughly the same size,

555
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,143
the body will be smaller, the legs will be shorter,

556
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:54,166
and it means you can very easily have

557
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,868
like a whole flock of sheep,

558
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:57,869
and you can have...

559
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:01,180
adolescence, you can have babies, you can have

560
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,222
grown adults, and it's...

561
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:06,385
I don't have to custom make those, all I have to do is say

562
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:09,808
when you spawn a group of sheep, you should spawn

563
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:12,230
you know, 10 adults, 15 adolescents, and it knows

564
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,592
because you tell it the min and max values of those

565
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:16,955
that it'll just create them and that

566
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,258
adds to the believability of the world.

567
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:23,172
This is a blueprint system on the trees.

568
00:29:23,172 --> 00:29:26,173
So what you see on the left here is just all the variants,

569
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:28,034
and on the right, you essentially see

570
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:28,915
what is currently picked.

571
00:29:28,915 --> 00:29:31,716
This is just an in-game tool we have for viewing variants.

572
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:33,717
So I click on View Variants,

573
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:35,618
and it creates a load more on the left,

574
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:38,320
and you can see the currently selected one on the right.

575
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,681
This works for plants as well.

576
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:40,681
Every plant in the game,

577
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,262
you see all the variation on the left.

578
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:44,703
I can cycle through them.

579
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:53,193
And the way that's possible is,

580
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:55,635
when I was talking about turning yourself into a little robot,

581
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:57,235
that's kind of what I had to do.

582
00:29:57,235 --> 00:30:00,277
So we just have a system for creating

583
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,158
as many kinds of trunks as we can.

584
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:04,439
I mean, that's essentially what it is.

585
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:05,940
It's just we do as many as we can,

586
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,242
and just try to change the silhouette as much as possible

587
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,682
to get as much variation as possible.

588
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:14,844
So we'll have trunks, branches, leaves,

589
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:17,886
different materials, and various extras that we can add on,

590
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:19,406
like fungus, moss.

591
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:24,095
and each one of those small extras adds to the variation.

592
00:30:24,095 --> 00:30:26,896
This is an example of some of the alphas

593
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:30,498
we create for leaves, and these are really cool

594
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:31,979
because you can just create as many as you want

595
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:33,620
and it's amazing the impact it has.

596
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:40,424
Now what you're seeing here is

597
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,025
an example of the blueprint system.

598
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:45,527
What I'm showing here is exactly the same planet.

599
00:30:46,332 --> 00:30:50,695
but all I've tweaked is the seed value of the trees.

600
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:52,216
So you're stood in exactly the same place

601
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:54,078
and I've just clicked view variants and it's moved,

602
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:56,280
it's just changed the type of tree.

603
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,021
And here you can see it again.

604
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:02,825
And what this is showing is that even if we weren't

605
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:05,026
to change the terrain at all, if we weren't to touch

606
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:07,448
mineral colors or anything like that,

607
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,391
you can still get a very different feeling planet

608
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:11,952
just from changing tree shapes,

609
00:31:11,952 --> 00:31:14,294
which to us was really amazing because

610
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:19,873
One of the number one, the number one thing people seem to worry about is how you make

611
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:25,154
every planet feel different and the moment we started to fiddle around with those kind of

612
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:32,176
values it made us all feel a lot calmer. This is a video that's showing a few of the worlds.

613
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:32,876
Hopefully it'll work.

614
00:31:46,023 --> 00:32:04,309
Please, like and subscribe.

615
00:32:55,537 --> 00:33:00,779
Yes, this is a message I got from one of our coders at Christmas time.

616
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,322
It's always nice.

617
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:08,843
Yeah, this is the Milky Way, which is our galaxy.

618
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:13,025
It's a spiral arm and we're somewhere in there.

619
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,245
That's quite a scary thought.

620
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:20,768
So what I'm going to talk about is our galactic map or our in-game galaxy.

621
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:28,418
It's a really strange thing to talk about because this game more than any other game I've ever worked on

622
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:33,200
It's been quite an educational sort of process because like I was saying about geography and things like that

623
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,982
I've never as an artist. I didn't really pay a lot of attention at school. I was very interested in what I was interested in so

624
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:46,665
Making it when having to do galactic artwork has meant I've had to Google things like spiral arms and

625
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:50,106
it's really really scary and

626
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:56,327
I don't know if any of you have read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

627
00:33:56,327 --> 00:34:00,650
but it mentions something which is called the Total Perspective Vortex.

628
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,613
And the story goes something like this.

629
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:08,976
So there was a scientist, and he had a loving wife,

630
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:11,217
but his wife used to nag him a great deal.

631
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:17,001
And she would always just pull him up on these really...

632
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:23,169
small, insignificant, at least in his eyes, little things.

633
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,671
So he thought like, if there was any some way

634
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:27,732
I could show her how unimportant

635
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,214
these things she's moaning about are.

636
00:34:30,214 --> 00:34:33,416
And being a scientist, he thought, I know what I'll do.

637
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,018
I'll invent a machine that she can put on.

638
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:41,602
And what that machine can do is in a split second,

639
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:44,164
it will show you the entire universe.

640
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:49,192
and it will, at that same split second,

641
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:53,934
show you in comparison to the entire universe.

642
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:56,535
And I imagine it's something a little bit like

643
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:59,136
a canoculus rift, you'd put it on.

644
00:34:59,136 --> 00:35:03,158
And he turned it on and it destroyed her brain.

645
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:05,859
So that was our main kind of inspiration

646
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:06,880
for our galactic map.

647
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:13,510
as well as cool things like the Pillars of Creation,

648
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,511
which I think is an awesome title.

649
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:17,934
This is the Eagle Nebula, which is also really cool.

650
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:21,677
Spaces filled with really cool things.

651
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:22,718
This is a little video.

652
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:24,159
So I should mention, like,

653
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,381
one of the things I've tried to stay away from

654
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:29,003
in No Man's Sky is the color black.

655
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,605
And that was one of those bold things I said

656
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:33,266
at the very beginning of the project.

657
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:36,269
Chris Foss, he uses colors, you know, none of this black.

658
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:39,081
But when you're trying to do a star field

659
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:40,142
and you're staying away from black,

660
00:35:40,142 --> 00:35:43,084
it becomes this real weird challenge

661
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:45,045
because it stops feeling like you're flying through space.

662
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:46,366
It's really easy for it to feel

663
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:47,567
like you're flying underwater.

664
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:50,910
So finding images like this of the Pillars of Creation

665
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,413
was really useful to me because it's still obviously space,

666
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:56,094
but it's colorful.

667
00:35:56,094 --> 00:36:01,778
So this was a massive, a really useful image when I found it.

668
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:02,559
Oh, wrong one.

669
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,681
So what you're gonna see here is

670
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:12,551
every single one of these little dots is a solar system you can fly down to and that's

671
00:36:12,551 --> 00:36:16,395
until you play the game it's not obvious you just have to keep that in mind.

672
00:37:04,828 --> 00:37:05,429
Boom, the end.

673
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:06,951
Spaceships.

674
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:11,355
So you can't really make a science fiction game

675
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:14,038
without thinking about spaceships at some stage,

676
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:18,782
so I thought I'd talk about it straight after that.

677
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:21,445
I asked Aaron, who is one of the artists I work with,

678
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:23,287
he is an incredible artist.

679
00:37:23,287 --> 00:37:27,511
He's one of those guys that lives and breathes

680
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,153
hard surface modeling, and so.

681
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:35,458
I asked him if he could, he's the main guy, he's responsible for all our spaceships basically in the game, I can't take credit for those.

682
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:40,602
I did like the one in the prototype video, but he has taken those and he has done amazing things.

683
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:47,926
So I asked him to put together an image that showed what he was thinking when he was designing spaceships

684
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:54,170
and he thought he would use Comic Sans in his image.

685
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,432
So, I was going to take it out, but screw him, it's his problem.

686
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:03,389
What we're seeing here is we have three types of ships

687
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:04,829
that you can get hold of in the game.

688
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:06,310
So we have trading ships, fighter ships, and explorer ships.

689
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:09,071
And essentially, you can pick any of those ships,

690
00:38:09,071 --> 00:38:15,134
whatever you want, but certain ships are more useful.

691
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:17,896
If you want to be a trader, then you're going to get a ship

692
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,517
that has a bigger cargo hold and is more armored,

693
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:23,839
and fighters generally are smaller and nippier,

694
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,900
and explorers are weird and scientific.

695
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,240
So...

696
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,142
This image just kind of shows some of the inspiration Aaron took from various places.

697
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:33,542
Let's get away from that Comic Sans.

698
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:37,845
One of the things he was saying is

699
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:42,828
it's absolutely impossible not to tread on some toes when you're designing spaceships.

700
00:38:42,828 --> 00:38:45,089
Like we get so much stick online of just being like,

701
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,591
oh they've just copied an X-Wing or they've just copied a Viper.

702
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,153
And it's like you should try to create a spaceship and not tread on some toes.

703
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:52,173
It's absolutely impossible.

704
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:54,155
But the way we've tried to do it is to...

705
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:57,651
kind of look at a lot of the World War II planes

706
00:38:57,651 --> 00:38:59,832
because they have that sort of chunky style

707
00:38:59,832 --> 00:39:00,892
which is something at Hello Games

708
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:03,813
we've always been real fans of.

709
00:39:03,813 --> 00:39:07,634
These are some of the early concepts of the fighters.

710
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:10,274
And it's an interesting thing with procedural systems

711
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:12,875
because we could if we wanted

712
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:16,735
make spaceships completely procedural and unpredictable

713
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:18,956
but when we were doing that we found it made

714
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,818
As an artist, sometimes people talk about things like gameplay,

715
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:27,481
and gameplay is something that's been created to make art worse,

716
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,383
so we have to listen to these guys,

717
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:31,785
and then we make our art worse, and it makes the game better,

718
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:34,928
and people are happy.

719
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:39,451
So we have fighters, and we have dropships,

720
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:40,873
and we have explorer ships,

721
00:39:40,873 --> 00:39:44,596
and the problem we had is when they're entirely procedural,

722
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:46,972
you couldn't really tell the difference between them.

723
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:48,533
So although they are still procedural,

724
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:51,375
we just have a set of rules, so we, with fighters,

725
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,516
even though they're all different ships,

726
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,738
you can kind of tell there's like a similar vein.

727
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:57,280
They'll have like two wings, and they'll have an engine,

728
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,281
and they'll have a cockpit, and they'll have a nose,

729
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:02,364
and all that is is like a set of constraints

730
00:40:02,364 --> 00:40:05,846
that means the end result is recognizable

731
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:07,027
and readable for the player.

732
00:40:07,027 --> 00:40:09,729
You can see some more examples here.

733
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:15,492
And this is like the in-game blueprint view.

734
00:40:15,492 --> 00:40:19,875
It's the same system as all the trees and things.

735
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,738
You can see all the variation on the left,

736
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:23,839
the main one on the right.

737
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,382
I click on view variants.

738
00:40:27,382 --> 00:40:30,785
We can also have procedural decals.

739
00:40:30,785 --> 00:40:32,786
These are the dropships.

740
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:35,449
And you'll see they have a different set of rules.

741
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:38,311
They don't have the same engines, they don't have noses.

742
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,372
But it means you get like...

743
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,611
very readable shapes.

744
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:43,372
Like even on the left,

745
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:45,293
even though they're all very different ships,

746
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:47,693
you know they're drop ships, you know they're traders.

747
00:40:47,693 --> 00:40:52,095
And what it means is when you're flying through the galaxy

748
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:53,775
and you see a ship flying along,

749
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:56,996
you can very quickly understand what kind of ship it is

750
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,897
and that was hugely important

751
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:01,158
from a gameplay point of view.

752
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,778
The same with freighters,

753
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:04,759
we don't need to have as much variation within them,

754
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:06,520
but they're all procedural as well.

755
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:10,031
And because we have factions within the game,

756
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:12,512
they can all be linked together really easily.

757
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:15,934
We can have certain shapes that are more likely

758
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:18,936
to be used in certain factions.

759
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,677
We can have certain decals, symbols.

760
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:21,598
Same with space stations.

761
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:23,699
Space stations can be procedural

762
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:24,659
and they can be linked to the factions,

763
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:28,522
which is really cool fun to play around with.

764
00:41:28,522 --> 00:41:29,562
Also, we have creatures in the game.

765
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:33,345
I'm just gonna drink some water.

766
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:34,605
I don't think we actually have camels,

767
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:36,406
so that's a false advertising there.

768
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:40,133
And it's the same at the beginning.

769
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:43,015
We started to, as I was in full robot mode,

770
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:45,516
I thought I'll try to categorize creatures

771
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:49,219
to what kind of environments they might inhabit.

772
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:51,480
So, snow creatures.

773
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,481
But as I was going through this process,

774
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:56,263
the same way, the same revelation,

775
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,605
which everyone else would probably just immediately know,

776
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:00,346
but was news to me,

777
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:06,249
there's some really crazy creatures on our planet.

778
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:06,770
And like.

779
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:12,750
These creatures could easily be in a sci-fi movie

780
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,931
and you would just accept it.

781
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:18,672
Like, if you're always gonna reveal

782
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:20,393
the protagonist in the game,

783
00:42:20,393 --> 00:42:21,814
this is who you actually play as in No Man's Sky.

784
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:22,774
So another thing I discovered,

785
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:31,378
even though I'd been a character artist for many years,

786
00:42:31,378 --> 00:42:34,079
I'd made loads of creatures and rigs and whatnot.

787
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,111
in looking at skeletons because essentially what we

788
00:42:38,111 --> 00:42:39,932
when we were breaking things up and dividing things up we

789
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,734
looked at the real world looked at those photos from earlier and said

790
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:48,137
we would we want to have creatures that are a bit like a deer or a bit like a

791
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:51,699
rhino and in doing that like immediately obviously

792
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:56,161
when we're thinking like that we're limiting ourselves but

793
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:59,443
luckily i'm really glad i did i have this really big

794
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:03,325
anatomy encyclopedia at work and i was flicking through it and

795
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:08,858
I was literally about to start building a rig when

796
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:14,420
I think I just randomly flicked between dog and cat.

797
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,941
And I discovered that dogs are basically cats.

798
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:19,041
See?

799
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:21,222
Isn't that interesting?

800
00:43:21,222 --> 00:43:24,382
Dogs are also horses.

801
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:26,283
Horses are pigs.

802
00:43:26,283 --> 00:43:27,803
Just a bit more bent over.

803
00:43:27,803 --> 00:43:29,404
Pigs are sheep.

804
00:43:29,404 --> 00:43:31,164
Lions are red pandas.

805
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,801
and Red Panda's triceratops.

806
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:37,762
So,

807
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:39,802
that might seem like nonsense,

808
00:43:39,802 --> 00:43:41,003
but I'm sure I had a point.

809
00:43:41,003 --> 00:43:45,664
So, the point is that if you would have a system

810
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,164
where you could move bones around

811
00:43:47,164 --> 00:43:50,685
and lengthen bones and tweak bones

812
00:43:50,685 --> 00:43:52,086
without having to redo a rig,

813
00:43:52,086 --> 00:43:55,746
then you could make all those creatures on a single rig,

814
00:43:55,746 --> 00:43:57,527
which for, you know, BioWare,

815
00:43:57,527 --> 00:43:58,627
they wouldn't bother doing that.

816
00:43:58,627 --> 00:44:00,328
They'd just throw a thousand artists at them

817
00:44:00,328 --> 00:44:01,328
and create all the creatures, but.

818
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:06,647
we don't have that luxury so we had to come up with a system for

819
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:10,588
being able to create all these creatures and have them show rigs

820
00:44:10,588 --> 00:44:14,468
and that involved, I can't take credit for this either, we have a very clever

821
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:18,209
guy called Charlie who has created this beautiful IK system

822
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:22,250
which means we can pull joints around, we can completely push a

823
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,251
rig to its absolute limits and the IK system compensates so you know

824
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:29,012
I can do terrible things to a rig and make it look absolutely hideous but the

825
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:31,612
creature will still somehow find a way to traverse the terrain.

826
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:38,439
So that meant we knew we could have these shared rigs.

827
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:41,081
So when we're designing creatures, suddenly,

828
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:43,502
again, I talk about how we added constraints to ourself,

829
00:44:43,502 --> 00:44:46,745
but we kept doing this where we'd add a constraint

830
00:44:46,745 --> 00:44:48,246
and then suddenly the coders would find a way

831
00:44:48,246 --> 00:44:49,366
of avoiding that constraint.

832
00:44:49,366 --> 00:44:51,228
And we're like, ah, I was quite looking forward

833
00:44:51,228 --> 00:44:52,909
to just creating this small set of things,

834
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:55,250
but suddenly it all blew up and we could be like,

835
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:58,012
oh, it turns out that a warthog can have the same rig

836
00:44:58,012 --> 00:44:59,693
as a duck-billed platypus or a frog,

837
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:02,996
which is great because it means we get all this variation,

838
00:45:02,996 --> 00:45:04,137
but it's also just.

839
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,363
As an artist, I'm a complete control freak,

840
00:45:07,363 --> 00:45:10,084
and having that kind of power,

841
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:11,605
yeah, I just wanted to get back in my little box

842
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:12,565
and kind of curl up.

843
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:17,268
So these were, yeah, I'm just getting ahead of myself.

844
00:45:17,268 --> 00:45:18,489
These are like some of the concepts

845
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:22,191
which we kind of created to, as like,

846
00:45:22,191 --> 00:45:23,091
in our Blueprint system,

847
00:45:23,091 --> 00:45:26,493
where we have built like a base template.

848
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:27,914
As I was saying, that base template

849
00:45:27,914 --> 00:45:30,275
needs to be really, really good, otherwise.

850
00:45:31,237 --> 00:45:34,137
it is the foundation on which all the generation is built.

851
00:45:34,137 --> 00:45:35,438
So if you have a bad template,

852
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:37,138
then all the creatures you create will be bad.

853
00:45:37,138 --> 00:45:39,179
So we have to be really careful at the very beginning

854
00:45:39,179 --> 00:45:41,679
to plan exactly the kind of variation

855
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:43,500
we want to get from a rig.

856
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,121
This is the whale slash shark slash water eel

857
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:51,802
alien crocodile rig.

858
00:45:51,802 --> 00:45:54,602
And this is a little blue dude.

859
00:45:54,602 --> 00:45:57,523
This is our blueprint system for creatures.

860
00:45:57,523 --> 00:46:00,904
So you have the base template and it gets skewed.

861
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,462
It then selects type of ear, tail.

862
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:05,603
It selects the texture.

863
00:46:05,603 --> 00:46:08,244
This is, again, like the tree,

864
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:12,245
just one possible version out of thousands

865
00:46:12,245 --> 00:46:15,206
or however many hundreds of thousands we want.

866
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,707
Then you get skewed.

867
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:20,648
This is the bone scaling where you can pick any silhouettes.

868
00:46:20,648 --> 00:46:21,649
That's real fun.

869
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:27,771
And this was, like, once we got this system working,

870
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:30,012
it was absolutely amazing because

871
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:35,213
Suddenly we were populating these worlds with, even when we only had a single rig,

872
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:38,136
and they were being spawned on every planet, suddenly you were flying down to a planet and

873
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:42,380
I wouldn't know what I was going to see, and it was unpredictable, and

874
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,144
I'd never had that before, because as an artist you normally know exactly what you're going to see.

875
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,122
And these are like some of the Zed brush,

876
00:46:49,122 --> 00:46:52,085
because we have a system where you can create normal maps

877
00:46:52,085 --> 00:46:53,386
that we can blend between,

878
00:46:53,386 --> 00:46:56,269
a bit like how some AAA games,

879
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:57,850
they'll have wrinkles and things

880
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,371
that they can blend on and off.

881
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:04,656
We have a similar thing for scales or muscle groups.

882
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:05,717
I'll show you a little video

883
00:47:05,717 --> 00:47:07,658
of the Blueprint system and the creatures.

884
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,482
So what you see here is, again on the left,

885
00:47:11,482 --> 00:47:12,523
you've got the variation.

886
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:15,989
We've got the parameters set to be within a small amount,

887
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:17,990
so you'll see when I click View Variants,

888
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,712
it'll be similar looking creatures.

889
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,273
So, you know, the scale is roughly the same size.

890
00:47:21,273 --> 00:47:24,315
It's not a million miles away from what it was before,

891
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:26,877
but we can change the values, which I'll do in a second.

892
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:30,240
And so yeah, that's a slightly fatter version,

893
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,382
but if I change the scale, put it right down,

894
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:35,384
then you'll see a very different looking creature, hopefully.

895
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,290
There we go.

896
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,931
So that's exactly the same rig,

897
00:47:39,931 --> 00:47:42,172
but hopefully you'll also notice it,

898
00:47:42,172 --> 00:47:44,253
it chooses a different animation

899
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:45,933
depending on what type of creature it gets.

900
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:47,834
So you've got a cow, it knows that

901
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:49,255
because it's a heavier creature,

902
00:47:49,255 --> 00:47:50,716
it's gonna use a slower walk.

903
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:52,496
And if I can tweak the scaling there,

904
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:54,177
so you can see I've made him

905
00:47:54,177 --> 00:47:56,158
with really skinny little back legs

906
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:58,059
and really heavy forelegs.

907
00:47:58,059 --> 00:47:59,920
But hopefully what it's demonstrating,

908
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,660
and you can get robots,

909
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,461
you could have robots in a sci-fi game.

910
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:05,502
What it's demonstrating is that you're getting

911
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:07,163
an awful lot for a very little.

912
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,203
It's a shark dude, a little alligator.

913
00:48:13,203 --> 00:48:15,045
And the next guy I really like.

914
00:48:15,045 --> 00:48:18,268
This is like our unicorn guy.

915
00:48:18,268 --> 00:48:20,610
Unicorn whale.

916
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,952
And his attack animation,

917
00:48:21,952 --> 00:48:23,653
he has like a little happy face.

918
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:29,199
So at this stage we have.

919
00:48:30,668 --> 00:48:32,589
All those creatures, you're clicking view variants,

920
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:34,249
you're getting very different looking creatures

921
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:36,230
with the trees, you're clicking view variants,

922
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,570
you're getting lots of different looking trees

923
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,970
and plants and the terrain.

924
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,131
We're talking about those sliders

925
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:44,371
and each one has a min and max.

926
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:46,432
But, so imagine you've got a planet,

927
00:48:46,432 --> 00:48:49,672
you've clicked on random, basically it's just picked,

928
00:48:49,672 --> 00:48:54,393
you know, that antelope creature has picked

929
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:57,414
the unicorn whale and it's picked pink trees

930
00:48:57,414 --> 00:49:00,115
and it's picked like bluegrass.

931
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:05,353
it's all gonna... well I know for a fact it looks absolutely disgusting when you have that

932
00:49:05,353 --> 00:49:08,734
and that's why I'm referring to when I say procedural suit because if you don't try to

933
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:14,657
control that you'll end up with a real ugly mess and I think that is what as artists we get terrified

934
00:49:14,657 --> 00:49:19,159
with procedural stuff because generally you don't have any control so you're just click... you're

935
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:22,881
just randomly hoping that the result you get is a pleasing one.

936
00:49:24,216 --> 00:49:26,897
So the way we kind of get around this is,

937
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,418
again, I wish I could do it all myself,

938
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:31,920
but I work with some really talented guys and girls,

939
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,583
and it wasn't a pleasant experience,

940
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:39,284
but there's a lot of back and forth.

941
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:42,226
We work together, teamwork, it's always rosy,

942
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:45,208
and there's never any arguments, and we all agree,

943
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:46,929
and we all do what's best for the game.

944
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:49,990
But essentially what happens is,

945
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,572
we'd implement a system, we'd load up the game,

946
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,192
and I would be.

947
00:49:54,307 --> 00:50:01,170
offended with my eyes would bleed and I would then paint over and try to stop whatever was happening

948
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:07,293
and then what would happen is the co whoever's working normally Sean like I've known Sean for

949
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:12,135
like I've worked with him for seven years now and we have a very healthy relationship so we don't

950
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:16,337
mess around I just say sure let's do shit let's change this and what he's really good at is

951
00:50:16,337 --> 00:50:20,139
looking at what I've done and then he makes me a better artist he says

952
00:50:20,994 --> 00:50:23,015
Why have you done this in a paint over?

953
00:50:23,015 --> 00:50:24,116
Why have you done that?

954
00:50:24,116 --> 00:50:27,798
And there's some artists who are really good

955
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:28,899
at knowing what they're doing,

956
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:31,741
whereas I've just always been a little bit more gut driven.

957
00:50:31,741 --> 00:50:34,142
I just do things because I think they look nice,

958
00:50:34,142 --> 00:50:36,324
but being a robot man like Sean is, he thinks.

959
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:38,496
Why are you doing this?

960
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:40,316
And I think, I don't know, because it looks nice.

961
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:42,756
And what he was really good at doing was saying,

962
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:45,617
well, oh, so you, I notice you've put like bushes

963
00:50:45,617 --> 00:50:46,537
around the base of that tree,

964
00:50:46,537 --> 00:50:48,338
or you've put little rocks and things like that.

965
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:49,798
And I'm like, yeah, of course, that's what you do

966
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:51,318
when you're doing environments and games.

967
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:52,999
And so what all he does is, well,

968
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:55,239
why don't we just tweak the environment system

969
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:58,500
so that every time you place a tree, then it does that.

970
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,940
And so it's, that's like a really simple example

971
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,761
of just like one of the little rules we have is,

972
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:06,421
it's all these tiny little rules and systems

973
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:06,862
that.

974
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:13,053
basically make it more likely for the procedural result to be like something I would have painted.

975
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:19,558
Whether that's a good thing or not is for you to decide. We also have rules when it comes to

976
00:51:19,558 --> 00:51:27,163
things like shapes and we talk about believability like say like a sort of swamp environment that's

977
00:51:27,163 --> 00:51:29,224
been when the planet's been terraformed it'll have...

978
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:36,007
it'll have generated this climate and ecosystem and again based on all these nice little universe

979
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:41,130
rules like how far away from the sun or just the minerals and the soil and that's all just

980
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:46,713
like nice little controllable factors but what happens is we know that certain we can tag certain

981
00:51:46,713 --> 00:51:50,855
types of leaf and tree and branch as being

982
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,272
matching to a climate.

983
00:51:54,272 --> 00:51:57,695
So essentially what that means is on a swamp planet,

984
00:51:57,695 --> 00:52:00,097
you will get swamp leaves and swamp branches.

985
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:03,260
That sounds like it's limiting, but it works over

986
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,120
a huge number of things.

987
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,362
And it means that that can also get filtered

988
00:52:06,362 --> 00:52:07,904
through to creatures.

989
00:52:07,904 --> 00:52:10,046
So in a sort of damp environment,

990
00:52:10,046 --> 00:52:11,968
you're going to get these more cold-blooded,

991
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:15,110
sort of waxy, damp-looking creatures.

992
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,132
And also some of the color from the environment will...

993
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:22,474
leak through to the creatures so there'll be natural camouflage and in the same way we can

994
00:52:22,474 --> 00:52:27,936
have the opposite of that where we can add in props that are complementary so they'll stand out and

995
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:35,699
that's that's when the real fun begins. And what I love talking to Sean about is how objects get

996
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:40,720
placed on a terrain and I know for a fact this is something

997
00:52:41,188 --> 00:52:43,609
that anyone who's ever worked with procedural generation

998
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:46,490
with a terrain will know exactly what I'm talking about.

999
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,450
When you place objects using noise,

1000
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:52,632
humans just know there's something not quite right.

1001
00:52:52,632 --> 00:52:56,112
So what we have is like a clumping system.

1002
00:52:56,112 --> 00:53:00,714
And it means that things get placed

1003
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:01,614
in a more pleasing way,

1004
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:04,235
which means that they understand shape, and they will...

1005
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:08,258
add a large prop and they'll place medium props

1006
00:53:08,258 --> 00:53:11,020
and small props and it will kind of gradiate down.

1007
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,642
And every environment artist does these kind of things

1008
00:53:14,642 --> 00:53:17,103
but setting the rules, it meant we were guaranteed

1009
00:53:17,103 --> 00:53:20,825
for that kind of thing to happen.

1010
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:22,806
Another thing I had to do was,

1011
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:24,707
this is a teach color theory to a robot.

1012
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:26,328
I just love that idea.

1013
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,990
Essentially, it's a bit like having a junior artist

1014
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,531
when you're working on procedural technology

1015
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:32,871
but it's a junior artist who is,

1016
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:38,691
like the worst, he's a complete idiot and you can't teach him anything, he just doesn't listen.

1017
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:45,553
So you have to be absolutely rigid and just, it's a bit, I remember I was talking to another guy

1018
00:53:45,553 --> 00:53:52,415
and he said that he found that when he did tutorials as an artist, that it made him realise

1019
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:58,297
why he made the decisions he did. And in doing this, I've had a similar experience that there's

1020
00:53:58,297 --> 00:53:59,718
all sorts of decisions I make.

1021
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:01,889
that I just did automatically,

1022
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:06,170
but in having to implement these rules,

1023
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,490
it meant that I was understanding

1024
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,311
why I was doing what I was doing.

1025
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:13,292
So we have, like materials have different palettes.

1026
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,732
So you'll have like, which I can define.

1027
00:54:15,732 --> 00:54:19,093
And so there's no random colors.

1028
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:21,674
You can have hue variation, but I can still say,

1029
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:23,874
if I want to say dirt is always one color,

1030
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:25,395
I can absolutely do that.

1031
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,155
But obviously in doing that,

1032
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:29,116
dirt would then be the same color in the entire universe

1033
00:54:29,116 --> 00:54:30,256
and that'd be really boring.

1034
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:34,995
but it means that I can control things like,

1035
00:54:34,995 --> 00:54:36,236
I can say what color fur is,

1036
00:54:36,236 --> 00:54:37,477
and I can say I want,

1037
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:40,798
when you have a creature that has scales,

1038
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:42,979
I want the markings to be a complementary color,

1039
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,301
I want the underside of certain creatures

1040
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:46,221
to always be lighter,

1041
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:49,443
and it means you don't get this horrible garish mess.

1042
00:54:49,443 --> 00:54:51,984
And I can do the same with trees,

1043
00:54:51,984 --> 00:54:53,665
and we have a tagging system,

1044
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,566
so everything is linked together,

1045
00:54:57,566 --> 00:55:00,148
so the color of the grass,

1046
00:55:00,148 --> 00:55:01,528
the color of minerals and soil,

1047
00:55:02,078 --> 00:55:06,561
will all filter through to the trees and the props

1048
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:09,023
and it just means it all feels coherent.

1049
00:55:09,023 --> 00:55:12,445
And this is our view of our little colored droids

1050
00:55:12,445 --> 00:55:15,127
that we send down to every planet

1051
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:18,109
because when you've got this many planets,

1052
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:20,211
I can't personally fly down to every single one

1053
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:24,354
and decide whether I like the color of the grass or not.

1054
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,675
So we have these little dudes that fly down,

1055
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:28,176
they spit out animated GIFs for me.

1056
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:29,858
I can then, and it puts it online,

1057
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:30,658
so I can then go and...

1058
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:33,270
look at it at my leisure and I can

1059
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,033
click on the image and get a seed value and then fly down.

1060
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:38,455
What it means is I can balance colors

1061
00:55:38,455 --> 00:55:40,317
like a god from above and tweak them and then

1062
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:43,520
send out my little minions.

1063
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,885
And all this stuff, all it means is it's a way for me

1064
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:52,408
to control the output and it means I can link things

1065
00:55:52,408 --> 00:55:54,850
together and the results are something like

1066
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:55,731
I would create myself.

1067
00:55:57,425 --> 00:55:58,886
And hopefully you can see here,

1068
00:55:58,886 --> 00:56:00,527
we have a tagging system for props,

1069
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:04,530
so you can see that the trees in style and color and shape,

1070
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,291
they kind of match the shapes you see on the ground.

1071
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:10,914
Even the creatures, you'll see their markings

1072
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:13,876
and the colors, they're all linked to the environment,

1073
00:56:13,876 --> 00:56:16,218
so everything just feels like it belongs.

1074
00:56:16,218 --> 00:56:18,779
And you can see the sort of clumping system

1075
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:19,920
with the complementary colors,

1076
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,321
where you've got the blue against the orange

1077
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:22,242
and you've got the green sky

1078
00:56:22,242 --> 00:56:24,463
and objects placed around cave mouths.

1079
00:56:24,463 --> 00:56:26,264
Like I haven't placed any of these props,

1080
00:56:26,264 --> 00:56:26,485
but.

1081
00:56:27,347 --> 00:56:31,654
Hopefully it doesn't look too procedural.

1082
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,936
And we get some really cool bugs.

1083
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:36,722
I'm trying to think of the best example I can give is,

1084
00:56:36,722 --> 00:56:38,806
like I was fiddling around with this.

1085
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:43,357
I wanted to create these little hippos that were spawned in caves, just as like a little

1086
00:56:43,357 --> 00:56:44,177
experiment.

1087
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:48,980
When I say hippos, it just means like a mammal-type creature that's within a certain scale.

1088
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,701
And I know that.

1089
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:52,443
And I could set it to have like a bulbous sort of nose.

1090
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:55,164
And so I'd done this on my PC, and I thought, cool, that's quite fun.

1091
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:57,346
I'll just check it in, and just, you know, we'll decide on it later.

1092
00:56:57,346 --> 00:57:03,270
And then one of the guys, he'd obviously got latest, and he'd loaded up the game, and he'd

1093
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,031
gone into an underwater cave.

1094
00:57:05,031 --> 00:57:07,112
And obviously I forgot that.

1095
00:57:07,777 --> 00:57:12,220
at that stage in time, caves were the same

1096
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,543
whether they were above water or underwater,

1097
00:57:15,543 --> 00:57:18,045
so he'd swum around the corner and been,

1098
00:57:18,045 --> 00:57:23,149
to his surprise, found like 200 hippos

1099
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:25,491
just splashing about in the water.

1100
00:57:25,491 --> 00:57:27,993
And that's the butterfly effect.

1101
00:57:27,993 --> 00:57:29,514
I can tweak tiny little things

1102
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:32,917
and it has this crazy, crazy effect,

1103
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:33,797
which is really scary.

1104
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:34,558
And I'm gonna show a final video,

1105
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:36,039
which hopefully shows all those things off.

1106
00:59:02,938 --> 00:59:03,398
Yes.

1107
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:03,478
Yes.

1108
00:59:03,478 --> 00:59:21,626
So, I've been told to remind people to fill out the little judgment cards, but you can

1109
00:59:21,626 --> 00:59:24,107
forget if you're going to give me a bad remark.

1110
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:29,529
But if anyone would like questions, then I think there's a little microphone.

1111
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:31,030
I don't know how much time we have, but yes.

1112
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,322
In creating all these procedural systems,

1113
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:37,604
you talked about creating the art cohesiveness rules.

1114
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:40,987
How did you incorporate things like gameplay concepts,

1115
00:59:40,987 --> 00:59:45,710
like threat level, or difficulty, or strength,

1116
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,390
or things like that?

1117
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,432
How did you incorporate those kind of concepts

1118
00:59:48,432 --> 00:59:49,152
into that same system?

1119
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:52,875
So we have things like, so the question was,

1120
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:55,897
how do we incorporate gameplay elements like threat

1121
00:59:55,897 --> 00:59:57,859
into a procedural system?

1122
00:59:57,859 --> 01:00:00,901
And through our tagging system, we can.

1123
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:06,172
Like when we create like generated props, things like horns and spikes

1124
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:09,115
on things like creatures, then we know

1125
01:00:09,115 --> 01:00:13,979
like scale values. So if a horn, for example, gets above a certain size

1126
01:00:13,979 --> 01:00:17,502
we can say a creature becomes more dangerous. And what it means is

1127
01:00:17,502 --> 01:00:20,825
when you see a creature you can kind of predict

1128
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,966
how dangerous it's going to be.

1129
01:00:22,582 --> 01:00:23,883
just by the way it looks.

1130
01:00:23,883 --> 01:00:25,624
So like the more ferocious the larger

1131
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:27,145
and the more spikier a creature is,

1132
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:28,506
the more likely to be dangerous it is.

1133
01:00:28,506 --> 01:00:30,067
But we can also play with that

1134
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:31,489
and have like a little fluffy white bunny

1135
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:32,750
and have him be really dangerous,

1136
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,892
but you just don't know.

1137
01:00:35,892 --> 01:00:35,972
Hi.

1138
01:00:35,972 --> 01:00:40,856
I had a couple questions about your production pipeline,

1139
01:00:40,856 --> 01:00:42,017
like for your art assets.

1140
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:42,337
Yep.

1141
01:00:42,337 --> 01:00:42,978
Kind of really unique.

1142
01:00:42,978 --> 01:00:48,142
So when you guys were doing R&D for your proceduralism

1143
01:00:48,142 --> 01:00:50,503
and all the different things that you guys were trying out,

1144
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:55,931
So you guys have multiple rigs, you have multiple geometries?

1145
01:00:55,931 --> 01:00:56,432
Yes, we can.

1146
01:00:56,432 --> 01:01:00,793
And so do you guys, how much do you guys rely on like blend shapes and morph targets?

1147
01:01:00,793 --> 01:01:02,574
Like you guys blend in different normal maps.

1148
01:01:02,574 --> 01:01:04,595
Can you talk about that a little bit?

1149
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:05,135
Yeah. So we have...

1150
01:01:05,135 --> 01:01:13,038
The thing with procedural systems is you almost want to have as much flexibility as possible.

1151
01:01:13,038 --> 01:01:19,060
So we do have entirely generated systems where the artist has no control

1152
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,081
and things like UVs are automatically generated.

1153
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,411
and textures are automatically applied.

1154
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:26,252
But what we do is if the result isn't good enough,

1155
01:01:26,252 --> 01:01:29,594
that's when we'll start adding in handmade assets.

1156
01:01:29,594 --> 01:01:32,815
And like you were saying, we have blend shapes.

1157
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:35,176
And because we have bone scaling and bone positioning,

1158
01:01:35,176 --> 01:01:37,437
it means we don't actually have to have

1159
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:38,458
too much different geometry,

1160
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:41,359
because it just kind of works by pulling it around.

1161
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,101
And we'll, with normal maps.

1162
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:50,532
we create as many different ones as we want for like a creature and often that's just things like

1163
01:01:50,532 --> 01:01:55,214
muscular or bulbous and we can blend between those or scaly and

1164
01:01:55,214 --> 01:02:04,396
We found you don't actually need to create that many to get the variation. But the more we do the the better it becomes

1165
01:02:04,396 --> 01:02:05,797
Is that cool? Thanks

1166
01:02:05,797 --> 01:02:06,477
Hi. Oh, sorry. What?

1167
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:08,878
Oh, time's up. Sorry. Um

1168
01:02:08,878 --> 01:02:12,379
If you want to ask me more questions, I'll be in room

1169
01:02:12,379 --> 01:02:14,119
2002 we can chat there if you want

1170
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:20,173
Cool, thank you very much everyone.

1171
01:02:20,173 --> 01:02:21,255
Yeah, yeah, I will.

1172
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:21,896
Okay.
