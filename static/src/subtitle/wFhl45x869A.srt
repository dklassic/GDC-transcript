Hello, I'm Nick and I made a game called Move or Die.

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:07,018
It's a four player friendship ruining game and it turns out it's objectively considered successful.

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:11,920
Now, I'm going to have a talk at this exact GDC about why Move or Die was successful

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,361
and how we managed to still sell copies even though it came out two years ago.

5
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:18,102
Now, here's a bunch of things that happened since the game came out.

6
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:22,783
We made an infomercial update and we actually bought a hotline number so players could leave us voicemails.

7
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:26,924
We managed to convince the creators of Rick and Morty to let us use their characters in our game.

8
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:29,185
Some people tried to sell our business cards on eBay,

9
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:32,806
and we ended up collaborating with several hardware companies for cross-promotion.

10
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:35,226
A Chinese publisher wanted to buy the IP from us,

11
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:39,527
so they can make Move or Die into a loading screen minigame for one of their bigger games.

12
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:42,768
We ended up on the front page of Twitch, above Call of Duty and Minecraft.

13
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:47,209
We got so many community-made characters that I could literally wallpaper my room with them.

14
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:51,150
And also we got Shaq playing Move or Die on stage while Snoop Dogg was watching.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,353
Now, as I said, I'm going to have a talk about all this and the overall success of Move or Die,

16
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:59,936
but the funny thing is, while I'm recording this video, whether or not these things made the game sell better?

17
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:01,197
I don't know.

18
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:06,981
So join me during my talk and watch me try to figure out why Move or Die did as well as it did and why it

19
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:12,044
ended up being successful, because right now, I don't know. But I will know by the time I have my talk.

20
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:12,905
So, see you there.
