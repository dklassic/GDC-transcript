1
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:09,854
Okay, well it looks like it's time to get started.

2
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,255
Thank you guys all for joining us

3
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:12,876
bright and early this morning.

4
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:15,017
This is Bridging the Community Divide,

5
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,659
Communities and Cross-Platform MMOs.

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,981
So first off, I'm gonna introduce these fine people

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,742
who are gonna be doing most of the talking today.

8
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:24,223
I just get to ask questions.

9
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:26,524
That's my payment for having to stand up

10
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:27,364
for the entire talk.

11
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:32,223
We're going to go through what the different communities are that we're talking about and

12
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:37,467
similarities and differences between them, some of the challenges made by certain decisions

13
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:44,453
in the development process, styles of communication we use, you know, some of the interplay between

14
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:49,397
the different communities and how differing platforms affect their growth.

15
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:53,161
And then if we are nice and quick, we will get time for some of your questions.

16
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:56,396
So I'm Eric Ochocleaver.

17
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:59,557
I'm a community and social media manager at NetEase.

18
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:03,559
My background is heavily in PC MMO, games like City of

19
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:04,559
Heroes and EverQuest.

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,981
I spent about eight years of my career working in PC MMOs.

21
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:10,102
And I said, I really want to do something different.

22
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:11,803
I'm going to go work for a mobile gaming company.

23
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,624
So I applied to work at NetEase.

24
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:16,505
And they were very excited.

25
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:17,526
They hired me on.

26
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:18,266
It was great.

27
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,647
And about two months in, they're like, hey.

28
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:27,469
we should launch a cross platform MMO, not only on mobile but also on PC. So, uh, it

29
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,951
gave me a really interesting perspective in looking at how PC MMOs with a straight one

30
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:39,753
platform, uh, play differently than cross platform MMOs and it was something I thought

31
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:44,414
was interesting so I thought we should talk about it. So, uh, M, why don't you introduce

32
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:44,774
yourself?

33
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,221
I happen to work with Sir Cleaver over here.

34
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:50,302
I'm taking full credit for being the one who hired him.

35
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:51,943
This is the second time I've done so.

36
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,684
Very, very happy, as always.

37
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:59,226
I have been in the gaming industry since straight out of college.

38
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:06,429
So since 1991, and I always kid that I kind of did it back assward, because most people

39
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,750
come in and sort of a support function.

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,092
and then jump into development.

41
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:15,856
And I started off as a writer game designer back in the Sega Genesis days.

42
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:22,622
And after doing that for five years, I was approached by Sega who said, we love your

43
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:29,207
communication background and we think you should try the communication thing on our

44
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:29,868
peer-to-peer.

45
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:35,833
platform and that's how I jumped into community relations. I did the hands on thing for about

46
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:40,076
ten years and then jumped into management and I've been building community teams ever

47
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,378
since. So that's a little bit about me.

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,701
We also have Linda Carlson.

49
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:50,945
Right. I do apologize. I came here with a...

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,765
a bad cold. So if you have a bad cold, don't come anywhere near me because then we will

51
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:01,449
breed a superbug that will wipe out humanity. I always thought that would start off in LA,

52
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:03,311
but San Francisco is a good second choice.

53
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:10,594
I do enjoy working with communities simply because I love learning about human nature.

54
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:15,138
It is most often depressing, but sometimes you get pockets of brilliance.

55
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:19,440
And I remain convinced that the online interactions that we have

56
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:23,943
are helping us to grow a reasonable, rational, global community.

57
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:29,247
And so while I work specifically in games, it's because I want to work with humanity.

58
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:32,144
And yeah, there's my games listed on there.

59
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:34,766
And that's not even all of them.

60
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:38,268
I would also like to add that Eric Cleaver has worked for me twice.

61
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:40,148
So I see a pattern emerging here.

62
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:42,029
It must be like when I get sick of working with him,

63
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,871
he goes over to work for M and then he comes back over to me.

64
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,912
So it's my turn next, Mr. Cleaver.

65
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,053
Over my dead body.

66
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:53,755
Our most intelligent panelist is John here.

67
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:56,777
And John's smart because he doesn't work in community full time.

68
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:00,619
Something like that, yes.

69
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,080
So I started our game company.

70
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:07,182
We started development back in 96, actually.

71
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:09,843
But we became more of a formal startup in 98 with our own

72
00:04:09,943 --> 00:04:10,663
office and everything.

73
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:14,785
And being the wide-eyed, inexperienced person that I

74
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:17,126
was, I was like, hey, why don't we try making a giant

75
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:18,007
online game?

76
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,087
No one's done that before.

77
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:20,328
That seems like a great idea.

78
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:24,529
So as a result, we've been making the same game for like

79
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:25,109
20 years.

80
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:27,710
And it's been a hell of a ride.

81
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,610
It went online in 2002.

82
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,931
And we've continually expanded it since then, including

83
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:39,852
platforms, bringing it over to mobile in 2010, and then more

84
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:42,933
recently into VR and starting to consider other platforms

85
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:43,373
beyond that.

86
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:45,873
So our community's been.

87
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:50,238
I think like everybody who interacts with the community, it's been like one of the greatest

88
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:55,084
aspects of our game and also one of the most challenging and it's a huge part of the reason

89
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:55,785
why we're still here.

90
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:57,047
So, very happy to be here.

91
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:00,792
And our final panelist is Troy Hewitt.

92
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:01,532
Too soon?

93
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,974
Too soon.

94
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:03,715
Definitely.

95
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:10,699
Anyway, my name is Troy Hewitt. Unlike him, I began my career when the Internet was a

96
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:17,422
here. So I've been doing online community management. My background is actually human

97
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:25,946
services. So like Linda, I fell into this community stuff with a belief that people

98
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:26,827
are better than they seem.

99
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:31,370
And I think that is good when you give them the opportunity to rise to the expectations of the community.

100
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,212
And I really have enjoyed that piece of it.

101
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:40,896
And I do believe that our work is creating people who are taking these skills into the real world.

102
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:42,257
And so I'm very passionate about it.

103
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:49,422
As far as the cross-platform stuff, I have been living the dream at an indie studio

104
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:52,524
with a bunch of friends that I've worked with throughout my career on MMOs.

105
00:05:55,367 --> 00:06:01,115
And it's been very interesting but we are working on a cross platform user generated

106
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:06,022
content game where they can build their own stuff and then share it with their friends

107
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:09,627
and it's sort of like Minecraft meets...

108
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:18,075
a combat meets good community citizen meets, we call it Quark, which is a quantum universe

109
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,456
interaction and replication kit.

110
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,517
So a lot of science, a lot of fun.

111
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:30,022
But we started on the HTC Vive and then moved to PC, Mac OS, and then added mobile.

112
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:32,583
So we have all the platforms.

113
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:38,407
And yeah, so we'll talk about that and what a wonderful challenge it is.

114
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:39,347
Okay.

115
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:42,154
So let's talk about communities on different platforms.

116
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:45,234
One of the first things I get asked when talking to anybody

117
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:47,795
new about communities is, is there a difference between,

118
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:49,515
say, PC and mobile gamers?

119
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:53,416
How do console players play into it?

120
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:55,756
So let's talk a little bit about these groups.

121
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:59,277
So Linda, are these groups the same?

122
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,097
Are they different?

123
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:01,498
Both?

124
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:01,958
Neither?

125
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:02,598
Wow.

126
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,138
Thanks for asking me to talk first.

127
00:07:04,198 --> 00:07:06,118
Nobody else is going to get to go for 40 minutes now.

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,723
One of the interesting things that I find is that communities are very, very different

129
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:12,384
from one another.

130
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:17,929
I worked on both EQ and EQ2 and although those two games had superficial similarities, their

131
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,852
communities were completely different from one another.

132
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:27,858
And when you're talking about cross-platform games, anything that runs on the PlayStation

133
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:28,679
or Xbox.

134
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:35,452
on mobile and on PC. I mean, if anybody's done that, quadrifecta. I mean, I've certainly

135
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:41,936
worked on communities that bridge three of those divides. And the communities do act

136
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:46,720
very differently, and the thing that I have found over the years is they each prefer a

137
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,821
different communication platform.

138
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:51,623
Some communities prefer to be on forums.

139
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,326
Some communities do almost all of their communications on Twitter.

140
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:57,227
Some really like their Reddits.

141
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:02,030
Discord is a really rapidly growing community platform,

142
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,491
and it's one of the hardest to manage.

143
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,633
And you have to go where your players are,

144
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:08,654
because you can set up your own platform

145
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:10,135
and think that's where the players are going to go,

146
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,316
but that's not true.

147
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:15,819
You have to be prepared to support where they naturally, organically want to go

148
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,940
based on their communication preferences.

149
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,463
So John, you have an established game that you've added to new platforms over time.

150
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:29,870
Do you find that people come to the existing communications platforms or does each new

151
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,594
wave of players go to a different communications platform?

152
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,633
It's kind of a mixture.

153
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,774
When we added a lot of mobile users, you would certainly see

154
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:42,074
like more interactions via Facebook and things like that

155
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:42,854
and social media.

156
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:47,476
At the same time, our game is incredibly hardcore.

157
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,597
And people tend to interact with the existing players

158
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:51,697
pretty commonly.

159
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:55,158
And as a result, there's a certain degree of training

160
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:57,598
that goes on from the existing players saying, hey, if you

161
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:59,219
want to get developer attention or whatever, you

162
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,859
should really post in the forums, or you should use a

163
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,800
support ticket or whatever.

164
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,404
So we do have that happen, but we do definitely have to monitor other channels in addition to that.

165
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:14,909
So, Em, I think that has something similar to do with your experience, because the game that you're working on right now,

166
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:21,474
it's Class Platform Crusader's Blade, is a very hardcore game, with very long play sessions.

167
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:26,978
So how do you think that plays into where communities form and how they communicate?

168
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:31,221
Yeah, well as you're very familiar with, we see a lot of action on Facebook.

169
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:40,037
actually. So, you know, like everyone has said, we modify to there. You know, when you're

170
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:46,859
dealing with, so this is a mobile game, but it's very hardcore MMO. You still are getting

171
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:53,362
a lot of those classic PC gamers. So there's a lot of discussions that they get really,

172
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:56,983
really into it. There's so much having to do with that game. You know, message boards

173
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:57,423
don't play.

174
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:02,167
a part in that because people want to get into real deep discussions because the game

175
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:07,510
is so multi-layered and has so many different things going on. So, you know, in that case,

176
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,054
there's a lot of that kind of interaction going on on message boards and they really,

177
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:15,156
really react to Facebook. So those are the ones that we concentrate a lot on.

178
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:23,221
So one of the things I think is really interesting is how different decisions play in from a

179
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:26,564
development perspective into how your community interacts with one another.

180
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,587
Are play spaces shared between the different platforms?

181
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:34,050
Are the Xbox players playing with the PC players all in one playground?

182
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,372
Are they walled off into separate little gardens?

183
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:42,826
Similarly, can a player log in on PC, play on PC, log out, log

184
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:44,667
in on their phone, and play their same character,

185
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:46,087
maintaining their same progression?

186
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:52,430
How do you guys think these decisions interact how you're

187
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,810
going to talk to your community later?

188
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,490
Troy, you want to jump in?

189
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,350
Yeah, I do.

190
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,052
So right now, the experience that we

191
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:05,217
had trying to create a product that had playability parity,

192
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:11,201
VR versus PC and Mac OS, was a really interesting challenge

193
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:11,542
for us.

194
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:15,264
Because it's definitely a different way of doing things.

195
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:18,047
And the VR space is still trying to figure out what.

196
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:25,034
how users should be using their stuff. So it was fun to kind of explore that. In the

197
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:31,081
future, in just a few months, we are bringing the mobile folks into the fold and that will

198
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:37,268
create an even more interesting how do we balance what a VR player can do versus what

199
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,610
a PC, Mac OS person can do.

200
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:47,216
and a person on the phone. For me, it is, you know, how do you get all those folks in

201
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:52,280
the same place if you want to? How do you, you know, for instance, with our mobile phone,

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,825
with our mobile app, I have a real hard time incorporating any kind of chat, especially

203
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:05,089
when you start looking at what happens on a global launch. Our game is really geared

204
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,270
for younger kids.

205
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:12,232
So, right now we're in the Philippines with the mobile app and they communicate, they

206
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:15,073
use Facebook a ton, way more than I thought they would.

207
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:22,376
And whereas other gamers, maybe not so much on Facebook, maybe they're more on Discord.

208
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:28,458
We try not to depend too heavily on Twitter, just because it appears to be the place you

209
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:29,399
go to get, you know...

210
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:35,987
harassed and abused. Um, but, uh, but yeah, so it's, uh, it is

211
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,469
interesting to try to find those pockets of people and to bridge

212
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,251
that divide, but we really do want to have this, this unified

213
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,354
cross platform experience and we need to sit down and start

214
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:50,656
talking about what are those mobile player expectations

215
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:54,859
versus the PC gamer expectations versus that VR expectation. Um,

216
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,446
What we don't want to do is focus on one and have the other two lie fallow or not recognize

217
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:08,491
great strides and jumps in what's happening both on mobile and on PC stuff is really easier

218
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,673
for me to track just because that's where my head has been.

219
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:16,739
But there's a lot of new stuff coming down the pike technologically and we want to make

220
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,223
sure that we are offering ways for them to build relationships and maybe they will take

221
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:21,443
that.

222
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:29,791
mobile piece and get into the PC piece because maybe there is, you know, our game has aspects of building in it.

223
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:33,594
Maybe it's easier to build on a PC or on a Mac.

224
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:41,981
And we find a way to allow folks to have their fun, casual gaming experience while they're running through a particular map.

225
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:46,427
But then transitioning over to the PC when they want to spend a good two hours building.

226
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:54,058
And then, you know, VR folks, we have people who have spent, you know, six hours on a stretch.

227
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:55,940
How many of you have put on a VR rig?

228
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:58,825
I can do about 10 minutes.

229
00:13:58,945 --> 00:14:01,787
So these people are committed and they're building and

230
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,368
they're using.

231
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:04,830
So they're very specialized groups.

232
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,132
We do really want to make sure we're finding a place for

233
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:10,634
them all to get the information, even if that

234
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:13,557
information isn't going to be the same by platform.

235
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:15,058
So it's a really interesting challenge.

236
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,720
What I don't want are three different SKUs where they all

237
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,281
play together.

238
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:23,864
There's a lot of information that you need depending on what phone you're using and what

239
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,745
country you're in and all of those little details.

240
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:31,688
But to have a centralized space where you can belong, which I think to me is the core

241
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,728
of what community is all about.

242
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:39,051
So John, you've added more platforms over time, layering in additional groups of gamers.

243
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:44,054
How is your approach to the shared play spaces, login fungibility?

244
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:45,154
So

245
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,287
Did you use the word fungibility?

246
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,474
I did! I even included all of that.

247
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:52,236
Ten points!

248
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,499
Your bingo card's out, kids.

249
00:14:57,157 --> 00:15:02,601
Basically, one of my overall goals is that I both oversee the design of the game as well

250
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:05,303
as things like, you know, community engagement and things like that.

251
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:11,307
And when we approached mobile, it was with this idea, it was quite early, that, you know,

252
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:13,688
hey, this is really cool that my phone can now run this stuff.

253
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:17,891
I would really like to be able to run my game on this, and if I want that, maybe someone

254
00:15:17,911 --> 00:15:18,712
else might want that.

255
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:23,495
So it's not very complex analytics-driven decision making or anything like that.

256
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:29,678
But as a result, you know, when we got into it, it was with continuing our model of all

257
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:33,619
platforms interact in the same shared universe and everything would be seamless from one

258
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,039
to the other.

259
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,961
And there are definitely some really significant tradeoffs in using that approach.

260
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:42,943
We have a Twitch model combat game, so our combat's like completely real time.

261
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:48,805
And really, you're not going to be able to be as effective, you know, from a UX perspective

262
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:49,866
of using a game like that.

263
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:59,211
So there's always a certain degree of, you know, the

264
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,912
perception of that tradeoff within our user base. At the

265
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:05,554
same time we have driven a lot of mobile people to also play on

266
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:08,916
PC and a lot of PC people to play on mobile. And they're

267
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:12,037
like, hey, I'm on a bus, I can interact with my guild, they're

268
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,799
doing some sort of big raid thing right now. I don't have to

269
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,180
like, you know, I can be some sort of support thing in the

270
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,021
background or I can just be hanging out with them or

271
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:19,301
whatever.

272
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:27,390
So it's been really popular, but there's always a degree of this kind of like ongoing competition

273
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:33,517
between different subsets of people and also just the expectation of the respective user

274
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:33,757
base.

275
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:37,061
Like, you know, PC players, especially PC MMO players,

276
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:41,044
They're expecting something that's going to be pretty intense when they get into it.

277
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:45,287
You know, there isn't really, I mean, there's certain MMOs that are kind of casual, but

278
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:51,551
they're not casual like Angry Birds casual. And when you ship a mobile MMO, the expectation

279
00:16:51,592 --> 00:16:55,274
of the user is often like, hey, this is the second game I've ever played or something

280
00:16:55,314 --> 00:17:01,238
like that. And that, it's really hard to bring that user along into a really complex environment

281
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:05,301
and kind of, you know, teach them about what's going on in a way that they're willing to

282
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:05,682
accept.

283
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:06,422
So...

284
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:13,406
I'll say that it's been a really cool experience overall and it's still an ongoing challenge

285
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:17,067
that we haven't really cracked the code on. We also have a lot of VR users. We've got

286
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:21,810
about 10,000 VR users over Gear VR and Daydream and things like that. We've got people playing

287
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,592
three, four, five hours at a time, which is a lot of time spent optimizing the heat threshold

288
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:31,574
of a mobile phone and things like that. But it's...

289
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:36,639
It's not a simple problem, and if someone were to come to me and be like, you know,

290
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:40,583
should I do one or the other, I'd say that would really depend on your game design and

291
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:47,730
your community, because it's really hard to make a single game that works, that is the

292
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,354
best possible game across all the different platforms, because the usability constraints

293
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:53,796
are so significantly different.

294
00:17:55,317 --> 00:18:00,280
I wanted to ask you a question personally just because we're kind of running through

295
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,861
the same mental exercise.

296
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:10,305
But with the mobile space, you have so many different phones that have been treated and

297
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:17,769
dropped and all kinds of crazy layout schemas that you've got to try to figure out how that's

298
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:18,289
going to work.

299
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,630
People's thumbs are different lengths.

300
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:28,192
The other thing too, we invited some kids in to come play test our game and so I handed

301
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:33,274
a couple of them, because our focus right now is Android, so we had some of the tablets

302
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:39,515
and these poor little kids were like, I can't, because they're tiny hands.

303
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:45,557
And so it was just a very interesting piece for us because it really informed the way

304
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:48,058
that we had to design the game through.

305
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:53,581
that's a little less, you know, like taking it, holding it and

306
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,563
trying to put it in the middle of a screen when you're a tiny

307
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,965
kid. You just don't have those fingers. What's interesting is

308
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:03,249
you may be hearing us talk about how to manage community and all

309
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,952
that stuff, but we're also having a deeper side discussion

310
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:10,775
which I hope everybody takes with them and that is community

311
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:14,318
management once upon a time was about jumping on forums and

312
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:15,418
telling people to be nice.

313
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:21,683
But it needs to be embedded in the process of design and delivery.

314
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:25,826
And the people who are heading up organizations need to be invested and

315
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:30,650
understanding that community management, which some, any marketing people in here?

316
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:36,774
So we have a game right now called, if any marketing person says relationship marketing,

317
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:41,039
we go, welcome to the club, we've been doing it for decades.

318
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:46,305
Relationship marketing is just a way for our friends in marketing to say community management.

319
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,889
But when we look at the development of these things.

320
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,232
Having a community person in to be the interpreter and the

321
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:58,492
arbiter and to talk about, hey, you're going to make this

322
00:19:58,512 --> 00:20:00,733
happen on PC, that's going to be great, but you roll that

323
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:03,274
onto mobile and you're going to get a lot of hate.

324
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:08,635
So it's important to note that your community manager, your

325
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:13,796
social engineer, your friend wizard is somebody who ought

326
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:16,157
to be baked into the process from the very beginning.

327
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:19,937
Relationship management is a horrible term.

328
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:21,478
Relationship marketing is a horrible term.

329
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:23,659
Wait, wait, wait.

330
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,060
Can I, can I, can I...

331
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:27,522
First of all, John, seriously.

332
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:29,944
How dare you. How dare you, sir,

333
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:31,685
call Angry Birds a casual game.

334
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,407
You have clearly not played with my grandkids.

335
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:37,449
But the point I want to make is that

336
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,092
there are some areas of cross-platform play

337
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,913
that you can never make work together.

338
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:50,670
The Xbox and PlayStation are jealous gods, and they will not work together.

339
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,852
And the pipeline to go to those platforms is very different as well.

340
00:20:56,473 --> 00:21:01,495
So if you're publishing to PlayStation, to Xbox, and to the PC, you've got three different

341
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:02,376
publishing paths.

342
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:06,718
And it's unfortunate that those communities can never play together.

343
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:12,181
And I don't know where this is going to go in the future, because they're protecting

344
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:12,942
their market share.

345
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,152
They want people to be loyal to their one hardware product.

346
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:20,734
And yet the players want to communicate together.

347
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:23,195
So I find that they often do their communication

348
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,095
on other channels.

349
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,137
I'm just joking about the Angry Birds.

350
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:29,158
The artificial constraints, I think,

351
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:32,740
we've seen that as an old model.

352
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,442
And players do find ways around that kind of stuff.

353
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:43,363
But can you play on, so right now we're focused on Android, learning a lot. Is there that

354
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:45,664
artificial wall between iOS and Android?

355
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:46,064
No.

356
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,144
Yeah.

357
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:47,564
No.

358
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:47,844
Yeah.

359
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:47,944
No.

360
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:48,864
But they play well together.

361
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:49,785
Yeah, very well.

362
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:50,185
Yeah.

363
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:56,846
It's made our life a lot easier. Crusaders of Light is on Facebook Game Room and just

364
00:21:56,886 --> 00:22:01,327
launched on Steam and then it's on iOS and Android. And you know, on a good day it just

365
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,727
seems like you have, you know, one whole community.

366
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:09,029
And on a bad day, something goes wrong for the Android players and they lose a bunch

367
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,670
of stuff and you have to deal with it and it's a problem.

368
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:15,612
But it works, you know, the fact that we're cross platform on those specific platforms

369
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:19,214
or at least Android and Apple and...

370
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:24,139
Facebook game room players can all play together on the same servers works really well for

371
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:24,319
us.

372
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:30,767
And, you know, being able to give them the opportunity to game wherever they're most

373
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:31,488
comfortable, right?

374
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:34,792
Like we were talking about, you know, go home, they've got a few hours to spend.

375
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:40,235
like, straight on to the PC they go and they can pick up that progress. As we said, commuting

376
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:42,176
on the way to work, on the mobile phone.

377
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:47,419
Gosh, if you're a small developer and you're dependent on those numbers and you've got

378
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:55,283
all of these platforms that you're managing, your player base grows exponentially, because

379
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:59,885
they're finding different ways to get into the game through different devices.

380
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:02,987
You're making it as easy for them to play wherever they are as possible.

381
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,487
So communication styles and channels.

382
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:10,569
How have your communication styles, what channels you

383
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:15,553
pick, we've talked about this a little bit, changed based

384
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:16,614
on multi-platform.

385
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,677
And do you do shared or combined communications?

386
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:21,438
Has anybody tried breaking it out?

387
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:25,181
So this is GameX for Xbox.

388
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:27,202
This is GameX for Mac OS.

389
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:35,698
In terms of general communications, especially on social media, we keep all of our platforms together.

390
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:47,407
However, in forums, especially because forums are where people in our gaming communities go for the latest updates or for issues that they're having and that sort of thing.

391
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:56,814
So we'll have a forum which is broken into here's the PC section, here is the PlayStation section, here's the Xbox section, because there are differences between them.

392
00:23:57,254 --> 00:23:58,776
But in the general section...

393
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:03,820
It is where we tend to communicate best, and on social media it's all interchangeable,

394
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,442
and we'll address it as you go along.

395
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:06,423
We're doing the same thing.

396
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:06,643
Yeah.

397
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:08,325
We're going to use hashtags to differentiate.

398
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:09,606
We don't have enough of us to go around.

399
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:10,247
No, absolutely not.

400
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,308
Yeah, hashtags are a great idea.

401
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:11,948
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:15,163
Yeah, we break out our forms by platform.

403
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:17,043
We've always done that just to try and keep it from being

404
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,504
completely chaotic, too.

405
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,425
It's like the sheer number of posts that you get.

406
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:24,887
But yeah, there's only so many channels that we can focus on

407
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:26,648
and focus on well.

408
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:29,109
So we do try to channel all of our users to something that's

409
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,450
a little bit more manageable, and then do the rest of it

410
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,610
ad hoc as we have to.

411
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:36,832
Yeah, communication style-wise, when I'm

412
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:40,254
communicating to folks on mobile, I'm like, hello,

413
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:40,914
fellow kids.

414
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:47,016
But honestly, it was really funny, the transition, because, you know, coming, all of us coming

415
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:50,697
from MMO space, the bane of our existence has been patch notes.

416
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:53,978
They are always lengthy.

417
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:57,459
They are rarely 100% correct.

418
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:02,161
And when I rolled over to mobile, I was like, oh, man, I've got to do this again.

419
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,661
And then it said, you have 500 characters.

420
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:08,363
And I was like, angels fell from the heaven.

421
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:14,907
So I had 500 characters to share, just got to the good stuff.

422
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:18,612
And I thought, I'm going to take some of that back to the PC,

423
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:21,636
because I think people don't need to see all of that.

424
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:23,017
Maybe they want to have access to it,

425
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:24,479
but that first interaction.

426
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,502
So there is a blending going on.

427
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:31,880
It's true, and you know, one of the most interesting things I've learned, because my career has

428
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,263
just jumped back and forth between PC, MMOs, and mobile, is that you do absolutely communicate

429
00:25:37,343 --> 00:25:38,784
completely different to those two.

430
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:39,944
Those two, right?

431
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:44,147
Because mobile gamers, man, you have to be short to the point.

432
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:46,748
If you can use pictures instead of words.

433
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:51,589
You know, to convey what's going on, that is super effective with those folks.

434
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:56,110
When you're on the PC, you know, much more elaborate communication happens, but you really

435
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,031
do have to gear your method and way of communication based on that platform.

436
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:06,553
The tone of communication varies as well from platform to platform.

437
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:10,053
We adopt a very different voice when we're on Facebook as opposed to Twitter.

438
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:12,095
as opposed to forums.

439
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,458
And now I've got a question for you guys.

440
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,442
This is something that at Trion Worlds we've recently started doing

441
00:26:18,522 --> 00:26:20,805
and that is we spend more time in games

442
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,381
talking directly to people there on global channels.

443
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:25,561
Have you guys done that much?

444
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:29,143
So we're rolling out an events system

445
00:26:29,183 --> 00:26:31,924
where our developers are going to be in game

446
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:33,745
during certain hours and certain times

447
00:26:34,586 --> 00:26:36,987
because there's nothing more effective in my opinion

448
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,308
than having the person who's making the game

449
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:42,309
then go in and we, it's kind of crass,

450
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:44,911
but we say, you know, eat your own dog food.

451
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,072
Like go in and you play and I'll tell you,

452
00:26:47,112 --> 00:26:48,693
bugs get fixed like that.

453
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:52,837
And even some where they're just like, I can't believe I've been making people suffer like this,

454
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:55,320
or this is really irritating to me, and then the next day it's fixed.

455
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:58,724
But the real part of that is more interaction.

456
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:06,774
We don't allow chatting in-game because I am worried about the way we present.

457
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:08,216
I want...

458
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:11,879
I want the interactions to be important and I want them to be fun and I want them to be

459
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:18,803
positive but I also want to protect kids and protect them and protect anyone from abuses

460
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:23,926
in game and people in my office were really stressed out about that and I said well so

461
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:24,346
what.

462
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:26,774
How many is acceptable?

463
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,876
Like how many problems is acceptable?

464
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:31,137
Is one OK?

465
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:32,758
And they're all kind of quiet.

466
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,200
And I was like, oh, two then, three then?

467
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,341
And they're like, shut up, Troy, we get it.

468
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,443
But we're looking at ways to get creative with that

469
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:41,044
communication.

470
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:45,026
But I think that getting your devs in game, that's a

471
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:45,647
wonderful thing to do.

472
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,068
Nothing excites the players more either.

473
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,591
If they see a dev in game, you know, and it shows them how much you care that, you know,

474
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:51,612
you're just like them.

475
00:27:51,652 --> 00:27:52,793
You play the game as well.

476
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:53,914
You have, you know...

477
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:54,775
They want to know that.

478
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:55,936
It bonds them to you.

479
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:56,877
It gets them loyal.

480
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:57,657
How about your group?

481
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:03,583
Yeah, well, I get in game periodically for, like, major messaging, like major points that

482
00:28:03,603 --> 00:28:04,704
I'm trying to make or something like that.

483
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:08,427
I generally do it on the forums and our users are really used to that because of the persistency

484
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:12,011
of the information rather than just being the current audience who happens to be online

485
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:12,571
at that moment.

486
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:16,674
But they do really like it when I show up for some kind of event or something like that,

487
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:18,034
or when any of us are online.

488
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:23,237
We're usually online before major patches, so we'll be talking to them about, like, what's

489
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:24,018
about to drop.

490
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:25,899
Managing those expectations.

491
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:26,699
Yeah, exactly.

492
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,701
I think we'll only be down for five minutes, maybe.

493
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:34,525
We'll let you know if it gets published.

494
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:39,169
If you're ever responsible for messaging, never actually try to measure it.

495
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:40,290
Give it an actual time.

496
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,891
Approximately is our favorite way.

497
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,453
I usually say, probably three days.

498
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:46,595
Only an hour, wow!

499
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:48,356
Isn't that amazing?

500
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:48,897
Exactly.

501
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:49,417
Exactly.

502
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,280
I had a quick question for the audience, Eric, and I don't mean to derail us.

503
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,625
How many of you have an actively launched app, mobile app, in a game store?

504
00:29:00,753 --> 00:29:04,640
Yeah, interesting. How many of you want to reach through your phone screen and throttle

505
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,401
your reviewers?

506
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,859
Let's have a talk about that later.

507
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,101
I mean, Steam reviews, come on.

508
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:14,443
They're just as bad, really.

509
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:15,223
Yeah, honestly.

510
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:21,328
It is really unfortunate that people don't put as much thought into their reviews as they do on Yelp.

511
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:24,390
If we had a Yelp-type system, I'd be much happier.

512
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,432
Or as many different ways to contact them.

513
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:26,952
No, I'm just kidding.

514
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:32,416
I'll take the, I played your game for ten minutes and gave you the honest feedback for ten minutes

515
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:34,998
over the, I'm trying to be witty on Yelp, any day of the week.

516
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:36,246
I don't know.

517
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:39,469
We got a review that said Stinky with one star.

518
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:41,070
And I'm like, I don't even know.

519
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:42,852
Did you tell them you showered?

520
00:29:43,993 --> 00:29:45,434
No, what I did is I said, no, you.

521
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:47,636
Seems legit.

522
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:48,536
I wanted to though.

523
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:53,835
One of the interesting trends that I have found with mobile apps, because I have great

524
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:56,638
discussions with my boss, let's just say we disagree sometimes.

525
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:00,702
And I'm glad he's not here right now, but he's somewhere around GDC.

526
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:04,726
And he says, well, nobody uses forums anymore.

527
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:06,207
Oh, I beg to differ.

528
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:09,611
And he says, you know, and mobile apps, mobile apps, none of them use forums.

529
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:15,076
So I open up Hay Day and I say, Supercell, let me just go to their forums for you.

530
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:20,722
Because it's strange to me now that mobile games are growing up, that they're starting

531
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:27,289
to spread out across more communication channels and you're getting so much more in-depth communication

532
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:28,009
and back and forth.

533
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:28,590
What do you think that is?

534
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:35,559
I think they're growing up and I also think that the hardware is allowing for people to

535
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:36,860
do that kind of stuff.

536
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,503
To run background apps that are voice.

537
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:41,204
It's all evolving.

538
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:47,069
I think it's a part of it, but I also do think there are a lot of people that mobile component

539
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:54,796
of gaming is kind of connecting a little bit more with what we've been doing for decades.

540
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:55,657
And I also think that.

541
00:30:56,658 --> 00:31:02,720
Gamers are holding mobile app developers responsible for the quality of the games that they make.

542
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,422
Absolutely, yeah. And I think that's good, really.

543
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:06,982
I do, totally.

544
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:11,504
You've got the two-way communication going, which was missing from mobile games for many, many years.

545
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:12,164
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:31:13,227 --> 00:31:14,948
Are we totally derailing your talk?

547
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:15,769
Derailing.

548
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:16,629
OK, that's all right.

549
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:17,449
But that's OK.

550
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:18,770
I'm here to get you back on track.

551
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,671
Job accomplished.

552
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:25,294
So how often in your games have you run into competing communities where the Android players

553
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:31,857
feel like you love the iOS players better, that the PC players are clearly the favorites

554
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:35,959
because the UI is optimized for the larger screen and keyboard and mouse.

555
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,922
So how have you guys run into this situation in the past, and how have you handled it?

556
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:43,023
That's a really, really tough one.

557
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:46,465
I mean, we just launched a progression server called Rift Prime,

558
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:47,906
which is subscription only.

559
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:52,229
And we're seeing running arguments between the Prime players

560
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:53,749
and the free-to-play players,

561
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,471
and it's really, really strange.

562
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:59,073
Their perception is we favor one over the other.

563
00:31:59,513 --> 00:32:03,715
The Prime players feel that free-to-play players are getting all the stuff first,

564
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:06,697
and they've got everything easier and we're focused on them,

565
00:32:06,997 --> 00:32:08,918
whereas the free-to-play people think that we're...

566
00:32:09,158 --> 00:32:12,559
We're investing all of our time in Prime and not fixing any of their issues.

567
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,800
And neither of those things is true.

568
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:20,102
So we find that we're generally addressing both communities at the same time and trying

569
00:32:20,142 --> 00:32:25,263
to make sure that we mention each one every time that we communicate on that platform

570
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,743
until they get used to it.

571
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:31,204
But I've seen the same thing with console players versus PC players.

572
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:34,925
Especially if there's a disparity in the production schedule

573
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:39,306
due to the numbers of tests and certifications you have to go through on console.

574
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:39,947
Oh yeah.

575
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:45,288
Well, and I agree with Linda that you definitely wanted to make everyone feel like you dislike them equally.

576
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:46,968
Because we do!

577
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,529
Wait! Wait!

578
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:51,349
That's not what you said. That's a direct quote that's on video.

579
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:51,849
You heard it.

580
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,670
Oh my god.

581
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,470
I hope this is reflected in a rating.

582
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,490
I hate you so much.

583
00:32:56,231 --> 00:33:03,578
But the real deal for us is that we are really working hard because we started with our VR,

584
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:08,623
we added the PC component, we're moving into mobile and mobile now will be kind of part

585
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:16,651
of the, we call it the uniting of the tribes, they will all be together, but we play a lot

586
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,294
of the, you know.

587
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:27,462
Indie dev stuff is a currency and indie dev love and sharing what our plans are and making

588
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:33,327
sure that those, you know, because we frankly we don't have enough people to keep the PC

589
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:38,152
build in line with what's going on with the mobile build and we got some bills to pay

590
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:40,555
and the activities that are on mobile maybe help.

591
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:45,780
In you know when we're visiting China and talking to friends who may want to help us

592
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:50,164
It's important that we focus on that, but we never leave

593
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:57,066
anybody out of our adventures. They know what to expect and they know that we've built really

594
00:33:57,606 --> 00:34:02,988
strong relationships and a lot of goodwill with those folks. They know, they get to see us

595
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:09,051
unfold our plan and move through those spaces. So it's not, you know, we always say it's not that

596
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:13,473
we don't love you, it's just that, you know, there's just too many of you to love all at once.

597
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:20,135
But we are also very, very open about timing. Even if we try to hedge our bets and say,

598
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:24,776
And, you know, around spring, that kind of stuff.

599
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:30,177
But we also have found, because we're early in development and you've got well established

600
00:34:30,578 --> 00:34:38,319
people who have done this, but our process is just starting and so we find setting the

601
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:42,420
tone at the very outset, and even though we may be launched in the Philippines, we can

602
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,961
still invite our people that are in VR and on PC to come be a part of this.

603
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:52,127
You know, the vanguard of telling us how the game plays on mobile and what they think will

604
00:34:52,147 --> 00:34:54,629
be wrong when we try to connect it to PC.

605
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:55,210
And we listen.

606
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:56,431
Yeah.

607
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:57,092
So far, so good.

608
00:34:57,752 --> 00:35:02,917
Really quickly, I have a very specific example of how we had to deal with this particular

609
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:07,862
situation when we launched Crusaders of Light on mobile for business purposes.

610
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:12,722
We launched on Android one week later than we did on iOS.

611
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,525
So as you can imagine, all these people are looking

612
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:16,786
forward to jumping into the game.

613
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:20,290
And then they're told, hey, these people get to play the

614
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,412
game first, and these other people have to wait.

615
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:24,975
So let's be honest about it.

616
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:27,057
We're in a business here.

617
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:30,079
Things are kind of sometimes dangled in front of you like,

618
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,561
hey, you could potentially get featuring if you launch on one

619
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,341
first before the other.

620
00:35:35,962 --> 00:35:38,843
So you have to make those kind of business decisions, right?

621
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:42,605
Because it can make all the difference in the

622
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:43,545
popularity of your game.

623
00:35:44,065 --> 00:35:46,466
So we went ahead and we had these two different launch

624
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:48,587
dates, and it was very hard.

625
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:53,049
It was hard because the players want to know why.

626
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,350
Why are we getting the game a week later than

627
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:55,951
everyone else is?

628
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,501
And you just have to do your best.

629
00:35:58,521 --> 00:36:02,302
It's good because I think it's a little bit more commonplace

630
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:03,222
now than it used to be.

631
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:07,864
It's not unheard of to launch on one platform on mobile

632
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:08,544
before the other.

633
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:13,765
But what we did, we were very lucky in that situation in

634
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,646
that you've got to always look at the player's motivation for

635
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:17,987
why they get angry about these things.

636
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:20,547
And in this case, they hadn't seen the game yet.

637
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:21,668
They just wanted to get in.

638
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:24,629
So once we were able to launch on Android.

639
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:27,790
All the anger went away, right?

640
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,612
Because then they were in and they were concentrating on the game and everything.

641
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:37,796
Much better situation than, say, you're way into release time and something bad has happened

642
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:41,798
to one as opposed to the other and they're angry because they've invested money and time

643
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:42,678
and everything in the game.

644
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:47,241
But for us, we kind of battled a little bit at the beginning there with how honest do

645
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:48,482
you be with your community?

646
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:51,965
You know, we don't want to tell them, you know, the farthest we would go is say, you

647
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:56,848
know, for business reasons, we're launching on this platform and then a week later on

648
00:36:56,868 --> 00:36:57,248
the other one.

649
00:36:57,288 --> 00:37:00,971
But it's really hard to manage because those perceptions at the very beginning are super

650
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:01,451
important.

651
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:06,494
So they've been looking ever since to say, hey, you love iOS more than you love Android.

652
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:11,117
So you just have to do everything you can to mitigate that and try to make them all

653
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:11,598
feel equal.

654
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:12,939
They're like, we've been here before.

655
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,462
We've always had a bit of a challenge with this because

656
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,405
we started on PC so much earlier than we moved to

657
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:25,589
mobile, and also because we are a relatively small indie

658
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:28,131
shop, we have relatively limited development resources.

659
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:31,333
So there was a perception that was very correct by the user

660
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:34,556
base that the development on mobile was cutting into

661
00:37:34,616 --> 00:37:36,858
content drops and content development.

662
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:38,639
And that really built up.

663
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,601
Over time, a still established degree of, I would call it bitterness, I guess, among

664
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:47,462
some PC players towards mobile development in general.

665
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:52,063
Now, at the same time, a lot of them have come to really like mobile, and they also

666
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:56,164
use it, and then there's a lot of mobile people who have come in and played on PC, and there's

667
00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:57,605
just a lot of cross-utilization.

668
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:01,606
So it's not that bad, but it's always been kind of an ongoing discussion point for us.

669
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:07,228
And for my own part, dealing with these same kind of business versus communication struggles,

670
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:12,071
like I really like to opt to be blunt. Like I can't be blunt to the point of being like,

671
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:17,454
this is how much money we're getting paid to do this. But I do like to try and, you know,

672
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:21,816
be fairly honest with the user base whenever I can. And when we started doing mobile,

673
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:26,178
this became more challenging just because of the diversity and the secrecy of the stuff

674
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:28,339
that we were doing with all these different OEMs.

675
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,822
You know, we were in every Verizon commercial for a year.

676
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,665
You know, I couldn't tell them about that or like what went into that.

677
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:38,788
So, you know, a lot of the time I'm having to unfortunately make, you know,

678
00:38:38,828 --> 00:38:43,032
very vague statements of like this is really important to the game.

679
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:47,355
And you would believe me if you understood what was going on.

680
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:52,079
But, you know, you really have to come up with ways to try and address that as best

681
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,563
that you can to try and curb that degree of bitterness that can evolve over time.

682
00:38:57,394 --> 00:39:02,117
It's really no different than if anybody here comes from a family with more than two children.

683
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:06,819
If you have four or five children in the family, they're all competing for your affection as

684
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:07,119
well.

685
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,842
And from that I learned that you just have to keep talking to them on all the different

686
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:12,522
platforms.

687
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:20,547
And we've also started to do, if a feature is coming to one platform, we try to get a

688
00:39:20,627 --> 00:39:24,249
commitment to when it's also available on the other platforms so that we can talk about

689
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:24,709
it right then.

690
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:30,731
Because we found that people are actually highly accepting of it if they know when they're getting X.

691
00:39:31,951 --> 00:39:36,673
But nowhere is this perception more obvious than when we're doing a livestream.

692
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:38,193
And I'm talking on the livestream and saying,

693
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,334
Why don't you fix that bug?

694
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:42,875
Oh honey, you don't want me touching that code.

695
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:49,039
If I go to work on that, then everything's going to explode and you aren't going to have

696
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:49,439
a game.

697
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:55,162
It is one of my favorites, and that is one thing that I have seen across all the platforms,

698
00:39:55,482 --> 00:40:01,906
and that is, I can't believe you're putting in spring art, why haven't you balanced, the

699
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,627
gun that does, and it's like, okay.

700
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:06,470
Once again, player, this is not how it works.

701
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,534
Just because we're doing a livestream doesn't mean that when we leave we're going to sit

702
00:40:10,554 --> 00:40:11,395
down and do some coding.

703
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:14,498
That's just, like, you know, these two things can happen concurrently.

704
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:16,260
Even if you feel like it isn't.

705
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:16,901
Oh, man.

706
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:22,686
Well, so one of the things I found really interesting when working on Defiance was what

707
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:24,388
you could give away on different platforms.

708
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:25,349
Oh, yes.

709
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:31,194
If you sell it in the store on PlayStation or Xbox, you're not giving it away.

710
00:40:32,235 --> 00:40:34,997
You know, at least specifically hard currency.

711
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:37,539
They don't want you doing that.

712
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,341
That is not allowed.

713
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:41,022
But you can give it to the PC players.

714
00:40:41,082 --> 00:40:42,644
So do you give it to the PC players?

715
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:43,204
Yep.

716
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:44,465
Or do you not give it to anyone?

717
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:48,076
You still do the giveaways.

718
00:40:48,617 --> 00:40:53,579
I mean, heck, we're multi-streaming with our live streams, and the only people who can

719
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:59,021
enter our draws are the people who are watching on Twitch, because that's where the randomizer

720
00:40:59,061 --> 00:40:59,401
thing is.

721
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:02,262
So if you're watching on Facebook or YouTube or Twitter...

722
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:03,870
You don't get to enter those.

723
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:05,733
So, I mean, that's another platform thing.

724
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:09,557
People get really mad that they can't enter from Facebook.

725
00:41:09,697 --> 00:41:14,063
But sometimes you just have to be open and honest at the outset

726
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,926
and make sure that they have the information.

727
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:22,052
It's when they find out afterwards that they can't do something that's the biggest problem.

728
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:28,518
And I honestly, I do feel that it's not one of those things where when you have those

729
00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:33,883
four children and they're not sharing and this person can't have the thing so nobody

730
00:41:33,903 --> 00:41:34,664
can have the thing.

731
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:35,484
Right.

732
00:41:35,945 --> 00:41:42,210
That's not, I think you need to really lean on your communications people, your community

733
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,255
folks to describe the policies that prevent them from giving.

734
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:52,822
things away, systems are wildly different across all those

735
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:57,629
platforms, but I find that they'll listen. And if they have

736
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:01,635
an issue with that, I also find ways not to be petty or

737
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:02,597
petulant, but...

738
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:10,703
If there's a bad policy, which, you know, the policy that Cleaver described, I think, is a bad

739
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:16,607
one, there are ways for those players to share those thoughts with the people that are

740
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:20,490
responsible for making those decisions. And I just make sure to include that information in

741
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,152
any kind of description. Yeah.

742
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:30,577
So let's talk about unique bugs. Because coding is not equal. And so that means that

743
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:31,698
whenever you do a deployment...

744
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:35,987
One platform is going to have bugs that other platforms don't experience.

745
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:42,408
One platform might lose progress, lose items, lose time that other platforms don't experience.

746
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,149
Do you compensate only one group?

747
00:42:46,589 --> 00:42:47,469
How does that all work?

748
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:50,549
And how do you guys approach those sorts of situations?

749
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,270
Oh, compensation, yeah.

750
00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:00,511
I think you have to, really, because you're looking at a group that is seeing everybody

751
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:01,012
around them.

752
00:43:01,558 --> 00:43:05,560
playing and having a good time and they're upset and they're on the communication platforms

753
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,620
to express their unhappiness.

754
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,141
And it is going to happen.

755
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:15,143
I mean, what if your build for Xbox went all wonky and people are crashing out all the

756
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:15,343
time?

757
00:43:15,363 --> 00:43:16,323
You have to deal with that.

758
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:22,465
We had some issues with Trove on this where we had some really serious stability issues

759
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:23,825
on one of the platforms.

760
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:28,007
You have to go in there and communicate as much as you can and then, yeah, if you can

761
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:29,587
give them compensation, do.

762
00:43:30,654 --> 00:43:36,920
For a minute there I honestly thought you said that we really have a problem with Troi-Ova.

763
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,162
Oh yeah, yeah, no, I always have a problem with Troi-Ova.

764
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:40,083
How do you know I'm playing?

765
00:43:40,303 --> 00:43:40,663
What are you-

766
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:41,804
It's not all about you, Troi-Ova.

767
00:43:41,824 --> 00:43:43,906
You and your persecution complex, sir.

768
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:44,227
Jeez.

769
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:46,629
But yes, I think you do.

770
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:48,391
I think you do need to address them.

771
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:50,773
I think you compensate generously and you-

772
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:51,293
Always.

773
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:53,555
And I also think that when you-

774
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:58,497
add the layer of if you have one shared community, one united

775
00:43:58,577 --> 00:44:03,379
community, and you lose a chunk of those folks that don't get

776
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:06,080
to interact with their friends, that don't get to connect, and

777
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,181
if you're running a free to play game, those folks who are

778
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:11,341
coming into play who maybe aren't spending a bunch of

779
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,842
money, and I'm not going to use any of the offensive terms for

780
00:44:13,882 --> 00:44:17,823
the people that do, you're losing content. And so I

781
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,585
believe that if you have the opportunity, if something goes

782
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,545
wrong with your service, I would rather

783
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:29,991
be very generous in compensation across the board to all folks so that they know we care

784
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:35,675
enough and we're taking care of those folks. Those folks feel taken care of and if it happens

785
00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:42,739
on their platform, they know that we're going to be paying attention. And the conversation

786
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:51,224
changes, the tone changes, and it also underscores we're one community. So, yeah.

787
00:44:52,397 --> 00:44:53,838
Yeah, I would agree with all of that.

788
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:59,622
We generally try to generally treat everybody roughly the

789
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:03,085
same across all platforms whenever we possibly can and

790
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:07,188
compensate well and compensate early and take good care of

791
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:10,190
people and communicate very clearly about what's going on

792
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,631
when something is going awry.

793
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:15,554
Communication is so critical to just having that level of

794
00:45:15,654 --> 00:45:18,136
trust between your player base and your development team.

795
00:45:18,696 --> 00:45:20,698
And it's especially challenging when you start breaking out

796
00:45:20,758 --> 00:45:22,099
onto these additional platforms like.

797
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:25,602
We roll our own engine completely, all our own tech.

798
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:30,125
And we run into way more bugs and problems on mobile than we

799
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:33,928
ever do on PC, just because the stability of the video drivers

800
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:36,690
is just not as solid there.

801
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,931
New devices are getting shipped all the time that have brand

802
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:39,852
new code in them.

803
00:45:40,092 --> 00:45:42,894
And you're supposed to be a featured product on that

804
00:45:42,934 --> 00:45:45,716
device, and the device blows up in some terrible way.

805
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:49,159
So communicating about all that and making clear what's

806
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:49,639
going on.

807
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,942
and how you're trying to look out for people, that's critical.

808
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:58,285
But at the same time, it goes back to the earlier question.

809
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:03,288
There can be a degree of resentment from one platform

810
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,489
that sees that you're spending a tremendous amount of time

811
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,290
doing maintenance on another platform.

812
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:10,172
And it all kind of rolls in together

813
00:46:10,192 --> 00:46:11,273
into the same sorts of issues.

814
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,368
I want to piggyback off of something that John just said that I think is really important.

815
00:46:16,028 --> 00:46:22,832
If you are a developer that has one or more games that is multi-platform, you just need

816
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:25,934
to make sure that you have a community team.

817
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,554
And by that I mean more than one person.

818
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,577
Because here's the deal, when you are dealing with all these different communities and something

819
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:36,279
goes wrong on one, if you don't have enough community people, because what I like to do

820
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:39,661
is I like to take one person of the team and say, go chase this down.

821
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:43,683
You are the czar of this one thing on this one platform.

822
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:45,625
Go talk to the developers.

823
00:46:45,905 --> 00:46:47,447
The developers are going to ask for information.

824
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:49,328
Go back to the players who are reporting the problem.

825
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:50,790
Get as much details as you can.

826
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,011
Be the go-between.

827
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,392
Help facilitate.

828
00:46:53,972 --> 00:46:56,855
Figure out what the hell is happening so that you can then

829
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:58,356
come back to the rest of us.

830
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:00,418
We can talk about communication strategy.

831
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:03,741
And we can execute on bringing everyone.

832
00:47:04,652 --> 00:47:07,674
publicly up to speed on what's happening when we think things could be resolved and all

833
00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:12,176
that stuff. It's super, super important because as we know, you know, daily live community

834
00:47:12,236 --> 00:47:16,618
operations, you've got your plan and then we just also have to deal with all of these

835
00:47:16,678 --> 00:47:20,840
things that come up out of nowhere, you know, catching these little wildfires and putting

836
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:25,382
them out. So you need to have a robust community team. You can't just have one person dealing

837
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:30,764
with one or more products that are out there, you know, available on multiple platforms.

838
00:47:30,944 --> 00:47:32,845
It's super important to be staffed appropriately.

839
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:37,789
Absolutely. And if you're a small indie developer, you're also going to have to train and trust

840
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:43,234
other people who may not necessarily have those skills baked in. They may not have been

841
00:47:43,274 --> 00:47:48,558
born with it, but they can learn how to do these things and to manage a tone in a tenor.

842
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:53,663
Because a lot of times when you're dealing with reporting a bug or sharing with the world

843
00:47:53,723 --> 00:47:57,846
what it is that's wrong with a particular thing, you've got to write it up here.

844
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:02,079
But then you've got to prepare the tweet here and then the

845
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:04,961
Facebook post goes here but it can't do that because you've

846
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:07,482
got to link to the Twitter and then you've got your CMS and

847
00:48:07,502 --> 00:48:10,364
then you've got what all this other, I mean, so it is the

848
00:48:10,844 --> 00:48:14,567
calculus on how what pops off first is, you know, try as you

849
00:48:14,587 --> 00:48:18,449
might to automate some of that stuff, you just can't. But it

850
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:22,451
really is important to spread out that work and to create

851
00:48:22,491 --> 00:48:25,233
those R's, like you are the person who's carrying the water

852
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:26,794
on this, you need to be sure.

853
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:33,956
That you're communicating it and that our language reflects across all of our communications channels the same stuff.

854
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:40,519
I think one of the interesting opportunities is actually leveraging your customers to help

855
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:41,179
take care of this.

856
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:44,640
Because if you spend a lot of time with your community, you know that there's those people

857
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,860
who are experts.

858
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:48,401
They're the guy who's always giving you the bugs.

859
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:52,102
Going to them and saying, hey, can you tell me what's going on right now?

860
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:55,843
Because I don't have time necessarily to look into every nook and cranny.

861
00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:59,544
So I need to get as much work and help from you guys as possible.

862
00:48:59,564 --> 00:49:02,445
And if those folks are using their powers for good, sometimes you find out through them.

863
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:04,266
Before you find out anywhere else.

864
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:05,267
That's what I was going to say.

865
00:49:05,427 --> 00:49:13,875
How many of you run, it would be the modern day parlance is influencer programs.

866
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:22,223
But yeah, I mean we've had a lot of experience here running and empowering groups of people

867
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:27,127
because every game I've ever played, even in mobile games, has this helper component.

868
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:31,469
That people that want to say here's how you do this, do this thing,

869
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,972
you know, they want to write, they want to be a part of educating.

870
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:41,435
Those are great, great folk. While they can sometimes turn out to be megalomaniacs,

871
00:49:42,535 --> 00:49:46,097
you know, you do it long enough and you can pick those people out before they get to Beach Provo some.

872
00:49:47,038 --> 00:49:51,660
But really leveraging your community to help spread the word and to help

873
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:56,582
connect, talk to you and say, oh, hey, I don't know if you've seen this dark corner of the

874
00:49:56,642 --> 00:50:02,543
internet where they're, you know, they're confused. Yeah, I think that's another really

875
00:50:02,563 --> 00:50:06,424
great point. Have people on your team, whether they're, if you're the only communications

876
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:11,926
person, get your CEO, get your, you know, I don't know, I don't care what they are, if

877
00:50:11,966 --> 00:50:18,067
they can type and talk and are amenable to your expectations as it relates to, you know,

878
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,108
treating your customers right.

879
00:50:19,608 --> 00:50:23,729
And then leverage those community leaders and they'll do it and love it.

880
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:24,589
For free.

881
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:25,810
Yeah, for free.

882
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,691
So I want to give you guys a chance to ask questions.

883
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,551
And we only have a couple minutes left.

884
00:50:30,671 --> 00:50:36,373
So if you guys want to follow up to this microphone here in the middle, that would be fantastic.

885
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,053
Don't be shy.

886
00:50:37,073 --> 00:50:40,014
Come ask questions, even if you don't really think it's a good question.

887
00:50:40,134 --> 00:50:40,955
Just we have some people.

888
00:50:43,844 --> 00:50:48,708
And I'll take this opportunity to again remind you to fill out the evaluations.

889
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:51,431
Thank you very much. It's very much appreciated.

890
00:50:55,287 --> 00:50:56,108
Everyone can hear me clearly?

891
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:56,809
Oh, yes.

892
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:02,594
So you talked about multiple platforms and messaging

893
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:03,394
for different platforms.

894
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:05,456
But what happens when something actually

895
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:06,998
goes wrong for an individual?

896
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,361
What are your best support channels individually?

897
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:12,022
Like if somebody has a problem on Android,

898
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:14,865
how do you get back to them on Android via somebody

899
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:16,086
having a problem on Xbox?

900
00:51:16,226 --> 00:51:18,848
And you now need to get back to them directly on Xbox.

901
00:51:20,505 --> 00:51:24,327
But for me, I've been talking this whole time, so I apologize.

902
00:51:24,627 --> 00:51:25,808
Again, my name is Richard Weil.

903
00:51:27,268 --> 00:51:31,351
But for Android, what we've done, I can only speak to that

904
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:35,933
right now, but we've actually captured their tag.

905
00:51:36,273 --> 00:51:39,035
And we know who they are, and we can send them a direct

906
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:40,255
message to their phone.

907
00:51:41,236 --> 00:51:44,237
But we also manage a lot of our stuff through Zendesk.

908
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:47,019
Zendesk has a really fabulous mobile component.

909
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:48,780
I am definitely looking for.

910
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,504
other resources that may be more mobile friendly, but yeah, it's

911
00:51:54,724 --> 00:51:58,507
a, it is a challenge. IOS I'm imagining will bring a whole new

912
00:51:58,627 --> 00:52:01,529
level of trying to get that person to feel supported. But

913
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:06,073
get their email address. Yeah, we email convert every user

914
00:52:06,153 --> 00:52:09,395
basically. So it's kind of a worst case scenario option. We

915
00:52:09,415 --> 00:52:11,577
would rather have something else but. I like that he's like,

916
00:52:11,637 --> 00:52:15,420
hold the phone. You say email convert, but what about kids?

917
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:21,176
Um, well I mean we're a 13 and over game so that doesn't affect me.

918
00:52:21,276 --> 00:52:22,839
So you kind of just dumped that, what about everyone else?

919
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:23,860
So, uh...

920
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,463
How do you communicate with kids on your platforms?

921
00:52:26,098 --> 00:52:30,241
Yeah, I mean, for mobile, using a mobile-specific tool is

922
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:35,065
ideally the best way to do it, something that can be

923
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:38,628
integrated into your app through an API and directly

924
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:40,009
message inside your client.

925
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,751
That's what we do for Crusaders of Light.

926
00:52:43,572 --> 00:52:46,735
The challenge is that our mobile-specific tool doesn't

927
00:52:47,075 --> 00:52:47,675
go to PC.

928
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:51,261
So for PC, we're doing email conversion.

929
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:53,845
And for mobile, we're doing the tool in the app.

930
00:52:54,626 --> 00:52:55,407
It works fairly well.

931
00:52:56,168 --> 00:52:57,190
It's not ideal.

932
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:58,973
Using email is never ideal.

933
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:03,179
But PC players tend to do better with it than mobile

934
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:04,201
players, in my experience.

935
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,362
But the COPA compliance stuff, you're right.

936
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:10,064
It's challenging, and it's challenging, and it's different

937
00:53:10,384 --> 00:53:11,844
in different countries.

938
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:14,646
But yeah, that's a tough one.

939
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:16,907
Let me know when you figure it out.

940
00:53:16,967 --> 00:53:19,468
When you're dealing with children, usually you count

941
00:53:19,548 --> 00:53:21,209
on the parents to contact you.

942
00:53:21,649 --> 00:53:24,330
And that's where we get most of our contacts, is

943
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,070
directly from them.

944
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:27,772
We're legally obligated to let the parent know that we can

945
00:53:27,832 --> 00:53:29,833
contact that child if they end up signing.

946
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:31,113
We can talk about this later.

947
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:36,234
So I know community management is about a lot more than

948
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:41,316
telling people when they're being mean and getting them to

949
00:53:41,336 --> 00:53:41,996
stop being mean.

950
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:45,878
But say you do have a griefy player, just hypothetically,

951
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,739
or you do see that coming into the community a lot.

952
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,740
How active should a code of conduct or community

953
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,441
guidelines be in the discussion?

954
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:58,303
And how much is that leading the?

955
00:54:00,844 --> 00:54:03,206
a fomenting of a better community for any of you.

956
00:54:04,468 --> 00:54:07,070
I think it's extraordinarily important to

957
00:54:07,992 --> 00:54:12,216
maintain a code of conduct or just some community standards because

958
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:18,043
as you know I've done the math it's less than one half of one percent of your

959
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:19,184
players will be griefers.

960
00:54:19,644 --> 00:54:23,065
Those are the people who are clogging up your communication channels,

961
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:27,607
being absolute jerks to each other and innocent bystanders.

962
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:32,429
And there is no reason to keep them in game, even if they have a high lifetime value,

963
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:37,571
because they negatively affect hundreds of other people.

964
00:54:37,851 --> 00:54:39,771
So at Trion we have...

965
00:54:40,332 --> 00:54:43,155
been actively clamping down on this and

966
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:49,461
Our own CEO has been in game and giving people mutes and that's kind of cool to see and then he sends a broadcast

967
00:54:49,842 --> 00:54:54,246
Yeah, he sends a broadcast out across the server saying hey, yeah

968
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:59,052
You know we have just given chat mutes to the people who were disrupting our good time tonight

969
00:54:59,072 --> 00:55:00,893
Have a you know have a great evening

970
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:06,781
And the chat erupts with applause because nobody wants to look at that stuff.

971
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:11,907
You know, you've got filters in game if you don't want to see swear words, but I use the

972
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:13,108
occasional expletive.

973
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:14,530
We don't care about that.

974
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,633
We care about ongoing abuse and disruption in the game.

975
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:19,195
We don't need those people.

976
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:21,338
They're not welcome in our house.

977
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:29,765
But every company is different. Some companies think that that sort of nasty toxicity is what the game is all about.

978
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:33,008
Not for try-on games, but any of you guys?

979
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:39,814
I think that the community standards, beyond the terms of service and all that stuff that nobody is reading,

980
00:55:39,954 --> 00:55:43,777
but I actually like to engage directly with the community to say,

981
00:55:44,097 --> 00:55:46,379
here's the fundamentals, what are we missing?

982
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,681
And have them be a part of it.

983
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:56,894
The community evolves, they start parroting that information, they start being the arbiters

984
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:58,295
and helping people.

985
00:55:58,615 --> 00:55:59,276
Self-regulating.

986
00:55:59,336 --> 00:55:59,676
Yeah.

987
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:00,597
It is very much so.

988
00:56:00,697 --> 00:56:03,760
And sometimes people who, you know, there are those people that Linda's describing,

989
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,421
that very small percentage.

990
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:04,541
Tiny.

991
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:04,601
Um.

992
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:04,801
So, yeah.

993
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:05,181
So, yeah.

994
00:56:05,201 --> 00:56:05,361
So, yeah.

995
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:05,542
So, yeah.

996
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:05,882
So, yeah.

997
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:06,142
So, yeah.

998
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:06,302
So, yeah.

999
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:06,462
So, yeah.

1000
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:06,623
So, yeah.

1001
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:06,823
So, yeah.

1002
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:07,183
So, yeah.

1003
00:56:07,203 --> 00:56:07,343
So, yeah.

1004
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:07,543
So, yeah.

1005
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:12,085
And they're easily removed because they are toxic, no matter how much money they contribute.

1006
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:14,667
But there are those people that just have a bad day.

1007
00:56:15,587 --> 00:56:20,051
So having the policy, but having that way to get back into good graces.

1008
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,652
Because when you do that, they'll...

1009
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:23,853
Yeah, it's usually escalating.

1010
00:56:24,073 --> 00:56:26,095
So we have five minutes left, so we're going to go to lightning round now.

1011
00:56:26,295 --> 00:56:26,455
Yes!

1012
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,057
So you are the first contestant in lightning round.

1013
00:56:31,407 --> 00:56:32,849
So, may I ask him a question, right?

1014
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:32,950
Yeah.

1015
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:33,611
You have some time?

1016
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:33,891
Cool.

1017
00:56:34,552 --> 00:56:35,494
Thank you for the great discussion.

1018
00:56:35,755 --> 00:56:38,099
I'm a marketing guy, not a community manager,

1019
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:40,303
so I have a tricky one for you.

1020
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:48,916
When you run a big PC MMO with a lifetime of several years, we usually see that there is a part of the

1021
00:56:48,936 --> 00:56:59,225
community that behave toxic, that usually complains about monetization, bugs, and stuff. But when the

1022
00:56:59,245 --> 00:57:04,389
product changes, the problems have been solved. And when you do a user acquisition campaign

1023
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:09,954
several years after the launch, the users actually Google the name of the game.

1024
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:16,458
They actually confront, they discover this toxic part of the community that always complains

1025
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:16,978
about stuff.

1026
00:57:17,278 --> 00:57:21,701
But at this point, the stuff, they're not the actual problems right now, they're myths

1027
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:23,622
that have been solved before.

1028
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:30,167
So could you give any advice on how to communicate with the newcomers, for the new players, that

1029
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:34,790
discover this toxic part of the community so they won't fall under their influence?

1030
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:38,894
So you shake off the old baggage and try to communicate to new players that this stuff

1031
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,656
has been fixed, but there it is in Google.

1032
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:50,048
It's quite challenging to pull that off sometimes because people can come in with very strong

1033
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:52,110
expectations and bad memories and whatever else.

1034
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:57,812
I have found that probably the best single way of getting that addressed is having your

1035
00:57:57,952 --> 00:58:01,674
user base be really well informed and be your biggest advocates, because they will go out

1036
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:05,755
there on every forum where somebody is saying something bad about some aspect of it that

1037
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:10,756
was fixed two years ago, and they will speak to it, even without your involvement.

1038
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:14,798
At the same time, we also monitor a lot of communications and content that's out there.

1039
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:19,264
I think the one last thing I'd say is you have to be extra

1040
00:58:19,284 --> 00:58:19,725
careful now.

1041
00:58:19,945 --> 00:58:22,947
From now on you don't get the luxury of having a bad day.

1042
00:58:22,987 --> 00:58:23,927
You have to be perfect.

1043
00:58:24,508 --> 00:58:28,630
Because every time you screw up in the future, calls back and

1044
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,111
reinforces what happened behind.

1045
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:33,794
So I mean it's just constant vigilance is the only way to

1046
00:58:33,894 --> 00:58:34,314
address it.

1047
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:35,995
At the end of this we have a little breakout session.

1048
00:58:36,035 --> 00:58:39,577
I want to give you some little advice that worked for me for

1049
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:40,198
something like this.

1050
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:41,939
But when we're done we can talk a little.

1051
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:42,319
Cool.

1052
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:42,719
Thank you.

1053
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,501
I can't really see you so find me.

1054
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:45,621
And me.

1055
00:58:47,844 --> 00:58:51,991
I just realized I have way too many questions. It was a great session. Thank you. Maybe I'll

1056
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:56,137
take it up later. So I'm going to try to keep it short. Just some feedback regarding the

1057
00:58:56,177 --> 00:59:01,785
kids. I work with the MMORPG game for kids, for girls between 9 and 15. I'm for speeding.

1058
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:02,926
Hi, Sasha Table here.

1059
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:06,588
And just so you know, because we have underage kids,

1060
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:10,190
Copa is only for US and always requires email verification.

1061
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,711
And if you want to have a customer support for kids,

1062
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:15,172
use the email verification system, the parent email

1063
00:59:15,192 --> 00:59:16,233
verification system, sorry.

1064
00:59:16,673 --> 00:59:19,054
And soon the GDPR is coming for Europe, so get prepared

1065
00:59:19,074 --> 00:59:19,634
for that as well.

1066
00:59:23,596 --> 00:59:29,538
So, I'm just going to have one question. Because we have an underage audience, we don't have

1067
00:59:29,578 --> 00:59:33,500
forum. Most of our audience is actually on Instagram and Facebook. And when I mean a

1068
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,401
lot, I mean we get like 20,000 likes on Instagram and 500 comments.

1069
00:59:37,762 --> 00:59:38,502
It's huge.

1070
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:39,402
Yeah.

1071
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:40,783
Well done.

1072
00:59:41,283 --> 00:59:42,043
Yeah, yay.

1073
00:59:42,964 --> 00:59:44,725
But Instagram is not a good platform

1074
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:46,707
to have a good conversation.

1075
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:49,769
So we are currently actually looking at how we solve this.

1076
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:51,370
And I would really like to hear your feedback

1077
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,271
from your experiences, from your experience.

1078
00:59:53,712 --> 00:59:56,033
Would it be better to build our own platform due

1079
00:59:56,073 --> 00:59:57,874
to the age of our audience, or actually

1080
00:59:57,934 --> 00:59:59,115
use one of the existing platforms

1081
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:00,556
for the communication?

1082
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:03,098
Let me ask you real fast.

1083
01:00:03,278 --> 01:00:05,340
Use the existing platforms to move them into your own.

1084
01:00:05,886 --> 01:00:07,207
We are not on Steam, yeah.

1085
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:08,228
We are very specific.

1086
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:11,791
We just have website, you have download the launcher, and we are not on Steam.

1087
01:00:13,772 --> 01:00:14,012
Yeah.

1088
01:00:14,453 --> 01:00:17,896
I don't think there's necessarily a simple answer to that one, but...

1089
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:19,677
But we'll jump out.

1090
01:00:19,697 --> 01:00:21,218
We do have a little breakouts that we can chat some more.

1091
01:00:21,238 --> 01:00:21,539
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1092
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:21,659
Okay.

1093
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:22,439
That was actually my question.

1094
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:22,760
There we go.

1095
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,020
How to win?

1096
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:23,921
How to win?

1097
01:00:23,981 --> 01:00:24,221
How to win?

1098
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:24,501
How to win?

1099
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:25,102
How to win?

1100
01:00:25,202 --> 01:00:25,422
How to win?

1101
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:25,682
How to win?

1102
01:00:25,702 --> 01:00:25,942
How to win?

1103
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:26,363
How to win?

1104
01:00:26,718 --> 01:00:28,159
Hey, Philipp, founder of Stumped.

1105
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:31,082
So we have developed a feedback platform for in-game feedback.

1106
01:00:32,163 --> 01:00:35,986
And my question is, how does your feedback process look like,

1107
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:37,347
or feedback management process?

1108
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,830
Are you trying to close the feedback loop?

1109
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:43,253
Or it's hard to get back to specific persons

1110
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,074
on specific channels, especially as you're

1111
01:00:45,094 --> 01:00:47,476
collecting feedback from so many different channels.

1112
01:00:47,516 --> 01:00:49,098
So how do you manage that?

1113
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:51,099
Is it even possible for you right now?

1114
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:53,954
It's not impossible, but it's important.

1115
01:00:54,134 --> 01:00:55,635
It's very time consuming.

1116
01:00:56,455 --> 01:01:01,517
With our games, each platform has its own feedback system because you're going to have

1117
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,819
different problems depending on what platform the game is on.

1118
01:01:05,399 --> 01:01:10,221
But if we look at PC, for instance, our players can report issues within game.

1119
01:01:11,102 --> 01:01:15,263
And we regularly have live streams where we advise people on how to make the perfect bug

1120
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:17,544
report so that things will actually get changed.

1121
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:23,797
Yeah, well do it because it's actually we had a very good discussion about this.

1122
01:01:24,578 --> 01:01:29,580
But typically that that feedback goes straight to the QA team from within game

1123
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,502
and there is no feedback coming the other way. So inevitably somebody will

1124
01:01:34,522 --> 01:01:37,864
post something similar to the forums and we honestly use the forums because these

1125
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:42,946
can be very complex issues and there can be very long discussions following them

1126
01:01:42,986 --> 01:01:43,306
as well.

1127
01:01:43,707 --> 01:01:48,231
So the people who are interested in getting the feedback on what they're submitting will

1128
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,614
go to the forums, and typically this is in the bug report section of the forums.

1129
01:01:51,654 --> 01:01:52,535
That's all it's for.

1130
01:01:52,935 --> 01:01:56,879
And our QA guys will respond there, our devs will respond there, and of course we will

1131
01:01:56,919 --> 01:02:02,124
respond there because it's a very public arena where you can also, if the same question comes

1132
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:06,588
up on Twitter, I can go, yes, this discussion is ongoing right now, and put a link to that

1133
01:02:06,668 --> 01:02:09,931
forum thread so that they can look into it as much as they want to.

1134
01:02:10,347 --> 01:02:14,909
Linda, do you encourage your QA folks or people who may be solving those bugs or those problems

1135
01:02:15,009 --> 01:02:16,349
to communicate directly with players?

1136
01:02:18,129 --> 01:02:22,911
We prefer to do it on the forums because then it's a one-to-many relationship.

1137
01:02:22,931 --> 01:02:27,552
So then they're responding to not just that one person but publicly to everyone.

1138
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:28,332
Very smart point.

1139
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:31,013
But you do like them to go onto the forums and speak to masses?

1140
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:31,993
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1141
01:02:32,273 --> 01:02:33,534
That's where the industry is headed.

1142
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:34,454
Our devs, QA guys.

1143
01:02:34,614 --> 01:02:34,874
Yeah.

1144
01:02:34,994 --> 01:02:35,374
Okay.

1145
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:35,754
Yeah.

1146
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:36,435
So.

1147
01:02:39,427 --> 01:02:40,848
I tried to reach out to each of you.

1148
01:02:40,868 --> 01:02:41,929
We are linked in beforehand.

1149
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,370
So if one of you could give me feedback, or a lot of you,

1150
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:45,891
later on to the solution we have developed.

1151
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:47,111
Yeah, we'll step outside and have a chat.

1152
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:47,832
Yeah, absolutely.

1153
01:02:48,072 --> 01:02:48,592
Last question.

1154
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:49,473
All right.

1155
01:02:49,633 --> 01:02:50,933
Once again, thank you for the great session.

1156
01:02:52,754 --> 01:02:55,516
Going from a team that dealt with a couple thousand players

1157
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:58,237
to now three actively supported games and millions of players.

1158
01:02:59,622 --> 01:03:04,428
Is there any tools you found, especially recently, to help you just monitor the feedback you're

1159
01:03:04,469 --> 01:03:04,769
getting?

1160
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:07,232
Any sort of automated systems?

1161
01:03:07,873 --> 01:03:10,036
These are tonal evaluations that you find work?

1162
01:03:10,076 --> 01:03:12,138
Or is it all mostly pure bullshit?

1163
01:03:12,198 --> 01:03:16,224
There's a panel that we need to, yeah, or a roundtable or something.

1164
01:03:16,784 --> 01:03:18,326
We need to do that.

1165
01:03:18,386 --> 01:03:22,592
There's a lot that come close, but I find that oftentimes and painfully you've got to

1166
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:27,999
have this patchwork of, you know, Firebase plus this, plus that, plus, you know, yeah.

1167
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:32,906
There's no one tool that will do it for you and there's no substitute for the human mind

1168
01:03:32,986 --> 01:03:35,068
to filter out what really needs to be addressed.

1169
01:03:35,469 --> 01:03:40,332
So what we have is we have a team of community managers and then we also have contractors.

1170
01:03:40,372 --> 01:03:45,575
The much maligned Richard Weil, for instance, works for ModSquad and they provide us with...

1171
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:50,578
We have six games but we have one moderator on.

1172
01:03:50,718 --> 01:03:54,559
24-7. And these people switch out, of course, around the clock.

1173
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:59,900
And what they do is they go through all of our communication platforms, just a constant cycle.

1174
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,020
Sweet.

1175
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,681
And they call out issues that we should be addressing.

1176
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:08,742
And, you know, they bring that to our special channel, then we send it off to Dev or CS or whoever else,

1177
01:04:09,082 --> 01:04:10,582
or we dive in ourselves to do it.

1178
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:16,364
But there is no substitute for having a knowledgeable individual with good instincts

1179
01:04:16,404 --> 01:04:18,224
who's going through this stuff manually.

1180
01:04:18,544 --> 01:04:20,545
And it's not as expensive as you might think.

1181
01:04:21,346 --> 01:04:21,766
No, it's not.

1182
01:04:22,006 --> 01:04:24,410
And also, I just think you lose a tremendous amount.

1183
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:27,354
How many of you launched through the Google Play Store?

1184
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:32,239
There are little random words, you know, like one word is like love.

1185
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,402
And you know, you're like, what, love what?

1186
01:04:35,422 --> 01:04:36,503
Like, love to hate your game.

1187
01:04:36,523 --> 01:04:38,364
It's like, that doesn't make any sense.

1188
01:04:38,404 --> 01:04:39,245
But no, it's a pain.

1189
01:04:39,265 --> 01:04:39,345
Yeah.

1190
01:04:39,465 --> 01:04:40,026
Love to hate.

1191
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:44,409
Yeah, I concur with earlier, because we've dealt with the Steam negative review bomb

1192
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:45,830
before, as well as other things.

1193
01:04:45,891 --> 01:04:46,871
And it mostly cleared up.

1194
01:04:46,931 --> 01:04:50,715
But when it happens, it's like, how do I react to this feedback?

1195
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:52,376
It's not usable in any way.

1196
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:52,656
Right.

1197
01:04:52,776 --> 01:04:53,337
Yeah, yeah.

1198
01:04:53,437 --> 01:04:54,157
But Linda's right.

1199
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,538
And also, you can't be awake 24-7.

1200
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:55,879
Nobody can.

1201
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,503
So, yeah, Mod Squad, they're awesome.

1202
01:04:59,523 --> 01:05:02,647
There are lots of different services that do that for people,

1203
01:05:02,727 --> 01:05:04,549
but that happens to be the one that many of us use.

1204
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:05,450
I do like Mod Squad, too.

1205
01:05:06,432 --> 01:05:07,012
We gotta cut it, guys.

1206
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:08,194
I just don't like that Richard Wilde.

1207
01:05:08,214 --> 01:05:09,375
Oh, yeah, I know that Richard Wilde.

1208
01:05:09,395 --> 01:05:10,317
We are well past done.

1209
01:05:10,517 --> 01:05:11,218
Thank you, guys.

1210
01:05:11,298 --> 01:05:12,199
Hey, thanks for hanging out.

1211
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:12,800
Thank you, everyone.

1212
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:13,841
We're gonna stand out in the...
