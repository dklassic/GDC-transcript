1
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:14,456
And also, if you could fill out the little flyer or the, what is it?

2
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:16,596
The survey, yeah.

3
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:18,297
If you can get that done, that would be great.

4
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:20,457
I would really appreciate feedback on this.

5
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:25,118
So everyone's all settled, I'll get started.

6
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,400
My name is Sarah Bonser, and I'll be talking with you today about world building with architecture.

7
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:35,527
and more specifically, designing for an authentic experience.

8
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:38,449
I know that sounds a lot like some words

9
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,631
you're familiar with, but authentic specifically relates

10
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,673
to how feelings are generated.

11
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:46,935
There's a way to get to engaging, immersive, unique,

12
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,798
et cetera, without encompassing this trait specifically.

13
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:54,780
For something to be perceived and remembered as authentic,

14
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:56,702
it can't feel manufactured.

15
00:00:57,362 --> 00:00:58,143
Authenticity is

16
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:01,424
best achieved below the level of consciousness.

17
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:04,065
Architecture is actually fantastic at this

18
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,225
because it requires no acknowledgement

19
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:07,366
for it to have an impact.

20
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:10,186
Bernard Schumi famously notes,

21
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,847
architecture cannot satisfy your wildest fantasies,

22
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:14,868
but it may exceed the limits set by them.

23
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:18,448
I'd imagine the opportunity to capture an audience

24
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:21,789
on it's got great architecture is exceptionally rare,

25
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,550
but the capacity to make a game unforgettable

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,290
with the help of architecture

27
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:28,111
appears to be unbounded by genre.

28
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,684
Architecture has the capacity to affect occupants,

29
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:36,466
whether it's behaviorally portraying a sense of space

30
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:40,228
or providing a lens through which to perceive information.

31
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,030
Levels work in a similar way,

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,951
organically teaching strategy,

33
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,732
providing a backdrop for lore, and divulging plot.

34
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,014
And admittedly, this is a lot to cover in an hour,

35
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:52,495
so here's a quick rundown.

36
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:53,815
I'm gonna catch everyone up

37
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:55,356
on relevant architectural theory,

38
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,837
then we'll look at how it's applied to video games

39
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:59,158
as well as some built structures.

40
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:03,901
After getting the hang of it, we'll go in depth into three well-known games as case studies.

41
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:06,163
I'll close out with some sources to learn more.

42
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:11,467
A little bit about me. I'm an artist and a licensed architect in the state of Washington.

43
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:16,171
I got some degrees from The Ohio State University and work as a project architect now.

44
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,039
And actually, there's a very rigorous process

45
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:20,879
to getting a license.

46
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,281
It's about 5,600 hours of apprenticeship, seven tests,

47
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:29,142
six years of school, and a state-mandated 1,000 hours

48
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:29,743
of the Sims?

49
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:31,123
No, that's not right.

50
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:35,445
Notably, theory is actually baked

51
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:38,806
into our profession through education,

52
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:40,587
whether we use it day to day or not.

53
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:42,388
We need it.

54
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:47,255
so that we can explain to any client or consultant

55
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:48,376
that we're working with,

56
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:51,117
whether they know architectural theory or not,

57
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:52,997
because it's good design

58
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,378
is not actually a viable defense for an idea.

59
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:59,940
This knowledge is the way to keep our concept intact

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,880
as constraints get layered on.

61
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,421
So that makes buildings like this look really impressive.

62
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,662
And as I mentioned before,

63
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:10,903
architecture works without the occupant's acknowledgement.

64
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:14,804
And I wanted to find how that works precisely.

65
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:17,247
There are a ton of little indicators,

66
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:19,769
scale of material, types of openings,

67
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:21,511
striation of level, and lighting.

68
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:24,934
Each of those little indicators informs a viewer

69
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:27,877
why, when, where, what, and who built this thing.

70
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:31,147
Even the context provides a lot of information.

71
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,688
So we see in this one, it's actually

72
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,709
manufactured materials that clad it.

73
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,011
That was built in a factory and had to get shipped to site

74
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:42,133
and had to get told to the people that are installing it

75
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:43,614
exactly where those go.

76
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:44,575
That's not a brick.

77
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:47,897
That's not something that you just lay on in a certain order.

78
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,478
That's not something that one person

79
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:52,820
is trained to do over many buildings that's

80
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,441
specific to that single building.

81
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,723
So that tells you a lot about the intent

82
00:03:57,763 --> 00:03:58,783
of what it's trying to convey,

83
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:02,485
and a lot of things about what kind of strategies

84
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:05,127
were employed to create the building.

85
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:08,649
These indicators allow a layperson

86
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,470
to pick up on characteristics of a building.

87
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,772
For instance, some buildings just look evil.

88
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,293
Shout out to our evil buildings for some of these ones.

89
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,574
Spikes, evil.

90
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:18,675
Going into space forever, evil.

91
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,656
Some angles, probably evil.

92
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,290
Without knowing anything else about it,

93
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,490
a first impression actually goes a long way

94
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,511
to evoke feelings.

95
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,152
Cirilio figured this out and codified it

96
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:32,012
with these two illustrations of comedic and tragic scenes.

97
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,794
These sets demonstrate a series of indicators

98
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,735
which set the context for how characters are feeling.

99
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,435
Take a moment to compare the two.

100
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:50,198
We'll start by looking at the tragic scene.

101
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:53,130
The tragic scene has a ton of gravity

102
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,212
as the space keeps going back into that set.

103
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,075
The buildings fall in line and stand at attention,

104
00:04:58,475 --> 00:04:59,697
enforcing center framing.

105
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,558
Cornices loom over the street

106
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:03,280
and decorations are carved in stone.

107
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,921
Then we compare this to the comedic scene,

108
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,182
where the buildings are individually expressive.

109
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:09,723
The massing does not appear

110
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,345
to have been coordinated overall.

111
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:15,407
Individuality is expressed through decoration

112
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,968
and articulation of colonnades.

113
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:19,869
We see a wider variety of architectural styles,

114
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,991
and these propose a more casual feel to the setting,

115
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,013
as they're far less subjected to rules

116
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:26,474
and overarching organization.

117
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,755
So let's look at these again.

118
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,182
and note the ways they're leaning on the set

119
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:35,043
to use that opportunity to show and not tell.

120
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:39,504
Unlike relying solely on dialogue for storytelling,

121
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:41,285
where you must select a reading level

122
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:42,165
that you're catering to,

123
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,966
environments have the unique opportunity

124
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:47,286
of displaying layered information to players,

125
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:49,527
freeing designers from catering solely

126
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:50,768
to the largest demographic.

127
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,468
So let's just take a moment to look at

128
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:55,429
how levels have been used in the past.

129
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:58,395
We'll start with the extrusion of the ground floor

130
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,379
and how that's clad in indicative textures.

131
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,860
So these are strictly informative.

132
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,643
They tell you where the bounds of your playable area are.

133
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,106
From there, we got these graphically excellent

134
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,407
illustrations of architecture,

135
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:16,131
but not necessarily functioning beyond something like a set.

136
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,914
Shortly after, we see architecture being used

137
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,556
to fill in narrative gaps for players.

138
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:25,793
It can be also used to indicate advantageous strategies

139
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,353
for upcoming obstacles.

140
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:31,054
Since then, we've seen many sophisticated combat games

141
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:33,275
leverage level design for strategic purposes.

142
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:36,736
But what's even more interesting to me

143
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:39,377
is something that's on the cusp of my own reach

144
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,978
as an architect, empathy.

145
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:44,913
This is a fascinating direction for games to move

146
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,295
because it can make the problems of others

147
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:48,776
seem familiar and relatable.

148
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,598
Specifically, creating an emotional impact

149
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,320
on an adult audience requires authenticity.

150
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,242
I see an unparalleled potential for this medium

151
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:00,164
as it has evolved to this in just two short decades.

152
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:06,149
Architectural theory has some ability

153
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:10,472
to help clarify opportunities to impact spaces

154
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:11,313
and

155
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,040
how that can affect occupants.

156
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,981
Writing topics can also serve as a guide

157
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,681
toward a more critical dialogue for game designers.

158
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,442
We'll start by looking design

159
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:24,362
in the most utilitarian application,

160
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:25,902
introducing a player to a game.

161
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:29,803
Tutorials can be the most immersion-breaking moment in a game.

162
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:31,343
The character and the player

163
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,224
are at opposite ends of the spectrum.

164
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:35,444
Presumably, the character has been running

165
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:36,404
and jumping for years,

166
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:38,184
but the player is being asked to do this

167
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,105
for the very first time.

168
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:43,505
Having control over the environment means supplying

169
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,286
information to the player intentionally.

170
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:48,247
Put simply, overt design requires the player

171
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:49,227
to gather information.

172
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,989
Subversive design gives the player information.

173
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,071
Overt design calls for the audience to draw information

174
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:59,231
about complex subjects.

175
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:02,153
You can use it to convey history, social norms,

176
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:05,114
and political climate from surrounding atmosphere,

177
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:08,095
similar to the way you learn about a city's culture

178
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:08,875
by traveling there.

179
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:12,204
The urban fabric is heavily influenced

180
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,405
by the culture of an area.

181
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:16,448
Most people can recognize the plan of Paris

182
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:18,751
because this bizarro thing happened.

183
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,274
This guy Hausman came in with this plan

184
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:22,775
to get some avenues in there,

185
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,318
and it took about 75 years to carry out.

186
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,862
So that threw it into this way different trajectory

187
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:31,825
than any other city, giving it a sense of place.

188
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,794
Subversive design conveys information passively,

189
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:38,876
like designing a push and pull side for a door handle,

190
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:40,417
which looks visually different,

191
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:43,319
or tactile transition surfaces for pedestrians

192
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,960
going into a vehicular area.

193
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:48,502
In louder ways, it can direct you to take the stairs

194
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:49,483
instead of an elevator.

195
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,844
Without being tied to a single language,

196
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:54,326
we can universally convey a lot of information.

197
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:59,048
One concept which architects grapple with

198
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:00,789
is this idea of consciousness.

199
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:05,055
Phenomenology is a word that I'll try not to bank on,

200
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:09,277
but it breaks down to something that adds to ambiance.

201
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:12,959
It registers as a coincidence or a phenomenon

202
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,860
and creates an experience

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,101
below the level of acknowledgement by the occupant.

204
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:21,022
Plot should register above consciousness

205
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:23,323
as the player needs to have an understanding

206
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,665
of why they're providing actions towards a role

207
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,386
and foreshadowing as a tool becomes available

208
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,166
once that context is understood.

209
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,301
Doom 2 actually uses both very skillfully

210
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,043
as information is baked into the game environment,

211
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:40,246
providing lore and strategic information to the player.

212
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,248
It trains the player over a series of levels

213
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,811
to navigate the halls of hell more adeptly.

214
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,513
Your character is a paranoid space marine

215
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:50,795
armed with a pistol methodically working his way

216
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:51,916
through a demon stronghold.

217
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:55,279
This environment uses lines and lights

218
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,440
to direct you through the level.

219
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:01,762
Soon you'll find yourself pressing up against walls, frantically searching for more supplies.

220
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:07,007
Doom leverages overt cues to teach the player where to look for supplies using gargoyles

221
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:07,888
and grotesqueries.

222
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:13,136
Later levels appear to have a ritualistic or religious aesthetic to them.

223
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:19,658
Items decorating scenes have a strong hierarchical and symmetrical design sensibility.

224
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:25,200
These indicators prime the player to imagine answers to questions they have about the environment.

225
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,922
When monsters spawn or you get dropped into a pit, it can be attributed to any of the

226
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:31,643
various reasons your brain came up with.

227
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,269
This leverages the player's imagination

228
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:36,510
to come up with more convincing reasons

229
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,352
than you as a designer could possibly predict for them.

230
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,555
Portal and its sequel also rely on gameplay

231
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,376
with gradually increasing complexity.

232
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:48,018
According to Chris Chin at Valve,

233
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:51,920
the first few puzzles scale from one solution to multiple

234
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,882
as the player gains more agency over the character.

235
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:58,298
Using colored light and iconography,

236
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:01,861
the players will gravitate towards certain areas predictably.

237
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:05,944
The grid also provides this burdensome backdrop

238
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:06,805
for the test chambers.

239
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,888
And those gridlines you see really tap into this idea

240
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:12,069
of modular furniture

241
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,511
being primarily consumed as oppressive.

242
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:18,133
Modular materials are classically used in large spaces

243
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:20,315
with no particular interest in hospitality,

244
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:22,917
and notably do not tap into fond memories.

245
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:25,679
DMVs are riddled with these materials, for instance.

246
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:31,259
These inherent thought processes allow Portal to snap the player

247
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,260
into the character's mindset of escape.

248
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,041
As a result, Gladys and Wheatley dialogue

249
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:39,062
doesn't have to tell you how to feel or what to do.

250
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:42,623
This results in an organic and authentic experience

251
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:44,363
for the player, given the opportunity

252
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,764
to graft their own thoughts onto the canvas as well.

253
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:51,126
Destiny 2 is interesting because the multiplayer maps,

254
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,126
of course, don't tell you how to navigate

255
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,367
and where advantageous locations are.

256
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,183
But sight lines and organic movement still happen.

257
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:02,406
And it brings the fights around the mountain.

258
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:05,749
So focused scrimmage areas migrate as sniping locations

259
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,270
perform as a catalyst.

260
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,173
While the game is technically and graphically excellent,

261
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,655
the campaign doesn't leverage the layout

262
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,057
of the environment in the same way.

263
00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:19,400
It doesn't provide any inherent wayfinding.

264
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:23,124
This is only evident as a bar because

265
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,458
The Crucible maps are so good at this.

266
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,900
In the opening mission, Homecoming,

267
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,361
it relies heavily on voiceovers and HUD.

268
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:34,463
As a result of this, your Ghost and Vanguards

269
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:37,625
forego some opportunities to directly characterize themselves.

270
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:40,587
They actively direct your player through the map.

271
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:44,229
This undermines the immersive feel of Agency.

272
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:47,831
As a result, the storyline must keep raising the stakes

273
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:50,112
in order to continue to have an impact on the player.

274
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:54,297
To some extent, as a designer, you must reward your player

275
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:56,840
for pouring their own thoughts into their experience.

276
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:00,143
If you set a standard that ceilings are rewarding

277
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:02,466
and worthwhile to look at, you'll train your player

278
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:04,288
to use that information actively.

279
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:06,990
If you mail it in, you're likely to lose

280
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,292
a little bit of trust with the player.

281
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:09,513
It's kind of like sig figs.

282
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,357
How do architects build these expectations?

283
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:16,603
We'll go through a quick study noting specific elements

284
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:17,444
of their impacts.

285
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:19,306
And for the sake of this talk,

286
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:21,868
architecture can be described through its materiality,

287
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:24,030
adjacency, figure, light, and scale.

288
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,493
More complex ideas such as proportion and ratio

289
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,795
can be extrapolated from scale, for instance.

290
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:35,259
Zaha Hadid uses the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati

291
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,560
to make art accessible.

292
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,723
She uses a variety of tactics to achieve that accessibility,

293
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:42,805
tackling it from different directions.

294
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:45,736
So we'll take a moment to get acquainted

295
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:46,777
with Hadid's masterpiece.

296
00:13:57,426 --> 00:14:00,409
Hadid ushers in the public by continuing this concrete

297
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,271
from the sidewalk up the building in the wall.

298
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:05,994
The gesture allows the concrete

299
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,715
to characterize itself through texture.

300
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:09,777
It's scored and rough at the sidewalk

301
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:10,798
and honed in the lobby.

302
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:16,007
And it has this formwork texture as it turns up into the wall as a structural material.

303
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,749
The massing of the building relies on sliding boxes indicating function.

304
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,532
She shows how exhibition spaces are laid out via the facade.

305
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:29,475
Direct sunlight isn't good for art, therefore the space will be devoid of functional windows.

306
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:34,517
This indicates individual collections and creates a hierarchy for their understanding

307
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:36,058
and relationships.

308
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:39,313
Natural light indicates public space.

309
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,174
It's completely glazed and not just punched openings.

310
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,195
The vertical scale of the public space

311
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:45,616
also allows for natural light

312
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,896
to reach deep into the structure.

313
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:51,599
And I'll have you note that the entire wall is that window.

314
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,679
It's a curtain wall.

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,261
And it goes up that chasm that is the stairwell

316
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,262
that you'll see here.

317
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,664
The exaggerated lighting contrasts the public space

318
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:04,886
from the exhibit areas, which cannot be naturally lit.

319
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:08,496
This provides a subversive cue for the occupant

320
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:12,597
to speak quietly or move slowly in gallery spaces,

321
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:15,218
while still providing a visual relationship

322
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:16,619
to that vertical circulation.

323
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:19,920
So there's a lot of moving pieces in this one,

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,201
and they all work to make art seem more accessible.

325
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:26,077
Hadid pursues motive from a variety of angles

326
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,078
and uses multiple design tools.

327
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:30,719
This adds to the impact and legibility,

328
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,541
but also takes on an opportunity for improvement

329
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,882
for future architects to use it as inspiration.

330
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:41,704
We'll analyze three games, two AAA titles,

331
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:43,645
and one of them is indie, but pretty well known.

332
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:46,066
I chose popular games for the case studies

333
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:48,127
such that most of the audience will be familiar

334
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,107
with the story and the lore.

335
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:52,985
These games hold architecture accountable

336
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:55,107
for different aspects of world building,

337
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,689
and I'll break down the opportunities they chose to take

338
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,271
as well as a few they might have missed.

339
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:01,813
Breath of the Wild uses architecture

340
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:04,235
to communicate cultural values and history.

341
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:08,599
Fallout 3 uses it to cohesively tell a nonlinear story.

342
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,263
Inside uses it in lieu of dialogue and text to tell a story.

343
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:15,865
FYI, there will be spoilers.

344
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,247
I'll start with Breath of the Wild.

345
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:21,978
My favorite part of this game was seeing the villages.

346
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,920
They established Link as a visitor,

347
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,881
which adds to the authenticity.

348
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:28,203
The lore has been built up by preceding

349
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:29,404
Legend of Zelda games,

350
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:31,665
but designers don't rely on that alone.

351
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:35,348
Each village requires Link to earn an augment to reach

352
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,510
or move through the area, creating a destination

353
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,311
as opposed to something you just stumble upon,

354
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:42,613
which overall is a very successful strategy

355
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:43,574
for an open world game.

356
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:46,056
In fact, the open nature of this world

357
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:48,737
has created an emphasis on profile

358
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,918
as a defining navigational feature.

359
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,839
For instance, the stables look like horses.

360
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,460
If you see them from a distance,

361
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,341
you can tell you need to put your horse there.

362
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:58,901
You're drawn to its profile,

363
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:02,183
which actually exists in real life architecture,

364
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:03,783
but it's not nearly as effective.

365
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:07,004
Architecture parlant, or speaking architecture,

366
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,085
visually describes its own function.

367
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,426
Modern parlant has become synonymous

368
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:14,487
with these literal recreations of profile.

369
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:16,813
It's an attention-hungry move.

370
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:19,035
And the worst part about it

371
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:21,116
is that they're just boxes on the inside.

372
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:24,559
That's just like a concrete sculpture

373
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,880
that's been put over a box.

374
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,081
It's gross.

375
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,374
But Breath of the Wild commits to it,

376
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:33,455
which allows the player to get a little bit more information

377
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:34,235
out of the skyline.

378
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,936
It's composed of shapes that are already recognizable

379
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:40,777
that can provide a meaning to things

380
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:42,537
before you have to learn about them.

381
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,398
This gives the player agency,

382
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:47,158
allowing inherent recognition skills to pay off.

383
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:51,686
It's also used as a primary design feature

384
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:52,747
for the Divine Beasts.

385
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,689
They have a cohesive model with the interior

386
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:57,511
adhering to the exterior envelope

387
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,632
and that makes it way better.

388
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:02,255
Actually, it creates this great exquisite corpse

389
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,456
because you can even rotate the parts around.

390
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:08,219
So we'll focus on the Rito Village,

391
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,461
which is elevated by a nearby landscape.

392
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,811
The divine beast is perched at the top of the spire,

393
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:16,452
just like a bird, and the air drafts in the area

394
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,174
pick up, similar to turbulence around real mountains.

395
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,777
The village is lightweight wood frame construction.

396
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:27,078
Fabric is a cladding material,

397
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:30,260
which is uniquely advantaged in virtual architecture,

398
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,461
and ritos, like birds, can fly,

399
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,162
so wind direction is important to them.

400
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:38,024
So feathers and fabric could feasibly serve a purpose.

401
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:43,126
This allows visual correlation also to fuselages and gliders.

402
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,908
And it's great considering how that contrasts the Goron's

403
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,549
heavy timber construction.

404
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,790
And actually, this is something we use in real life.

405
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,631
A heavy timber is actually fire resistant.

406
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,271
It creates a char around the outside,

407
00:18:57,212 --> 00:19:00,433
which prevents it from burning down as easily as lightweight

408
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:01,313
wood frame construction.

409
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:05,023
So it works twofold as the Gorons actually have very large hands

410
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:08,464
and would most likely not care to articulate their handrails

411
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:09,404
with fine details.

412
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:13,086
So there's a lot of ways the level characterizes itself.

413
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:16,347
But it also manages to foreshadow events as well.

414
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:19,788
Just like movies, the level designers and environment

415
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,989
artists decorated these scenes with props.

416
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:25,350
It's exceptionally impressive that these

417
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,051
work after giving the camera controls to a player.

418
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:34,074
The profile of the hut is bell-shaped and framed out of wood,

419
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,275
which ends up looking like a birdcage,

420
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:39,177
but it also matches the profile of that shrine

421
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:41,038
more closely than any of the other buildings.

422
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:45,662
This introduces the concept as what we call a dialectic,

423
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:47,623
providing two ends of the spectrum,

424
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:50,425
embedded stone versus elevated wood frame.

425
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:54,209
And the concept of primitive hut is taught this way

426
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:55,570
by two warring concepts.

427
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:58,733
Perrault and Logier, on opposite ends of the spectrum,

428
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:01,675
Perrault proposes that architecture started

429
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,076
with a hut embedded in the earth.

430
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,017
We consider this vernacular architecture

431
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:07,680
or architecture without architects.

432
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,142
Logier proposes that it happened the first time

433
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,064
columns and entablature were used.

434
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:15,586
But if this was the case,

435
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:16,887
I don't know if that's happened yet.

436
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,248
I haven't seen trees do that.

437
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:24,706
Introducing both allows that profile to work in two ways

438
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:27,168
and allows the player to fill in gaps,

439
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:31,010
allowing some indication of the origin of that design.

440
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,392
And as with every great accomplishment,

441
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,934
there's always some way to evolve or improve the concept.

442
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:40,296
So I'd say the next step would be to create slightly more

443
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,217
varied typologies from the exterior.

444
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:45,039
Providing exterior variety to the huts

445
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,780
could allow more characterization

446
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,621
and create a spectrum of viable Rideau style huts.

447
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:52,816
They're not distinctive from the exterior,

448
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:55,616
which is odd as they're not intended to be manufactured.

449
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:58,917
Precise, perhaps, but the organic nature of the layout

450
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,897
would also indicate that it's not the intended takeaway.

451
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:06,118
Shops and interactive huts require you

452
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:08,518
to pass through the threshold to distinguish function.

453
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,799
This problem is, of course, alleviated

454
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:14,699
by showing certain items for sale

455
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,700
or these little chick hammocks, which are kinda cute.

456
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,400
They use colored textiles as well

457
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,420
to customize the interior.

458
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,421
So as I mentioned before, Breath of the Wild

459
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,143
does an excellent job introducing

460
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:26,164
a variety of cultures.

461
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,868
It provides comparable design moments

462
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,011
to demonstrate nuanced information

463
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:33,635
that can be distinguished between different villages

464
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:33,975
as well.

465
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,950
Moving on to Fallout 3, it was an ambitious reboot

466
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,230
to an isometric series.

467
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:44,471
It introduces concrete visualizations

468
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,772
to an already established world, which is hard.

469
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,932
The series is laden with lore and subplots

470
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:51,973
which allow an experience to become

471
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,873
more or less catered to each player.

472
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:56,814
The landmark buildings are where the level designers

473
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:58,574
chose to convey more abstract goals,

474
00:21:58,674 --> 00:22:02,235
so that's what I'm gonna be using as a specific critique.

475
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:08,518
And not meant to negativity, but there are a lot of reasonable decisions that I believe

476
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,901
led to a less than impactful location, 10 penny tower.

477
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:14,302
I think there's a lot we can learn from this, though.

478
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:17,144
So I'll start with the datum of expectation.

479
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:20,046
Megaton had a lot of roles in this game.

480
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:22,327
Primarily, it establishes that datum.

481
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:28,031
It uses materials and layout to convey a concept of makeshift space planning.

482
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,995
They also established the distinction between friendly

483
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:34,416
and hostile settlements by walling the city off.

484
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:37,817
Circular walled cities historically have indicated

485
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:42,058
a culturally important epicenter, which is true in Megaton.

486
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:44,278
Everything has a view of that bomb,

487
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:45,939
centrally located in the city.

488
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,680
It showcases constraints of new cities,

489
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,101
lacking means to fabricate and time to design and construct.

490
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,522
This contributes to the characterization

491
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:56,922
of the industrious wastelanders.

492
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,382
They're settling and developing not only single structures,

493
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:03,744
but managed to create a somewhat cohesive city from scraps.

494
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:08,066
So we see a fuselage from a plane underperforming

495
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:11,368
as its previous life was flying through the air,

496
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:13,469
and now it's just simply a settlement.

497
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,051
So there are a lot of things that indicate to us

498
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:19,653
that this is a fallen from what it previously

499
00:23:19,713 --> 00:23:22,475
manufactured civilization, which is very interesting

500
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:25,756
and very quick to get that information to the player.

501
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:29,838
Rivet City creates a uniquely restrictive environment.

502
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:33,239
The city is hosted on a retired aircraft carrier,

503
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,960
which is a highly engineered vessel with precise openings.

504
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,361
Unlike Megaton, these parts were not scrapped and customized.

505
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:44,642
As a result, the citizens keep the structured lifestyle,

506
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:47,563
and it feels restrictive, even to the extent

507
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,084
that you must get permission to access it via the drawbridge.

508
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:54,545
The mall leveraged inspiration from existing architecture

509
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:55,645
fits very well here.

510
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:59,299
Even if you haven't been to the United States Capitol,

511
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,260
you know what it looks like, it's iconic.

512
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,102
And even if you haven't seen it,

513
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,784
the style of architecture is so formulaic,

514
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:08,726
it's enough to demonstrate what's missing

515
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:10,027
based on what remains.

516
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:13,310
The practicality of imposing asymmetrical damage

517
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,611
to a one symmetrical building

518
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:16,832
has an inherent impact on the player.

519
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:19,555
So given all that information,

520
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,116
let's take a look at Tenpenny Tower.

521
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,513
It's approached somewhat early in the game.

522
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:26,594
You get the marker for it after exploring only one city

523
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:27,254
prior to this.

524
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:29,255
It holds the quest, which presents

525
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,056
the first massive moral decision you

526
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,336
must make with your character.

527
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:35,057
And spoiler alert, you're positioned

528
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:38,578
to arm that bomb in Megaton City and destroy it.

529
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,159
Breadcrumbs prepare you for this, though,

530
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,899
learning how to arm the bomb, confirming the quest,

531
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:45,220
bartering for the reward.

532
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,241
And it will land you some seriously bad karma

533
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:49,081
if you go through with it.

534
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:52,139
Tenpenny Tower is where you push that button.

535
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,703
This tower is also one of the best preserved buildings

536
00:24:55,763 --> 00:24:58,466
in the Fallout world, for a while at least,

537
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:01,809
which creates an opportunity to represent

538
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:03,631
what life was like in higher fidelity

539
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:05,854
than any other exterior environment.

540
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:09,437
It also has the opportunity to justify its longevity

541
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:10,839
with building materials.

542
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:14,075
And it may seem nitpicky, but all the rooms

543
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:15,496
have kind of look like tunnels.

544
00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:16,377
They lack windows.

545
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,019
And for the tallest building in the Wasteland,

546
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,400
I would think that this would be kind of a selling point.

547
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,843
But again, that's probably just because of engine limitations.

548
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:29,225
And without a lot of sleuthing, we

549
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:32,728
can look at the New Willard Hotel and see the similarities.

550
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:37,391
It's a historically tall building in Washington, DC.

551
00:25:38,131 --> 00:25:40,573
And it's not a tower, though.

552
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:44,089
And that's why I think Tenpenny looks a little bit squat.

553
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,231
Early skyscrapers typically used primarily

554
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:50,652
vertical articulation.

555
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:52,833
Architects were actually over the moon

556
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:54,113
about how high they could build,

557
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:56,655
and as a result, couldn't even.

558
00:25:58,913 --> 00:26:03,697
About 100 years later, architects finally got over themselves and started exploring

559
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:05,018
horizontal articulation.

560
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:09,261
You can see the spandrel panels and floor plates articulating the iconic Lieberhaus,

561
00:26:09,962 --> 00:26:15,766
and the aqua tower provides modulation in the X axis at the cost of practicality because

562
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:18,408
now it is actually just a radiator.

563
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,532
The New Willard Hotel is actually a block building, which is why it's got that horizontal

564
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:24,873
banding.

565
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:29,361
Also, the hotel is massive compared to its neighbors.

566
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:31,023
The city probably had restrictions

567
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:33,866
on how tall a building could be on that plot of land.

568
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:36,108
It's a very courteous building, though,

569
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:37,970
because it gives back a little bit of space

570
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,893
on that intersection, as you can see that chamfered corner.

571
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:45,998
But then it does this thing that I have actually done myself.

572
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:47,159
I feel really bad about this.

573
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,422
That cornice, that balcony, actually just

574
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:54,103
shields the view for the pedestrian.

575
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:57,085
So it looks like the building's about 40 feet shorter.

576
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,546
I've had to do this.

577
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:00,187
I don't feel great about it.

578
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:03,929
The vaulted roof structure also foregoes that upper edge.

579
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,871
So it's hiding its penthouse floor

580
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,852
as it's timidly approaching its footprint.

581
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:12,087
So when we see Tenpenny Tower mimic these things,

582
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:15,067
it appears ashamed of its size, fighting to appear shorter.

583
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:18,508
We also don't see anything that could pick

584
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:21,729
to another side of Tenpenny, outside of his dialogue.

585
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:24,569
Something like strong 90 degree corners

586
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:26,869
could imply a rigid, unchanging nature,

587
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,050
as he's greeted with the wasteland, but refuses to adapt.

588
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,490
Also, I'm still bummed about that Windows thing.

589
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:36,731
Choosing reference material requires some insight

590
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:39,052
on why it's working in its current context.

591
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,872
In fact, you end up inheriting a lot of solutions

592
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:44,073
to other people's problems.

593
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:48,757
I could imagine a seemingly valid argument for this design

594
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:53,020
as it relies on maybe existing in the palette of the Potomac.

595
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:55,562
It's an existing building in the area.

596
00:27:55,602 --> 00:27:56,302
That would make sense.

597
00:27:56,983 --> 00:28:00,145
But it's easier to defend discrete moves and motives

598
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:02,747
by referencing symbolic justification.

599
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,950
This allows for more correct answers to your problem.

600
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,890
as opposed to putting collaborators

601
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,011
in a take it or leave it situation as well.

602
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:13,794
I also saw this alternate concept art.

603
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:16,335
I don't know why this didn't make it in.

604
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:18,557
I could probably think of a thousand reasons

605
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:19,578
why it couldn't make it in,

606
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:22,519
but it does adhere better architecturally.

607
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,542
So it has those 90 degree corners, which are really strong.

608
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:29,584
It also has a bunch of different architectural styles,

609
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:31,325
which is indicative of a single payer.

610
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,599
And it does this wedding cake thing,

611
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:37,700
where it builds slowly up to that decision point.

612
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,181
And that could have a good correlation

613
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,822
to the way you followed those breadcrumbs.

614
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:47,643
Fallout ultimately does a fantastic job with storytelling.

615
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,784
I spent 300 hours in this game,

616
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,965
and I didn't feel constrained by an order of levels.

617
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:55,366
So no matter what path I took,

618
00:28:56,246 --> 00:28:58,287
each did their part to further illustrate the world

619
00:28:58,527 --> 00:28:59,687
and the culture of the Wastelanders.

620
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,597
Now, Inside was a remarkable game,

621
00:29:04,697 --> 00:29:06,539
and I will warn you, spoilers on this one.

622
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:09,761
I'm saying that because it is a really good reveal.

623
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:13,284
But the game relies on context and gameplay

624
00:29:13,304 --> 00:29:14,125
to reveal the plot.

625
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:16,707
There are a lot of clever decisions

626
00:29:16,747 --> 00:29:19,589
which capitalize on the constraints and requirements.

627
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,792
These decisions are leveraged to challenge the player

628
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:25,633
to solve this meta puzzle.

629
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:28,947
introducing a desire to know why you're here

630
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:29,888
and what you're doing.

631
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:35,474
Playdead uses this to set up and train the player

632
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:37,055
under a certain set of rules

633
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:39,758
and has them develop habits and strategies.

634
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,041
This allows for the reversal at the finale

635
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,643
to have much more of an impact.

636
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:48,126
For architects, experience design and forced perspective

637
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:50,468
are challenging to maintain for multiple hours.

638
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,399
One building does come to mind,

639
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,922
which provides prolonged empathetic experiences.

640
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:01,745
Leibskins Jewish Museum in Berlin jars its occupants

641
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:04,527
with subtly disorienting and harsh conditions

642
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,188
in order to simulate the toll

643
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:07,769
an environment can take on a human.

644
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,391
The color palette is reduced to mid-gray tones,

645
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:15,154
forcing occupants to use light to distinguish elements.

646
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:17,516
Soft shadows strain the viewer

647
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,077
to distinguish similar elements,

648
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:20,738
and harsh lights produce.

649
00:30:21,164 --> 00:30:25,067
stressful impairment on eyes by providing too much contrast.

650
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:29,392
Narrow windows consistently cover the exterior,

651
00:30:29,472 --> 00:30:30,993
providing different level of lights

652
00:30:31,393 --> 00:30:34,036
through the same mechanic, that thin rectangular void.

653
00:30:34,857 --> 00:30:36,819
By rotating those, you've actually created

654
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:40,843
a variety of conditions which can be used

655
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:43,225
to do that subtle and stark thing

656
00:30:43,485 --> 00:30:45,427
that was messing with people's eyes.

657
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,753
Many museums rely on layout and lighting

658
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,635
to break up displays in an attempt

659
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:54,598
to help viewers read for more than comprehension,

660
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:55,919
but empathy.

661
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,562
You're asking the visitor to learn a lot

662
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:01,284
by giving them breaks between exhibits.

663
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:03,787
You allow them to rebuild their stamina and learn more.

664
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,184
These sharp corners provide an uneasy feeling

665
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:08,465
throughout the entire journey,

666
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,227
granting temporary reprieve between spaces,

667
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:13,188
but not letting the visitor feel rested

668
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:16,410
or have a clear path forward to the end.

669
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,531
Leaveskin treats the museum

670
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:20,152
as an extension of the collection,

671
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,053
a machine for creating feeling,

672
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,434
not just something people move through.

673
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:28,637
Inside forces a reckoning with the players,

674
00:31:28,697 --> 00:31:29,538
seemingly at ease.

675
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,147
The player must use spatial and visual indicators

676
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,169
to discern meaning about their experience,

677
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:39,272
like lighting, building layout, material characteristics,

678
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:40,934
and area of effect.

679
00:31:42,195 --> 00:31:43,956
By providing high-fidelity details,

680
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:46,398
the onus falls on the player to distinguish content.

681
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,760
In Playdead's previous hit, Limbo,

682
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,662
we see a blur as things fall out of focus.

683
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:55,886
Inside, crisp backdrops indicate their value

684
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,228
as a narrative element.

685
00:31:58,288 --> 00:31:59,829
There's something that's important to you.

686
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:03,969
They also work to codify planes of action.

687
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,491
Early in the game, the smaller challenges

688
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:09,433
train the player to focus on opportunities presented

689
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:12,375
in a single plane while referencing mid-ground

690
00:32:12,395 --> 00:32:14,096
and background for information.

691
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:17,158
So the scenes can actually be dissected.

692
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,122
So in this one, we see that we have control over the chicks,

693
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,164
and we also have control over the lever.

694
00:32:25,704 --> 00:32:26,645
That's in the foreground.

695
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:28,446
That's lit by that lamp.

696
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:32,768
as soon as we pull the lever, we lose control of the chicks

697
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:34,088
as they go into the background.

698
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:35,169
Poor things.

699
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,551
The same can be said about this scene

700
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:42,352
where you have control over your player in the foreground

701
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:45,914
and start to learn how to control the background.

702
00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:49,436
But they keep the plane separated

703
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:50,877
as you don't have full control yet.

704
00:32:53,498 --> 00:32:55,539
So we're gonna use that word again, phenomenology.

705
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:59,844
It's when you're fed information and it stays below the level of consciousness.

706
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:03,546
The subtlety of clues is actually held as a datum in this game.

707
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:07,970
The player's consciousness actually fluctuates when they're tasked with challenges.

708
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:13,974
Platforming challenges come in waves, switching you between survival and understanding the

709
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:14,315
levels.

710
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:18,518
The environment is consistently broadcasting clues

711
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:21,719
to a player on a basis of whether they're in control

712
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,540
or following along.

713
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,821
So two different players would actually have

714
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:27,062
two vastly different experiences

715
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:30,384
and maybe get the same story out of it

716
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:33,986
even though they've been presented with the same material.

717
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:34,046
So.

718
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:39,487
this is like a personal problem for me,

719
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:40,888
but I'm not good at platforming.

720
00:33:41,328 --> 00:33:43,009
And this was a really hard part for me.

721
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:45,871
I didn't even notice the people in the background

722
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:46,891
that were watching me do this,

723
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:48,652
which completely changes the scene.

724
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:50,973
And then if I was even better at it,

725
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,234
I didn't notice that bus in the background

726
00:33:53,254 --> 00:33:53,935
that brought them,

727
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:57,336
which indicates an institutional portion of their presence.

728
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,897
And that would have completely changed

729
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,858
the way I perceived that moment in the game.

730
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,000
They also do this great thing where the materiality shifts

731
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:11,501
from something seemingly less formal and rustic

732
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:14,222
to something maybe a little bit more industrial

733
00:34:14,582 --> 00:34:16,783
and then gets curved glass at some point

734
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:18,223
and it has a scientific look.

735
00:34:19,343 --> 00:34:21,584
A life cycle that a lot of technology has

736
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:25,685
from origin to militarization or monetization

737
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:27,565
such as airplanes for instance.

738
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:31,082
I don't have many critiques of this game.

739
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,304
It masters the use of passive and active design cues

740
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,365
by fluctuating the level of attention

741
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:40,328
the player has the capacity to spend outside of platforming.

742
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:43,690
This provides an allegory for seeing the forest

743
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,092
beyond the trees, which ends up being tough to simulate.

744
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:51,974
So going back on that initial thought,

745
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:54,576
designing for an authentic experience.

746
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:02,293
And I think it boils down to who the perceived designer is.

747
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,234
The environment has the opportunity

748
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:07,295
to feel as if it's been designed

749
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:08,756
by an inhabitant of the world.

750
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:12,018
Studying architecture and building taste

751
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:14,259
can improve the ease at which you design

752
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,780
for a varied context.

753
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,161
Another way to build taste is by looking at the way

754
00:35:19,322 --> 00:35:21,803
directors use existing buildings as sets.

755
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:26,565
Directors frame the camera and change lightings

756
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:27,806
to recharacterize a space.

757
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:32,071
These settings sculpt the general perception of spaces

758
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:35,334
because it feels like they were built just for these moments.

759
00:35:36,856 --> 00:35:38,898
So the way the Bradbury building felt

760
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:43,682
when you're watching Blade Runner versus 500 Days of Summer

761
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:45,144
is dramatically different.

762
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:50,243
And it has a lot to do with the closeness of the characters

763
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:51,144
to the environment.

764
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:53,447
It also has a lot to do with the special effects

765
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:54,047
that are involved.

766
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:56,310
So there's a lot of things that you can learn

767
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:01,076
that aren't necessarily even in the structure of a building

768
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:04,439
that can be conveyed through a variety of means.

769
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,421
Further mastery of this medium also allows movie set designers

770
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:15,184
to propose new contexts for style learned or adapted

771
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:16,705
from a real built structure.

772
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:21,687
So we see Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House actually performing

773
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:25,810
very well in the new environment of Blade Runner

774
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,190
in Deckard's apartment.

775
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:34,034
If you do like books, I've come up with a pretty good list.

776
00:36:34,783 --> 00:36:37,964
The first book is a good place to start

777
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,185
if you're looking for where this line of study could take you.

778
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,366
The next two are a lot, and it might take some rereading,

779
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:46,926
but will certainly broaden your horizons.

780
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:50,347
That last one is like our version of Google.

781
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:54,268
It can help you find critics or authors sorted by topics.

782
00:36:56,749 --> 00:36:58,969
But it's nothing compared to the recommended reading that

783
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,270
came with the original Sims game.

784
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,610
I cherry-picked the ones that were literally

785
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,510
part of my curriculum.

786
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:08,293
which is actually crucial to the Max's path to licensure

787
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:09,113
in all 50 states.

788
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:11,014
Thank you.

789
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:25,139
And I actually provided bonus slides

790
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,840
in case anyone asks a question that I

791
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,721
had in another slideshow version of this.

792
00:37:34,943 --> 00:37:35,303
Yeah, yeah.

793
00:37:36,914 --> 00:37:38,835
And feel free to introduce yourself with your first name.

794
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:40,995
Get to know people.

795
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:44,736
Hi, I'm Steve.

796
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:50,178
So in reality, no design is ever truly realized.

797
00:37:50,258 --> 00:37:53,979
There's always some sort of socio-political pressure

798
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,320
that comes in the construction of a building.

799
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,461
And architectural theory rarely acknowledges this.

800
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:03,782
I have a background in architectural engineering.

801
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:06,524
In school, I was taught that architects

802
00:38:06,704 --> 00:38:08,025
were the designers of buildings,

803
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,846
when the reality is architects plus politicians

804
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:12,287
plus whatever.

805
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:13,568
There's a lot that zoning does.

806
00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:14,748
There's a lot that goes in there.

807
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:22,896
Similar to this, if you're a level designer, you're an artist, you rarely have pressures

808
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:28,338
beyond your own ideas, or the ideas of your art team, or the ideas of your design team

809
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:29,818
for how a space is going to be realized.

810
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:36,721
In suggesting that we apply architectural theory to the design of a space without also

811
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:43,443
emphasizing that we should consider what the realities of the construction of a space are.

812
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:50,586
Do you think that there's a risk that we might give people the wrong impression of how design is realized

813
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:57,369
and sort of just be teaching them the theory in a vacuum?

814
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:01,370
Or do you think that this is something that architectural theory can handle?

815
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,791
Like, I don't know if we need, like, fake politicians that come in and...

816
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:09,655
I would say that the value of virtual architecture

817
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:12,117
maybe doesn't have to be parallel

818
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:15,020
with the value of built architecture.

819
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,824
I would say that the paper architects of the 70s,

820
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:24,227
like, ha ha, you've activated one of my trap cards.

821
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:27,710
I was gonna mention the metabolists, but.

822
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,953
Leavius Woods has done a lot of writing on architecture

823
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:37,141
without the bounds of politics.

824
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:43,730
There are critics that do evaluate how politics do affect architecture,

825
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,811
and that could be an interesting way to kind of look at that.

826
00:39:46,891 --> 00:39:51,073
I think Half-Life actually does a pretty nice job at introducing that,

827
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:55,414
because they have the Combine and the old existing architecture.

828
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:58,576
And that kind of war is, I think, visible through the sets

829
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:00,696
that they choose to create.

830
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:03,217
So I think that there is kind of an interesting dialogue that

831
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,299
can be kind of approached, but doesn't necessarily have to be.

832
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,660
Does that answer your question?

833
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:09,647
Yeah.

834
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:10,668
Okay.

835
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,031
Any other questions?

836
00:40:22,891 --> 00:40:23,851
All right.

837
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:27,813
Sorry if this question is pretty general,

838
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:30,213
but how would you go about evoking dread

839
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:32,794
or unease through architecture?

840
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:33,214
Hey.

841
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:35,615
Like, do you have an example for a game or,

842
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:36,675
in the real world?

843
00:40:37,464 --> 00:40:41,567
Um, yeah, I would say that things like forced perspective,

844
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,589
height, and things that are generally

845
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:45,210
from a worm's eye view, actually.

846
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,433
You can do a lot to evoke dread.

847
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,336
Not that architects can typically do this.

848
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:55,918
We are actually like under a Hippocratic oath of a type

849
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,521
to design nice spaces for people.

850
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:04,946
But yeah, there are a lot of things like Leibskin's work

851
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:05,226
in the,

852
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:08,588
Jewish museum in Berlin.

853
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,192
But also, yeah, memorials have a very solemn look to them.

854
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:17,435
I would say dread is something that's usually evoked

855
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:20,337
by camera angles, I would say most actively,

856
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:24,941
but, ah, Gothic architecture has a good amount of it.

857
00:41:24,961 --> 00:41:26,282
Does that help?

858
00:41:26,302 --> 00:41:27,262
Yeah.

859
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:27,382
Cool.

860
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:29,944
Hi, I'm John.

861
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:32,046
Sorry if I said names.

862
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:34,179
I just want to say thank you.

863
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,560
This talk is like really refreshing and articulate.

864
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,560
Thanks.

865
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,121
I wanted to throw that out there.

866
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:48,003
A lot of the work that I'm done, I'm interested in is often centered on kind of like the way

867
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:51,003
that spaces manifest the things that you're talking about.

868
00:41:51,043 --> 00:41:54,824
And I think that, like you mentioned landscapes at one point in the talk.

869
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:59,245
And this is such a broad topic that it's hard for me to be like, what's...

870
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:06,245
It's like the way you would do this sort of thing, but I don't know if you had any suggestions for places to look for, like, the way that...

871
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:11,313
or readings on the way that these buildings,

872
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:13,074
for example, like Breath of the Wild,

873
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:15,576
exist in a grander landscape

874
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:18,859
and kind of take a context from that.

875
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:23,983
I know, I'm from Chicago and the IIT

876
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:26,626
is a pretty famous architectural school, I think.

877
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:27,867
Their student,

878
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,774
like commons areas like used to be a park and then they just

879
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:38,560
plopped a building on top of it and I was heard that described as post-modernist

880
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:42,646
architecture but I don't know. Actually they did maintain the sidewalks in that. Yeah yeah.

881
00:42:42,746 --> 00:42:47,754
So they used the tiling of the floor to keep the same like

882
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:52,356
pathways through, I would say that as far as landscape goes,

883
00:42:52,457 --> 00:42:54,878
there's a lot that actually architects

884
00:42:54,898 --> 00:42:57,719
have designed utopian societies very often.

885
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,861
And so maybe looking in that direction of what

886
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:04,363
is a utopian society, but also the way

887
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:09,185
that landscape architects use keyholes, for instance,

888
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:14,308
which is like kind of using sight lines to direct views

889
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:14,528
and.

890
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,415
older gardens, like, gosh, Versailles.

891
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:21,297
Versailles is a really good place to kind of

892
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:25,882
really delve into the depth that you can put into a garden.

893
00:43:25,962 --> 00:43:29,326
They had these Aesop fables, like automatons

894
00:43:29,366 --> 00:43:30,367
that were powered with water

895
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:32,690
in just a certain part of the park.

896
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,612
So it's a very interesting thing to read about.

897
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:36,374
Cool, thank you.

898
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:45,050
This is kind of a strange question, I guess, but I've interacted with people who are working

899
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:49,932
in all different sorts of other disciplines, artists, architects, people making films,

900
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:55,715
people working in the ad industry, authors, and most of them have absolutely no interest

901
00:43:55,755 --> 00:43:58,977
in video games, let alone have put in 300 hours into Fallout.

902
00:44:00,297 --> 00:44:03,218
three. So I'm wondering if you could, I mean you talked a lot about your

903
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:05,459
background as an architect, but could you talk a little bit about your

904
00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:10,561
background as a gamer? Oh, what made you want to come and present at a video game conference?

905
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:16,463
Probably Doom 2. No, actually I usually don't play video games with my co-workers

906
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:22,384
because they don't play video games. No, I think that it provides a great

907
00:44:22,424 --> 00:44:23,385
opportunity for...

908
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:31,549
virtual spaces to have an impact on people in a way that, like you're mentioning, politics

909
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:37,232
really does prevent a lot of architects from realizing a design the way they had originally

910
00:44:37,272 --> 00:44:46,277
intended. Or, of course, we are kind of a patron-based profession, so we require someone

911
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:51,740
else's money in order to realize our visions. So there's a lot of catering to the client.

912
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:54,261
you've activated another one.

913
00:44:56,102 --> 00:44:58,542
We fall on these crutches a lot as designers,

914
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,003
which is a fair kind of,

915
00:45:02,023 --> 00:45:03,544
this is Philip Johnson's list by the way,

916
00:45:03,564 --> 00:45:04,304
I can't take credit,

917
00:45:04,784 --> 00:45:06,764
but these are a lot of things that designers

918
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,725
of architecture use to support themselves

919
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:10,685
more than their actual designs.

920
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:13,526
As far as games that I like to play,

921
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:14,886
I'm playing Fortnite right now.

922
00:45:16,308 --> 00:45:16,729
Love that.

923
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,871
And gosh, I really put a lot of time into Risk of Rain.

924
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,132
That's been surprisingly a great one.

925
00:45:23,212 --> 00:45:25,473
It's one of those ones that you can, again,

926
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:28,754
put your own thoughts and your imagination into

927
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:33,216
because it lacks photorealistic detail,

928
00:45:33,256 --> 00:45:34,217
and I kind of like those ones.

929
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:36,458
Does that answer everything?

930
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:37,498
Great.

931
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:42,036
Hi, my question comes from an art creation point of view.

932
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:46,577
A lot of the time we are tasked with creating

933
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:49,618
a certain style of architecture

934
00:45:49,698 --> 00:45:50,938
or a certain kind of building,

935
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,959
but the level design spaces that we're working with

936
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:58,080
are not the same type of spaces you'd get from that style.

937
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,280
And so when it comes to this kind of,

938
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:05,101
you know, mashing two incompatible things together,

939
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:07,962
we often end up with, you know, unconvincing...

940
00:46:09,223 --> 00:46:11,384
you know, yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying.

941
00:46:11,424 --> 00:46:16,248
So if you had any advice on how to, you know,

942
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:21,091
create a good style, you know, as long as it says that,

943
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:22,553
you know, this is an Aztec building,

944
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:25,775
even if it's not, you know, made out of solid,

945
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:28,577
huge stone monolithic blocks or something like that,

946
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:31,799
you know, like how to put a style facade or a front

947
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:34,481
on a building space that doesn't necessarily suit

948
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:35,462
that style of architecture.

949
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:38,468
Yeah, I would say the most important thing you could do

950
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:40,797
is frame the views in the same way.

951
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:46,682
if that's at all possible, because the Greeks had imagined

952
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:51,745
the best way to view a building was kind of an angle of it.

953
00:46:52,286 --> 00:46:54,867
And so you have a better idea of the whole thing

954
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:55,968
instead of just flat on.

955
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:58,930
And so doing tricks like that could also help.

956
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,092
But then, yeah, like you're saying,

957
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,154
pick up individual parts that you believe

958
00:47:04,394 --> 00:47:05,275
have the essence of.

959
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:08,157
I would say materials and,

960
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:11,392
camera angles go a long way for that.

961
00:47:11,672 --> 00:47:14,833
But also the proportions of things.

962
00:47:15,173 --> 00:47:17,814
So if you have the opportunity to read anything

963
00:47:17,874 --> 00:47:19,435
about the proportions that were used,

964
00:47:19,895 --> 00:47:24,656
maybe talking with your gray boxer about those

965
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:27,297
and seeing if you can kind of meet in the middle.

966
00:47:27,717 --> 00:47:27,917
Yeah.

967
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:28,918
If that's at all possible.

968
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:35,021
Yeah, there was a talk sort of relating to that called The Nature of Order in Game Narrative,

969
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,703
but it was very, very architecturally based on Tuesday, I think.

970
00:47:37,863 --> 00:47:44,847
They had something called the 15 Rules, and one of them was scale of detail.

971
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:50,531
So, you know, from small scale to large scale in terms of details was one of those rules,

972
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:51,752
which just reminded me.

973
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:54,673
So, yeah, I think that pretty much answers it.

974
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:58,928
It's very ideal, you know, like,

975
00:47:58,948 --> 00:48:00,129
talking about the architecture,

976
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:01,870
it's very sort of theoretical and ideal,

977
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,770
whereas like, the actual implementation

978
00:48:03,831 --> 00:48:05,571
is never quite so, yeah.

979
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:08,313
Yeah, yeah, it's never so cut and dry.

980
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,174
I would say also picking out something

981
00:48:11,214 --> 00:48:13,975
that sticks out to you in the photographs,

982
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:17,017
if you see any photographs or documentation of it,

983
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:19,518
finding a quirk in there,

984
00:48:20,078 --> 00:48:22,440
and really committing to that, maybe embellishing it.

985
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,401
Yeah, that's a good one, thank you.

986
00:48:28,445 --> 00:48:36,150
Christopher, in video games we don't have to necessarily live by the restrictions of physics or geometry or anything like that.

987
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:42,614
If you've played Anti-Chamber, he does really interesting things with space that is impossible in our mind.

988
00:48:43,815 --> 00:48:47,938
And even in like dream sequences and even AAA games and other indie games,

989
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:50,639
there's a lot of tricks that can be done with space.

990
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:56,482
Is there any, I guess, literature or research that's been done by architecture,

991
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:58,964
even though it's not exactly applicable to architecture,

992
00:48:59,224 --> 00:49:03,466
and how the fundamental principles could apply to those sorts of spaces?

993
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:09,992
Gosh, I know there's a lot of research done in the 90s

994
00:49:10,053 --> 00:49:11,893
because people were talking about perspective

995
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,174
as it relates to matching camera angles.

996
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:18,857
And there was a, gosh, I know Kipnis talked about this.

997
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:22,318
He's a critic as well.

998
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:23,999
But there's...

999
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:27,145
I'll email you.

1000
00:49:27,325 --> 00:49:28,906
There are people that have talked about

1001
00:49:28,926 --> 00:49:30,468
the warping of perspective.

1002
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:32,930
We call it forced perspective.

1003
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:36,593
There is a classical example of it in,

1004
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:39,035
gosh, I forget, it's been a while.

1005
00:49:39,835 --> 00:49:42,037
But yeah, there is a classic example of

1006
00:49:43,078 --> 00:49:44,719
just the set that goes back into space,

1007
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:45,840
but it truly doesn't.

1008
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,922
It's manipulated it in a way.

1009
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:49,063
Thank you.

1010
00:49:52,466 --> 00:49:52,986
Hi, I'm Grace.

1011
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:55,028
I had two questions, and actually you just covered

1012
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:57,177
One of them for the most part.

1013
00:49:57,999 --> 00:50:01,685
In terms of kind of bending that reality versus not reality,

1014
00:50:01,746 --> 00:50:04,370
have you ever found ways where it's gone too far before?

1015
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,616
Where it's a little unsettling when it's unrealistic?

1016
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:14,152
Oh gosh, I kind of like when it's unsettling though because that means that it's trying harder to hit its character.

1017
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:18,155
I thought Sly Cooper was really on the edge.

1018
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:22,019
That was one that really stuck out to me as cartoony buildings that take a like

1019
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:25,803
entasis, which is the embellishment of the width of a column.

1020
00:50:26,183 --> 00:50:29,864
to like the ends of what I believe to be reasonable.

1021
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,985
But that was also like a game that really did captivate me.

1022
00:50:34,225 --> 00:50:36,045
I thought that the colors that they chose

1023
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:39,166
and the organization of the cities

1024
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:41,807
actually did bring out a lot of value

1025
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:43,947
in the architecture that they designed.

1026
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,368
So yeah, I think that that's kind of a fun opportunity

1027
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:50,109
for game developers to take, so.

1028
00:50:50,711 --> 00:50:52,592
Since there's no one else here, can I ask the other question?

1029
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:53,212
Yeah.

1030
00:50:53,653 --> 00:50:56,894
Can we see the slide again that had the resources at the end

1031
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:57,855
that you were recommending?

1032
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:58,075
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:50:58,095 --> 00:51:00,276
Do you want the virtual version or the?

1034
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:02,497
Like the list one, because I was going to read it.

1035
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:03,038
Yeah, yeah.

1036
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:04,338
See if that's it.

1037
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:06,620
Yeah, you can see.

1038
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,180
This one.

1039
00:51:08,921 --> 00:51:09,101
Yes.

1040
00:51:10,282 --> 00:51:11,122
Thank you.

1041
00:51:11,762 --> 00:51:12,643
Oh, this one?

1042
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:13,984
Yeah.

1043
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:15,945
Wait, can you do both of them?

1044
00:51:16,185 --> 00:51:16,505
Yes.

1045
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,407
These will be on the thing, though, the vault.

1046
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:20,467
OK, that works.

1047
00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:20,527
OK.

1048
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,002
Oh yeah.

1049
00:51:22,022 --> 00:51:22,062
Oh.

1050
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:24,402
Excellent.

1051
00:51:24,422 --> 00:51:24,662
Thank you.

1052
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:26,123
Sorry, I went a little bit fast too.

1053
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:26,903
Thank you.

1054
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:28,083
No problem.

1055
00:51:31,024 --> 00:51:31,724
Any other questions?

1056
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:34,445
I probably can't help you with your foundations

1057
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:36,586
for your decks or houses or anything, but.

1058
00:51:36,606 --> 00:51:42,627
If you guys want to know about elevators, I can probably.

1059
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:43,967
I've taken a crack at that.

1060
00:51:43,987 --> 00:51:45,228
I have a question.

1061
00:51:45,428 --> 00:51:45,608
Yeah.

1062
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:53,756
So just curious, your perspective, mankind going out to space and gravity maybe not being

1063
00:51:53,816 --> 00:51:58,721
a factor in the way we build things, how do you think that could possibly evolve into

1064
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:00,323
new forms of architecture?

1065
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:03,720
Oh, I think we're going to go straight back to the geodesic dome.

1066
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:11,402
So Buckminster Fuller was this great guy that came up with the Dumaxian sleep cycle, even.

1067
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:16,023
And so he proposed this way that you can get two-hour segments of sleep.

1068
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:21,024
But he was remarkable at designing these things that may not necessarily need to...

1069
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:28,711
be architectural in the sense that they follow these classical rules. He took a more engineering

1070
00:52:28,751 --> 00:52:32,675
approach to architecture and came up with these really great things. So I think we'll

1071
00:52:32,695 --> 00:52:37,739
kind of go back to the 70s and kind of look at the way that architecture was designed

1072
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:43,985
back then before we move forward in another way. So yeah, weirdo things.

1073
00:52:46,486 --> 00:52:49,647
This guy, this is kind of what the speculative architecture

1074
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:50,688
of the 70s looked like.

1075
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:53,609
They were just like imagining what the world

1076
00:52:53,649 --> 00:52:54,589
of the future was gonna be.

1077
00:52:55,249 --> 00:52:55,850
And here we are.

1078
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:04,793
Without balloons.

1079
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:05,013
Thanks.

1080
00:53:05,233 --> 00:53:05,793
Does that answer?

1081
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:06,993
Sort of.

1082
00:53:07,013 --> 00:53:07,293
Okay.

1083
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,576
You guys just wanna see some cool architects?

1084
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:16,177
All right.

1085
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,123
So this guy's my favorite, Ira Saarinen.

1086
00:53:21,223 --> 00:53:22,684
He did the TWA terminal.

1087
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:24,606
This is actually a real life building.

1088
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:28,651
It was like sculpted out of concrete.

1089
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:29,792
I'm surprised that I haven't seen

1090
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,013
many things like this in games.

1091
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:33,997
It's like one just cohesive structure

1092
00:53:34,037 --> 00:53:36,139
that looks like it was carved out of something, you know?

1093
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:41,074
This is Eric Owen Moss's Angewatt project.

1094
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,337
It was speculative, but yeah, he kind of proposes

1095
00:53:44,457 --> 00:53:49,461
the juxtaposition between modern and existing architecture.

1096
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:50,322
I think that's kind of neat.

1097
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:53,024
Of course, my man, Libby Woods,

1098
00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:55,326
kind of proposing the insanity.

1099
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:58,409
He's actually, he's passed away,

1100
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:01,271
but he wrote a blog before he passed away,

1101
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,712
and it's actually really great.

1102
00:54:02,752 --> 00:54:04,094
It's really accessible, I would say.

1103
00:54:06,585 --> 00:54:07,506
This stuff is weird.

1104
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,386
Hayduk is weird, but he's great.

1105
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:14,067
Piranesi is actually referenced often

1106
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:15,908
when people talk about architecture.

1107
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:19,528
It's just the complexity as it goes back into space

1108
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:22,429
is very compelling, I would say.

1109
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:26,230
This guy's currently running SciArc.

1110
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:31,171
It's kind of the way that, we call it parametricism,

1111
00:54:31,191 --> 00:54:31,871
but it's the way that...

1112
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:36,899
We're using procedural generation of elements right now.

1113
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:39,202
We're kind of end users to these things,

1114
00:54:39,262 --> 00:54:40,763
so like the scales on the buildings

1115
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:41,964
are kind of a weird feature.

1116
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:46,305
Zaha's work, this is some of her newer stuff.

1117
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:48,806
It's a mall in China.

1118
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:49,726
It's pretty great.

1119
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:51,827
She was prolific.

1120
00:54:52,787 --> 00:54:56,489
Actually, she was the first female Pritzker Prize winner,

1121
00:54:56,569 --> 00:54:59,290
and if you guys are looking to learn more about architects,

1122
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:03,071
Pritzker Prize winners are kind of our best bet.

1123
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:08,453
This is probably the most lore of architecture

1124
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:09,814
you can pack into a single house.

1125
00:55:10,254 --> 00:55:12,135
Alvaro Alto's Villa Maria.

1126
00:55:14,463 --> 00:55:20,429
Shigeru Ban is a master of just this new architectural style that's coming to China.

1127
00:55:20,469 --> 00:55:23,311
He's really defining a new look.

1128
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:25,073
I think it's pretty great.

1129
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:26,714
Gaudi.

1130
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:27,895
Gaudi is the best.

1131
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:31,198
This one's Casa Botlow.

1132
00:55:31,819 --> 00:55:34,341
These are designed to look like bones, if you notice.

1133
00:55:34,361 --> 00:55:35,422
The columns are bones.

1134
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:38,044
And so it's like this weird version of organic architecture.

1135
00:55:39,556 --> 00:55:41,918
Sana has these very clean spaces,

1136
00:55:41,998 --> 00:55:42,998
so if you're trying to make something

1137
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:44,299
look futuristic and clean,

1138
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,681
you can draw inspiration from them.

1139
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:50,804
They use pilotes or columns without capitals or bases.

1140
00:55:51,924 --> 00:55:52,605
Let's see.

1141
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:54,246
Yeah, that's what I got for you.

1142
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:00,110
Second smaller presentation.

1143
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:02,912
Any other questions?

1144
00:56:05,473 --> 00:56:06,514
Well, thank you guys for coming.
