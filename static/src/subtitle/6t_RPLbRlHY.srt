1
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:09,642
Hello, my name is Brian Horton, Creative Director at Insomniac Games.

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:14,406
It's an honor to be at GDC to talk about Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles Morales, the creative journey.

3
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:18,951
Before we jump into the presentation, let me start with a quick overview of my career

4
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:22,754
and the events that led up to the creation of our game.

5
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:25,737
In November of 1994, I graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design

6
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,759
and landed my first job in the game industry.

7
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:33,561
Throughout my 26-year career, I've worked at seven studios on 20-plus games as an artist,

8
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:38,885
lead artist, art director, game director, and most recently, the creative director on

9
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:42,308
Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales, a launch title for the PlayStation 5.

10
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:48,033
It was a career highlight to be at Insomniac Games, collaborating with PlayStation Studios

11
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,135
and Marvel Games on this amazing franchise.

12
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:55,340
Spider-Man is very special to me because my love for the web-slinger runs deep.

13
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:02,107
As a young kid in the 1970s, my mom made me a hand-stitched Spidey costume for Halloween.

14
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:04,189
I played with numerous Spider-Man action figures.

15
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:10,616
I was obsessed with the reruns of the classic 60s Spider-Man cartoon, and I lovingly read

16
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:13,459
and re-read the pages of my Silver Age Spidey comics.

17
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:18,685
But years later, I would rediscover my love for Spider-Man in Miles Morales.

18
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:23,657
Brian Michael Bendis and Sarah Pacelli's work brought a fresh new energy to the franchise,

19
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:28,899
and it was a huge influence on the Insomniac team. We fell in love with Miles, and it was

20
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:35,062
important to make his video game origin story a special experience. Starting with our first game,

21
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:41,584
Marvel's Spider-Man. We introduced Miles Morales, an Afro-Latino teen born and raised in Brooklyn

22
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:47,586
with a passion for science, playing ball, mixing beats, and his favorite hero, Spider-Man.

23
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,119
In our story, Peter is older and more experienced.

24
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,143
This provided us a unique opportunity

25
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:56,946
for a new take on the Spider-Man origin story with Miles.

26
00:01:56,946 --> 00:02:00,271
So when he was bitten by a genetically engineered spider

27
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,153
and discovered his new powers, it

28
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:05,037
was destiny that Peter would be his mentor

29
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:07,019
and show Miles the ropes of being a hero.

30
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:10,764
So this brings us to Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales,

31
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,885
and I'm excited to share my perspective

32
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:14,266
on the creative journey.

33
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,667
This presentation is a chronological overview

34
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:19,649
of the development, from pre-production to release.

35
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:22,050
My hope is you walk away with a better understanding

36
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,633
of our process and benefit from some of our best practices

37
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,554
and lessons we learned along the way.

38
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:31,396
The topics include crafting the vision,

39
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:34,498
building the dream, iterating to quality,

40
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,519
road to release, and takeaways.

41
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:42,320
So let's discuss the first topic, crafting the vision.

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,821
Insomniac Games is a collaborative company.

43
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,442
Everyone pours their ideas, talent, and passion

44
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,123
into every title we make,

45
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:50,924
and Miles Morales was no exception.

46
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:54,066
At the beginning of pre-production, our team was small,

47
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,727
and I worked closely with the following people

48
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:59,888
to create the creative vision for Miles Morales.

49
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,230
Jess Reed is our lead PM.

50
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,451
Cameron Christian, our game director.

51
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,671
Ben Arfman, lead writer.

52
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:12,424
Evan Narcis, writer and consultant, Mary Kenny, advanced writer, James Cooper, lead designer,

53
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:16,265
Gavin Goulden, and Jason Hickey are co-art directors.

54
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:21,426
Pre-production began in August of 2018 and ended in December of 2018.

55
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:27,527
This first milestone included documentation for the creative vision, story animatic, mission

56
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:31,008
macro, art bible, and production plan.

57
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:35,488
We also created a vertical slice, a mission that would represent our goals for gameplay

58
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:35,868
and art.

59
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:41,364
So the following is an abridged version of the Creative Vision PowerPoint I presented

60
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:44,005
to Sony and Marvel at the end of pre-production in December of 2018.

61
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:51,986
My goal was to communicate the theme, pillars, design, art direction, and story outline.

62
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:57,547
Because we were so early in development, most of the images in this presentation are illustrations

63
00:03:57,547 --> 00:04:01,668
from the Miles Morales comics and some early concept art.

64
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:03,968
But be warned, there are massive spoilers ahead.

65
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:08,303
So Miles Morales learns to master his new powers

66
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:10,085
and discover his true identity

67
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:12,127
in a coming of age superhero adventure.

68
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,609
Our theme, be yourself.

69
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,953
To become a hero, Miles must embrace his true identity.

70
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:21,755
Miles wants to be just like his mentor, Peter Parker,

71
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:22,656
to save his new home,

72
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:25,558
but he needs to embrace his unique power

73
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:26,940
to become his own Spider-Man.

74
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,049
Our game was built on three pillars.

75
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:33,631
The first, become an explosive new Spider-Man.

76
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,332
Miles will play differently from Peter

77
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:37,973
with new combat, traversal, gadgets

78
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,614
that embraces unique powers,

79
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,335
bioelectricity and optical camouflage.

80
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,636
These powers will improve throughout the game

81
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:46,918
as Miles and the player become more experienced.

82
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,773
Or second, protect your home from two warring factions.

83
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:55,096
Harlem is ground zero of a two-sided war between Roxxon

84
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:55,756
and the Underground.

85
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:59,199
Miles must defeat these threats to protect his family, friends,

86
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,740
and citizens of East Harlem.

87
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,243
And finally, play a seamless cinematic experience,

88
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:07,204
an uninterrupted journey from the beginning

89
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:09,346
to end by eliminating loading screens

90
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:12,989
and maintaining systemic control during our epic Marvel set

91
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:13,329
pieces.

92
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,192
The art directors also had three goals.

93
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,294
The first, make a noticeable difference to the city

94
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:23,675
by setting our game in the winter season.

95
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:26,116
The second, embrace strong color

96
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:28,238
with a neon noir aesthetic.

97
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:30,819
And third, represent the culture of East Harlem

98
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:31,640
with authenticity.

99
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,602
The design was driven by our theme and gameplay pillars,

100
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,323
beginning with our hero.

101
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:41,265
You play as Miles Morales, a teen with amazing powers

102
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,666
that you will discover and improve throughout the story.

103
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:48,038
Miles' wardrobe will evolve as he embraces his identity.

104
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,380
In Act 1, Miles starts in his homemade suit,

105
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,886
and after the first mission, Miles wears Pete's gift suit.

106
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:57,028
In Act 2, Miles and Genki will create

107
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,550
the iconic black and red suit.

108
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,695
And in Act 3, the player can earn up to 20 custom suits

109
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,317
from doing open-world activities.

110
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:11,193
Miles has two unique powers, camouflage, which is ideal for stealth gameplay, and bioelectricity

111
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:15,175
is an organic energy source used for powerful attacks and puzzles.

112
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:20,758
For progression, Miles' unique abilities and gadgets are unlocked in the campaign.

113
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:24,700
Upgrades help Miles defeat new enemies and solve environmental puzzles.

114
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,063
Traversal animations will be all new to reflect Miles' personality and abilities.

115
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:32,777
Miles is inexperienced.

116
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:35,760
He isn't as controlled as Peter, so he'll flail his arms

117
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,141
and legs when he catches air.

118
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:39,242
But he's stylish.

119
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:41,484
Miles is young and enthusiastic, so we'll

120
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,026
give the player additional manual tricks for more

121
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:45,127
expression while swinging.

122
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:47,589
And finally, he's dynamic.

123
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:51,372
Transitions will be seamless between cinematics and gameplay

124
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:54,614
to make Marvel-sized set pieces even more epic.

125
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,818
But a hero is only as good as the villains they face.

126
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:05,762
Our main antagonist is the Tinkerer, a brilliant inventor of programmable matter, a metal that

127
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,683
can transform into weapons and armor.

128
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:13,327
The Tinkerer recruits a high-tech criminal army called the Underground, the Young Mafia

129
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:13,968
of New York.

130
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:18,932
They wage war with Roxxon with plans to destroy their new form reactor in Harlem.

131
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:27,768
Roxxon is an energy corporation who deployed paramilitary security to reclaim their experimental

132
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:33,953
energy source, Nuform, with exoskeletons and next-gen weapons designed to combat the underground

133
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,613
and Miles.

134
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:41,399
The Prowler, Miles' uncle Aaron Davis, is an ally and antagonist for our hero.

135
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,763
His efforts to protect Miles from Roxxon and the underground backfires, resulting in a

136
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,324
battle between Miles and his uncle.

137
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:54,578
So we visualized our story in a 20-minute animatic we called Story Time.

138
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:59,500
We used this to help us test narrative comprehension and Miles' journey to rise to the challenge

139
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,161
to become his own Spider-Man.

140
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:06,183
These storyboards were drawn by my good friend Paul Lee and narrated by our lead writer,

141
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:06,723
Ben Arfman.

142
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:12,406
This movie would be shown to players to test our story and allowed us to iterate very quickly.

143
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:17,649
The most important function on story time was tracking Miles' arc throughout the game,

144
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:23,172
like when Miles saves Peter and defeats Rhino with his new bioelectric powers,

145
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:28,574
or when he manifests invisibility when Roxxon threatens his life at the Braithwaite Bridge,

146
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:33,397
and at the end of the game in his final heroic act when he's willing to sacrifice his life

147
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:36,398
to absorb the energy from the new form reactor to save Harlem.

148
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:40,129
The most important deliverable for pre-production

149
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,930
was our vertical slice, designed by Brian Matheson,

150
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,832
to demonstrate our gameplay pillars

151
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:47,533
and make Miles feel unique from Peter Parker.

152
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:48,254
As a way to prove out our third pillar,

153
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:51,896
play a seamless cinematic experience,

154
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:56,118
we created a start screen that seamlessly transitioned

155
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,399
into gameplay without loading.

156
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,781
Ultimately, the PS4 version would have loading screens

157
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,982
for reloading and fast travel,

158
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:03,463
but other than that,

159
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:06,045
the entire game was seamless from start to finish.

160
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:12,836
James Hamm is the animator responsible for Miles' unique swinging and the tricks that you see here.

161
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:16,199
And even at this early stage, you can see the differences from Peter Parker.

162
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:22,645
We chose the Opera House mission from our second act of our story because it featured traversal, stealth, puzzles, and combat.

163
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:32,835
In addition, this mission showcased the winter season, the Neon Noir art direction, and the unique powers of the Underground Faction.

164
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:41,636
Another initiative we had was to make environmental puzzles designed to be solved with Spider-Man's unique abilities, like this simple web-based challenge.

165
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:48,884
Miles' camouflage allowed the player to re-establish stealth from combat and perform takedowns without being seen.

166
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:53,547
And finally, we wanted to feature Miles' bioelectric powers

167
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:55,649
to make a unique combat experience.

168
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,311
Andrew Garber and James Hamm worked together

169
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,793
to create Miles and the Underground's motion.

170
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:00,694
And after pre-production,

171
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:03,637
we would add dynamic cinematography and slow-mo

172
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,280
to enhance the impact of bioelectric punches,

173
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,481
jumps, and dashes.

174
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,595
The team and executives at Insomniac Games

175
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:12,777
and our partners at Sony and Marvel

176
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:16,000
were excited about the vision, story, vertical slice,

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,682
and game macro, which included 10 Golden Path missions

178
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,043
and our open world content.

179
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:23,707
Our pre-production provided a strong foundation for the game

180
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,789
and we entered production in January of 2019

181
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,110
with confidence.

182
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,953
So this brings us to our second topic, building the dream.

183
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:35,056
We utilized a new model we call slice production,

184
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:38,358
where we created 50% of the game's content in five months,

185
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:41,981
including missions, quests, activities, bases, training,

186
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:44,682
and collectibles.

187
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:47,504
Missions were constructed in four phases.

188
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:49,646
We did documentation for a week,

189
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,627
block out for three weeks,

190
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:53,088
first playable for eight weeks,

191
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:55,870
which was basically finding the fun.

192
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,232
Then we had art, post and polish for the last eight weeks.

193
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,664
All of this content was brought to what we call representative quality,

194
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:08,785
which demonstrates the experiential intent of the game so we could playtest it for fun factor

195
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:15,487
and overall story comprehension. Our first task in production was to create Miles' new home in

196
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:20,868
East Harlem, and it was essential to represent the neighborhood, people, and culture authentically.

197
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:28,497
Our team was immediately drawn to the vibrant murals painted on the walls, celebrating the

198
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:31,681
life and culture in the neighborhood.

199
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:36,206
Miles lived his entire life in Brooklyn, but in our story, he and his mother Rio moved

200
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:38,189
to East Harlem, her childhood home.

201
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,302
Miles was unsure if he could keep up with the changes in his personal life and his hero life,

202
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:48,444
and he was searching for a way to connect to his new home. So our lead designer, James Cooper,

203
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:53,306
had an idea for a new mechanic that would allow Miles to meet and help the people of his new

204
00:11:53,306 --> 00:12:01,230
neighborhood. The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man App, or FNSM for short. In this story, Miles'

205
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,612
friend, Genki Lee, created this app to allow citizens to report crimes and post requests

206
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:07,753
to Spider-Man directly.

207
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,966
During our brainstorming process for quests,

208
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:15,428
Evanarsis suggested we feature East Harlem's local spots,

209
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:17,849
places like a mom and pop restaurant,

210
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:20,871
the local barber shop, and the corner bodega.

211
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:22,532
This idea was perfect.

212
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:24,132
It allowed Miles and the player

213
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:26,153
to learn about the neighborhood in an organic way

214
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,575
and fall in love with the people who live there.

215
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,766
Teo's Bodega kicked off our Harlem Quest chain,

216
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:35,468
inspired by a 3x5 on an idea board called Save the Cat.

217
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:39,610
This simple idea resulted in one of the most memorable

218
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,151
characters in the game.

219
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,352
The mission, designed by Shane McCloskey,

220
00:12:43,352 --> 00:12:46,734
written by Ben Arfman, required Miles to locate criminals

221
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:49,996
who busted up Teo's Bodega and stole his cat,

222
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:52,097
which Ben named Spider-Man.

223
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:55,198
The team rallied around our new favorite mascot

224
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:57,039
to create something truly special.

225
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,230
So what's more adorable than a cat in a backpack?

226
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,431
Well, a custom Spidey suit with a cat in a backpack.

227
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:06,672
So Gavin Goulden commissioned a new suit

228
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:08,613
that we would earn by completing this quest.

229
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,835
And soon after, one of our animators, Bulo Rebello,

230
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,955
created Spider-Man and the Cat finishers,

231
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:16,757
and Andrew Garber made custom poses for photo mode.

232
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:21,556
The reaction from our fans and press was overwhelmingly positive.

233
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:26,198
And this only happened because our team worked together to bring Spider-Man the Cat to life.

234
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:28,680
But these Harlem Quests just kept giving.

235
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,963
Haley Cooper is a skilled street artist and community organizer created by Mary Kenny

236
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:38,065
for the final Harlem Quest mission designed by Charlie Carusi.

237
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,326
Mary pitched this wonderful idea.

238
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:46,130
What if Miles and Haley spoke ASL, American Sign Language?

239
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,671
I love this idea.

240
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:49,632
My son took ASL in high school,

241
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:51,654
and it made sense to me that Miles could have as well.

242
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:54,836
So we cast deaf actors and consultants

243
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:58,058
to ensure the conversations were 100% authentic.

244
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:01,601
From left to right, we have Joshua Castile,

245
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:05,603
our ASL consultant, Natasha Ofili as Haley,

246
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,545
and TJ Fortson who performed Miles' ASL.

247
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:13,156
Najeejit performed the verbal lines Miles was saying on the side while TJ was signing.

248
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:18,099
Our animators and the mocap crew were excited by the challenge to innovate our finger capture

249
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:22,842
technology and the results in the game look incredible.

250
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:28,105
The FNSM quests and activities were so well liked, but we didn't have a reward for completing

251
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:28,446
them all.

252
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:30,627
So the team brainstormed again.

253
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:37,246
What if the citizens of Harlem gifted Spider-Man a special suit for those that completed all the quests?

254
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:40,368
Thus the black and gold Uptown Pride suit was the result.

255
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:48,034
And the incredible mural designed by Natasha Leigh Hooker from our QA team was featured in the background.

256
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:55,340
The team driving ideas like this are an organic process and it's woven into the fabric of culture of Insomniac Games.

257
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,523
It's a reinforcement of our mantra that great ideas come from everywhere.

258
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,203
Throughout the 10-month production phase,

259
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,305
we did frequent usability testing,

260
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,306
providing our team valuable feedback

261
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:09,846
to help us iterate to quality.

262
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:13,208
One of my favorite Golden Path missions

263
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,709
was designed by Timmy Jordan,

264
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,891
written by Ben Arfman with art by Ernesto Gonzalez.

265
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:19,992
Rio Morales invites Miles' good friends,

266
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,693
Genki Lee and Finn Mason, for Christmas Eve dinner

267
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:24,034
to help Miles feel more at home.

268
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,966
Our team did exhaustive research to ensure the Morales apartment was believable.

269
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:33,970
And with some help from our friends at Sony Research, we had this unique opportunity to

270
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,633
show this mission to a selection of individuals and families from East Harlem.

271
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:43,158
We received so many valuable insights that helped us to make everything feel even more

272
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:44,439
authentic.

273
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:49,324
My favorite details included the traditional dishes Rio prepared, reflected in this concept

274
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:49,704
above.

275
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:54,158
The apartment was warm with holiday decorations

276
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:56,700
and had a strong family feel.

277
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,562
But it also had a lot of narrative revelations

278
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:02,364
and three new characters to introduce.

279
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:05,686
So we started this mission in our first production slice,

280
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:07,247
and it was also the first mission

281
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,589
to shoot mocap for our cinematics.

282
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:13,251
I worked closely with the writers, actors, animators,

283
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:16,914
and amazing stage crew at Sony to create these cinematics.

284
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:19,235
So let me introduce some of our talented actors and crew.

285
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:24,361
Najee Jeter reprised his role as Miles Morales.

286
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:27,285
Jacqueline Pignol returned as Rio Morales.

287
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:29,948
Griffin Poitou voiced Genki Lee.

288
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,491
Jasmine Savoy-Brown played Finn Mason in The Tinkerer.

289
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:35,939
Ike Amadi voiced Aaron Davis and The Prowler,

290
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:37,680
and Troy Baker played Simon Krieger.

291
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,962
Our incredible cinematics team is led by Carla Schwamm,

292
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:45,004
the cinematics PM, Jason Rogatz, narrative coordinator,

293
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,826
Ben Arfman, lead writer, Mary Kenny, advanced writer,

294
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:52,248
and we had Brian Weiser, Mike Yosch, and Chris Zimmerman

295
00:16:52,248 --> 00:16:55,670
as our talented and amazing cinematics directors.

296
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,491
So let's look at some of the first cinematics

297
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:58,791
we created for this mission.

298
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:27,059
Here's the original scene for Genki's introduction in Miles' apartment.

299
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,570
You gotta show me that electric thing.

300
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,671
Oh no, no suit in the house.

301
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:35,632
Right.

302
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:38,353
Miles, is that you?

303
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:43,976
This next scene was designed to convey

304
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:46,277
Miles and Finn's close friendship,

305
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:47,617
and that she's a brilliant inventor,

306
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:51,179
and also the tragic death of her brother, Rick.

307
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:51,679
Whoa, what is that?

308
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:51,839
Oh, hmm?

309
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:57,221
Something I've been tinkering with.

310
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:01,014
Carbon grid rigged as cellular automata.

311
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,495
Programmable matter?

312
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:04,637
Are you serious?

313
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:08,660
No, people have been working on that for years.

314
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,662
Finn, you know you could pay for college 20 times over if you

315
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:15,485
just sold that to Oscorp or even Roxxon.

316
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,606
Yeah, not going to do that.

317
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:18,407
For real.

318
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:26,233
Wait, doesn't your brother work for Roxxon?

319
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:26,693
Yeah, right.

320
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:27,574
I can't even tell you who to talk to.

321
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:32,359
Finn, this is like Thomas Edison and a light bulb.

322
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,880
Call Rick!

323
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,960
Miles!

324
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,642
Rick's dead.

325
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:42,563
He's dead?

326
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:45,203
I wasn't gonna...

327
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:51,385
It's Christmas. I didn't want to ruin the night.

328
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:55,086
How?

329
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:55,747
What happened?

330
00:18:57,305 --> 00:19:01,366
If you don't want to talk about it, I understand.

331
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:01,566
No.

332
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:04,607
It's alright.

333
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:08,548
There was an accident at the Roxxon campus last summer.

334
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:14,830
They said it was a gas leak, but I know they're lying.

335
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,290
I'm not Roxxon's biggest fan.

336
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:16,970
Finn, I'm sorry.

337
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:32,672
You know, last year, my dad-

338
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,833
Your mom told me.

339
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,535
Miles, I'm so sorry.

340
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:37,075
Yeah, me too.

341
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:41,318
And this final scene I want to show

342
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:43,540
is some stage footage from a cinematic

343
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,502
that happens after dinner.

344
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:47,683
In this version, we had a lot of conflict.

345
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:49,985
Finn was pleading for the Morales family to move,

346
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:51,466
and Miles wasn't too happy

347
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:52,907
about moving from Brooklyn to Harlem.

348
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:54,329
So let's take a look.

349
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:58,192
Campaigning against them is like wrestling a bulldozer.

350
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:03,825
That's something I wanted to talk about.

351
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,685
You and Miles need to move.

352
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:09,846
Back to Brooklyn. Further, if you can.

353
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:11,627
Are you serious?

354
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,348
My brother was on the New Form project.

355
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:16,149
That stuff scared him.

356
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,590
I'm not sure why, but it's not safe.

357
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,212
Finn, I am so sorry about Rick.

358
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:31,326
That's all the more reason to stay and fight.

359
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:34,407
Get Newform out of here.

360
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,607
Protesting won't work.

361
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,128
I've tried everything.

362
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:41,769
Roxxon's too powerful.

363
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:44,349
That means she's not wrong, Mom.

364
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:49,450
You think we should just leave?

365
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,231
Roxxon's like ten times bigger than Oscorp.

366
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:55,312
Why fight a losing battle?

367
00:20:56,676 --> 00:21:01,379
Because this is our home.

368
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:01,859
Your home.

369
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,760
So the quality of the writing

370
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,161
and the acting in these scenes was absolutely stellar.

371
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:08,483
But when we installed them in the game,

372
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:10,464
we identified some issues that we had to solve.

373
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:13,806
First, we had too many character introductions.

374
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:20,491
Genki, Rio, Finn each had introductions in this mission, and it was a bit overwhelming and crowded.

375
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:25,032
We had inconsistent tone. We pivoted from lighthearted moments to serious moments,

376
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:29,053
resulting in too much conflict overall. And Finn's motivations.

377
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:33,374
Finn's pain and motivations to become the Tinkerer were presented a little too early in the story.

378
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:38,115
So we needed to make some significant changes to fix these issues, including

379
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:42,777
moving Genki's intro to earlier in the story, just after Peter gives Miles his new suit.

380
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:49,075
We removed conflict to focus on the celebration between family and friends.

381
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:53,957
After all, this is the heart of our story, so it had to represent what Miles would fight to protect.

382
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:59,299
We moved the time capsule introduction to later the next day,

383
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,960
teasing out Finn's problem without revealing the true source of her pain.

384
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,802
We introduced three flashbacks with Rick,

385
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:10,003
so the player could see how important he was to Finn and to Miles.

386
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:15,096
And we allowed Miles and the player to witness Rick's death

387
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:16,457
in a video Finn recorded.

388
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:19,039
This scene was critical to understand why Finn

389
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,020
would become the Tinkerer.

390
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,382
Spacing out these story revelations

391
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:26,645
helped to reinforce Miles and Finn's friendship

392
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,327
before the tragic turn of them becoming enemies.

393
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,094
Making this many changes after production

394
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:34,155
would have endangered the release date.

395
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:36,536
But we were able to accomplish these fixes

396
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:39,778
because we budgeted for one additional production milestone

397
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:43,140
we call pre-alpha, or reckoning.

398
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,162
An additional five-month production milestone

399
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:48,743
designed to address problems with gameplay and story.

400
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,705
To use this time effectively, we built a strategy

401
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,446
to prioritize our efforts.

402
00:22:53,446 --> 00:22:56,728
So first, we focused on the first 90 minutes of the game,

403
00:22:56,728 --> 00:22:58,669
restructuring missions to improve pacing.

404
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:01,918
we wrote new cinematics to spread out our character

405
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:04,020
introductions, improve character motivations,

406
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,641
and story comprehension.

407
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:09,603
And each one of our boss fights were expanded and improved.

408
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:13,166
So remember when I said we planned 10 Golden Path

409
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,267
missions from pre-production?

410
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:18,449
Well, by the time we were at the end of pre-alpha,

411
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:21,752
we restructured Act 1, added missions,

412
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:24,173
open world activities, and many of our cinematics

413
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:25,975
were redone or heavily modified.

414
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:29,103
To make this achievement even more impressive,

415
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:31,265
most of this work was accomplished at home

416
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:33,166
because of the COVID lockdown.

417
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,426
So I wanna give an extra special thanks

418
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,448
to our narrative, cinematic and post teams.

419
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,389
They truly pulled off a miracle

420
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:39,829
and I can't thank them enough.

421
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:43,071
So this leads us to the road release.

422
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:43,972
As we entered alpha,

423
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,593
we switched our focus from production to polish.

424
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,654
And we had a few key areas to focus on,

425
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:51,136
which included next gen features,

426
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:53,597
music and audio and marketing materials.

427
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:58,395
It was such an honor to launch a title for the PlayStation 5.

428
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,458
And our core tech and tools team, led by Mike Fitzgerald,

429
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,440
created new features to take full advantage

430
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,502
of the power of PlayStation 5, including

431
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:09,745
updated skin shaders, spline-based hair that moved

432
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:13,688
and rendered more realistically, ray traced reflections

433
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:17,532
for glass skyscrapers, wet streets, cars,

434
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:19,413
and other reflective surfaces throughout the game.

435
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:23,963
Eventually, the tech team created a performance RT mode,

436
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,543
which supported 60 frames per second

437
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:26,964
and ray trace reflections.

438
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:31,165
We capitalized on the speed of the PlayStation 5's SSD,

439
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:34,367
allowing us to stream high quality assets on the fly

440
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:37,548
and perform near instant respawn and fast travel.

441
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:44,094
supporting the DualSense controller to create a new layer of immersion to the Spider-Man experience.

442
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:49,778
Haptics connected your actions to Miles' power. So for instance, you experienced the crackle of

443
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:56,223
electricity flowing from one side of the controller to the other when performing a bioelectric punch.

444
00:24:56,223 --> 00:24:59,566
We leveraged the resistance triggers so the players could feel the webshot

445
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,527
and tension through the swing of the arc.

446
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:05,242
And the Tempest 3D Audio Tech Engine

447
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:07,444
facilitates full 3D ambisonic sound,

448
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:09,485
allowing the player to hear traffic under you

449
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:11,626
when you swing and a much better sense

450
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:14,848
of enemy positioning from all directions.

451
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,489
And new accessibility features

452
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:19,872
ensured as many players as possible could play our game

453
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,213
as we added a number of options

454
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:23,394
that made the game even more inclusive.

455
00:25:24,597 --> 00:25:28,119
These features like low vision mode seen in the screenshot above

456
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:31,581
were a passion for our lead programmer, Maros Macintosh,

457
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:35,183
lead UI artist, Gil Doran, lead effects artist, Brianna Lindsay,

458
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:38,986
and our entire user research team led by Brian Allgire.

459
00:25:38,986 --> 00:25:42,788
All of these features came together with the incredible music and audio.

460
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:47,431
John Paisano returned as the composer and created a new score

461
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:50,733
that felt unique to Miles while maintaining the original spirit.

462
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:56,624
We added the talents of Boy Wanda to create beats and produce two original songs with Lecrae,

463
00:25:56,624 --> 00:26:00,208
where we come from, and this is my time.

464
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:04,232
We licensed On My Own by Jayden for the reveal trailer and an original track,

465
00:26:04,232 --> 00:26:06,614
I'm Ready, for the launch trailer and end credits.

466
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:10,459
The new score provided the emotional core for our game,

467
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:13,261
and it was a fusion of epic orchestral themes,

468
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:17,042
cutting edge beats, original and licensed tracks,

469
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:21,164
and this hybrid approach created the asonic tapestry

470
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,564
we dubbed Orchestral Synth Hop.

471
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:25,786
The picture above was our audio team

472
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:28,046
at Studio A in Nashville, Tennessee,

473
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,947
right before the COVID lockdown.

474
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:32,808
And here's just a small sample of the orchestra in action. ♪♪

475
00:26:59,436 --> 00:27:06,003
Our game was nearing completion and we were ready to reveal it to the world.

476
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:10,047
Before we started our reveal trailer, we created three goals to steer the direction.

477
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:13,439
The first was a new hero and a new season.

478
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:16,020
We wanted to focus on Miles Morales, the young man

479
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,801
and the new Spider-Man, his unique swinging

480
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:21,563
and new powers, bioelectricity and visibility,

481
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:24,785
and then Harlem, bringing it to life in the winter season.

482
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:29,687
We wanted next-gen fidelity, that facial animation and hair

483
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:31,729
really coming to life, cutting-edge ray-traced

484
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:34,850
reflections, and film-quality simulation and effects.

485
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,013
And we wanted this trailer to be memorable and unexpected.

486
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:44,811
to create a mysterious introduction and an explosive montage of action,

487
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:48,516
and to set it to an iconic piece of music by Jaden.

488
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:51,601
The work of our entire team is featured in this finished product,

489
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:54,686
but we assembled a strike team to focus on the trailer, including.

490
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,013
Ryan Schneider, who's our Chief Brand Officer,

491
00:27:58,013 --> 00:28:00,255
Corey Hoover, who's our Senior Marketing Producer

492
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:02,037
and the Editor of the trailer,

493
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:03,418
Ben Arfman, Lead Writer,

494
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:05,160
Gavin Goulden, Art Director,

495
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,761
Mike Yosh, Cinematics Lead,

496
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:07,882
James Hand, Senior Animator,

497
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:10,244
Brianna Lindsay, Lead Effects Artist,

498
00:28:10,244 --> 00:28:12,246
Matthew Bennett, Senior Effects Artist,

499
00:28:12,246 --> 00:28:14,068
Jenna Ruth, Advanced Effects Artist,

500
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,550
and Ed Ruiz, Senior Lighter.

501
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,951
The slow motion reveal of Miles Morales

502
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:20,874
was the brainchild of Ryan Schneider,

503
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:23,500
inspired by this concept by Nicholas Shoemaker,

504
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,544
which represented the moment Miles was willing

505
00:28:25,544 --> 00:28:27,608
to sacrifice his life to save Harlem.

506
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:31,426
The announcement trailer was a well-kept secret,

507
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:35,029
and it paid off because no one knew what this game was.

508
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:38,932
Our team watched the fan reactions evolve from confusion

509
00:28:38,932 --> 00:28:40,613
to guessing what the game was,

510
00:28:40,613 --> 00:28:43,255
to elation when Miles' face was finally revealed.

511
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,357
Creating this announcement trailer was a labor of love

512
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,380
with incredible editing, film quality simulation,

513
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,841
effects, lighting, animation, and sound design.

514
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:54,163
By the time of this presentation,

515
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:56,985
the reveal has 19 million views

516
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,847
and generated a lot of buzz for our game.

517
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:03,062
But we had one other major asset to create.

518
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:05,844
Our follow-up would be a mission that showcased our pillars

519
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,945
and would prove Miles was his very own Spider-Man.

520
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,286
We selected another one of my favorite missions

521
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:14,028
from the game that we called Time to Rally,

522
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:17,149
an exciting action set piece designed by Neil Walker

523
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:20,351
with art by Ernesto Becerra that features everything

524
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:22,712
that makes Miles Morales a unique Spider-Man.

525
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:28,718
It begins with Miles and Genki walking through a holiday street fair to Rio's election rally

526
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:32,881
that's showcasing the rich culture of East Harlem and the new PS5 tech features like

527
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:33,822
Ray Traced Reflections.

528
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:35,443
Here's a sample of this section from the demo.

529
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:36,083
Subway card.

530
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:36,263
Check.

531
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:36,684
You got the house key?

532
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:37,304
Yeah, I got it.

533
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:37,985
Come on!

534
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:47,031
We're gonna be late!

535
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:52,434
Come on!

536
00:29:52,434 --> 00:29:53,235
We're gonna be late!

537
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:01,729
Hey! Dude, I am so filling your suit with snow.

538
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:03,591
Are you still wearing your suit?

539
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:06,933
Yeah, you know, just in case.

540
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,275
It's gonna be fine.

541
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:15,861
See, this is my favorite part of living in Harlem.

542
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:19,303
Pop-up street fair, best food in the city, awesome music.

543
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:22,486
Man, this would be great for the last beat I was working on.

544
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:24,828
I should get back into mixing.

545
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:29,951
The next section, we see Miles become an explosive new Spider-Man with his new bioelectricity

546
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:30,952
and camouflage powers.

547
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:19,585
People are trapped over there!

548
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:20,146
I have to push past these guys!

549
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:20,446
Where is he?

550
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,928
And our final pillar, play a seamless cinematic experience,

551
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:25,810
is showcased as Miles scrambles to save civilians

552
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,392
from the crumbling bridge in an epic Marvel-sized set piece.

553
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:32,295
No, no, no, no, no!

554
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:09,258
And finally, our launch trailer, created in partnership with Sony Marketing and AKQA and

555
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:10,198
Blur Studios.

556
00:32:10,198 --> 00:32:15,002
We wanted to show how Miles rises to the challenge to become his own Spider-Man.

557
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:27,506
Remember, Miles, you're saving me.

558
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:47,775
So I'm proud to say that in the challenging year of 2020,

559
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:51,778
with a global pandemic, massive social unrest,

560
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:54,960
the entire team working from home,

561
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,901
we shipped a PlayStation 5 launch game on time

562
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:00,963
at 85 Metacritic with numerous nominations and awards.

563
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:04,205
Our team was honored by the reception from press

564
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:05,105
and especially our fans.

565
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:08,227
We can't thank you enough for your continued support.

566
00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:11,429
So here's some key takeaways from our experience

567
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:13,930
that making of making Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales.

568
00:33:15,157 --> 00:33:20,560
Our successes, which include driving vision with theme and pillars,

569
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,203
strong pre-production, ideas from the team,

570
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:30,766
embracing cultural authenticity, representation, and accessibility,

571
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:37,650
next-gen features, iteration to quality. But we have some learnings from the

572
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,010
future.

573
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:41,956
We plan to develop full scripts before shooting mocap.

574
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:44,017
Our story time was great for structure,

575
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:46,999
but it wasn't enough to fully test our story.

576
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:49,461
So in the future, we plan to write full scripts

577
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,583
and perform table reads before entering into production

578
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,405
and iterate when it's cheaper with storyboards

579
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:58,387
and reduce the need for costly reshoots.

580
00:33:58,387 --> 00:34:01,129
We want to balance excellence and wellbeing.

581
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:03,210
We iterated a lot in pre-alpha,

582
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,552
but these challenges bled into alpha and beta.

583
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,331
While we made improvements, it took a toll on our team.

584
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:11,913
We'll continue to refine our process

585
00:34:11,913 --> 00:34:14,535
to achieve excellence and well-being for all Insomniacs.

586
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:19,158
I want to thank all of our fantastic partners

587
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:21,720

592
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:38,127
But last but not least, I want to thank every developer,

593
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:42,250

594

At Insomniac Games, we strive to make

595
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:46,774
a positive and lasting impact in people's lives.

596

And I feel so honored to be a part of this incredible team.

597
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:53,340
It's been wonderful discussing Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles

598
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,242
Morales, the creative journey.

599
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:56,863

600
00:34:56,863 --> 00:34:58,424
