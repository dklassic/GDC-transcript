00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:06,772
Hi, I'm Oliver Miao. I lead the team at Pixelberry Studios.

2
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:09,853
Before we get started, I was asked to remind everyone to

3
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:12,654
please put your phone on silent or vibrate mode.

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:18,156
We make games for teens, so I don't mind if you're playing a game

5
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:22,217
during my talk and you can multitask, but just please keep it in silent mode.

6
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:27,247
Today I'm going to talk to you about how our studio saved a life

7
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:30,249
and how that event inspired us to work with non-profits

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,933
to add features to our game that have affected thousands, if not millions, of lives.

9
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:39,917
And hopefully many of you will leave the room inspired

10
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:44,581
by what we discovered and by the events that we encountered ourselves.

11
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:47,463
But before I begin, I want to get a feel in the room

12
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:50,966
of how many people in the room are actually game developers and make games.

13
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,595
Great. It's a large number.

14
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:57,938
Do you remember what it felt like

15
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:00,420
when you first released your very first game?

16
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:06,244
I think it's something that most game developers will always remember.

17
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:09,547
And for me, right after I finished my first game,

18
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,649
it was a web-based game that I put on the browser.

19
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:13,270
I showed it to some friends.

20
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:17,594
And it was a really exciting feeling to have them playing that game.

21
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:20,896
And I was also really nervous to see what their response was.

22
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:22,498
But fortunately...

23
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:23,851
They really enjoyed the game.

24
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,852
And they actually were inspired to start

25
00:01:25,872 --> 00:01:26,792
creating games of their own.

26
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:30,074
And then I launched the game.

27
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,395
And suddenly, hundreds and then later thousands of strangers,

28
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:37,276
people I never knew, were playing the game

29
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:38,617
and leaving comments for it.

30
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:42,198
And I think as a game developer, that's something really unique.

31
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:45,579
We're creating something that gets played and seen

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,760
by all these people who we don't know.

33
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,442
Now, my friends kind of caught that same bug.

34
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,811
And so later, a few years after college, four of us

35
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:59,133
started my first company called Center Score.

36
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:01,434
We were focused on web-based games.

37
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:04,477
And although we never really talked about it,

38
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:08,480
I think that one of our motivations of starting a game

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,041
company was so that we could create a project that

40
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:13,343
would be played by millions and millions of people.

41
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,225
That was always our intention.

42
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:19,288
And as we began, we actually started

43
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:22,510
creating these multiplayer games that our players really

44
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:22,890
enjoyed.

45
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,191
We get emails from people saying,

46
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,751
can you change the IP address of your servers?

47
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:31,092
Because our schools won't let us play those games anymore.

48
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,253
And we tried to find a financial model.

49
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:36,314
This was in 2000.

50
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:38,594
So we tried to use subscription.

51
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:42,835
Ended up being about 60% of our subscribers paid via PayPal,

52
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:44,536
which was pretty impressive for the time.

53
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:46,836
About 30% paid via check.

54
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:50,697
And the other 10% would actually send us dollar bills,

55
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:51,978
and in some cases, coins.

56
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:54,316
So we had a lot of kids playing our games.

57
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:58,537
But that wasn't enough money for us to sustain our company.

58
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,157
So after about a year and a half,

59
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:02,818
we were getting ready to shut our company down.

60
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:06,979
And on the very last day, when we were planning to turn off our servers,

61
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,101
we had a friend give us a phone call and ask if we wanted to create cell phone games.

62
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:13,641
So we leapt at that opportunity.

63
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:16,122
And we really tried to learn from what we...

64
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:20,988
The mistakes we had made earlier, and that was we didn't spend enough time on business.

65
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:25,892
We did have some business deals with other companies, but I only spent maybe a quarter

66
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:26,953
of my time on business.

67
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:31,437
And the other founders, they just spent all their time on art and programming and design.

68
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,062
And as we started creating games for this one company, it transitioned into creating

69
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:38,383
games for more and more companies.

70
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:40,425
And I went from...

71
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,835
most of my time on programming to all of my time on business.

72
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,277
And I really had to step outside my comfort zone,

73
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:48,838
because I was naturally an introvert.

74
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:53,342
But I'd go to conferences, just like you are right now.

75
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,224
And before a session started, I'd

76
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,525
talk to the person on my right, and I'd

77
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:57,466
talk to the person on my left.

78
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,548
And usually, it led to nowhere.

79
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:01,850
But one time, someone on my left was from Sega,

80
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,153
and someone on my other side was from Sony.

81
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,316
And we actually ended up making games for both those companies.

82
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:13,115
We grew our business, started creating our own games,

83
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,717
and after five years, we ended up selling that company

84
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,780
to Vivendi Games, which owned Blizzard at the time.

85
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:22,302
We were at Blizzard for about two years,

86
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:24,703
and then Blizzard and Activision merged,

87
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:26,024
as many of you may know.

88
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:29,387
But Activision didn't want to be in mobile games.

89
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,328
So I think we're the only studio

90
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:34,211
that Activision has ever sold to EA,

91
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,373
being that they're such fierce competitors.

92
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:40,295
And so I was at EA.

93
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:44,855
And up until then, I was having a lot of fun making games.

94
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:48,797
And it wasn't because of EA that something

95
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:49,818
started changing for me.

96
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:52,759
But something did change.

97
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,981
But before I get to that, let me tell you

98
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,282
why I loved making games.

99
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:00,224
And some of these reasons may carry over to many of you.

100
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,686
First, I just love the creativity of designing a game.

101
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:07,268
You really get a chance to add new ideas,

102
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:08,969
to think about how to do things differently,

103
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:10,850
and see how they affect people.

104
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:15,827
Second, I really loved working as a team with people.

105
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:18,309
It may sound kind of crazy,

106
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,010
but in college I was a pre-med major,

107
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,492
and when I decided to change to engineering,

108
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:25,413
I actually told people it was because

109
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:26,933
I wanted to work with people.

110
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,795
And you know, doctors see a lot of patients,

111
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,716
and they see a lot of people on a daily basis,

112
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:34,658
but they don't get to spend as much time

113
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:38,320
with a core group of people creating something new.

114
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,721
And as an engineer, even though I wouldn't see as many people,

115
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:44,843
the relationships I develop with people in creating a project

116
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,244
was something that was really appealing to me.

117
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:48,766
And that's definitely a part of gaming that I love.

118
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:52,489
And then the third thing is what I talked about before.

119
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:54,850
Just seeing something you've created

120
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,733
played by millions of people and knowing

121
00:05:57,793 --> 00:05:59,934
that they're enjoying your creation

122
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:02,816
just feels really, really good.

123
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:05,758
But something changed.

124
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:11,327
Around the same time that my studio became a part of EA,

125
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:15,930
I had twins, one boy and one girl.

126
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:20,893
And it may sound very cliche, and it's a movie type of moment

127
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:24,896
and very stereotypical, but having kids really changed

128
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:26,197
how I started thinking about life.

129
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:29,859
It started making me feel like I wanted

130
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,661
to do something that would really make a difference.

131
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,817
so that I could leave the world in a better place for my kids.

132
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,539
And although the games we were making,

133
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,480
sometimes they did make a difference,

134
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,883
and people would tell us that our games would get them

135
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,725
through a hard time, or that they really

136
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:49,326
enjoyed what we were doing, I felt

137
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:50,507
like there was more I could do.

138
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:53,410
So I started thinking about other professions,

139
00:06:53,510 --> 00:07:00,796
and I explored opportunities in education, in biotech,

140
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:02,698
and in green energy.

141
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:06,279
And the one that seemed that it might fit the best

142
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:07,819
was educational gaming.

143
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:13,440
But I'd always created games for older kids, or teenagers,

144
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:13,980
and adults.

145
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,601
And in the educational game field,

146
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,301
games that are successful are really the ones

147
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,602
geared towards preschoolers, or kindergartners,

148
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:23,622
early elementary school.

149
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:27,282
And I think it's because at that age,

150
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:30,043
kids just love being on the iPad.

151
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,463
And they'll basically do anything

152
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:33,123
that parents give to them.

153
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:37,715
But once kids start playing on a DS, on a console,

154
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,177
on an iPad or iPhone, they start learning

155
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:43,620
that there's a lot of other fun games out there.

156
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,162
And educational games aren't as fun anymore.

157
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:49,565
Because educational game makers, they focus on education first,

158
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:51,827
and then they try and layer in elements of fun.

159
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:56,150
But as I started thinking more about that,

160
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,853
I realized there could be a different model.

161
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,596
And that's why I started Pixelberry Studios.

162
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,498
with two friends.

163
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,281
And our model was creating games with heart.

164
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,003
And what this meant is that we'd focus on the fun first,

165
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:14,805
really try and make that game successful

166
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,087
and played by thousands and millions of people.

167
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:21,069
And then at that point, we'd start layering in elements of education

168
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,252
in a way that we hopefully thought would be natural

169
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,714
and conducive to the natural gameplay.

170
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,097
So, pulled a lot of people that I worked with previously.

171
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:35,238
And we worked on a game for 18 months.

172
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,320
And we released High School Story.

173
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,802
So High School Story, as you can tell,

174
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:43,044
is a simulation builder-type game

175
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:45,025
where you're creating your dream high school.

176
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:49,108
And we have a story at the beginning

177
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:51,430
that's really focused on a bunch of misfits

178
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,112
who don't fit in at their old schools.

179
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:56,874
And they come together to help create this dream school.

180
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:00,277
And you start becoming their leader and working with them.

181
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,394
And that story really resonated with our players.

182
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,896
So you can see here, for us, story mattered.

183
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,517
We had an 87% tutorial completion rate, which is

184
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:14,618
really strong in the mobile games industry.

185
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,940
And players were giving us 4 and 1⁄2 star reviews.

186
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:27,083
And most importantly, we had players who would tell us how

187
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:29,524
our game was starting to affect them because of the storyline.

188
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,761
You know, this girl, she was from Japan.

189
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:36,162
She had moved over there, didn't have any friends,

190
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,583
and didn't feel like she fit in.

191
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:40,203
She said, high school story opened my eyes

192
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:42,704
to be just myself in front of everybody,

193
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:44,244
instead of just fitting in.

194
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:48,565
And messages like this, they really affected our team.

195
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:50,545
You know, they make you feel good

196
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:51,726
about the product you're creating.

197
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:55,107
They made us feel like we were headed in the right direction.

198
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:59,677
And because of these messages and the story and all the

199
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:02,379
elements we put into the game, the game started rising

200
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,219
quickly up the charts.

201
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,722
We hit number 10 in top grossing in the App Store,

202
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:12,426
which was something that not a lot of games can do a week

203
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:12,986
after launch.

204
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:17,810
But we started going back down on the charts, because we

205
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,851
needed a lot more content.

206
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:22,393
So for two months after we launched the game, we were

207
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,975
just running like crazy trying to get as much content in.

208
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:29,126
And we didn't have time, or we may have had time,

209
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:31,308
but we didn't think about the educational aspects

210
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:32,568
of things we could do.

211
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,431
Well, two months after we launched the game,

212
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,753
I was taking a break and surfing the internet.

213
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,335
And I read two articles in the same afternoon.

214
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:45,917
The first was about a girl, Rebecca Sedwick.

215
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:47,838
She was from Florida.

216
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:51,421
And she'd been cyberbullied by people in her school

217
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:53,902
over a fight about a boy.

218
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:59,117
And eventually she couldn't take it anymore, and she committed suicide.

219
00:11:01,518 --> 00:11:04,859
The other story was about a girl named Audrey Potts.

220
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:11,942
For those of you here from the Bay Area, she went to a school in Los Gatos, and she went

221
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:16,783
to a house party one day where she got drunk, and she ended up passing out.

222
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:22,525
And when she woke up, she woke up in a bed with all of her clothes off and Sharpie written

223
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,145
all over her.

224
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:27,905
And that's already bad enough.

225
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:31,148
But then the next day when she went to school,

226
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,391
she started getting looks from almost everyone in her school.

227
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,834
And basically, the kids who had done that

228
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:40,056
had taken pictures of her and started

229
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:44,240
sending messages and photos to everyone else in the school.

230
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,323
And she started receiving more messages

231
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,685
from people talking about what happened.

232
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:51,787
And she was being cyberbullied.

233
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:56,215
And she couldn't talk, she felt like she couldn't talk to her parents about it.

234
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:58,837
And she committed suicide as well.

235
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:04,781
And normally when I read these type of stories, you know, it just really bums me out.

236
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:08,684
And it still bums me out even telling you guys about it.

237
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:14,869
But I realized that we actually had a game and a platform where we could start making

238
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:15,770
a difference about this.

239
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:21,394
And their stories really resonated with me because I was bullied when I was growing up.

240
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:25,052
first in elementary school, and then later in junior high.

241
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,352
In fact, when I was in junior high,

242
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,173
I was a really small seventh grader.

243
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:31,833
And whenever my Spanish teacher was late to class,

244
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:35,034
the biggest eighth grader in the class

245
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,395
would pick me up outside the classroom

246
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:40,155
and dangle me over a trash can.

247
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:44,257
And that felt embarrassing, but I could deal with it.

248
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,597
But then he'd also put me in a headlock.

249
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:49,398
And sometimes I couldn't tell if he was joking

250
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:50,398
or if he was serious.

251
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:51,898
And it was probably a mix of both.

252
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:56,476
You know, in hindsight, he probably had a lot of other issues that he was just trying to get out himself.

253
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:58,317
But I was really scared.

254
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,578
But I never talked to my mom about it.

255
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:04,479
And in fact, she never even found out I had been bullied

256
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:06,860
until I told her about the game

257
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,561
and I told her about this particular story.

258
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:11,542
I was just too scared.

259
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:13,423
I thought that if I told my mom,

260
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:15,444
she'd go tell a teacher or principal

261
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:18,785
and they would do something minor,

262
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:20,365
but not enough.

263
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:21,506
And...

264
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,050
the bully would take it out on me even more.

265
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:29,732
And I know now in hindsight that I should have talked to someone,

266
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,652
to my parents, to a teacher, to an adult.

267
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,333
But when you're in middle school, you don't always think about those things.

268
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:39,875
And I started telling this story to people in our studio.

269
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:45,356
And I started finding out that several of them had been bullied too.

270
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:48,857
Some that had forgotten about it.

271
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,278
Some had forgotten about it on purpose.

272
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:57,523
But as we talked about it, we talked about how we could use our game

273
00:13:58,164 --> 00:13:59,825
to actually start making a difference there.

274
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,668
And so, we decided that we would write a cyberbullying storyline.

275
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:11,612
So that both victims of cyberbullying, as well as people who might be doing the bullying,

276
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,913
would kind of understand more what was going on.

277
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:17,215
And that we could teach them what to do if they were being bullied.

278
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,210
But because this is such a sensitive topic,

279
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,011
we really wanted to work with a non-profit.

280
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,272
So we started sending a lot of emails out

281
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:29,193
and started cold calling different non-profits.

282
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,554
And there was no response from anyone.

283
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,976
I don't think the non-profits understood that a game could

284
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:37,576
make a difference.

285
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:40,737
To them, they probably thought games were part of the problem.

286
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:47,760
And then something happened that accelerated things even further.

287
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,846
Via our game's in-message support system,

288
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,988
a girl messaged us and asked us,

289
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,109
should I kill myself?

290
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:01,372
My friends and I at the studio, we didn't know what to do.

291
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,613
We were so scared by this.

292
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:07,256
This was totally outside our realm of experience.

293
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:08,957
And when we started Game Company,

294
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:11,459
we never thought we'd actually need to be

295
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,720
answering a question like this.

296
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,441
And of course, the answer is no,

297
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:16,862
but we didn't know what we should.

298
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:21,082
tell her. So we ended up calling the suicide prevention hotline ourselves.

299
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:26,866
And they really pushed us to tell the player to get professional help.

300
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:32,670
But we thought if all we were doing was telling her, you know, you should talk to someone,

301
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,213
go talk to a psychiatrist or a counselor, a teacher. And that was all we did, that

302
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:42,657
she might feel like we were just pushing her away, and she might not talk to anyone.

303
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,210
And if we were at a bigger company, they'd probably tell us,

304
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,771
don't talk to her and don't engage in conversation.

305
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,472
But we felt a responsibility

306
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,313
that we should continue the conversation.

307
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:55,274
So we did tell her to get help.

308
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:57,876
But we also told her that we were there to listen to her.

309
00:15:58,896 --> 00:15:59,517
And for a week,

310
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:02,358
and it was the most nerve-wracking week I've ever had,

311
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:05,140
we would exchange messages back and forth with her.

312
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,536
And sometimes we might go a day and a half

313
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:10,656
before she messaged back.

314
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,717
And during that time, I was really scared

315
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:13,878
that she wasn't going to respond.

316
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,639
But then every time we saw a message, I got more scared

317
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:19,640
because she would tell us more about what she was thinking.

318
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,681
But finally, after that week and a half,

319
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,962
she sent a message to us.

320
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:30,404
And she basically said, I want to thank you for saving me.

321
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:34,085
And she told us that she had finally gotten help.

322
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,427
And she followed on by saying,

323
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,748
all of you at the studio should know,

324
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:41,709
you're the reason I'm still here,

325
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,350
as weird as that sounds.

326
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:49,273
And this showed us that games are really, really powerful.

327
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:54,056
We're part of an interactive medium

328
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:55,817
that people really connect to.

329
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:59,439
And this girl felt comfortable enough

330
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,020
that she could reach out to us.

331
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,201
And because we paid attention to her,

332
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:04,521
she was getting help.

333
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:11,307
Now in the course of helping her, we started doing more research on both cyberbullying and suicide.

334
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:18,371
And we discovered that here in the US, 1 out of 6 teens has been bullied.

335
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:28,938
But what was even scarier than that, is that 1 out of 13 teens have actually tried to kill themselves.

336
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:29,278
1 out of 13.

337
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:32,119
I mean, that number is insane.

338
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:34,201
And so...

339
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:39,508
After this incident, we decided we really have to find a non-profit.

340
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,009
So we started trying to cold call people again.

341
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:51,312
Now as it turns out, the very next day, sorry I skipped that slide, but the very next day

342
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:58,335
I had a friend who I had known from the industry, he had just joined a new company called PlayMob,

343
00:17:58,955 --> 00:17:59,936
and he got in touch with me.

344
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,197
And he basically said, PlayMob connects.

345
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,435
game developers with non-profits,

346
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,558
so that the developers can help the non-profits raise money

347
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,681
as well as raise awareness for these non-profits.

348
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:17,945
And he also told me that the week before

349
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,649
they contacted us, they had just signed a new non-profit.

350
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,692
And that non-profit was called the CyberSmile Foundation.

351
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:27,994
And they focus on cyberbullying.

352
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:31,377
And they actually have a helpline with counselors.

353
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,142
It was amazing, amazing timing.

354
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:40,026
And we got on the phone with both people at Playmob,

355
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,688
as well as CyberSmile, and we quickly

356
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,789
hashed out an arrangement.

357
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,912
And we decided to do four things to our game

358
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:50,735
to really help our players understand cyberbullying

359
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:51,015
better.

360
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:58,021
So the first is we created a cyberbullying quest.

361
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,683
And in the quest, we have a girl, Hope,

362
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,705
a sister of one of our main characters.

363
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:05,875
who's starting to have problems,

364
00:19:06,236 --> 00:19:07,977
but her brother doesn't know what the problems are.

365
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,578
And you work with her to discover over time

366
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:11,799
that she's being cyberbullied.

367
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,841
And she does some things that you're not supposed to do,

368
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,862
like confront the bully directly.

369
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:21,285
But over time, she learns about the things you should do.

370
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:25,767
Some of those things are to always tell an adult,

371
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,029
to save a record of the bullying and not delete the messages

372
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,231
so that you have proof of what happened,

373
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:33,652
to not retaliate.

374
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,953
were to talk directly to the bullies, but to hold back.

375
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:45,438
And the second thing we did was we put in-game facts on bullying

376
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:48,000
into our game.

377
00:19:50,802 --> 00:19:51,622
The third thing we did

378
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:57,906
is we actually allowed Cybersmile counselors access to our in-game support system.

379
00:19:58,286 --> 00:19:59,987
So whenever players would message us for help,

380
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:03,563
CyberSmile counselors could be the ones responding

381
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:05,304
because they had the training.

382
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:10,127
And then lastly, we put CyberSmile-specific items

383
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,849
in our game so that players who cared about this

384
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:14,710
could actually buy these items

385
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,892
and a portion of the proceeds would go to CyberSmile.

386
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:22,495
So our goal was to run the campaign for a month

387
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,977
to raise $20,000 and hopefully educate

388
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:27,578
hundreds of thousands of our players.

389
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:34,362
And it turns out that our players loved what we did with this campaign.

390
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:38,224
One player said, I love these creators.

391
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:41,287
I feel like they actually care about their players and their opinions.

392
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:48,872
And we actually saw the number of people playing our game every day increase by 16% because

393
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:49,552
of this quest.

394
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:56,157
So this is an example of where you can do good and make money at the same time.

395
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:04,248
Our quest was so successful that we decided to keep it in our game for a lot longer than a month.

396
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:11,390
And so, since then, we've educated over 5 million players about cyberbullying.

397
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,631
We've raised $350,000 for CyberSmile.

398
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:19,612
And we've connected thousands of players to CyberSmile.

399
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:23,713
You know, some of these players were just sharing stories of how they've been bullied.

400
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:27,213
But some of these players were being bullied.

401
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:29,007
or were self-hurting.

402
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:32,309
We've had players who've been abused by their parents

403
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,130
or concerned about abuse that they've seen

404
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,931
with a girlfriend or boyfriend.

405
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:40,873
And some of the players also

406
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,794
were thinking about committing suicide.

407
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,276
CyberSmiles shared some stories.

408
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:49,578
One that really stood out was they were helping

409
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:52,719
a teen who was on the roof of a house

410
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,841
chatting back and forth with them.

411
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:56,661
And

412
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,910
By the end of that chat conversation,

413
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:02,133
they had been able to get the parents involved

414
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:03,995
and the teen had come off the roof

415
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:05,796
and the parents knew what was going on

416
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,598
so that they could find help

417
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:09,640
and talk to their kid about the problem.

418
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:17,168
And we had other people contact us

419
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,750
and contact CyberSmile

420
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,353
and we were able to save other lives as well.

421
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,899
This was really powerful for our studio.

422
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:27,700
And it inspired people on our team

423
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,961
to think up ways in which they could do things with our game

424
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:32,981
to help people as well.

425
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:37,662
We had one designer who decided that he

426
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:41,742
wanted to focus on women in gaming and sexual harassment.

427
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:44,243
And this was about a year before GamerGate.

428
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:47,984
So he wrote a storyline about one

429
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:51,264
of our females in the game who is a gamer

430
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,785
and talked about how.

431
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,867
guys would react to her when she was playing in tournaments.

432
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:01,850
And this was a response from one of our players.

433
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:06,833
One of my favorites is a storyline about sexism and sexual harassment in gaming.

434
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:11,075
From start to finish, it was the ultimate response to gamer discrimination.

435
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:19,540
Two of the females in our studio, our COO and one of our writers, talked about how when

436
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,901
they were in high school, they had body image issues.

437
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,371
So they reached out to the National Eating Disorders Association,

438
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:32,412
and we partnered with them in creating a storyline about eating disorders and body image.

439
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:37,273
And at the end of that, we gave players a chance who wanted to learn more

440
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,914
an opportunity to discover more details about eating disorders.

441
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,275
Our players really responded to this as well.

442
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,636
But one thing we learned, even when you're partnering with a non-profit.

443
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:56,093
they don't always understand how powerful a game can be.

444
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:59,195
So when we first launched our eating disorder storyline,

445
00:23:59,215 --> 00:24:01,277
you know, the non-profit had told us,

446
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:03,919
there's specific things in the game you should not include

447
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,620
because they may be triggers

448
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,642
that cause someone who had an eating disorder before

449
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:10,463
to relapse.

450
00:24:11,164 --> 00:24:12,365
And so we pulled those things out.

451
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,006
But they didn't realize that

452
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,428
just the storyline and the emotional draw from that

453
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:18,609
might be enough.

454
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:20,710
to start triggering people.

455
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:23,773
So once we launched it, within that same day,

456
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:25,254
we had a number of players tell us

457
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:28,257
that the story hit too close to home,

458
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,458
was a little too traumatic,

459
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,841
and we had to push out a message immediately

460
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:34,943
telling our players that, you know,

461
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,546
if this is something that you've struggled with,

462
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:41,429
you may want to avoid the quest.

463
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:46,373
And later we were able to get in a warning message.

464
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:49,504
to make sure that players knew before they started the quest

465
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,988
that it would be about body image and eating disorder,

466
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:56,409
so they didn't even have to choose it if they wanted to.

467
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:00,412
At the end of this quest,

468
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:03,755
we had over 50,000 players click

469
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,196
to learn more about eating disorders.

470
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:09,979
So several months went by,

471
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,042
and we finally had time to focus on education.

472
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,022
One of the first features we put in our game

473
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:20,324
was called your voice pulling.

474
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:24,307
Now at its roots, it's a very simple feature.

475
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,870
Basically, we have a question and we have answers.

476
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,693
And we try and do a mix of different type of questions.

477
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,775
A lot of them are just fun and frivolous

478
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:37,398
and focus on movies or memes or trends,

479
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:39,900
or they just ask you, would you rather

480
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,081
be stung by 1,000 bees or bitten by a dog?

481
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:50,947
But some of our questions we put in there are about serious topics, like net neutrality,

482
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:57,311
about Syria, about events going on in our world that we think it's important for people

483
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:57,852
to know about.

484
00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:06,618
And players can see the type of responses that other people in the game are sharing.

485
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:11,101
And our hope by doing this was that over time...

486
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,382
As players started seeing more and more serious topics,

487
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:16,985
that even if they didn't care about the topic at first,

488
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:19,187
the next time they heard someone talking about it

489
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:21,769
or they caught a glimpse of a headline on a website,

490
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:25,453
they might spend some more time interacting with those topics.

491
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:34,241
And as this one player shows, our players

492
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:36,503
really understood what we were trying to do.

493
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:45,361
And to date, we've had over 50 million questions

494
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:46,502
that have been answered.

495
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:51,185
And the number of sessions since we introduced the feature

496
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:51,585
went up by 12%.

497
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:56,969
And one of our players said, the political questions

498
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:59,031
are only annoying because I end up spending

499
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:00,111
an hour researching them.

500
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:08,778
So the next feature we tried to introduce into the game

501
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:10,819
was Extra Credit Vocabulary.

502
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:20,953
So our thinking behind this was that kids get really stressed out by the SAT.

503
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:26,056
And we actually had a poll question about the SATs asking them about that.

504
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:29,078
And 30% of our players were really stressed by it.

505
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:36,202
The other thing we realized is that there's an income disparity.

506
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:41,665
And for 27% of our players, they could afford prep courses or private tutors.

507
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:45,499
But on average, those courses now cost over $1,000.

508
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:51,042
And so for players who come from a lower economic background

509
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:53,883
and whose parents can't afford those expensive prep courses,

510
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:56,205
we thought our game might be a way to help

511
00:27:56,405 --> 00:27:57,585
level the playing field for them.

512
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:00,727
And for everyone, it would be an opportunity

513
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,948
for them to learn vocabulary.

514
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:05,289
And if they were in high school,

515
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,110
study for the SAT while they're playing our game.

516
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:09,511
And so we really wanted to put.

517
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:13,690
you know, game mechanics that would fit this

518
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,591
and try and make it as fun as possible.

519
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,352
So we learned from a lot of the Sega games out there,

520
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,713
like Candy Crush and Cookie Jam

521
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:22,973
and all those other puzzle games.

522
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:25,774
And we used a map,

523
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:28,435
and we created a series of different mini-games.

524
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,816
Some of the mini-games were story-based,

525
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:33,836
and they fall very much in line

526
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:36,217
with what we already do with our game.

527
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:41,797
And here, we're trying to teach players what the word potentially can mean

528
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,778
just via the context of the game,

529
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:46,540
rather than using a word and a definition.

530
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,722
Having them learn in the context of a story should help.

531
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:53,105
And whether they get it wrong or right,

532
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,907
eventually they'll learn that verbose means wordy.

533
00:28:57,768 --> 00:28:59,269
And then the second type of minigame we have,

534
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:03,393
it's a fast-paced action-style minigame

535
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:06,215
where you're trying to match synonyms or antonyms.

536
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:09,395
And this really reinforces the learning.

537
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:18,602
And we were afraid at first that players might shy away from our game because of the educational

538
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:19,082
aspects.

539
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:24,466
But our players are pretty smart, and they understood what we were trying to do, too.

540
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:33,073
One player gave this as an example of how the feature allowed them to keep playing the

541
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:33,253
game.

542
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,515
We released the SAT functionality in December,

543
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:43,636
so I don't have a ton of data on it so far,

544
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:46,778
but it's been really well-received by our players in the forums.

545
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:51,220
And all these type of features are features that, over time,

546
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,842
our players feel like we care about them

547
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:56,143
and keep them more and more connected to our game.

548
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:02,826
So in conclusion, I wanted to talk a little bit about the industry

549
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:06,788
and how, especially, how many of you are in the mobile games industry?

550
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,653
So in mobile games, and we're starting to see it in other areas of games,

551
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:16,616
we talk about numbers and data all the time.

552
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:23,362
We talk about day one retention, day 30 retention, ARPDAU, DAU, MAU.

553
00:30:24,883 --> 00:30:29,847
And when we use these numbers, we think about our players not as people,

554
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,329
but as whales, as people we can make money from,

555
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,371
or people who can download and play our games.

556
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:38,453
But the things that.

557
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,886
that happened with our game have taught me

558
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,267
that each one of our players is an individual.

559
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:48,529
And it's something that we all should know about,

560
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,010
but we don't think about a lot.

561
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,911
And my hope is that from this talk,

562
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:59,394
that if just a few of you start thinking about how in your jobs

563
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:01,735
you can use your game to start making a difference,

564
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:05,876
that more and more games can take the mechanics we've done

565
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:09,258
and the ways in which we're already engaging players.

566
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,782
And we can use that to help create games that have more and more of a social impact.

567
00:31:15,722 --> 00:31:20,263
And as those games become more and more successful, bigger companies will take notice.

568
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:30,727
And eventually, I hope that games are associated both with entertainment, but also with making

569
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:35,148
a difference, and that we remember that all of our players are people too.

570
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:36,448
Thank you.

571
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:48,916
So if you have any questions, feel free to go up to the

572
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:49,436
microphone.

573
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:54,719
I can talk about either events that happened within the game

574
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,400
or elucidate more on some of those things.

575
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,702
Or I can just answer questions about our game or things we

576
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:01,664
did to make our game more successful.

577
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:05,326
Hi.

578
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:13,195
I was just wondering if, first of all, I think this experiment of taking a really successful game and trying to make it educational is awesome.

579
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:31,766
I was wondering if you had any stories of, say, failures that we might also learn from when it comes to making a feature that's more educational or making a feature that integrates with, or hooks up with a non-profit or something like that.

580
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:36,907
Right. I mean, so, I mean the best example was probably the one I shared where

581
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:41,629
we didn't even realize how powerful the message would be and we had to scramble at the last minute.

582
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,872
You know, some of those players who had eating disorders and started playing those quests

583
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:50,154
they were guessing that something was coming like that, but...

584
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:55,179
You could really see kind of their angst and their anxiety.

585
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,283
Once we started triggering that and so we felt really, really, really bad about that.

586
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:04,946
And I think one of the things you know we've learned over time with high school story.

587
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:10,930
We release new quests every week and we've learned that you know having downloadable systems

588
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,052
and basically online systems so that you can adjust things and change things

589
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:18,054
and add messages is super, super helpful.

590
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:20,656
Because inevitably if you're dropping new content.

591
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,833
At that type of pace, you're always going to have problems.

592
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:26,234
Cool, thank you.

593
00:33:31,615 --> 00:33:35,376
Hey, I was wondering if you know the demographics of your game?

594
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:39,157
Do you tend to have more female or male players?

595
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:41,998
Yeah, that's a good question.

596
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:45,939
She asked about the demographics for our game.

597
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:52,490
The large majority of our players, we believe, are teen females.

598
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:57,233
When we look at Facebook Connect, it says the number one group is 18 to 24,

599
00:33:58,073 --> 00:33:59,674
and then the number two group is 14 to 18.

600
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:06,259
But we think Facebook's reliability, especially when it comes to people under 18,

601
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,699
isn't always the most reliable.

602
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,301
And looking at our forums and everything,

603
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,823
we think our core audience is probably 14 to 18 females.

604
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:15,805
And when it comes to females versus males,

605
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,696
About 85% of our players are females now.

606
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:21,799
I do think that's changed over time.

607
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:25,542
When we first launched, it was much more gender neutral.

608
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:28,604
But over time, because of all the advertising and targeting

609
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:32,026
we've done, we've pulled in more and more females into the game.

610
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,929
So was that a purposeful choice, or did it just happen?

611
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,153
I would say it was a purposeful choice

612
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:43,695
to pursue the advertising that was most effective.

613
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:45,776
So in the mobile games industry.

614
00:34:47,442 --> 00:34:51,064
Most mobile game companies will spend a lot of money on what we call user acquisition.

615
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:55,967
And so you want to do the most effective user acquisition you can.

616
00:34:56,488 --> 00:35:00,530
And for us, the ads that started working the best were ones that appealed towards females.

617
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,251
Thank you. You're welcome.

618
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:06,233
Inspiring talk, sir.

619
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:10,436
Have you had any further contact with the young one whose life you saved?

620
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:14,023
We actually haven't had any contact with her since.

621
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:18,944
So the question is if we had any contact with the young woman since.

622
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:21,565
And one of the things that's our policy is,

623
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:24,907
already when we're talking back to our players,

624
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:30,829
and it's not about game-related issues,

625
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:33,330
but deeper or social issues like this,

626
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:37,840
We have never talked to our lawyers about this.

627
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,343
So one of the first things we started thinking about when we got this message

628
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:43,344
and we thought about whether we should reply back or not,

629
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,186
someone in the studio actually brought up,

630
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,008
you know, legally are we even allowed to talk to these people?

631
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:51,891
And, excuse me, we decided that.

632
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:56,959
Even if we weren't sure if we were allowed to talk to them about this,

633
00:35:57,019 --> 00:36:00,802
especially if they may be underage, so we made a point not to ask about her age,

634
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:03,464
you know, we wanted to engage with her.

635
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:07,526
But after that point, when we knew she was getting help,

636
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:11,049
you know, we never wanted to be the one to initiate a conversation.

637
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,570
Okay, thank you.

638
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,131
You're welcome.

639
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:22,473
Hello. I'm wondering what your thoughts on the game being a value-based game,

640
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,974
but also wanting the company, obviously, to be profitable in the long run.

641
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:29,975
Do you feel like you have to make sacrifices on either side,

642
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:31,595
and how do you have that balance?

643
00:36:32,595 --> 00:36:34,815
Yeah, so I think that's a really good question.

644
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:38,636
He's asking about, you know, because we're a value-based company,

645
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,196
but we're also trying to make money,

646
00:36:41,276 --> 00:36:43,857
you know, if we run into conflicts related to that.

647
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:44,517
And...

648
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:52,980
We haven't, and the main reason is because we said as our guiding light, the first thing we want to try and do is have commercial success.

649
00:36:55,241 --> 00:37:06,005
And so, you know, when we're designing our games, right, we're always thinking about what type of features are really going to be fun and entertaining for our players first.

650
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:10,015
And then only after that point do we start thinking about these other features.

651
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:14,616
And as you can tell, a lot of those features, like some of them definitely tend more educational,

652
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:18,898
but what we've seen in most cases is that it's actually improved our game

653
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:22,079
and helped with retention or with engagement from our players.

654
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:28,060
But, you know, I'm sure at some point that may come up.

655
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:31,241
And I guess as I think about it,

656
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:35,103
you know, even when we decide whether we should answer back to that girl or not,

657
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:35,843
you know.

658
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:38,932
One of the other questions we had was,

659
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:42,433
what happens if we engage with her and we say the wrong thing?

660
00:37:43,414 --> 00:37:45,634
And she does end up killing herself.

661
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,015
And her parents find out that we were talking to her

662
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:49,115
during that process.

663
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:50,716
And we get sued.

664
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:53,517
And so from that perspective, and that's

665
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:54,777
why I think a lot of big companies

666
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:57,578
would not be engaged in those type of conversations.

667
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:00,059
And they would tell you just to stop communicating.

668
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,778
So in that case, I guess we do put our company at the risk

669
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:05,758
sometimes when we do this.

670
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:07,239
But for us, it's worth it.

671
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,581
And it really makes a difference in your studio when

672
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:14,643
you're starting to do things like this.

673
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:18,565
Because everyone on our team, we all love making games.

674
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:20,406
But now we actually feel like what we're doing

675
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:21,887
has more of an impact.

676
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:24,549
So even when we talk to our parents and our friends about

677
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:26,089
it, it's something that they all really get.

678
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,991
And I think it gives us kind of an extra push in what we do.

679
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:36,394
Yeah, I also agree. This is a great talk.

680
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,855
Do you have any counselors on staff?

681
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:42,236
No, we don't have counselors ourselves.

682
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:45,818
That's one of the reasons we partnered with the nonprofits,

683
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:48,499
so that when we get those questions,

684
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:51,820
we redirect them to CyberSmile,

685
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,702
so they do have counselors there.

686
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:59,784
We have had people on our staff get more educated about this,

687
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:01,545
and we've actually thought about in the past

688
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:04,226
putting some of our support staff through training.

689
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:08,718
so that they'd be able to help more, but it's a lot easier

690
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,285
and makes a lot more sense for us to just have, you know,

691
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:14,352
them talk to someone who's at a trained non-profit.

692
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,571
Hi, sorry, quick question.

693
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,893
Just because you've seen a good amount of success

694
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:32,396
from implementing these features into High School Story,

695
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,660
do you guys feel inspired to just create new games

696
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,723
that are really geared towards social good

697
00:39:41,444 --> 00:39:42,404
as the main feature?

698
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:44,346
Right, so the question was,

699
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:47,909
because of High School Story and the success we've seen

700
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,551
for our next games, do we think a lot about creating games

701
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:51,712
that focus on social good?

702
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:52,673
And.

703
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:57,517
The direct answer I'd say to that is no.

704
00:39:57,537 --> 00:40:02,582
Because we still think about what's going to be most successful in the marketplace.

705
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:05,885
Because if you're trying to create a game for just social good,

706
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:08,987
you may not reach as many people.

707
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,169
Because not as many people are going to play that game.

708
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,381
We're always thinking about how we can create a game where we can make enough money to support our studio,

709
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:22,482
hopefully more, so we can keep growing the studio, but at the same time reach more and more people.

710
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:30,744
So when we spend money on advertising, you know, a lot of companies will spend money to make sure that they're always making a profit off those ads.

711
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:38,205
Sometimes we push the limit and we spend as much money as we think we're going to make from players who come in through those ads.

712
00:40:38,665 --> 00:40:40,726
And it's because of that kind of social message too.

713
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:45,129
But as an example, for our second game we released, it's called Hollywood You,

714
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,233
which on its surface, you know, doesn't feel

715
00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:52,916
like it has much to do with social good at all. And right now, you know,

716
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:57,359
our storyline, we still try and keep it to the values that

717
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:01,022
we believe in, and we try and promote, you know, inclusion

718
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,624
and people being themselves in our story.

719
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:08,388
But we don't have these elements of working with non-profits or doing things.

720
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,020
We definitely have thought about those features.

721
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,062
And over the next few months, we'll start rolling in those type of storylines.

722
00:41:15,882 --> 00:41:18,264
One of the great things about Hollywood is, you know,

723
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:22,146
celebrity is actually, a lot of them work with different non-profits.

724
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:25,747
So as part of the game, you know, after you start becoming a little more famous

725
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:29,129
and connected within the game, you'll have the opportunity to choose

726
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,312
among different non-profits to work with, and to see which one you want to support.

727
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:38,674
And in doing so, we're hoping we can educate players about those particular causes.

728
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:45,323
Any other questions?

729
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:47,745
Great, thank you.

730
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:49,387
And I hope some of you leave inspired

731
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,489
and are able to make a difference with your games

732
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:52,810
as well.

733
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:53,510
Thank you.
