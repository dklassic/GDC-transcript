00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,321
Welcome today to Champion Insights.

2
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,422
I know a lot of you guys are coming to this talking like,

3
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:13,323
okay, Riot Games is giving a talk,

4
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:15,044
they're only gonna talk about League of Legends

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,105
and their eSports and their bizarre stuff with that.

6
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:19,525
That's not the case today.

7
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,106
We're actually going to be covering

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,426
more than just League of Legends.

9
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:24,867
We're gonna be covering stuff from a lot of games.

10
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:27,048
A lot of the data that I'm gonna be presenting today

11
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,969
and the methodologies can be applied

12
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:30,629
to your games or to your studios.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,410
We're also gonna be talking about some other stuff.

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,251
We're gonna talk probably a little bit about K-pop.

15
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:38,959
abstract expressionism in American art,

16
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,440
and we're gonna talk about scuba suits.

17
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,043
But most importantly, we're going to be talking about

18
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:45,284
champions in League of Legends

19
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:48,186
and characters in games overall.

20
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:50,007
So, who am I?

21
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,389
I am Nathan Blaustois Blau.

22
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:57,469
Blaustoise is a mix of Blau and the Pokemon Blaustoise.

23
00:00:57,529 --> 00:01:00,812
Nintendo attorneys, please save your questions till the end.

24
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:04,336
I studied neuroscience and political science

25
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:05,537
at the University of Chicago.

26
00:01:06,178 --> 00:01:08,961
Jason Jones, who is one of the co-founders of Budgie,

27
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:10,422
was always a major influence to me.

28
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:15,025
My career in the games industry was started at PlayStation.

29
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:21,169
I have to take a brief moment to thank the PlayStation user research team

30
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:23,190
and Justin Tanimura specifically.

31
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,712
They got me my start in games and I owe them everything.

32
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:27,753
So thank you guys so much.

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,231
And now currently I work at Riot Games,

34
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:33,571
maker of League of Legends,

35
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,872
and I am the Gameplay Insights Lead.

36
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:39,332
And we will talk a little bit more about what that is,

37
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:40,893
what is Insights, et cetera.

38
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:44,173
Because we're talking about champions today though,

39
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,533
and we're gonna be talking about characters

40
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:46,454
and champions in game,

41
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,534
both my favorite champion in League of Legends

42
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:53,455
and also my favorite character in all of games is Yasuo.

43
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:54,115
So.

44
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:57,756
Yeah, wow, my gosh, he's a Yasuo main?

45
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,136
More on that later.

46
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:00,657
That's certainly covered in the talk.

47
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:02,917
Cool, let's talk about Insights, though.

48
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,698
So what was I saying when I mentioned

49
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,458
that I'm the Gameplay Insights lead?

50
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:07,919
What's Insights at Riot?

51
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,920
Well, it's a mixture of analytics, research,

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,640
a splash of data science,

53
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,561
and a healthy serving of strategic advising.

54
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:21,485
In short, what we do is we gather and analyze data, both quantitative and qualitative, from

55
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:29,211
our game, from our players, and we provide insights, recommendations, strategies to our

56
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,473
designers, our artists, and our leaders.

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,885
Today's champion, or today's talk is going to focus

58
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:39,229
on champions, so this is Champion Insights.

59
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,432
We're gonna be talking specifically about how we use

60
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,497
that data to inform decisions around the roster

61
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:45,299
of over 140 champions now.

62
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,274
Feels like yesterday that it was not that much,

63
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:53,116
but now here we are at 140 in our 10th year,

64
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:55,477
over 140 actually.

65
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:59,700
But every time I reference champions in this talk,

66
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,561
I want you guys to know that you can apply that

67
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,503
to characters in games.

68
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,185
And what I mean by that is that characters

69
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:07,786
are everywhere in games.

70
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:10,468
It's not just League of Legends and their champions, right?

71
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:12,689
We have games like Overwatch.

72
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,610
Battle Rite, we have mobile games,

73
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:17,871
we have stuff like Brawl Stars,

74
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:20,272
we even have mobile MOBA games,

75
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:21,912
don't say that 10 times fast,

76
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:25,073
like Mobile Legends, with the characters in their game.

77
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,074
We even have, you know, the new hotness,

78
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,995
Battle Royale finally has, you know,

79
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:33,256
some great character set with Apex Legends.

80
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,357
And then we even have character games

81
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,417
where we take sort of collaboration

82
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,078
of characters across multiple games and genres

83
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:42,859
with something like Super Smash Bros.

84
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:47,156
So, in all of these games, and in League of Legends,

85
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:50,902
there's only one thing that is more important than.

86
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:56,292
characters. And, you know, sorry because I'm cheesy, but it's players. It's the people

87
00:03:56,352 --> 00:04:01,233
who play and engage with these characters. So, the importance of today's talk is that,

88
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:06,235
hey, we're looking at the most important part of your game, characters, and we're talking

89
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:09,815
about the most important part of the game holistically, which is the players who play

90
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:13,977
it. We're trying to understand the relationship between those two and make better decisions.

91
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:18,390
So characters matter to our players.

92
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,613
That's why they engage in so many of these games,

93
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,836
even games that aren't necessarily

94
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,220
these competitive PVP games

95
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,762
like Overwatch or League of Legends.

96
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:28,605
We can even think about the importance of characters

97
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,287
in Mass Effect or something like that.

98
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,210
What I want to talk about is how these,

99
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,072
just go through a couple examples of some players

100
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,412
who latch onto certain characters

101
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,973
and build an affinity for them.

102
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,294
So I'm gonna go through three.

103
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:44,034
Some of you guys might know these,

104
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:45,975
some of you guys might be totally unaware,

105
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,856
but these are three of the most popular streamers

106
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,877
on Twitch TV of League of Legends.

107
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:53,398
So these people play League of Legends for a living

108
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:54,839
and have other people watch them.

109
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,160
So first one I'm gonna go over is Moe, okay?

110
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,080
And Moe is this guy,

111
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:02,082
He's kind of this cool kid, you know, he's kind of cocky.

112
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:05,178
He kind of likes to show off and style on people.

113
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:08,822
And the champion he's best known for is that one

114
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:09,883
that I referenced earlier.

115
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,204
It's Yasuo, OK?

116
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:16,469
And Yasuo perfectly embodies this show-off sort of style.

117
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:19,751
In fact, one of Yasuo's quotes is, kill me, you can try.

118
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,852
So very, very fitting.

119
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,315
Next, we have Pokimane.

120
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:27,518
And she's a streamer who's on a different end, is super

121
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,980
bright and cheerful.

122
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,585
super high energy and positive and her favorite champion is Lux.

123
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,788
And Lux in our game is this light mage.

124
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:40,210
She's the spirited, happy character.

125
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:42,632
She's always being positive.

126
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:46,516
And her quote is, if you can smile, you can be the light.

127
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:50,720
And lastly, we have my my dear friend Tyler1.

128
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:57,523
And Tyler1 is, you know, hey, this guy is competitive.

129
00:05:57,543 --> 00:06:00,544
This guy is driven, competitive, fierce.

130
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:02,404
He's all about, he's kind of this alpha male,

131
00:06:02,524 --> 00:06:04,025
all about dominating his opponents.

132
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:05,485
And the character he plays,

133
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:08,486
and has gravitated towards, is Draven.

134
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,987
And Draven embodies that in our game perfectly.

135
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:13,387
Draven is all about dominating his opponents

136
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:15,308
in the early game, and it's all about

137
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,108
sort of that strength and style.

138
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:21,190
And his quote is, subtle, I don't do subtle.

139
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:26,730
So our goal with these data is to understand the relationship between players and characters.

140
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,311
And it's not just these three high-profile characters,

141
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:36,013
these three high-profile players and the characters they have been drawn to.

142
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:40,814
But we're talking about the stories of millions of players across the world

143
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:43,455
playing millions of hours on these characters.

144
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,956
And that's where the importance of all of this comes from.

145
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,535
So what kinds of things can we inform with this data?

146
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:52,916
Well, let's go through just a quick list,

147
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,816
and we're gonna return to this list at the end

148
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:55,956
with specific examples,

149
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,937
but just to get your mind thinking about them

150
00:06:58,237 --> 00:06:59,317
as we go through the talk today,

151
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:01,217
here's what I want you to think about.

152
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:03,878
We can inform decisions on your current game

153
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,638
or the future state of your game, right?

154
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:09,139
You can talk about new opportunities

155
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,299
for your character roster,

156
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,519
being more deliberate and informed

157
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,900
with updating characters or updating your game.

158
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:19,659
you can talk about how you would create games with the same IP.

159
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:23,161
Say you're creating a new game with the Overwatch characters.

160
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:27,223
Say you're taking the Apex characters and turning them into a MOBA game.

161
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:30,865
You can inform that data for those games

162
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:33,406
with an understanding of your current characters.

163
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:37,633
You can also use this data to inform rosters

164
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,173
with entirely new IP.

165
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:41,855
Imagine you knew everything there was to know

166
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,775
about the Overwatch characters

167
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:47,177
and someone tasked you with making a new game

168
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,838
with a similar sort of style as Overwatch.

169
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,660
You could use that data from those Overwatch characters

170
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,141
to help and inform what you're going to do with this new IP.

171
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:59,688
And it's not just games, it's creatives too.

172
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:03,251
We can talk about how we feature our characters in art,

173
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:05,313
and in comics, and in movies.

174
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:08,675
We can talk about publishing, how can we be more targeted

175
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:11,618
about presenting the more aspirational characters

176
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,659
to the right audience in our publishing efforts.

177
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,821
And even things like physical merchandise

178
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:18,583
to make sure that the characters that players want

179
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,426
to buy the merch for the most are getting that chance.

180
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,801
We'll get to these later and I'll show some specific examples.

181
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,482
But you guys are like, okay, Nathan, you showed us Tyler1,

182
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,584
you showed us a bunch of other games, where's the data?

183
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:34,665
Okay, let's get to the data today.

184
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,946
We're gonna be covering three data sets today.

185
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:40,588
And let's just briefly go over what they are

186
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,748
so you can be prepared for them.

187
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,590
The first one is a pretty simple engagement data set.

188
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,612
It's our play rate over time data.

189
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:51,353
And what this basically tracks is how much players

190
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:52,674
are playing a champion.

191
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:59,341
over the course of time. Very simple. Our next data set is similar to this, but a little

192
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:05,667
bit more complicated. It's our breadth versus depth measurement. And this is similar to

193
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:10,272
our play rate data, but has a little bit more nuance and a much more complicated tableau

194
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:11,834
graph. Much more on that later.

195
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,036
And then lastly, we're gonna shift away from engagement data

196
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,616
and sort of that raw telemetry,

197
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:20,837
and we're gonna focus on our mass champion survey.

198
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,138
And this is something that's measuring more sentiment,

199
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,398
more feels from our players

200
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,179
about what they think about our champions.

201
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,100
And this can cover things

202
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,440
beyond just people playing the champions,

203
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,421
but stuff like visuals, voice, personality,

204
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,642
and how our players feel about everything

205
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,583
outside of the game for the characters as well.

206
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,870
To start us off though, let's go with that play rate over time.

207
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,332
And we're actually just going to focus on one champion in particular and go through

208
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:50,313
a sort of series of stories about this champion.

209
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,735
Oh, and sorry, one final note I do have to note.

210
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:59,812
We're going to be covering stuff from active League of Legends players.

211
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,194
Keep that caveat in mind. We have other data sets that look at stuff like

212
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:08,315
League of Legends players who have stopped playing or potential new players of League of Legends.

213
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,596
For today, the data we're going to be looking at is active League of Legends players.

214
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:13,536
Okay.

215
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:16,227
Let's go on a play rate journey.

216
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,129
And what I mean by a play rate journey

217
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,991
is let's see how the play rate of a champion

218
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,274
changes over time, specifically over a few months,

219
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:26,260
about a year, and we're going to be talking about Akali.

220
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:31,796
Now, before I get into that juicy data, I am going to pose a question that we will try

221
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:37,103
to answer with this data, which is, what happens when a ninja joins a K-pop group?

222
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:41,349
I'll have a series of these esoteric questions sprinkled throughout.

223
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:43,191
We'll see if we can get some answers to them.

224
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:45,514
But this is what I meant when I referenced K-pop.

225
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:50,198
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with League of Legends,

226
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:53,060
I have a brief explanation when I say Champion Update.

227
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,681
So let's quickly cover what that is.

228
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,603
So League of Legends is coming up on 10 years now.

229
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,843
It's quite a long time.

230
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:03,206
And part of that longevity is that we're constantly evolving and changing the game.

231
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,591
To do that, we have to sometimes look at some of our older characters

232
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:09,972
and find ways to make them fresh again,

233
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:13,234
whether that's updating their visuals, updating their gameplay.

234
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:16,857
Or in the case of Akali, we did what's called a VGU,

235
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:18,798
Visual Gameplay Update,

236
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:22,520
the full package, totally reimagining this character

237
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,981
into something new and fresh,

238
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:27,403
kind of like if we took that archetype and we're designing it today.

239
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:34,247
So Akali was previously a more sort of just kind of generic ninja.

240
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:39,188
She, yeah, was a green ninja, I guess.

241
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,369
There wasn't too much particularly interesting about her,

242
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,649
and we sort of totally reimagined her into this more sort of street-style ninja.

243
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,650
She got these really cool tattoos,

244
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,531
and her gameplay was made much more fresh for the current age of League of Legends.

245
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,991
So what does updating a champion do to its play rate?

246
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,092
Let's start the journey.

247
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:05,026
So, this is Akali's play rate over the course of before,

248
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:07,428
a little bit before her update, through her update,

249
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:09,329
and all the way to today.

250
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,392
The X axis is time, you can see sort of in very small text,

251
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:15,834
the monthly callouts, and the Y axis is just how much

252
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:19,216
Akali is getting played relative to other champions.

253
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,537
All the other champions are the dimmed out ones

254
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:23,619
in the background, we've highlighted Akali

255
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,040
in that nice blue T.

256
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,266
heel. To start off our journey, I want to draw your eyes to the very far left, the very,

257
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:36,651
very far left of that graph to where there's that flat line and then there's a little bump

258
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:43,919
before the giant spike and that is Akali's last hurrah. So what this is, is when we have

259
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:44,559
officially

260
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,061
started to update Akali.

261
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:50,184
We've put the new version of Akali on our public test realm

262
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:53,767
and all of the players on the live servers are like,

263
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:55,109
okay, it's real now.

264
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,010
They're actually the mad lads.

265
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,512
They're actually gonna get rid of Akali.

266
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,393
We need to get our last games in.

267
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:03,596
So all of the current Akali players

268
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:05,278
will go and get those last games in.

269
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,780
Maybe people who used to play her will go and play her,

270
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,561
but we get this little last hurrah bump.

271
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:12,972
and you know it's emphasized by wolverine here

272
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,438
fondly remembering all the calling

273
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,780
okay

274
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:19,903
But it's League of Legends, out with the old, in with the new.

275
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:21,324
Let's talk about that update.

276
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:21,884
Boom.

277
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:24,965
That spike on the graft is huge because this

278
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:26,805
is when Akali actually drops.

279
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:28,946
That's the day that the Akali update drops,

280
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,206
and a bunch of players go and play her.

281
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:34,467
And these are not just the old players trying out

282
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:35,787
to see if they like the new one.

283
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,188
These are players like myself.

284
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:40,068
I never had a game on the old Akali,

285
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:43,369
but I saw the new gameplay, the new abilities.

286
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,510
I saw the new visuals.

287
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,030
I thought, wait.

288
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,395
You know, I play Yasuo, I'm kind of a weeb,

289
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,717
that looks like a champion for me.

290
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:52,819
So I go and I start to play Anakali as well,

291
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,561
and then other people are just checking her out

292
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,463
just to get a sense of what the kit's going to be like

293
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,484
when they play against it.

294
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:02,087
So, you know, again, we sort of,

295
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,289
we sober up after that initial launch,

296
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,531
and we get to this sort of new stable play rate,

297
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:07,612
which is really exciting,

298
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:09,173
because if you guys look where this line

299
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:11,976
sort of flattens out, it's so much higher than previously.

300
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:16,477
Akali has played multiple times more than where she was previously,

301
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:21,079
and that really hit our goals for the character. We thought this was a fantasy

302
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,679
that we had not delivered on as well,

303
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,801
and we wanted more players to engage with her and to engage with her more.

304
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:31,462
So this was looking like a success. And you know what? The success doesn't stop there.

305
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:37,180
What happens when a ninja joins a K-pop group?

306
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,562
Well, I'll tell you, we get a juicy spike of engagement

307
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,925
and a lot of players playing a K-pop ninja.

308
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,727
So what I was referencing there is, of course, KDA.

309
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:52,008
For those of you guys who are unfamiliar,

310
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:53,569
this Riot basically was like,

311
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,069
hey, let's make a K-pop group.

312
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:56,770
Yeah.

313
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:00,693
So we took four champions, we put them in a K-pop group,

314
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:03,315
we gave them new looks, new skins in our game,

315
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:06,917
and a lot of players who don't typically play at Kali

316
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:07,978
would go and flock to this,

317
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:10,139
because it was this really cool new visual look,

318
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,280
new identity for her,

319
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,062
and we saw a huge bump in her play rate at this time.

320
00:15:17,123 --> 00:15:21,606
But all good stories have to have sort of a downfall,

321
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:23,567
the downturn, so let's talk about that.

322
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,104
In this period after KDA, we suffer an era of pro-play dominance.

323
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:35,567
League of Legends is also played by professionals around the world, and two things happen.

324
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:41,191
One, she becomes very, very powerful in professional play, and is played all the time.

325
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:41,751
That's number one.

326
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:46,434
Number two, she becomes really frustrating for players in normal play.

327
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:50,797
So not only is she too powerful, but she's also extremely frustrating.

328
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:56,482
Here we see actually G2, it's a professional team in Europe.

329
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,305
This is Perkz, one of the pro players

330
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:00,606
who plays a lot of Akali.

331
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:03,949
If he's on your team, that's great.

332
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,812
If he's on the other team, that's really unfortunate

333
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,113
for you when he's playing that champion.

334
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:12,597
So we get to this dark time where we were constantly

335
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,920
trimming and nerfing power out of Akali.

336
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:18,718
and the only way we could actually get her out of pro play,

337
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:20,399
reduce some of that frustration,

338
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:23,281
was to hit her with substantial nerfs.

339
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,123
And nerfs are where we remove power

340
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:27,044
or remove mechanics from a champion.

341
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:31,127
Usually it doesn't hit play rate that hard,

342
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:35,090
but in this case, I mean, we obliterated Akali.

343
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,072
We just, we just, yeah, it was a massacre.

344
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:38,752
It was terrible.

345
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:41,347
We took so much power out of her.

346
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:42,887
It was very rough.

347
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:47,108
I think the best way to sort of show what it looked like

348
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:49,489
is with this classic scene from The Avengers.

349
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,290
Are you finally not getting banned?

350
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:52,610
Yes.

351
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,730
What did it cost?

352
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,570
Everything.

353
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,651
So Akali dips into this new low,

354
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:00,152
almost as low as her pre-update play rate

355
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:01,932
as a result of these hard nerfs.

356
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,165
Two patches later in patch 9.5, and the patch is our major update to the game, she gets

357
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:09,805
redemption.

358
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:14,511
We look at some ways of bringing power back into Akali and buffing her a little bit.

359
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:19,277
And so we are able to do that and players flock back

360
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,297
and start to come and play her a bit more.

361
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:22,698
And we're seeing her play rate rise.

362
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:25,318
And this is just as early as a few weeks ago, actually.

363
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,599
And here we see a League of Legends player now,

364
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,680
just a few days ago, playing some games on Akali.

365
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,121
Wait, that looks like my match history, actually.

366
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,482
And we're gonna ignore the game right there

367
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:39,082
where I went five, 13, and 12.

368
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:42,423
You know, everyone has bad days, et cetera.

369
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:47,408
But overall, this is our story of Akali.

370
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:48,770
This is her play rate journey.

371
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,192
So just using this sort of simple metric

372
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:52,954
and looking at one champion over time,

373
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:55,377
we can tell compelling stories about the players

374
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,698
who engaged with her over time,

375
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,101
the content that was released for her over this time.

376
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:02,605
It helps us to understand this character going forward.

377
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:03,105
We know.

378
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,888
where some of the best and worst states

379
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:06,869
of this characters are.

380
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:10,312
And so for champions where we know we want to retain

381
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:11,733
some of this play rate,

382
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:13,534
we can always look back at this data

383
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:14,855
to better understand that.

384
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:16,597
And we're not finished yet.

385
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,998
This isn't the end of the story.

386
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,520
You know, the Akali train will continue

387
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,901
and we'll keep tracking her

388
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:25,144
and all the other 140 some odd champions

389
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,185
over time with this.

390
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:30,348
But we don't just track engagement

391
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:31,709
with champions through play rate.

392
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,622
We have a really exciting piece of data

393
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:36,402
to share with you guys today.

394
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,844
This is our breadth versus depth framework.

395
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:42,946
And this is another way of looking at champion engagement.

396
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,008
And I want you guys to remember that Akali journey

397
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:48,549
because we're gonna come back to it framed in this new way.

398
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,191
And maybe we'll learn some more things from that.

399
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,691
So breadth versus depth.

400
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,173
Let's get into this and answer the question,

401
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:57,374
how does Jackson Pollock help us

402
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:59,615
understand champion engagement?

403
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,756
Now some of you guys are like, wait,

404
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,804
Who is Jackson Pollock?

405
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:09,068
So Jackson Pollock is an American painter and major figure in abstract expression movement.

406
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,830
I am not an art critic, thank you Wikipedia for that note.

407
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:18,436
He's widely recognized for his technique of pouring or splashing liquid paint onto his

408
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:19,156
canvases.

409
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:23,400
So now at this point you're like, okay, you told me who Jackson Pollock is.

410
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,403
Nathan, why are you talking about Jackson Pollock?

411
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:30,325
Let us look at this interesting Jackson Pollock piece.

412
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:32,907
Okay, it's a little bit more modern, all right,

413
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:35,728
a little bit brighter colors, you know,

414
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:37,449
some more jagged lines, but it's a nice,

415
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,970
it's a nice Pollock piece, right?

416
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,151
Wrong.

417
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:43,632
Incorrect, this is actually a David Novatti piece.

418
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:47,314
David Navati is not an artist.

419
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,595
He lacks the grimace.

420
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,436
He lacks that cigarette in his mouth.

421
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:53,798
But he does have a wonderful understanding of analytics

422
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:54,578
and a Nerf gun.

423
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:56,880
And that has allowed him to create

424
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,741
some really interesting data visualizations for us,

425
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,143
which this is actually our breadth versus depth

426
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:03,003
framework.

427
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:05,945
I just took out all the labels and the axes

428
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,445
and made it look like a painting.

429
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:12,548
So let's actually go through and understand what this graph is.

430
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,061
So graphing champion engagement, and to be clear,

431
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:18,363
you can actually graph a lot of things

432
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:20,605
of engagement with this method.

433
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:22,206
So let's go through it.

434
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,189
Breadth versus depth.

435
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:30,291
Breadth is simply how many players.

436
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:33,093
Could be a champion, could be selecting a weapon,

437
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,675
it could be selecting a squad mate or selecting a map.

438
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:38,978
On the x-axis, we're just looking at how many people

439
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:41,660
are selecting something, engaging with something.

440
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,123
On the Y-axis, we're looking at depth.

441
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:47,965
This is how much those players engage.

442
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,706
So after they've made that selection,

443
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,407
after they fall into the bucket,

444
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,728
the yes-no bucket of has selected or has not,

445
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:56,010
how often do they make that choice?

446
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,311
How deep do they go into that selection?

447
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:02,791
Finally, you might say, well, OK, if you have breadth

448
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:05,512
and you have depth on x and y-axis,

449
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:07,213
how did you get all of those lines?

450
00:21:07,574 --> 00:21:08,975
Well, let's use an example.

451
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,557
Say we had that champion Akali prior to her update,

452
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:14,838
and she's unpopular.

453
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:16,699
She's down here.

454
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,440
Not that many people play her.

455
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,661
They don't play her that much.

456
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:23,423
And then we update her, and she becomes a popular champion.

457
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,365
Well, we can track that movement.

458
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:30,266
we add a line in there, and over time with each of those updates we can see where the

459
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:32,627
champions' breadth and depth go over time.

460
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:40,209
So let's now explore those four quadrants, because I mentioned unpopular and popular.

461
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:43,990
Let's cover those two as well as niche and broad and what those mean to us.

462
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,202
So we're gonna be looking at four champions

463
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,623
that over the course of six patches

464
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:51,984
stay within those quadrants.

465
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:54,446
So again, you see those lines moving on those champions,

466
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:56,947
but they relatively stay in the same quadrant over time.

467
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:59,669
First one is an unpopular champion.

468
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:03,311
This is Karthus, and Karthus is like this undead lich.

469
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:04,652
He's a mage.

470
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,993
You know, one of his most powerful moments

471
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,294
is when he dies in game.

472
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:11,796
Not the most appealing fantasy,

473
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:14,037
so he kinda sits down there at unpopular.

474
00:22:14,907 --> 00:22:15,848
We also have Allawi.

475
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,089
Now, Allawi is this really cool character

476
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,510
who has pretty unique gameplay.

477
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,012
She summons these giant tentacles that smack opponents.

478
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:26,754
It's very unique gameplay, but not necessarily

479
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:29,995
the standard League of Legends experience for most people.

480
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:32,517
So she doesn't have that many people who play her,

481
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:34,978
but the people who do play her play her a lot.

482
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:36,078
She's a niche champion.

483
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:38,420
And we also have Annie.

484
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,604
And Annie is our bread and butter mage.

485
00:22:42,064 --> 00:22:44,027
This is the character where you're having a bad day

486
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:47,431
and you're like, I need something very simple to play

487
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:48,312
and just win the game.

488
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:49,734
You go and play Annie.

489
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:52,797
And that's why she's a very broad appeal champion.

490
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:54,660
A lot of players will go and play her,

491
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,703
but not a lot of them are going to go super deep

492
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,725
and play a bunch of her.

493
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:03,601
And then finally we have one of my favorite champions.

494
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,683
He's a hypebeast champion, as I call them,

495
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:08,966
or you can call them a popular champion, but Lee Sin.

496
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:10,767
And what I mean by hypebeast is that

497
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:13,569
this character's all about style and show.

498
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,191
This is a playmaker champion.

499
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:17,973
Very hard to execute some of these cool plays,

500
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:20,515
but when you do, it looks really cool.

501
00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:21,716
So a lot of players.

502
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,239
go and play Lee Sin.

503
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:25,062
And they get a taste for those big plays,

504
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:27,387
so they start to practice and play him more.

505
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:30,212
So he has high depth to make those big play happen.

506
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,601
I told you this wasn't just going to be about League of Legends.

507
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:43,884
So Blizzard devs, and Overwatch devs in particular, please forgive me if I butcher this, but I

508
00:23:43,904 --> 00:23:47,626
want to now take our breadth-first dev framework and let's try to apply it to some other games.

509
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:51,908
Let's predict where some characters would be in other games.

510
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:57,311
So this is my fake data, this does not actually exist, but we're going to try and plot where

511
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,511
the Overwatch characters are.

512
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,802
Now I briefly looked at third party sites

513
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,323
to get a general sense of where they are

514
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,304
and I used some intuition from League of Legends,

515
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:07,645
but let's see how well we do.

516
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:09,967
Blizzard devs, please correct me afterwards

517
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:12,008
along with the Nintendo legal team.

518
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:16,271
So Brigitte, I put down at unpopular.

519
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,253
I think she suffered a similar issue to Akali.

520
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:22,316
She was very big in professional play

521
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,517
and they had to nerf and take a lot of power out of her.

522
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:28,920
For niche characters, we have Symmetra and Tjorbjorn.

523
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,421
And these two characters, their gameplay revolves

524
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:32,782
around placing turrets.

525
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:36,265
I actually intuited that, hey, Illaoi is similar.

526
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:39,087
She places these tentacles that beat people up for her.

527
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:41,429
Similarly, Tjorbjorn, Symmetra.

528
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:44,692
they create these turrets that shoot people for them.

529
00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:48,495
A similar sort of idea for why they exist there.

530
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,838
For broad appeal characters I chose to, Soldier 76

531
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,741
very much is your bread and butter shooter

532
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,604
just like Annie is your bread and butter mage.

533
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:03,217
broadly appealing sort of character fantasies and very accessible and

534
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:04,317
approachable gameplay.

535
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:07,739
Meanwhile, Mercy I thought was probably even more broadly appealing.

536
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,901
That's the character where, you know, for those of you unfamiliar with

537
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,962
Overwatch, there's this problem where a lot of people tend to pick the

538
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:18,504
damaged characters. So you get into a game and it's like, well I'm Tracer,

539
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:21,446
well I'm also Tracer, and I'm Genji, and

540
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:23,246
someone on the team has to be like, hey...

541
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:26,438
It's cool, I'll play Mercy, I'll support,

542
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:27,538
I'll give us healing, right?

543
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:29,679
Mercy's that very accessible healing character.

544
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,320
And for popular, of course, it's gotta be Tracer.

545
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,460
Tracer must be up there, Blizzard, I know it.

546
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,001
I mean, she's the box character,

547
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,561
she's one of the most aspirational,

548
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,061
heroic characters in the game.

549
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:43,882
And on another end, there's also Genji,

550
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,743
and I think Genji represents that sort of

551
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:49,944
edgelord, hypebeast fantasy, I want to outplay everyone.

552
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:51,804
So I expect him to be very popular.

553
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:55,046
uh... apex legends

554
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:59,009
please respond as correct me if i get this wrong but we had we're gonna go

555
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:02,892
through a couple for uh... apex legends as well but a bit more of a new example

556
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:07,615
okay for unpopular i think it's caustic and the reason for this is i've looked

557
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:09,177
at some other league champions like

558
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:10,938
singed or uh...

559
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:14,070
or ergot, and I just think the fantasy of like,

560
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:17,552
I'm kinda like this old balding dude who like,

561
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:19,733
gases people, is not like,

562
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:21,935
and I don't think people like wake up like,

563
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,276
yeah, like that's me, that's my vision, right?

564
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:26,117
But hey, sorry caustic players,

565
00:26:26,157 --> 00:26:27,518
still cool if you do like him.

566
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:30,059
I also think his gameplay suffers from some issues as well.

567
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,780
On the other hand though, I think a really cool

568
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,342
character in terms of niche gameplay is,

569
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:40,586
is Bloodhound. Bloodhound has this cool thing where he goes and stalks people.

570
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:43,908
Very interesting gameplay. I think it's something that's really appealing to a

571
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:44,629
lot of people.

572
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,113
But those who do play it, they go really deep on it.

573
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:53,950
For broadly appealing, I mean of course it's got to be Bangalore.

574
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,693
Very similar to Soldier 76, right? Clearly aspirational theme,

575
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:02,636
very accessible gameplay, that standard shooter in the shooter game,

576
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:06,438
and Lifeline, again, very appealing

577
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,541
visuals, similar to Mercy, and has this accessible

578
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:11,342
healing kit in her game.

579
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:15,165
Go-to character for the people that want to be a healer.

580
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,183
You guys already know who's going to be popular for Apex Legends.

581
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:20,425
It's going to be Wraith.

582
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:23,908
Of course, the try-hards and the edge lords

583
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:26,611
who want to outplay their opponents are probably playing Wraith.

584
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:30,654
So I want to now come back to League of Legends

585
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:32,116
after having done this little example.

586
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:36,960
And let's try and understand some decisions that we can make

587
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,622
off of this breadth-versus-depth framework.

588
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:44,070
The first thing is looking at the popularity of marksmen and monsters.

589
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,331
And it's okay if you can't read the specific labels,

590
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:51,333
but that cluster over there in the broad section and the popular section

591
00:27:51,594 --> 00:27:53,014
are a lot of our marksmen champions.

592
00:27:53,234 --> 00:27:56,876
And in League of Legends, these champions all kind of play the same.

593
00:27:57,837 --> 00:28:00,118
Part of the issue with them is that when one is weak,

594
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:01,538
it typically falls out of favor.

595
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:04,400
When one is strong, players go and gravitate towards it a bit.

596
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,101
In fact, the only sort of niche characters are the ones on that far left.

597
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:14,503
Quinn and Kindred who aren't even typically played in the same position as other marksman champions.

598
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:18,624
So I would argue that, hey, maybe there's an opportunity for us.

599
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:24,725
I would talk to our designer back, what's it look like to create that traditional marksman in the bot lane fantasy

600
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:30,146
that has more niche appeal gameplay, that people, not all the marksman players are going to play,

601
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:32,767
but those who do play it will stick with it.

602
00:28:34,154 --> 00:28:38,335
Interestingly enough, I think one of the goals of that was, or one of the goals for Jin was

603
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:39,436
to be that kind of character.

604
00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:43,797
It ended up he just was really popular and everyone played him, but still, I think this

605
00:28:43,837 --> 00:28:45,878
could be a cool opportunity for us.

606
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:49,980
On the other hand, our monsters are not very popular.

607
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:54,380
Part of this could be something that other games

608
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,701
would struggle with as well,

609
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,784
in terms of how you view the characters in the game.

610
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,466
You know, League of Legends is this isometric view,

611
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:03,546
you're looking at the characters,

612
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:05,108
all the models, character models,

613
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:06,789
have to be relatively the same size.

614
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:10,511
So imagine you have this monster-esque character,

615
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:11,692
Aurelion Sol.

616
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:14,134
This is a cosmic space dragon.

617
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:15,915
He creates galaxies.

618
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,397
He's this incredibly impressive figure.

619
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,758
And then you see him in game,

620
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,702
and he's like, you know, maybe only like a little bit bigger than Annie,

621
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:26,084
the little fire mage girl, right?

622
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:30,168
It's this thing where it's like, okay, we've promised you this larger-than-life fantasy,

623
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:31,789
but it's harder to deliver it in the game.

624
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,692
And that, I think, has caused some issues for monsters,

625
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,154
but I also think it highlights an opportunity.

626
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:39,716
For unpopularity of monsters, I think the opportunity is,

627
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,899
hey, what's a really broadly appealing monster look like in League of Legends?

628
00:29:42,939 --> 00:29:44,240
We haven't quite hit that yet.

629
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:45,281
And I don't think...

630
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:49,643
we have to necessarily be concerned or constrained

631
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,763
with character models to hit at.

632
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:53,183
We can look at other games and see extremely

633
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:54,704
broadly appealing monsters.

634
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:58,104
I don't know, Pikachu is a great example of this actually.

635
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:03,806
So I think both of these, a more niche appeal marksman

636
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:06,326
and a more broadly appealing monster

637
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:09,227
are opportunities that we can identify using this data.

638
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:12,628
And I wanna come back now to this Jackson Pollock

639
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:15,348
and let's finish the story about Akali.

640
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,652
So, let's add in some labels, let's kind of clear away

641
00:30:20,712 --> 00:30:23,715
all the clutter in there, let's not have all of the

642
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,776
champions highlighted, and let's look at a more

643
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:26,917
reasonable time frame.

644
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:30,460
Okay, this is a little bit easier on the eyes,

645
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,543
but let's apply that Akali play rate story to this

646
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,945
so we can better understand where she sits today.

647
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:40,508
So right here was that last hurrah.

648
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:42,930
This is right where she was before we updated her.

649
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:49,362
And then you see this giant spike up, up and to the right.

650
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:52,946
This is more players playing her and those playing her are playing her even more.

651
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:56,910
And that's where her update drops, okay?

652
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,354
Again, we, we ask the question, what happens when a ninja joins a K-pop group?

653
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:05,899
We can see another sort of spike to the right that occurs here after she settles down.

654
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,741
And this is when KDA comes out.

655
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:13,431
uh... i have uh... with thanos represented that really dark time when

656
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:14,652
she was extremely weak

657
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:15,513
uh...

658
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,517
very sad time you know cost us everything

659
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:21,461
but now let's go to where she is today

660
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:26,487
and right there looks actually a lot healthier

661
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:29,129
than the play rate graph that I showed you previously.

662
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,491
She doesn't have nearly as much breadth.

663
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:33,752
She doesn't have tons of players playing her,

664
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:35,273
but those that are playing her

665
00:31:35,313 --> 00:31:37,175
are actually playing her quite a lot.

666
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:40,157
And this is looking like a good state for Akali.

667
00:31:40,177 --> 00:31:41,018
Now, are we done with her?

668
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:41,838
Is our work finished?

669
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:42,118
No.

670
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:45,481
There's still much more that we can do for this champion

671
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:46,502
and for all of our champions,

672
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,523
but this is how we use some of that data

673
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,424
to track where these champions were

674
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,545
and where they're headed.

675
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:58,469
All right, let's shift now away from play rate

676
00:31:58,629 --> 00:31:59,689
and champion engagement,

677
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:01,770
and let's talk about player sentiment.

678
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,931
We're now going to present some data

679
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:06,032
from our mass champion survey.

680
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:09,053
And the two questions I want us to answer,

681
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:09,874
we have two this time,

682
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:12,755
is why do assassins hate diving suits,

683
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:15,796
and why is Happy Win Man on the other team?

684
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:17,237
Let's answer those.

685
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:21,312
First of all, I want to give everyone an overview

686
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:22,753
of the Mass Champion Survey.

687
00:32:22,993 --> 00:32:25,095
There's two quick slides just to get everyone

688
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:26,756
on the same page of what we mean

689
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:28,438
by this Mass Champion Survey.

690
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:31,360
So this survey goes out to hundreds of thousands

691
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,843
of our players where they answer questions

692
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:35,004
about champions in our games

693
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:36,385
so that we can get an understanding

694
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:39,688
of where those champions rank on certain attributes.

695
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:43,158
We also collect a lot of demographic info.

696
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:47,359
We collect demographic info relevant to us in the game.

697
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,100
Stuff like, what are the classes that these players

698
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,580
like the most?

699
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,121
By classes, I mean things like, do they like tanks?

700
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,821
Do they like assassins?

701
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:56,102
Do they like mages?

702
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,222
We also ask about their position,

703
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,723
their preferred place to play in League of Legends.

704
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:02,603
Do they like to play in the mid lane?

705
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:04,404
Do they like to play in the jungle?

706
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:05,324
Et cetera.

707
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,381
In this version of the Mass Champions Survey,

708
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:12,001
we only collect data from four of our major regions.

709
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:18,563
Those four are North America, Brazil, Korea, and China.

710
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:19,923
I am sorry, Canada.

711
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,424
I swear I put in the flag

712
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:24,904
that had the Canadian split in there.

713
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:27,304
I really apologize to all the Canadians in the audience.

714
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:29,465
I messed that up.

715
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:31,545
North America also includes Canada.

716
00:33:32,586 --> 00:33:33,746
And we also ask things about,

717
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,861
you know, other demographic info such as gender,

718
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:41,942
splits for male, female, non-binary, et cetera.

719
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:47,964
And another note is that this is our 2018 data.

720
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:49,564
2019 data is coming soon,

721
00:33:49,924 --> 00:33:51,905
and we're actually going to update some more stuff

722
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:55,025
and include more demographic splits in our future data,

723
00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:57,686
including we'll be expanding our regions

724
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,507
to Europe and Vietnam.

725
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,981
Now there's sort of two ways that we can ask questions,

726
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:05,702
or have historically asked questions

727
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:06,964
with our mass champion surveys.

728
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:09,406
One of them is very standard in surveys,

729
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,887
it's just Likert questions.

730
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:12,648
So it's rate your agreement.

731
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,411
Something like Echo is one of my favorite champions.

732
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:18,714
And you'll get a list of options,

733
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:20,655
strongly disagree to strongly agree.

734
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:22,857
Echo happens to be one of my favorites.

735
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,179
So I'd say yeah, okay, strongly agree.

736
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,862
Another survey that we do run that unfortunately we will not have time to cover today,

737
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:39,025
but potentially at another talk, is one that involves max diff, also known as best-worst scaling.

738
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:45,091
And the way this works is it actually gives you more granular understanding of the rankings

739
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:48,152
of the various characters you're looking at.

740
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:52,114
So it asks something like, which of these champions is your most and least favorite?

741
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:54,436
Okay, so something interesting occurs here.

742
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:59,938
If you ask me to rate my agreement, Ekko is one of my favorite champions, I'd say strongly

743
00:34:59,979 --> 00:35:00,219
agree.

744
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:02,720
And I'd also say the same thing for Akali.

745
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,221
But if you place this in front of me, what do I put?

746
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:09,705
I can't strongly agree for both Echo and Akali, so I have to make a choice.

747
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:11,686
And I choose that Akali is actually my favorite.

748
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:15,769
And I also write which is my least favorite, which is Shaco of these four.

749
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:19,552
And that tells us a lot more information than simply Likert stuff.

750
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:23,515
For the sake of this presentation, we're going to cover the Likert data.

751
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:27,918
One of the benefits, though, of doing the Likert survey is that we get to ask a lot

752
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:29,179
of questions.

753
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:36,275
Almost 30 questions, I believe, are asked in this survey about everything regarding

754
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:36,915
the champions.

755
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:39,218
Don't necessarily try to read all this.

756
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:43,784
We're only going to be focusing on two today, but it's everything from VO, personality,

757
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,307
visuals, thematic cohesiveness.

758
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:51,047
interest in purchasing physical merchandise for the champions,

759
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:52,588
we look at all number of things.

760
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,370
But we're only going to focus on two of those questions today.

761
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:59,713
One is for players to rate if the champion is

762
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:01,994
one of their favorites, and if the champion

763
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,135
is fair to play against.

764
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:10,179
Now, that might seem simple, but thanks to our good friend

765
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:12,021
David Navati, we have clever ways

766
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:13,962
of making complicated graphs about this.

767
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:15,803
So let's go and look at one of those again.

768
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:20,744
And what we're going to try and understand is the perfect assassin.

769
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:23,571
So, the graph I'm going to show...

770
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:29,392
We're going to be looking at rating of champions mapped on the x-axis

771
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:34,414
and the delta from the average of all players on the y-axis.

772
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:37,755
Give me some time, we'll walk through it all together.

773
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:42,056
So first of all, we are only highlighting assassin players.

774
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:46,137
All those blue dots, if you remember from that demographic information,

775
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,698
all those blue dots are players who self-select into saying, yeah.

776
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,219
I'm an assassin player.

777
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:52,640
That's my favorite class.

778
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,261
We've only highlighted those blue players,

779
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:57,902
those blue assassin players.

780
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,145
So what we're looking at then is the rating.

781
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,706
A higher rating, more to the right,

782
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:07,287
means that players like that champion more.

783
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:09,708
For the delta from the average,

784
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:11,829
if it's higher up on the x-axis,

785
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,571
that means they like it more relative to the average player,

786
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:17,352
the average of all of the classes.

787
00:37:18,543 --> 00:37:23,265
So what we find with this data is a champion like Zed,

788
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,626
who is this shadow ninja, this shadow assassin,

789
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:29,707
is all the way to the top right.

790
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:31,707
And this actually tells us a couple things.

791
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:34,588
So not even just looking at assassin players,

792
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,629
but looking at all of the classes of players broken out.

793
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:41,432
Zed is actually the character, or Zed for assassins,

794
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:43,614
is the character furthest to the right.

795
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:46,177
What that means is that Zed players,

796
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,379
or sorry, assassin players like Zed

797
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,942
more than any other sort of class mains

798
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,664
like champions in their class.

799
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:58,031
The other thing it tells us is that it might be the case

800
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,593
that not that many people like Zed,

801
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:01,995
except for assassin players,

802
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:03,856
because he's so far up on the graph.

803
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:07,340
He's so much more liked relative to the average of players.

804
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,162
And indeed, when we look for the other Zed dots

805
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:12,504
on the graph, when we look at support players

806
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,907
or tank players, we find they don't like Zed

807
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:16,668
nearly as much as the assassin players.

808
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:19,391
That makes sense, though, considering he's an assassin.

809
00:38:20,978 --> 00:38:27,309
We also see that the character that Assassin players like the least is Mordekaiser, because

810
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:28,812
he's the furthest to the left.

811
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:31,497
He's the lowest on the X-axis on rating.

812
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:32,458
However...

813
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:36,776
While he might be the just overall least liked by assassins,

814
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:40,357
Nautilus is actually the character that is liked

815
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:43,259
the least relative to all the other characters.

816
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,460
And Nautilus makes a lot of sense.

817
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,181
He's this big hulking dude in a scuba suit,

818
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:51,003
answering our question back there.

819
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:55,085
And all of his abilities say, hey, sit down.

820
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:58,103
And assassin players don't like to sit down.

821
00:38:58,143 --> 00:39:01,684
They want to move about and do their Naruto runs

822
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:04,465
and do all their fancy combos and stuff.

823
00:39:04,746 --> 00:39:06,826
But Nautilus is a champion in our game that says,

824
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,567
hey, you don't get to do that.

825
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:10,668
He has all of these abilities in gameplay

826
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:12,189
that prevent people from doing that.

827
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:16,611
So, Zed makes assassin players very happy

828
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,892
and Nautilus makes them very upset.

829
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:22,473
I'm sorry for putting that image on there.

830
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:24,454
It is definitely my favorite one in this talk though.

831
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,886
So you might say, okay, Nathan, that's pretty simple.

832
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:30,928
I understand that the graph was complicated,

833
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,950
but you didn't need that complicated graph to tell me that,

834
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,092
okay, assassin players like Zed,

835
00:39:35,152 --> 00:39:37,714
and they don't like a big tanky dude like Nautilus.

836
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:40,517
Well, the reason why I want to emphasize this

837
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:43,139
is because of how much player preferences

838
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:46,082
differ by something like class.

839
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:51,315
And what if I told you guys that sometimes those differences are even more exaggerated,

840
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:57,038
not by your gameplay preferences, whether you are someone who likes to be a team shot

841
00:39:57,098 --> 00:40:02,480
caller or leader, or you like to play damage, or you like to play as a healer, but sometimes

842
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,142
it actually comes down to just where you're playing, what country you're in.

843
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,416
So let's talk about finally getting to him,

844
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,897
our good friend Yasuo.

845
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:14,619
And let's talk about Yasuo around the world.

846
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,082
We're gonna be looking at mass champion data for Yasuo.

847
00:40:18,102 --> 00:40:20,824
And just as we explained some of those differences

848
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:22,765
of assassin players and what they like,

849
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,467
we're going to look at how players view Yasuo,

850
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:28,169
not based on if they're an assassin player

851
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:29,890
or a marksman player,

852
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,092
but actually just based on what country they're from.

853
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:35,656
So, let's start with some memes.

854
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:39,439
Our first meme is a classic one from North America,

855
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:42,442
and it's their Yasuo versus our Yasuo.

856
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:45,905
And the idea here is that their Yasuo is like,

857
00:40:46,165 --> 00:40:49,168
and this guy has put in thousands of hours on Yasuo,

858
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:52,051
and he's, you know, they're a Yasuo savant.

859
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:53,932
They're just gonna completely dominate your team,

860
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:57,876
and your team's Yasuo is playing the flute with their nose.

861
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:03,267
uh... that's the idea is basically the yasuo is going to just ruin the game for

862
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:03,990
you no matter what

863
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,494
Here's another interesting meme that we found.

864
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:11,675
This is a word cloud of Yasuo from multiple regions

865
00:41:11,715 --> 00:41:12,715
that was translated.

866
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:15,356
And there's one big word that kind of jumps out

867
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,116
right in the middle that says science.

868
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,737
And I was very confused by this at first.

869
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:24,738
And I talked to members of our Riot Korea office.

870
00:41:24,778 --> 00:41:26,898
I was like, hey, this was mistranslated.

871
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:30,399
I noticed that science, all of the markings for science

872
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:31,860
in this word cloud came from Korea.

873
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,680
Why is that?

874
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,860
That must be mistranslated.

875
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,420
I'm like, oh, no.

876
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,122
Yasuo is science.

877
00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:39,167
I said, well, please explain Yasuo is science.

878
00:41:39,187 --> 00:41:41,070
Like, yeah, it's a scientific fact.

879
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,333
When Yasuo is in the game, you will lose.

880
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:48,665
It is their version, I think a more colorful version

881
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:50,886
of their Yasuo versus our Yasuo.

882
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:51,587
It's just science.

883
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,087
When he's on the other team, you're gonna lose.

884
00:41:53,327 --> 00:41:55,168
When he's on your team, you're going to lose.

885
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:59,150
But my favorite meme of them all comes from China.

886
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,730
And it's this.

887
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:03,532
It is, and I really hope Google Translate

888
00:42:03,572 --> 00:42:04,792
did not mess this up, but it is,

889
00:42:05,452 --> 00:42:07,673
and I hope I also don't butcher as I say it,

890
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,474
it's Kuai Le Feng Nan.

891
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:13,716
And what this roughly translates to is happy wind man.

892
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:18,437
In China, their nickname for Yasuo is Happy Windman,

893
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:20,858
because when you play Yasuo, you're happy.

894
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,921
And that makes me happy.

895
00:42:26,702 --> 00:42:27,602
But that's interesting.

896
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:29,543
We have these different memes coming up

897
00:42:29,723 --> 00:42:31,845
in different regions for this champion.

898
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,145
What does the data say?

899
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:36,107
What's our mass champion survey say about Yasuo?

900
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:39,785
Well, let's look at those two questions I highlighted.

901
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:42,846
Let's see what they think about Yasuo as a favorite champion

902
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:45,367
and whether or not he's fair to play against.

903
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:49,468
So remember, these rankings are out of about 140 champions.

904
00:42:49,508 --> 00:42:50,428
Let's see where he ranks.

905
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:53,749
OK, North America, he's 70, he's in the middle.

906
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:56,169
OK, that's pretty serviceable.

907
00:42:56,729 --> 00:42:57,589
Not too concerned.

908
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,150
Brazil, pretty similar to North America.

909
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:00,710
He ranks at 66.

910
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:04,795
And Korea, OK, much better.

911
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:05,996
Korea is definitely like, hey, he's

912
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:07,577
in our top quartile of champions.

913
00:43:07,597 --> 00:43:08,237
We're going to put him at 34.

914
00:43:09,357 --> 00:43:11,998
We get to China, and he's number two.

915
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,540
So I looked at this, and this was pretty crazy.

916
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,380
But I was like, OK, I can understand this.

917
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,062
Because Yasuo is actually still played a lot in North America

918
00:43:21,102 --> 00:43:21,942
and Brazil and Korea.

919
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:26,384
They might just be a little salty about their team's Yasuo.

920
00:43:26,424 --> 00:43:27,604
OK, I understand that.

921
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:30,245
Let's look at what people think about him

922
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:31,606
being fair to play against.

923
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,661
So in North America, Brazil, and Korea,

924
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:39,382
he ranks very, very low in fair to play against.

925
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:43,363
In North America and Brazil, there's only a few champions,

926
00:43:43,403 --> 00:43:48,104
a couple who are less fair in their minds than Yasuo.

927
00:43:49,124 --> 00:43:54,405
And I was like, I expect China won't be as bad as these.

928
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:56,326
But I'm a Yasuo player.

929
00:43:56,346 --> 00:43:57,006
I love playing him.

930
00:43:57,046 --> 00:43:59,026
And I recognize that he is very frustrating.

931
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:02,467
So I'm like, OK, China, you can't surprise me here.

932
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:03,882
And yet they did. 24.

933
00:44:03,922 --> 00:44:09,664
So like the difference between these are incredible.

934
00:44:09,724 --> 00:44:11,705
So we're looking at this Mass Champion Day

935
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:14,045
and we're seeing these giant regional differences

936
00:44:14,105 --> 00:44:15,526
in how people play with the champions.

937
00:44:15,546 --> 00:44:16,726
So let's try and investigate.

938
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:18,827
Let's go through an exercise and see if we can look

939
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:20,548
into why that might be the case.

940
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,085
So let's look actually now just at these two regions,

941
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,266
just at North America,

942
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:28,830
hey I included Canada in there by the way,

943
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:31,213
and let's look at China.

944
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:34,077
And let's see what are some of the favorite champions

945
00:44:34,117 --> 00:44:36,780
of these regions and see if we can tease out a story here.

946
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,852
So we'll notice that there's four marksmen in the top for each region.

947
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:47,555
So in North America we have Jin, Lushin, Jinx, and Xia.

948
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:51,858
And in China we have Kaisa, Vayne, Ezreal, and Jinx.

949
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:54,399
Jinx being the only one that's the top in both.

950
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,181
Good job to August Browning, the designer on Jinx.

951
00:44:59,062 --> 00:44:59,722
Well designed.

952
00:45:00,462 --> 00:45:05,445
Anyways, we do notice though that there's a little bit more of like the hypebeast style

953
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:11,808
ultra carry champions in China already with Vayne and Kai'Sa, but nothing too crazy.

954
00:45:12,731 --> 00:45:14,392
This is where things start to get interesting.

955
00:45:15,093 --> 00:45:17,955
These three champions, Rakan, Thresh, and Braum,

956
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:19,436
are all support champions.

957
00:45:20,436 --> 00:45:22,858
They're some of the top champions in North America.

958
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:27,181
The only support to show up in this top nine,

959
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:28,922
by the way, it's top nine.

960
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:32,124
because top 10 doesn't make it look as pretty.

961
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:32,904
You'll see later.

962
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:34,425
Biggest reason why.

963
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,526
The only character that shows up is Thresh,

964
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:40,527
and Thresh is that ultimate playmaker support in our game.

965
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:43,929
Again, he's the, you can consider him

966
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:45,850
the Yasuo or Lee Sin of support.

967
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:52,766
We see a smattering of assassins show up. We have Cain and Echo in North America.

968
00:45:52,827 --> 00:45:55,892
We have Zed showing up in China.

969
00:45:56,252 --> 00:46:00,739
And then lastly, our final three in China are Li Xin, Yasuo, and Jarvan.

970
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:05,001
Now, for me, I tried to explore a couple ideas right here.

971
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:06,842
OK, maybe there's a thematic component.

972
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:08,563
In North America, we see actually two

973
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:11,605
of the most liked champions are black, Lucian and Ekko.

974
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:15,348
And in China, two of the most liked characters

975
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:17,849
are more Eastern, are more Asian.

976
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:19,430
We have Yasuo and Lee Sin.

977
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,111
So maybe it's a thematic thing.

978
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,813
But that didn't quite fully jive up.

979
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:26,315
I think North America tends to lean more

980
00:46:26,355 --> 00:46:29,056
on thematics for what they like and rate

981
00:46:29,096 --> 00:46:30,117
as a popular champion.

982
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:35,670
China is looking more at sort of the game play, looking for that carry potential,

983
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,551
that ultimate fantasy in League of Legends.

984
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:39,814
So I actually turn to another question.

985
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:43,037
What are the least fair champions in each region?

986
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:45,339
And this is where things really blew up for me.

987
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,623
And this is where I was like, ah, North America, I see, I see what you're doing.

988
00:46:50,204 --> 00:46:51,865
So first of all, in North America.

989
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,131
Assassins are not liked.

990
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,673
We have, for the least fair champions in North America,

991
00:46:59,013 --> 00:47:02,335
we have LeBlanc, Akali, Rengar, and Fizz.

992
00:47:03,836 --> 00:47:05,316
For many people who play League of Legends,

993
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,538
just hearing those names is gonna get them upset.

994
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,859
In China, the only assassin champion

995
00:47:10,879 --> 00:47:12,480
that shows up is Shaco.

996
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,781
And I want you guys to hold on to this point.

997
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:17,883
Shaco, of all of these, is the least played.

998
00:47:18,763 --> 00:47:20,484
Fizz, LeBlanc, Akali, and Rengar

999
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:22,085
are much more played than Shaco.

1000
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:27,801
We then go into this other group of champions that show up way more in North America again.

1001
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:33,425
Some of these ultra hyper carry champions like Yasuo, Tryndamere, and Master Yi.

1002
00:47:34,525 --> 00:47:40,069
And the only kind of similar character that shows up to those in China is Udyr.

1003
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,250
And again...

1004
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:50,163
that pattern holds. Of those four champions, Yasuo, Tryndamere, and Master Yi are some of the most played champions in our game.

1005
00:47:50,564 --> 00:47:54,888
Udyr is a very, very niche-picked champion, not played that much.

1006
00:47:56,182 --> 00:47:59,383
Finally, we round out the story with North America with two characters.

1007
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:02,685
And these don't quite fit the story as well, but it's Mundo and Zoe.

1008
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:05,166
Now, Mundo is a less popular champion.

1009
00:48:05,506 --> 00:48:07,907
Zoe is a more sort of niche pick champion.

1010
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:13,349
But yeah, also North America just really hates Zoe.

1011
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:15,429
She's actually the number one most disliked.

1012
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:21,052
They really have a lot of ire for that champion, which is sad. She's so cute and charming

1013
00:48:21,952 --> 00:48:29,196
We then look at China again though and immediately we see this trend continue of this low popularity and high

1014
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:36,079
Dislike when we look at champions like Ivern Heimerdinger Mordekaiser old Nunu not the new Nunu

1015
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:38,880
and Singed and

1016
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,623
We round it out with two champions that aren't unpopular, but aren't really that popular

1017
00:48:44,263 --> 00:48:45,143
Urgot and Draven

1018
00:48:45,899 --> 00:48:52,604
So what I've sort of understood here is coupling the sentiment data from mass champion and

1019
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:56,667
also looking at some of our engagement data like play rate and breadth versus depth, we

1020
00:48:56,707 --> 00:49:01,891
can start to paint a picture about maybe what North American players find frustrating and

1021
00:49:01,911 --> 00:49:03,412
Chinese players find frustrating.

1022
00:49:03,472 --> 00:49:07,695
It looks like in China the champions that are very infrequently played when they come

1023
00:49:07,795 --> 00:49:10,577
up are extremely frustrating, maybe because they don't see them that much.

1024
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:14,860
Whereas in North America it's some of these more high play rate, high damage.

1025
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,141
high agency champions that cause frustration.

1026
00:49:19,201 --> 00:49:20,361
More on this talk later.

1027
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:22,582
I'm actually going to be doing a much deeper dive

1028
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:25,122
into the regional differences and gameplay preferences

1029
00:49:25,322 --> 00:49:28,183
of League of Legends, but this is even corroborated

1030
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,103
by some data outside of this talk

1031
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:31,583
that shows that North American players

1032
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,584
are actually much more sensitive to damage

1033
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:36,504
in the game than China.

1034
00:49:36,764 --> 00:49:39,945
North America players think that there's too much damage,

1035
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:43,345
just people dying too fast in League of Legends

1036
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:44,445
relative to China.

1037
00:49:46,252 --> 00:49:48,654
But lastly, I want to go through an example,

1038
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,517
as we wrap up here today, of how we can use this stuff

1039
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:53,278
to make a decision.

1040
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,421
How can we take this data and make an informed decision?

1041
00:49:56,802 --> 00:49:59,224
And I also want to emphasize what it means

1042
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:01,686
to be data informed versus data driven.

1043
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:01,746
So.

1044
00:50:04,355 --> 00:50:07,658
Let's ask the question, who are the Avengers of League of Legends?

1045
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:12,342
And no, this is not a spoiler that in Endgame, you know, we've partnered with Marvel and

1046
00:50:12,362 --> 00:50:17,827
that Yasuo and Jinx are going to show up in the Endgame movie, but let's try and imagine

1047
00:50:17,867 --> 00:50:18,568
the League of Avengers.

1048
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,670
So I could take...

1049
00:50:21,872 --> 00:50:25,373
that play rate or champion engagement data or even mass champion data and look at the

1050
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:29,856
most popular champions, the ones who everyone gravitates towards. And I might get something

1051
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:36,099
like this. I might get those edgelords, right? I might get Yasuo and Lee Sin and Zed. And

1052
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:40,821
I would also probably get some of the more conventionally attractive female characters,

1053
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:46,364
especially the marksman females who are extremely popular, like Miss Fortune and Caitlyn and

1054
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:46,884
Kai'Sa.

1055
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:52,228
And then I could round this out with the sort of aspirational heroes of our game.

1056
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,410
You're Garen, you're Ezreal, and you're Lucian.

1057
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,311
But there's a problem with this.

1058
00:50:59,032 --> 00:51:02,634
We have a lot of overlap in the appeal of these characters.

1059
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:07,817
And so even though we're using one lens of data, we're asking, hey, what are the most

1060
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:08,777
popular champions?

1061
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:09,818
Let's put them in the Avengers.

1062
00:51:10,078 --> 00:51:10,678
What if we asked...

1063
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:15,573
what is the roster that's most appealing to the most number of players?

1064
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:20,156
Well, with that question, it actually changes how we could think about our Avengers.

1065
00:51:20,216 --> 00:51:21,256
So let's do this again.

1066
00:51:21,697 --> 00:51:26,299
Let's only take one champion from those three broadly appealing categories.

1067
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:32,203
Let's just take Yasuo from our edgelords, and Miss Fortune from our conventionally attractive

1068
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:36,365
females, and Lucian from our sort of heroic, aspirational champions.

1069
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:43,871
And then instead of Garen, this sort of big juggernaut knight guy who's, you know,

1070
00:51:44,011 --> 00:51:47,333
it's a trope that's done over in games. Let's put someone new in there. Let's put a Laui in there.

1071
00:51:47,673 --> 00:51:53,397
She's this strong juggernaut female. Let's put her in. And let's tie in something to

1072
00:51:53,537 --> 00:51:57,240
some of the interesting lore in our game. The desert region of Shurima.

1073
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,522
has not been flushed out in our game.

1074
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:02,024
Let's consider putting in Xareth and Taliyah

1075
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:03,385
to better understand that.

1076
00:52:03,665 --> 00:52:06,907
And let's not just do all of these humans.

1077
00:52:06,968 --> 00:52:11,271
Let's get a little bit of our different sort of looking characters in there.

1078
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:13,653
Let's put in Thresh and Blitzcrank.

1079
00:52:14,553 --> 00:52:15,294
And finally...

1080
00:52:16,694 --> 00:52:19,419
uh... as much as i love as real because i too

1081
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,402
have blonde anime hair

1082
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:22,163
uh...

1083
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:26,410
i mean also the uh... i'd just like echo more i think he's a cooler champions let's

1084
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,091
put echo in

1085
00:52:27,692 --> 00:52:28,573
and all the sun

1086
00:52:29,094 --> 00:52:29,695
i think this

1087
00:52:30,644 --> 00:52:33,905
League of Legends Avengers roster is looking a lot better.

1088
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:36,527
And I think it's more appealing to more players.

1089
00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:39,869
It might not be the most popular champions straight up,

1090
00:52:40,149 --> 00:52:42,650
but it is more appealing at a global level.

1091
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,712
And indeed, that was the decision that we went with

1092
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:47,373
when Mass Champion informed.

1093
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:53,015
some of our character choices for our 2018 season start

1094
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:54,555
trailer, The Climb.

1095
00:52:54,775 --> 00:52:57,736
And you can see the visual explorations

1096
00:52:57,776 --> 00:53:00,997
we did for champions like Lucian, Miss Fortune, Blitzcrank,

1097
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:04,458
Taliyah, Yasuo, and Ekko for this.

1098
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:11,060
So to wrap everything up, there's

1099
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,961
always opportunities for you guys to be using

1100
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:14,601
your data for new characters.

1101
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:18,463
new characters, updated characters in your game.

1102
00:53:18,703 --> 00:53:21,245
If you take your roster, your current existing roster,

1103
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:22,546
you can make new games with them.

1104
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:26,350
This is Dream Draven, a Draven simulator game,

1105
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,211
or Draven dating simulator game

1106
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:32,535
that some of our designers made during our hackathon.

1107
00:53:33,555 --> 00:53:36,618
We have things like comics, merchandise,

1108
00:53:37,138 --> 00:53:38,740
publishing that we can inform with this.

1109
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,262
Things like Ash, War Mother,

1110
00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:43,924
which is the comic that we've partnered with Marvel with.

1111
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:47,884
And then it also helps us understand

1112
00:53:48,385 --> 00:53:50,265
how our players engage with these characters,

1113
00:53:50,345 --> 00:53:52,226
players who are cosplaying these characters,

1114
00:53:52,246 --> 00:53:55,007
who are putting so much time into learning them

1115
00:53:55,047 --> 00:53:56,748
and to understand the art behind them.

1116
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:01,150
And lastly, I wanna come back to one other thing.

1117
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,111
I said I was a Yasuo main,

1118
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:06,832
and I think a lot of this talk people have thought,

1119
00:54:07,032 --> 00:54:09,573
oh, so it's League of Legends, it's Riot Games,

1120
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:10,354
they're talking about Yasuo.

1121
00:54:10,434 --> 00:54:13,155
I wanna emphasize that we can understand characters

1122
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:14,015
in any game.

1123
00:54:14,904 --> 00:54:16,164
and in any genre.

1124
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:18,526
I am not just a Yasuo main,

1125
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:20,227
I know that that might surprise people,

1126
00:54:20,267 --> 00:54:22,848
but I'm also a Tracer main in Overwatch.

1127
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:25,710
And I know, I'm gonna get to Apex Legends,

1128
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,011
and again, I think people,

1129
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:29,252
they think it's gonna be Wraith, but you're wrong.

1130
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,113
It's actually Mirage.

1131
00:54:31,374 --> 00:54:33,595
It's my favorite character in Apex Legends.

1132
00:54:33,615 --> 00:54:36,557
Probably has something to do with orange jumpsuits

1133
00:54:36,597 --> 00:54:38,078
and orange goggles, I don't know.

1134
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:38,958
But.

1135
00:54:40,399 --> 00:54:42,420
On that note, I want to say this.

1136
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,202
To the designers in the audience,

1137
00:54:44,722 --> 00:54:47,304
think about the ways you could use data

1138
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:51,327
to better make decisions about characters you're designing,

1139
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:52,568
characters you're updating,

1140
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:56,171
how to make new games with a roster of characters

1141
00:54:56,231 --> 00:54:59,374
to make sure that they're broadly appealing,

1142
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:00,915
that there's also niche characters,

1143
00:55:01,636 --> 00:55:03,717
and that they're globally resonant.

1144
00:55:04,018 --> 00:55:05,639
And for my insights people,

1145
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:08,520
my data scientists, my researchers, my analysts,

1146
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,362
work with your designers, with your producers,

1147
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:12,322
with your artists.

1148
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:14,703
Don't just give them the data and say,

1149
00:55:14,783 --> 00:55:16,384
here's what you should do.

1150
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:18,725
Work with them, help them to be data informed.

1151
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:20,706
Think more about the questions that you're trying

1152
00:55:20,746 --> 00:55:22,207
to answer with this data.

1153
00:55:23,307 --> 00:55:26,148
And at the end of the day, make it about the players.

1154
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:28,309
Deliver the best experiences to them

1155
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:29,650
when you're data informed.

1156
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:31,351
Thank you guys so much.

1157
00:55:41,452 --> 00:55:46,936
And real quick before Q&A, special thanks to the Gameplay Insights squad, David Navati,

1158
00:55:47,236 --> 00:55:49,477
Ben Steffler, and Coleman Palm.

1159
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:56,441
And also special thanks to Insights leadership, Jason Moore, the brainchild of, or sorry,

1160
00:55:56,521 --> 00:56:01,144
the originator of the Mass Champions Survey, Betsy Anderson, and Davin Pavlis.

1161
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:09,241
Q&A time. So we only have a few minutes for questions, but I will be going outside to

1162
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:12,944
the lounge just out this way for questions afterwards. So go ahead.

1163
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:20,289
Oh, I guess it's just me. Hello there. Great talk. I want to ask about the slide where

1164
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:23,612
you talked about monster popularity and you were talking about how it seems like monsters

1165
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:24,813
aren't actually that popular.

1166
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:31,449
Would there be any caveat to how these characters are currently viewed in the balance of the game?

1167
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:37,874
Because when around that time, 7.6 or 7.16, a lot of those characters weren't really that strong.

1168
00:56:38,254 --> 00:56:44,858
And I would like, you know, what would that be compared to a patch like the Stoneplate patch with Cho'Gath where he was really everywhere?

1169
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:46,703
Great question, actually.

1170
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,625
And before I answer that, I briefly

1171
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:51,726
want to say make sure you guys fill out those surveys.

1172
00:56:52,386 --> 00:56:53,427
It's important for GDC.

1173
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:55,649
It's important for me to get feedback on my talk.

1174
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:58,450
So please, please fill out those surveys.

1175
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,651
I think check your email for them.

1176
00:57:00,372 --> 00:57:01,392
The question was.

1177
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:07,253
And I'll briefly summarize it. How can we look at, you know, monsters being unpopular

1178
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:12,515
if during that time the balance of the game was such that maybe monsters and a lot of

1179
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:16,978
those champions were just sort of weak? Well, again, that's why we do the breadth versus

1180
00:57:17,078 --> 00:57:23,301
depth over time. So when we, in that particular graph, we only looked at a few patches, but

1181
00:57:24,265 --> 00:57:29,368
A lot of times when we're making balance decisions about this, or if we're looking at something

1182
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:32,749
and thinking, hey, here's an opportunity to make something more popular, we would look

1183
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:37,552
at the play rate over time, and not just over a single patch.

1184
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:38,532
But that's a great question, yeah.

1185
00:57:38,552 --> 00:57:42,974
Because they do fluctuate based on the sort of meta of League of Legends, what's strong

1186
00:57:43,014 --> 00:57:43,535
and what's weak.

1187
00:57:43,995 --> 00:57:44,415
Great question.

1188
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:44,835
Thanks.

1189
00:57:52,224 --> 00:57:53,366
Hi, thanks for the great talk.

1190
00:57:53,946 --> 00:57:57,151
I have a simple question about the other than the user survey.

1191
00:57:57,591 --> 00:58:01,256
Do you use the play log or data to categorize the play style?

1192
00:58:02,157 --> 00:58:04,961
Like, I mean, assessing versus powerholders,

1193
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:05,462
something like that?

1194
00:58:07,004 --> 00:58:09,667
For some of our surveys, we do collect.

1195
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,942
player data based on like what they were doing in that game.

1196
00:58:12,962 --> 00:58:17,646
We actually have a tool that allows us to ask any number of specific questions based

1197
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:21,790
on the instances of a game they just played in or based on their player account.

1198
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,251
So it depends on the survey.

1199
00:58:23,552 --> 00:58:28,936
Sometimes we will have them self-select various aspects because, you know, for instance, they

1200
00:58:28,976 --> 00:58:33,020
could have been playing a game in a different position and that might not be their main

1201
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,200
one.

1202
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,522
So sometimes we have them self-select.

1203
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:40,948
Sometimes we grab it from the game data as well to draw whatever demographics we need for them.

1204
00:58:43,264 --> 00:58:46,948
I was wondering, so you've got the chart with the like popularity, depth, and niche.

1205
00:58:46,988 --> 00:58:51,793
Do you generally try to design champions aiming at specific points of that graph,

1206
00:58:51,853 --> 00:58:55,397
or do you try and just make the best champion that you can and see where they land?

1207
00:58:55,537 --> 00:58:58,480
Is that like, where does that go in the process?

1208
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:02,705
Great question. I mean, generally when we're making new champions with League of Legends,

1209
00:59:02,745 --> 00:59:04,947
we're never going to be like, yeah, we want an unpopular champion.

1210
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:11,051
But we do actually have more intentional design where sometimes we, especially when we make

1211
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:15,995
shot calls about where we expect a champion to be, we'll say something like, hey, we know

1212
00:59:16,075 --> 00:59:20,258
this gameplay fantasy or this thematic fantasy is not going to appeal to a ton of players,

1213
00:59:20,298 --> 00:59:24,781
but we want to deliver that experience really, really well for the players who do like that.

1214
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:29,144
And we'll specifically call a champion, hey, we expect this champion to be more niche appeal.

1215
00:59:29,504 --> 00:59:32,586
Or we expect this champion to be a more sort of broad appeal.

1216
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:35,547
Or sometimes where those things really align,

1217
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:38,669
we're like, yeah, we know this character is going to be sort of a knockout.

1218
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,590
Sylas is an example of a character.

1219
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:43,632
Sylas, for those of you wondering, was a recently designed character

1220
00:59:44,112 --> 00:59:46,873
who had a long-requested ability in League of Legends.

1221
00:59:47,374 --> 00:59:49,795
He can steal the abilities of other champions.

1222
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:54,437
He was one where we were very confident he was going to be a popular champion,

1223
00:59:54,537 --> 00:59:55,678
and we designed him for that.

1224
00:59:57,179 --> 00:59:57,319
Yes.

1225
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,076
Thanks for the talk.

1226
01:00:02,618 --> 01:00:10,084
So when you were going in for the breadth-first steps, you were talking about how when you make changes to a champion, how that actually affected where they were or where they landed.

1227
01:00:10,965 --> 01:00:24,397
Do you guys do more with also investigating item changes or rune changes or anything like that to see how that also affects champions and where they land and whether it's less on the champion and more on other aspects of the game?

1228
01:00:25,478 --> 01:00:26,158
Absolutely.

1229
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:37,284
While it wasn't covered in here, I have had to do many presentations internally and do a lot of work with my team around how the marksman item,

1230
01:00:37,904 --> 01:00:43,586
the items for the marksman champions like Lucian, Ezreal, Caitlyn, the characters with the long-range weapons.

1231
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,948
We updated all the items that they could purchase.

1232
01:00:47,308 --> 01:00:49,269
We've actually done it now twice in the last year.

1233
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:52,250
And yeah, we track a lot of stuff regarding how...

1234
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:57,034
systemic changes to the game can affect an entire class or a position.

1235
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:58,635
So yeah, we do track those things as well.

1236
01:00:59,395 --> 01:00:59,676
Thank you.

1237
01:01:01,377 --> 01:01:06,200
Okay, I'm going to be out in the lounge back that way to chat a little bit.

1238
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,761
It's the Outlook just over here.

1239
01:01:08,022 --> 01:01:09,483
So, I'll be around. Thanks, guys.
