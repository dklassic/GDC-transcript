00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:06,989
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:08,330
My name is Sean Krenkel.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,550
I'm the co-founder of a game studio called Night School.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,470
We're down in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,751
And we started in 2014, like the middle of 2014.

6
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:19,532
And we've put out two games.

7
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:22,052
The first one is a game called Oxenfree,

8
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:24,892
which is sort of like a supernatural,

9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,933
coming-of-age adventure.

10
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:30,353
And then we also did a game in the middle of the year

11
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:32,414
last year based on Mr. Robot, the TV show,

12
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:33,214
and that's sort of like a...

13
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:35,394
paranoid texting thriller.

14
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:39,295
Somebody likes that game.

15
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,216
So this is a picture of me and my co-founder, Adam Hines,

16
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:47,797
who is also my cousin and is also sitting right there

17
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,717
and is mortified.

18
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:52,678
Yes, that little sweet potato wrote all of Oxenfree.

19
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,198
So when Adam and I were little kids,

20
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:59,759
we just always cared about story and cared about games.

21
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,101
something that we, as we started the studio,

22
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:04,641
that was really the thing that we thought

23
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:07,643
we could focus in on and make something really special.

24
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:11,124
And so, for us, the story-focused games that we make

25
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:13,185
are all about kind of letting players

26
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:15,226
push and pull at narrative in ways

27
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:17,547
that they haven't seen in games before.

28
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,908
And so today, I wanted to talk about

29
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,929
how our team has been approaching that,

30
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:23,830
just specifically with Oxenfree.

31
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:26,618
So we'll go back to 2014.

32
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:31,441
We were there, crammed in a little 600 square foot box

33
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,043
in Glendale, California.

34
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:38,006
And there are obviously no shortage of amazing dev teams

35
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,948
who are doing really great storytelling in games.

36
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:42,989
And so we knew we would have to do something

37
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:44,770
really different to stand out.

38
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,452
Because again, I'm sure half this room

39
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:49,333
is making extraordinary story games.

40
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:52,375
So the thing that we started to really come back to

41
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,276
over and over again that we were observing

42
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:59,119
was this idea that most games really kind of treat

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,402
gameplay and story in these very siloed moments, right?

44
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:05,523
So you would have a mechanics-driven encounter,

45
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:07,084
then you move to some storytelling,

46
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:09,545
that storytelling is either something that tells you

47
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,046
what you're going to do next

48
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:13,087
or is there for emotional impact,

49
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:16,229
then you go back to the mechanics-driven encounter.

50
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,911
And so even in the best stuff on the market,

51
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:21,454
that works well, but we thought as a small team,

52
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:24,417
something that we could try to do is make a game

53
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,399
where the mechanics only serve to push the story.

54
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:30,122
And so every decision that we made in the game

55
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:31,703
then would focus on that.

56
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:35,006
And that was really sort of the foundation

57
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,428
for the studio and for Oxenfree.

58
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,730
So, you know, in the very beginning,

59
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,272
we only had a really basic idea

60
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:45,855
of what Oxenfree was going to end up being.

61
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:48,417
You know, we had some pretty specific references

62
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,358
for what we wanted the feel to be,

63
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:52,460
but we didn't know what the story would turn out to be

64
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,961
or the mechanics.

65
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,081
You know, I mentioned it before,

66
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:56,963
but it was like supernatural elements

67
00:02:56,963 --> 00:02:58,744
we thought were really cool,

68
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:00,525
coming of age we thought was really cool,

69
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:02,347
and if you look at all these different movies

70
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:03,648
and books and shows that are,

71
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:07,409
referenced up here, they all have this really underlying

72
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,751
vibe that is frankly pretty well-mined territory

73
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:14,752
in movies and other media, but you haven't seen

74
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:17,193
a lot of it in games, and so you kind of keyed into that

75
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:19,973
and went, oh, this could be a really interesting space

76
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,394
to play in for a game.

77
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:28,136
So Oxenfree's basic story came together really quickly.

78
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:32,779
It's about this girl named Alex and the game takes place

79
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,962
on an overnight party where Alex and her stepbrother,

80
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:37,963
Jonas, go off and...

81
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:45,406
right after the first act they end up unwittingly opening this crazy ghostly rift and

82
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:50,208
They then have to kind of uncover the mystery of the island and what they've just unleashed

83
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:54,690
And we also unpack a fair amount of trauma in Alex's life

84
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,592
Rooted in issues with her her older brother Michael who had passed away

85
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:03,234
So usually, and I'm sure a lot of folks in this room

86
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:05,715
would think maybe we kind of got ahead of ourselves

87
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,676
because even for us as a team,

88
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:10,917
we'd historically like to find a set of mechanics

89
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,758
and then build the game around that set of mechanics

90
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:16,459
and build the narrative to support those mechanics.

91
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,440
And we were a little kind of nervous about that.

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,561
We were falling in love with this story

93
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,902
and maybe a little bit too early.

94
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:25,663
But because we were loving where the story was headed,

95
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:30,805
decided to kind of keep pushing and let that story

96
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,606
drive all of our mechanics choices.

97
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,928
So I want to take a step back for a second

98
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,449
and talk about the what versus the why.

99
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,570
And that's really, for Night School,

100
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,972
that's a guiding principle of all of the games that we do,

101
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:48,493
is having a clear understanding and delineation

102
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:49,713
of the what and the why.

103
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,915
So what is the player doing,

104
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,817
and then why is the player doing that?

105
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,239
Because hopefully there's a meaningful connection

106
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,721
between those two things.

107
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:01,103
And I'm sure I'm gonna butcher this slightly,

108
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:05,206
but in film, the what is the plot,

109
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:08,749
and that is the sequence of events that take place

110
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:10,510
over the course of the film.

111
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,071
And then the story is the why,

112
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:14,353
because it tells us why the characters

113
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:15,935
are on the journey they're on,

114
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:18,296
and how that series of events happens.

115
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,965
In games, games are primarily a what medium

116
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:25,226
because they're interactive.

117
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:29,327
And so the what is typically the set of mechanics

118
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:33,129
and encounters, and then the why still remains the story.

119
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:37,290
So I'm sure this isn't a new concept to anybody in this room,

120
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,592
but many games treat their what as a toy, right?

121
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,114
So you've got like running and jumping,

122
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:47,196
or aiming and firing, or flinging,

123
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:49,797
or katamari-ing, whatever that is.

124
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:53,500
And these are all these really fully developed toys

125
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,982
that are fun to interact with at a very primal level,

126
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,563
because games really excel at the what, right?

127
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:02,665
Like that's so much of the purpose of why we all love them.

128
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,060
But then a toy alone, no matter how fun it is,

129
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,042
can get boring kind of quickly if there's no feeling

130
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:11,744
of progression or escalation.

131
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:14,746
So that's where games traditionally introduce things

132
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:19,409
like challenge or changes to how the toy works,

133
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,591
or adding new variables to impede your ability

134
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,412
then to use that toy.

135
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,301
So, you know, in games, story is usually just a catalyst,

136
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,262
then, to the real game of what you're doing.

137
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:32,543
And so we were finding ourselves in this dilemma

138
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:34,843
of how could we make a story-focused game

139
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:39,365
with no overt challenge be mechanically satisfying?

140
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,066
Like, what mechanic would best represent the story

141
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:45,487
that we were developing, and how could we escalate that

142
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,468
over the course of the game?

143
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:50,423
And we kept coming back to communication,

144
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:53,525
like being that central piece.

145
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:57,147
So if Alex's story is why you play Oxenfree,

146
00:06:57,147 --> 00:07:01,570
then communication and how we communicate just as humans

147
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,091
would become our what.

148
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:07,352
So, kind of quickly just breaking down like,

149
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:09,714
what was, what is Alex's why,

150
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:12,317
and what is Alex's what in the game?

151
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:16,741
So, her why before these kids open this crazy hell gate

152
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:19,544
is basically just like overcoming awkwardness,

153
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,486
you know, the typical kind of teen stuff

154
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:24,469
that you would expect of a senior in high school,

155
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:27,692
and allowing you to define her as a character or.

156
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:32,336
kind of role play and be yourself as Alex.

157
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,938
And then after the gate opens up,

158
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:38,380
you're forging bonds with friends and your new stepbrother,

159
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,602
but in a very kind of mortal way,

160
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:43,684
instead of the sort of teen BS way that happens

161
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:44,684
before the gate opens.

162
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:47,446
You're coming to terms with these deep-seated issues

163
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:49,028
regarding your brother's death,

164
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:50,429
and you're uncovering the mystery

165
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,330
of the island's inhabitants,

166
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,752
so that you can bring peace to the island.

167
00:07:56,993 --> 00:08:00,436
But then, if you break that down into the what,

168
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:01,797
it's actually super basic.

169
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:04,940
It's essentially just like exploring and communicating.

170
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,403
So instead of escalating challenges to what you are doing,

171
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:12,045
we would escalate the stakes of why you do it

172
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:12,686
through story.

173
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:15,788
So we set a very core rule set for movement,

174
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,650
navigation, communication,

175
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,791
but we would then tweak elements of the story

176
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,753
over and over and over again to sort of escalate it

177
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:23,715
and give that feeling of challenge.

178
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:27,416
So every creative decision we made then was intended

179
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,317
to smooth out story interactivity.

180
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:32,660
And where that ended up putting us was,

181
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,502
you know, we kind of looked at it as three different buckets

182
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:39,065
for our main kind of creative decision making process.

183
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,947
Exploration, which is pretty straightforward,

184
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:44,209
communication, and then the visual design

185
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,051
that needs to house those prior decisions.

186
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:51,414
So from an exploration front, how can we make exploration

187
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:54,577
more conducive to storytelling?

188
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,638
So the first decision we made was that movement

189
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:59,040
has to be contiguous through the whole game.

190
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,682
Like we never wanted there to be a cut scene,

191
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:03,403
so there's never a cut scene in the game,

192
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,344
and it was crucial to us to say,

193
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,707
we're never going to take control away from the player

194
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:11,689
at any time, and always they have the ability

195
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:13,610
to have some form of input and move.

196
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,333
And that was a big key thing that became a massive,

197
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,335
had a huge ripple effect and big design challenge

198
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:23,197
both from a writing perspective and a design perspective.

199
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:27,821
The other piece of exploration that we thought

200
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:29,322
would be important for us was.

201
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:32,944
to make it more of a big screen, kind of lean back

202
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:34,725
experience and not a point and click game.

203
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:37,426
Like you can play it that way, but we wanted to make sure

204
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,047
that the foundation of the game was still

205
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:42,389
something that you could play with a controller

206
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,310
and feel really kind of natural and fluid.

207
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,535
So more importantly though, probably most importantly,

208
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:51,375
is really the kind of bucket of communication, right?

209
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,616
So if we're gonna make communication

210
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:55,856
the nucleus of this game,

211
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:59,137
the act of choosing dialogue for us

212
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:00,778
needed to feel like an ability.

213
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:02,258
And that was a big distinction

214
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:03,638
that we wanted to make up front,

215
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:06,599
where dialogue is not a set of menu choices

216
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,280
that have right or wrong or good or bad or.

217
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,281
morally gray or whatever, it really needed to feel like

218
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:15,123
an ability and an extension of you.

219
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:19,285
And so that meant that in the writing process,

220
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,326
Adam, as he was working on it, needed to think through

221
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:26,808
a wide array of options that I'll kind of go into in a bit.

222
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:30,564
So another kind of quick aside,

223
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:34,126
I had never heard of this term a pre-mortem before,

224
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:35,626
that you guys might know this term,

225
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,087
but I did not know it at all,

226
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:40,669
and I was looking up how not to freak out before a talk

227
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:42,891
because I knew I'd be up here slightly freaking out,

228
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,172
which is basically happening,

229
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,933
and I found this TED Talk,

230
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,354
and this guy was talking about

231
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:52,356
you could stop a stressful moment before it happens

232
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:53,717
by doing a pre-mortem,

233
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:54,457
and a pre-mortem...

234
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:57,899
is it's like a business concept where at the beginning

235
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,881
of a project you look at the end goal and the product

236
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:04,402
that you're going to build and you play out in your head

237
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:07,904
every possible scenario that could go totally wrong.

238
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:11,005
Like just be super imaginative and think of the worst case

239
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,966
of everything and then you work, whoops,

240
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:17,509
you work your way backwards then and now you've ideally

241
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,130
sort of covered off on a majority of these scenarios

242
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,031
and you're prepared for them before they come.

243
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:24,413
it calms you down, and that's the type of thing

244
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:28,296
you could apply to yourself in your everyday existence.

245
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:31,900
And so what I thought was really interesting,

246
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,402
while looking that up just for my own

247
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,244
non-freaking-out reasons, was that

248
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,787
Oxenfree's writing process was essentially a...

249
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:43,929
big pre-mortem, because the way Adam approached

250
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:46,310
writing Oxenfree, as often as possible,

251
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,032
the player needed to have dialogue choices

252
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,553
that they would naturally want.

253
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:53,414
So again, it's not about good or bad, or light or dark,

254
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:56,056
it's just like, what would they naturally want to say?

255
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,417
And so, and our goal internally,

256
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,858
even as we were playtesting it, was to make sure that.

257
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:03,299
One of the big things that we did in all of our playtests

258
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,080
was go, was there ever a moment you were left

259
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,560
wanting to say something?

260
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,361
Did you feel like Alex didn't have,

261
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,922
you know, queued up in the chamber

262
00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:13,043
a line that you would want to say?

263
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,804
And that went, we went back and did a lot of rewrites

264
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:18,164
based on elements of that.

265
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:20,685
So Adam then, you know, had to read players' minds

266
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:22,686
basically in advance, and that is why

267
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:26,547
the script for this four or five hour game

268
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:27,468
is 1,800 pages long.

269
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:27,968
Sorry, Adam.

270
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,831
So another big thing for us, you know,

271
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:35,096
when we think about communication as a mechanic

272
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:35,677
and as an ability.

273
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:39,785
was to ensure that Alex would never talk

274
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:42,326
unless the player makes her.

275
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:45,047
This is something that we thought we could put

276
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:48,129
another kind of big stamp on where we would go,

277
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,350
you know, if other games you have these moments

278
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,291
where the player character,

279
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,312
even maybe the player character gets to choose a line,

280
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:57,653
but then immediately thereafter, the NPC says something,

281
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,974
and then there's kind of a ping-pong back and forth,

282
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,495
and you wait for a discussion to end

283
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:04,816
so that you can then jump in and say something.

284
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:08,319
we said, no, we want it to be every time she talks,

285
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,621
it's because you make her talk, right?

286
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,562
So there's never a moment in the game

287
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:14,003
where Alex will say something

288
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,265
unless you decide to initiate that.

289
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:18,606
And that was really crucial in making it feel

290
00:13:18,606 --> 00:13:22,289
more like an ability and less like a set of menu options.

291
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:27,032
So that also had a pretty insane ripple effect

292
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,393
in terms of how the game was designed,

293
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:32,076
because one, now the players can be super just weird

294
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:34,638
and mute and run through it and not say a word.

295
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:36,578
and there's an achievement for that,

296
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:38,279
so I don't know if anybody ever got that achievement,

297
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,519
but you can play the game totally silent.

298
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,640
And then the other thing was that, like in real life,

299
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,541
if you've got multiple characters around you

300
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,181
and you don't say something,

301
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:52,022
the other NPCs have to be able to pick up that conversation

302
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:54,122
and keep it moving, right?

303
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:58,143
So it was really our goal to make it feel that fluid,

304
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,364
where if the player decides to just kind of lay in the cut

305
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:02,164
and not say anything, they can,

306
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:04,705
because the other characters will continue talking.

307
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:05,071
You

308
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:09,025
So, and then even, you know, when it comes down to

309
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,147
the supernatural abilities in the game.

310
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:13,749
This is something that we started to let

311
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,750
get the best of us very early on.

312
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,253
Like we initially were like, we gotta have a ghost gun,

313
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:23,716
or we gotta have some sort of Spectro 3.

314
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,997
We literally had something called the Spectro 3000

315
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:27,018
for like a week.

316
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:27,899
It was so stupid.

317
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,180
I'm really glad we didn't keep it.

318
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,541
And so we killed that.

319
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,322
And we killed all these other mechanics

320
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,264
that we were starting to think through and prototype that.

321
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:37,665
didn't have to do with communication.

322
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,787
Like that was, if that's the core of the game,

323
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:42,289
we wanted the way you interact with ghosts

324
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,970
to also be rooted in communication.

325
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,412
And so, that's kind of where the radio came from.

326
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:50,695
Like the radio in the game is this analog, creepy,

327
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:55,479
semi-familiar, but also really weird mechanic

328
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,482
that allows Alex to talk to the ghosts

329
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,644
and also allow the ghosts to talk to her.

330
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:02,946
And the other thing that started to feel really special

331
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:05,649
or interesting about that from a player character perspective

332
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,791
was that now they were wielding.

333
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:09,674
what would be a weapon and something else,

334
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:12,718
but they were the only one that could kind of open gates,

335
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:16,364
talk to the ghosts, and not be trapped

336
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:19,268
in the sort of tropes of Alex is the chosen one.

337
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:21,812
It's more like she's just got a radio in her pocket.

338
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,133
So all these design ideas then needed to manifest through a

339
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,514
simple visual design.

340
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:31,356
And every decision that we made on how the game looks and

341
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:36,459
feels was intended to serve those design choices that I

342
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:37,960
just walked through.

343
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,183
we had early on. We decided we wanted a really far back camera to let you see the player

344
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:48,825
character, to let you see a few NPCs at once, to let you see where you're exploring and

345
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:53,868
kind of searching for different objects of interest. And also to encompass all the dialogue

346
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:57,950
bubbles that come up. And so that was really something that I think

347
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,251
before we even landed on a lot of

348
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,892
where the story was going to go,

349
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:04,892
we knew we wanted the camera to be this far back

350
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:06,673
to feel like, essentially,

351
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,534
whenever you're looking at the game, it's a shot,

352
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,655
like a very defined shot.

353
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,896
Yet, at the same time, we didn't want it to be

354
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:15,717
locked in, you know, very scripted cameras.

355
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:17,597
And another thing that we sort of came upon

356
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:19,638
pretty early in the prototyping phase

357
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:23,700
was our talk bubbles and how those talk bubbles function.

358
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,481
We kept going back to like, if in other games,

359
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,343
you are wielding a sword or a gun or whatever

360
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:30,783
and these are these things that let you

361
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:32,184
interact with the world,

362
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:34,346
how can we make dialogue feel that way?

363
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:37,307
And those talk bubbles are positioned the way that they are

364
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,709
because we didn't want players to have to

365
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:42,190
look up or down or look at sort of subtitles

366
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,472
that are on the lower left upper corner or whatever.

367
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:46,993
We wanted them to feel as connected to Alex as possible

368
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:47,313
so that

369
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,974
while you're playing and deciding what to say,

370
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:51,395
your eye is not moving around the screen.

371
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:54,336
Your eye is looking at the character firmly the whole time,

372
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:56,016
and if you decide to look away,

373
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,797
that's only because you're exploring.

374
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,917
It's more of a choice for the player

375
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:02,118
rather than having to kind of dart around.

376
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:04,379
So we really wanted those talk bubbles to be,

377
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:06,520
again, like an extension of Alex.

378
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:11,993
Oh, so another kind of result of that then became,

379
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:14,173
now we have these talk bubbles, we've got these characters,

380
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:16,074
we've got this really zoomed out camera,

381
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:18,595
well how fast should she be moving around?

382
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:21,516
Because early on we had her just sprinting

383
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:24,296
and jumping on stuff and she's having these

384
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,517
tear-jerker conversations about her dead brother

385
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:29,518
and that felt super weird and kind of mixed up

386
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,859
and then we're like, well should there be a run button?

387
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,579
And then we're like, well what does a run button

388
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,660
have to do in this game?

389
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,521
we tried, I don't even know, we spent months on these things

390
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,202
that now feel to us, we kind of forget them,

391
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:43,183
but we spent months trying to sort this out.

392
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:45,424
And where we ended up landing was,

393
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:49,385
whenever Alex is talking, she slows to either kind of a jog

394
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:52,106
or almost like a pretty brisk walk,

395
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,487
and then when she's not talking, she speeds up

396
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:55,868
and she can navigate that way.

397
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,588
And we, hopefully that was something

398
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:58,789
that's invisible to players,

399
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,130
but it also let them cover ground

400
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,451
when that would be the interaction that they'd want to do,

401
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:03,651
but.

402
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:07,158
observe and talk and not be, you know,

403
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:09,744
having these crazy conversations

404
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:10,968
while running through a forest.

405
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,952
So a lot of these early decisions then

406
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,692
ended up starting to push back,

407
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,593
where at a certain point the mechanics

408
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:24,833
and visual choices that we made did push back on the story.

409
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,854
And I'll give you just a couple of examples,

410
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,555
but yeah, this was a little bit further

411
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,095
into the development of the game.

412
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:33,836
We started to go, there's some key moments in the game

413
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:37,077
that now that these mechanics are truly solidified,

414
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,857
let's tweak bits of the story for it.

415
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:44,053
So the first one, which has been, I don't know,

416
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,016
sort of controversial even in our own team,

417
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:49,800
is this very deliberately paced first act.

418
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,843
So the first act of the game, about 30, 45 minutes,

419
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:56,288
is you're walking and talking and hanging out with people.

420
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,790
There's no ghosts, there's no crazy.

421
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:01,134
over-the-top supernatural stuff happening.

422
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:03,978
It is essentially a microcosm of people's

423
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:05,961
typical senior year in high school.

424
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,784
So you've got things like,

425
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:09,927
you've got these heightened versions of

426
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:12,010
you're meeting somebody that you really want to impress,

427
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,472
but there's other people there who know.

428
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:17,355
some dirt about you, or you know that your friend

429
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,897
has this massive crush, so are you gonna choose

430
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,938
to help him or just like totally expose him

431
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:23,840
and make him embarrassed?

432
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,723
And so, you know, for us, the reason why we made

433
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:29,984
this decision was that we wanted people to get

434
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:33,647
really familiar with Alex as a character and the movement.

435
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,170
the core relationships with these friends

436
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,533
before the ghost shit hits the fan

437
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:42,659
because then when said shit hits the fan,

438
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,482
it just feels way crazier and more over the top

439
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:47,966
because you're really familiar with the character

440
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:50,008
and sort of the systems at play in the game.

441
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,442
And then this one, I'll try to, it's not too spoilery,

442
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:57,625
actually it won't be spoilery, I'll speak in code.

443
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,029
The conclusion of the game became the sum

444
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:03,391
of all of our communication mechanics.

445
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:06,835
So there was a point where like after alpha,

446
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:09,037
actually after beta, I don't know, it was bad.

447
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,720
We were late in the game, and we were trying to sort out

448
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,263
the conclusion, and we had these elaborate puzzles,

449
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:19,346
and we were like, again, kind of ham-fisting new mechanics

450
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:22,288
in at the end, and we went, this just doesn't fit.

451
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,610
It like, even intellectually, where people should be

452
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,312
at the end of this game should be more about Alex's

453
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:30,155
and their emotional journey, and they shouldn't be

454
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:32,997
learning how to like, fill water and things,

455
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:35,199
and move blocks around, and do all these things

456
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,260
that have nothing to do with it.

457
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,342
we ended up going, okay, with the mechanics

458
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:41,063
that they've already learned, let's let them

459
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:44,345
either jettison these ghostly creatures

460
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:47,787
back to the strange place from where they came

461
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:50,649
as a single sort of organism,

462
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,811
or you can kind of negotiate and treat them as individuals

463
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:57,253
and bring elements of them out by peaceful means.

464
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:58,934
But it's all done through the radio

465
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:01,316
and things that you learned earlier in the game,

466
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:03,497
not through introducing new mechanics.

467
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:08,234
So all these decisions came together to make a game

468
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,915
that our team is super proud of.

469
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:13,216
I mean, we're beyond grateful to have this community

470
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:16,458
of players now who have connected with Alex both inside

471
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,459
but also outside of the game.

472
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,480
Like it totally blows us away every time

473
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,921
we see any of this stuff.

474
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:25,402
And we, you know, I think we feel that we're pretty sure

475
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,003
that the community is connected with her.

476
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:29,966
Because they can feel that when we were making it,

477
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:33,088
we were always more worried about why Alex would do something,

478
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:34,390
why she would make a decision,

479
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,192
why she would put herself in harm's way,

480
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,894
as opposed to anything else.

481
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:40,395
Like that was the most important thing,

482
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:43,378
that was the guiding principle for the whole game.

483
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:46,000
And we feel like it's really sort of paid off

484
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,461
in making something pretty special.

485
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,739
This slide makes me laugh when I'm looking at it.

486
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:53,700
This is, you guys have probably seen this kind of

487
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,162
classic quote from Pixar founder and Disney CCO,

488
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:00,603
John Lasseter, where he talks about kind of the interplay

489
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:02,703
between art and technology, right?

490
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,864
And so for those guys, the art.

491
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:08,645
challenges the technology and then the technology

492
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:12,067
inspires the art and for us we've kind of like

493
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:15,028
morphed and mutated that kind of basic idea

494
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:18,109
where for us we want to continue to approach game making

495
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:22,431
through this lens of story inspiring our mechanics

496
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:25,372
but then we will build mechanics that empower players

497
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:27,033
to tell their own stories.

498
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:30,554
So I hope this talk has given you some interesting ideas

499
00:22:30,554 --> 00:22:32,935
to explore as well and thank you.

500
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:47,018
Do we have Q&A time? I don't know how long I've been up here. Sweet. How do we do that?

501
00:22:47,018 --> 00:22:48,298
Can't see. Just hurdle questions. There we go. How's it going?

502
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:52,819
My name is Odette. I'm also a point and click adventure game designer, developer, indie.

503
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:11,890
I'm very interested in learning about the prototyping, playtesting, early stages,

504
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,737
because this game, when I played it, it felt like the voice acting and all that

505
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:23,503
was a very strong part and I'm curious how did you do that in early stages of the development?

506
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:28,759
So it was pretty funny, we would record scratch audio

507
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,382
in our bathroom at the office, and we would come up

508
00:23:33,382 --> 00:23:36,164
with these really just ridiculous small scenarios,

509
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,585
none of which made it into the game,

510
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:39,586
and Adam would write these scripts that would be like.

511
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:41,848
okay, here is a challenge to overcome,

512
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:44,210
and here's a lot of branching options,

513
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,372
and let's test out basically all those systems

514
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:47,512
that I was just talking through.

515
00:23:47,512 --> 00:23:50,975
And so, we did that for a while.

516
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:53,337
Like, we did not do any casting or any of the real,

517
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:55,619
you know, solid, solidified writing

518
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:57,680
until we had gone through that prototyping phase.

519
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,082
But early on, Brian, who's also here,

520
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:02,864
who was our lead engineer, was working on a tool

521
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:04,265
that was intended to be a very...

522
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:08,168
visual, simple design tool that ideally any designer

523
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:10,509
or writer who's not hyper-technical can get into

524
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:13,191
and use it's a visual kind of node-based thing

525
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:14,952
so that you could even play something out

526
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:17,714
without dropping it into a full scene.

527
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:21,256
We, to be perfectly honest, it all came in way too hot.

528
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:24,198
Like we were halfway through the game

529
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:25,879
and some of the core tools were still getting built.

530
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:27,640
The story was changing for a long time.

531
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,262
So I'd like to say that we, in the first three months,

532
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:30,882
had this like,

533
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:35,766
Yes, here it is moment, but we were at alpha still like crapping our pants

534
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:40,910
So it was but yeah, I mean for us. We were kind of doing two or three things at once

535
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,312
There was a lot of art tests happening

536
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:45,514
That we're not taking into account a lot of the dialogue

537
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:51,299
And then there were a lot of like script tests happening based on the tool set that Bryant was building and then we would just

538
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,101
Let people play it that was pretty much it. Thank you sure

539
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:54,282
All right

540
00:24:57,091 --> 00:25:01,615
Since most games kind of take control away from the player,

541
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:05,358
lock the camera, etc. to force the player to view the story,

542
00:25:05,358 --> 00:25:10,243
did you guys have issues with playtesters walking away from conversations

543
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:17,309
and missing out on parts of the story or the delivery of certain voice lines

544
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,591
that kind of took away from their experience?

545
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:21,532
all the time.

546
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:25,053
Like, yeah, the earliest versions of the game,

547
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:28,355
we wanted to let you go anywhere at any time

548
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:30,856
and be able to backtrack, go wherever you want,

549
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:34,378
and have a lot of conversations be location agnostic.

550
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:37,239
And we ended up having to kind of hone that in.

551
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:39,641
I think for our next stuff, we'd still like to find ways

552
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:42,522
to improve more of that and let important conversations

553
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:43,963
sort of happen anywhere.

554
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:45,483
But yeah, the biggest challenge is we're like,

555
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:48,747
how long should a scene be?

556
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,289
How long should a chunk of dialogue be?

557
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:51,690
Because if a character is moving,

558
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,612
if a player is moving too quickly

559
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:55,715
from one waypoint to another,

560
00:25:55,715 --> 00:25:57,857
they're going to trigger the next conversation too early.

561
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,399
Or are they going to run along

562
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:01,881
and then there's just a long, dead stretch of space?

563
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:03,623
or are they going to go backwards

564
00:26:03,623 --> 00:26:06,045
and not be able to talk about anything?

565
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:09,548
And so, all credit goes to Adam

566
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:11,550
and his maniacal writing process

567
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,692
for finding ways to fill in

568
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:15,313
and kind of shave off the edges of that,

569
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:17,555
but there was never like a magic bullet for it.

570
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:18,936
It was just a lot of play testing

571
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:21,178
and finding where people went and how to guide them

572
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:23,520
and how long scenes should be.

573
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,681
Okay, thank you.

574
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:24,761
Sure.

575
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:34,071
So awesome game. The timing I think is really crucial to the dialogue mechanics in Oxenfree.

576
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:43,095
Like how long the options stay on screen or how long the conversation pauses while the system is waiting to see if the character is going to reply.

577
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:48,558
Was there any science that went into choosing those numbers or do you guys just sort of feel it out and watch playtest?

578
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:52,708
That was another just duct tape and a prayer thing.

579
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:58,133
Early on we did want a science and a consistent thing for it

580
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,456
and it's something that response wise to the game,

581
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:03,299
some people really love exactly how it was timed

582
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,441
and other people are kind of pissed off about it,

583
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,122
but ultimately.

584
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:08,823
most of those lines and how the interrupts work,

585
00:27:08,823 --> 00:27:11,323
sometimes you cut somebody off right in the middle of a line,

586
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:14,164
sometimes they say their whole line

587
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:16,164
was all just hand tweaked basically,

588
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:17,245
because it's like maybe a line

589
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:19,685
has some really crucial information

590
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:22,346
that an NPC might be saying something that you need to hear,

591
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:23,766
so we're going to let that whole line play.

592
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:25,727
But if it's more just a feel thing,

593
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,807
as often as possible,

594
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:29,047
we wanted you to just cut people off, no matter what.

595
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,968
So that would be the perfect world version,

596
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,708
but half the lines are not that way

597
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,309
because they're just for subjective reasons.

598
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:44,294
Quick follow-up question. Did you ever measure that like cutting off other characters and did that ever feed back into the relationships between the characters?

599
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:49,477
Not the cutting off. No, but thank you. We're gonna take that idea

600
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:50,257
Please do

601
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:50,658
Thank you

602
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:55,621
Did you systemically deal with interrupting?

603
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:59,943
Conversations or were they custom every time when Alex chose to speak or not?

604
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,830
Sorry, could you say that again?

605
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,151
So, other characters are speaking, Alex responds in the middle, cuts people off.

606
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:12,792
Did you have to systemically deal with then resuming or how to deal with all of that?

607
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:17,393
A lot, yes. So again, crazy writer Adam down there.

608
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:24,534
There's, we, as often as possible, we'd like the NPCs or Alex to be able to pick up the conversation.

609
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:29,395
So if you cut somebody off in the middle of any line, we don't want it to just like awkwardly...

610
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:31,737
jump back into the conversation.

611
00:28:31,737 --> 00:28:33,418
So there's a lot of lines in the game,

612
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,239
hundreds of lines where they'll be like,

613
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,801
okay, back to what we were talking about,

614
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:37,821
or things like that.

615
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:40,944
So yes, there is definitely a system

616
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:42,885
for all of that in place.

617
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:43,946
Cool, thank you.

618
00:28:43,946 --> 00:28:44,246
Thanks.

619
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:51,978
Hi, my name is Molly. I'm an artist, so I have a lot of like art questions for you, but

620
00:28:51,978 --> 00:29:00,464
I'll keep it to just a mechanics question. The radio idea is really interesting to me,

621
00:29:00,464 --> 00:29:06,708
and that mechanic is like fascinating. How did you guys come up with that? Like what inspired it?

622
00:29:07,562 --> 00:29:11,945
So early on, it actually became like an offshoot

623
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:12,646
of another idea.

624
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:14,967
Early on we wanted to have a tape recorder.

625
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,528
And that tape recorder, we were going to let you

626
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:17,809
record a bunch of stuff in the world

627
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:18,790
and run around with that.

628
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,571
And then, and Brian still wants it,

629
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:23,232
and he's bummed out that it's not in the game.

630
00:29:23,232 --> 00:29:25,154
And it got totally crazy, and we went,

631
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:28,476
no, what are the elements that we really like about it?

632
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:31,217
Back to that communication thing, we thought,

633
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:34,878
what is something that's familiar, and radio is familiar,

634
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:36,239
and what is something that's creepy?

635
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:38,439
So we thought about radios and Silent Hill

636
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,700
were a really big piece of that,

637
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,981
that feeling of the static and that feeling of like,

638
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,682
I'm getting a very guttural piece of feedback from the game,

639
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:47,443
but it's also not direct.

640
00:29:47,443 --> 00:29:49,203
You don't know what it means all the time.

641
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:50,384
And so we thought it could be this really

642
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:51,764
kind of cool coded thing.

643
00:29:51,764 --> 00:29:54,085
So for us, early on, the radio,

644
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,185
we kind of looked at it as

645
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:59,107
aesthetically like the Silent Hill radio,

646
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:02,189
and then mechanically we wanted it to be like the ocarina,

647
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:05,830
an ocarina of time, where you can have sequences

648
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,851
of things that you can plug in, like a puzzle,

649
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,212
or tunes, or things like that.

650
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:12,074
And so it kind of became both of those, essentially.

651
00:30:12,074 --> 00:30:14,795
We wanted it to be, the other big piece was that

652
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:18,697
we wanted players to have some form of analog expression

653
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:21,278
while they're playing, and instead of just choosing

654
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,599
dialogue choices, so being able to bust that radio out

655
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,340
whenever you want.

656
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,221
and pick up little secrets and listen to other stations.

657
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,761
Just felt pretty cool.

658
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:29,862
So it was kind of all those things,

659
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,183
but it took a long time to get to it.

660
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:33,143
That's awesome.

661
00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:34,024
Thank you.

662
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:35,904
I was just told, I'm so sorry sir,

663
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,885
I was just told that was the last question.

664
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:41,027
But I'll talk to you out there.

665
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:42,187
Okay, thank you guys so much.
