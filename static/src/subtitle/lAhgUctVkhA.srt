00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:09,190
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel. My name is Brian Francis. I am here today with our wonderful guest in the lower left hand corner of the screen.

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,051
Our wonderful guest is Matthew Burns of Zachtronics.

3
00:00:13,832 --> 00:00:18,733
Matthew, I believe it would be accurate to describe you as the lead developer on this game we're playing today, right?

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:27,235
Yeah, it's kind of unlike every other Zachtronics game. This is sort of like my game, I guess, in a way.

5
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:32,292
And the game in question is, I believe it's called Solitaire?

6
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:34,453
Yeah, you guys just made a whole Solitaire game this time?

7
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:35,494
Simple and startling?

8
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:36,754
Yeah, it's called Kabufuda Solitaire.

9
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,057
Oh, Kabufuda, wait, so this is a different kind of Solitaire from...

10
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:51,024
It's a Solitaire based on Kabufuda cards, which are kind of a, you know, a kind of Japanese playing card that you can still buy today.

11
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:53,385
Nintendo actually still makes them.

12
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:57,388
So, you can buy Nintendo brands.

13
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,302
physical Kabufuda cards if you want.

14
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:31,212
That is absolutely correct. It is a visual novel in almost every sense of the term.

15
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:33,615
Yeah, we'll dig into that a little more, but yeah.

16
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:37,579
Eliza is a visual novel set in the far off land of Seattle.

17
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:43,106
In fact, I got a really eerie look when I went on the light rail in this game, and I was like, wait, I've been here?

18
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:43,967
Uh-huh.

19
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:54,397
So, like I said, it's a light novel, which means it's a narrative story about an app developed for treating mental health, which is something that is happening in our real world.

20
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:56,859
It's a little weird, a little prescient, you might say.

21
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,022
It's different than a lot of the other games we've streamed, which have been...

22
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:03,405
Kind of delving through all kinds of systems.

23
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:09,248
This one shows off some of the fine writing that has showed up in interesting characters and settings

24
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:16,231
that have been part of other Zachtronics games, but usually are sort of helping make the interesting puzzles take shape.

25
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,533
But, Eliza has been nominated.

26
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:30,461
For a couple of IGF awards, and I'm pretty sure that those awards are the IGF Award for Excellence in Narrative and the Seamus McNally Grand Prize.

27
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:31,542
That's right, right?

28
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,103
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

29
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:33,744
Yeah.

30
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:40,897
With that in mind, we are here today with Matthew to take your questions and my questions, and

31
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,378
everyone's questions, whoever's questions.

32
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:47,001
We are here today, as we play the game, check it out, sort of dive through the ins and outs

33
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,583
of the way Eliza tells its pretty unique story.

34
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:54,946
We are only going through, I've played about 30 minutes of the story, so if you're concerned

35
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:59,829
about spoilers, we're going to go through what I call the first 90 minutes or so, unless

36
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,851
I get stuck on something, or I don't think there's anything I get stuck on, or if I get

37
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,211
distracted.

38
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:03,911
Yeah, you won't get.

39
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:04,632
stuck.

40
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:08,815
I don't think, unless you want to try to beat Solitarium hard or something like that, but

41
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:09,395
other than that.

42
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:12,057
This is X-A-Punks.

43
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:15,479
No, it's not any X-Actronics game in that sense, right?

44
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:15,959
Like you can...

45
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:17,496
It's a visual novel.

46
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:20,217
I'll get things rolling here with the game.

47
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:22,858
Matthew, would you mind...

48
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,880
Actually, I'm going to turn the music down real quick.

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,821
Would you mind just explaining to us the origins of this game

50
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,022
and what sort of got you and the folks at Zachtronics started on a visual novel

51
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:37,563
as opposed to the normal puzzlers that we see from you all?

52
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:38,884
Sure, yeah.

53
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:42,985
So, before I worked at Zachtronics full-time...

54
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:47,213
I worked at the University of Washington here.

55
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:53,377
This was sort of in between working on AAA games and the other stuff that I was doing.

56
00:03:54,717 --> 00:04:02,141
As part of that academic job, I saw a bunch of different technologies that were in development,

57
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:11,326
having to do with trying to apply game technologies to health and education and things like that.

58
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:16,370
So while I was there, one of the demos that I saw was this like kind of virtual therapist

59
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:21,835
application thing that people were working on, where there was like an avatar, like a

60
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:26,298
second life looking avatar that would like interview you about your day or whatever.

61
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:30,681
And this was in 2014.

62
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:35,365
And I remember seeing that demo and just being like, that's such a wild thing.

63
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,769
It just struck me in a certain way.

64
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,790
It seemed kind of dystopian.

65
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,212
It seemed just like an interesting story.

66
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:55,137
I had this idea for the scene of someone talking about some very, very deep topics about themselves.

67
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,678
When you go to therapy, sometimes you access some really deep things.

68
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:02,780
And then it's just like this Amazon Alexa on the other side of it.

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,281
The contrast between those things is so great.

70
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,042
So I was thinking about telling a story about this.

71
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:16,104
And so on my own time, I always do my own writing.

72
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:19,044
I have some Twine games that I've made.

73
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:24,426
So I thought, well, maybe I'll do a Twine game about this, where you are talking to

74
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:28,167
a virtual therapist, or where someone is talking to a virtual therapist.

75
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,709
And maybe you can

76
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:34,870
maybe you work at the office and you are like...

77
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:40,248
applying AI therapy to people, like you don't actually do therapy on your own, but you are

78
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:47,293
the vector for this AI to do therapy to people. So I kind of worked out that basic premise in

79
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:52,857
twine form. I still have some of the twine prototypes that I made, there are like two or

80
00:05:52,897 --> 00:06:00,562
three of them. And the basic format of the game was actually all just done in twine, so there's

81
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:08,794
There's a very early one where it's just like you're sitting in your office and then you have a couple options of like,

82
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:15,417
look out the window, do another therapy session, go into the kitchen and see if there's cookies, things like that.

83
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:20,819
And so I was working on this, again in my own time.

84
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:27,842
And then around the time after we shipped Opus Magnum, I think in like 2016, at Zachtronics,

85
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:30,143
I was talking to Zach and I've been...

86
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:35,417
We were just chatting about stuff and I was like, well I'm working on this story about

87
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:40,720
this virtual therapist and it would be cool to do it as like a visual novel with some

88
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,742
art and if we could get some actors in and things like that.

89
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,704
And Zach was just kind of like, yeah, let's do it.

90
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:49,966
Let's give it a try.

91
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:56,730
So because I had this kind of fully formed idea already that, I mean it wasn't fully

92
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,752
formed but it was pretty well formed.

93
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,777
and I had a lot of the script done already.

94
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:14,383
So it wasn't hugely risky because to him, for his part of it, Visual Novels is very simple.

95
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:20,347
He doesn't really have to think about the design space of it too much.

96
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:28,113
There was some user interface work, obviously, but there wasn't this big design space.

97
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:30,569
that he needed to explore, anything like that.

98
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,252
Like, by saying it's going to be a visual novel,

99
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:39,440
kind of grounds it in an established genre,

100
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:40,862
you know, an established style.

101
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:46,570
So, it was pretty easy to think about doing at that point.

102
00:07:47,239 --> 00:08:02,138
Yeah, let's talk about the visual novel-ness of it and how there's still kind of a sense of interaction with this game that means you're not just sort of clicking through dialogue and you're not making a lot of choices, like there's some light branching that I've encountered so far.

103
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:09,943
But I want to talk about what we're looking at here on screen, which is the dialogue that's playing as, you know, the character here is explaining their problems to you.

104
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:16,627
You, the character, you're not just, you're playing as Evelyn, who is using the Eliza interface to interact with this person.

105
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:23,852
So, right now things feel very on rails, but early on there's a lot of talk about something that feels like it will be a choice.

106
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,295
which is the idea of you're supposed to be reading off the script here that I'm mousing over

107
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:31,177
and then down here obviously the text is popping up

108
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:37,222
and in the very first conversation the character here trying to help begs you to go off script

109
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:43,166
and the software prompts you to go off script by staying on script

110
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:44,828
by saying things that seem off script

111
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:50,492
so it's kind of this loop that even though it is nothing has changed in the

112
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:56,353
In the scripting, in the formatting, in the string of pearls that you're constructing,

113
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:58,674
there's an illusion.

114
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:02,475
The player is suddenly conscious of control and what they have choice over in a way that

115
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:07,236
a lot of other games like to make big statements about, but this one sort of does just by railroading

116
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,316
right through the conversation.

117
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:10,657
How did you sort of come to that?

118
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:14,278
So there is design space, right?

119
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,339
Like even though there's not a lot of...

120
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,720
even though this isn't Choose Your Own Adventure,

121
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,181
there's still... the player's brain is being wrapped around

122
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:22,762
the idea of what choices they have the ability to make

123
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,403
and how that affects these characters.

124
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:25,944
I'm speaking broadly. Totally.

125
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:27,545
It's easier to go into specifics, but...

126
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:29,946
Yeah. What were your thoughts about that when you were making it?

127
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,207
I think...

128
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,888
You know, I didn't have this term when I was doing it,

129
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:35,549
but I feel like if...

130
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:37,410
if interaction...

131
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,031
if interactive design is like giving people...

132
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,852
choices or is about giving people choices, then taking choices away is kind of like a

133
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:52,675
it's kind of like the negative space of game design in a way. And that can be very powerful

134
00:09:53,415 --> 00:10:00,958
to say that, you know, in this instance you don't have any choices. And so there actually was, I

135
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:06,300
played around with a couple different ideas of like how these therapy sessions would actually work.

136
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:12,818
And in some early versions, it's like, oh, well, you should pick between these three

137
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:13,938
things to say.

138
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:20,441
And then maybe the client feels better if you pick this thing versus that other thing.

139
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:30,546
And the more I thought about that and making therapy like a mechanic, the less I liked

140
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,087
that because you'd be making the argument that like...

141
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:42,378
all someone needs to do is hear the right thing and then they feel better.

142
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,739
You know, it's kind of, there's a lot of, um,

143
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:49,800
but it, it, there's a lot of issues around, around trying to like,

144
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,281
the make,

145
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:56,642
make something interactive that actually has to do with real human beings and,

146
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:59,183
and like what you say to them and how they feel.

147
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:05,105
Like I didn't want to reduce people to like these little mechanical objects

148
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,385
that are just like, Oh, you did a great job.

149
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,463
There are no specific guidelines for this.

150
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:12,665
I just want to say that I'm not a therapist.

151
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:13,605
I'm not a therapist.

152
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:14,606
I'm not a therapist.

153
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,686
I'm not a therapist.

154
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:17,387
I'm not a therapist.

155
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:18,027
I'm not a therapist.

156
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:18,167
But...

157
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:43,140
So eventually, yeah, eventually it was just like, you know what, I think the therapy sessions are going to be completely linear.

158
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,881
You're going to be railroaded on them.

159
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:53,123
And then hilariously you get that sort of completion screen with like little metrics and how they rated you and stuff like that.

160
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:56,064
It's like you have no agency over that.

161
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:58,424
Right, yeah, those are completely canned, right?

162
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:04,266
And it's funny because some people understand this, but like other people...

163
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,840
Play the entire therapy session, click through it, and then they're like,

164
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,901
oh, but how do I get a better rating?

165
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:10,802
Oh my god.

166
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:15,204
And yeah, and it's funny because it's so ingrained in us that like, you know,

167
00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:19,347
you do something and then you get your little Overwatch badges at the end,

168
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,488
and it's just like, you got this, this, this.

169
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:27,611
And so those, you know, that completion screen being completely fake is,

170
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:30,993
you know, my way of like...

171
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:35,005
Having a little bit of commentary on that, because you had absolutely no choice, there's

172
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:39,050
nothing you could have done, but you still get these fun little instrumentalized badges

173
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,374
and XP and stuff like that at the end.

174
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:43,917
It made me feel bad about my Apex Legends badges.

175
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,824
We are looking at it right now. I wanted to talk about the interface too.

176
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:55,105
You said Zack had a lot less to do this time, but he did some UI work on this.

177
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,986
This UI is really simple. This is sort of a little standard.

178
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:02,987
Although I like the nice pagey kind of feeling here along the top of the UI.

179
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:05,288
But when you're in there, there's a couple of really cool things happening,

180
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,789
which is on the left, there's kind of some prompts that are firing off.

181
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:15,691
On the left side of the screen, which is what we have here, there's the prompts that are firing off that are like positive or negative responses to the dialogue.

182
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:19,293
Over here, there's kind of like this thing, you know, like their audio inflection.

183
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:28,876
I was really surprised that the waveforms on this seem to be lining up, and I was surprised at how there were all these little things firing over here, positive, negative, on the dialogue.

184
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:35,958
And it wasn't just generic flow, like it felt really immersive for even though this was in such an intimate moment.

185
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,539
How much work did that take?

186
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,566
It was a fair amount of work to hook that all up.

187
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:48,410
All of those, you know, all of those metrics and things like that are pretty fake.

188
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:54,274
They're kind of like fluttering around and just there to make you feel like it's doing something.

189
00:13:54,294 --> 00:14:03,720
That even comes up in the story that like, if all you really have to do is say exactly what the AI tells you to,

190
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,241
you don't actually really need all of those metrics, right?

191
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,802
Like if this job really existed.

192
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:11,857
You wouldn't need to actually have all of that information.

193
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:22,566
But the headset, the fictional headset that you put on, shows all that stuff just to kind of like make you think that it's doing something.

194
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,588
It's sort of like when you...

195
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,672
You know, when you go to your bank's website or something and it like...

196
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,245
It'll have animations and stuff for things when it's not...

197
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:37,187
You know that it's not doing anything, but it'll play that animation for you anyway,

198
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:42,050
just to make you feel better about how it can't contact the server or whatever.

199
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,093
So that stuff is kind of a little bit of a UX commentary on how...

200
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,755
We like to see that it's like...

201
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:54,697
So that it looks fancy, that it looks like it's doing something.

202
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,919
And you can imagine that Skanda, the tech company in this...

203
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:04,320
built all that out so that it demos really well, so that people think that it's doing so.

204
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:12,630
Right on, we're gonna shift gears a little bit here in conversation, get back on talking about the game's narrative.

205
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:19,235
If you folks have questions for Matthew in chat, feel free to drop them. I'll grab them and ask him myself.

206
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:34,826
The main character of the story, Evelyn, takes the job as a Eliza proxy, in part it seems because she seems to also be dealing with a kind of emotional or mental, I wouldn't call it a crisis, but definitely a hard time sort of fits the bill.

207
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:41,308
I was sort of struck by playing the first 5-10 minutes of this game how super emotionally

208
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:46,410
intense it is, especially when all there is to focus on is the text and not any shiny

209
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,051
doodads, Overwatch badges, gunplay, whatever.

210
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:53,513
I was wondering about what your experience was.

211
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:59,896
I can sort of conceive of the writing and understanding a character and letting it

212
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:04,858
flow out, but I was curious about how you wanted players to understand the story.

213
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:06,979
How did you understand Evelyn in this way?

214
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,323
And how you could help them understand her position when all you sort of have are dialogue trees to work with?

215
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:23,610
Yeah, I mean I think there were a lot of cues at the beginning of the game that this was going to be a more introspective kind of experience, right?

216
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:29,615
Like at the start, the key image of the game is her sitting on the bench and it's this very, very...

217
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:35,864
blue-gray Seattle day and there's a big focus on the clouds in the sky and things like that.

218
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:44,108
Evelyn at the start of the story I think is sort of recovering from a depressive episode.

219
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,891
And so there's a lot of like people saying, wow I haven't seen you in a while, you know,

220
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:53,713
where have you been, how have you been, sorry I didn't ever contacted you and things like that,

221
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:57,075
because she's been kind of just more or less...

222
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:03,436
moping around in her apartment for close to three years, which is a pretty long time.

223
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:15,979
Part of that is, it's really like, there's a lot of reasons why that's the case.

224
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:21,000
One is that it's kind of, it's nice to start a story that way because she's like reconnecting

225
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,261
with people that she used to talk to but don't quite know.

226
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,142
It's, you know, they...

227
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:33,921
It gives you a little bit of an excuse to fill people in on what has happened in the past.

228
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:40,485
It's sort of like a gentler version of starting a story where someone has amnesia or something like that.

229
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:49,451
The hero washes up on the beach and has amnesia, and then everyone you meet is new because everyone in the story is new to you as well.

230
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,214
So mechanically, that's a useful thing.

231
00:17:56,211 --> 00:18:07,717
Emotionally, I think it's really important to show her getting her bearings again and making a very large decision about what she needs to do next in her life.

232
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:20,223
That's where this game is basically going, as it's building to Evelyn needs to make a decision about what she's going to do for the rest of her life or for her career.

233
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:25,106
What is she going to dedicate her time and energy to? What's important to her?

234
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:31,086
And having that depressive episode where she didn't have anything that she cared about,

235
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:37,330
you know, this story is about coming into the process of discovering that again, and

236
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:44,595
figuring that out, and making a big, maybe a career change, or moving away, or something

237
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:44,895
like that.

238
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:50,559
Just a very large decision that affects your life quite a bit.

239
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,042
And then, you know, there's another aspect to it, too.

240
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:56,364
She's really burnt out.

241
00:18:57,044 --> 00:19:02,128
I kind of wanted to tell a story about people in their 30s.

242
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:08,573
And so Evelyn is in her 30s, you know, Evelyn and Ray and Nora are all in their 30s.

243
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:14,478
And at least, you know, my personal experience of like kind of like getting into my 30s,

244
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:18,562
I had this moment where I was just like, wow, I don't.

245
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:26,486
I worked really hard throughout my 20s, and I don't even know why I did that.

246
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:30,268
I look back and it was just like, wow, I worked very hard, and now I don't...

247
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:33,931
What do I have? What have I accomplished by doing that?

248
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:38,834
And so there's this moment of looking back and feeling burnt out,

249
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,696
and asking myself why I did that.

250
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:46,139
And I think that that is definitely part of Evelyn's character as well.

251
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:50,948
I was still there for some reason.

252
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:14,588
The choice dialogue driven games, players are often aligning different choices.

253
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:17,651
Sometimes there's a moral system, sometimes there's a character system.

254
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,855
Some really interesting games are kind of using an information system,

255
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,458
like you want to make different dialogue choices because you're motivated

256
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:24,419
to get certain information.

257
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,724
In a game without those tangible rewards, I'm still sensing kind of a reason to pick.

258
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:32,325
I'm going to be doing a lot of different dialogue choices here as I play.

259
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:36,647
It's kind of like how people don't say what's on their mind,

260
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:40,088
they sort of translate what's on their mind into dialogue, if that makes sense.

261
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:42,949
That's true in real life, and that's true of really good screenplays,

262
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:46,611
is when you're talking about one thing, you're talking about something else.

263
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:52,053
I'm curious how you approach that as a writer in this story,

264
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:53,493
and maybe other stories you work on too,

265
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:56,855
because you've had to transition from objective-based dialogue

266
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,235
to open dialogue as well.

267
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:04,501
I think that it was important to me to be honest, in a way.

268
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:14,191
I don't really like the idea of fooling the player into thinking that there's more agency than there really is.

269
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:21,018
I would much rather say, here's this thing that you have to be on board with and go along with.

270
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:27,950
As opposed to saying, here's this mysterious system where you pick dialogue options and then stuff happens,

271
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,312
but you're not, you don't quite understand why stuff happened.

272
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:38,918
You know, like maybe it's tallying points in the background or maybe it's like you did this, you did, you picked the wrong kind of like

273
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,342
cookie to eat so somebody doesn't like you or something like that. Like that kind of stuff feels

274
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,264
arbitrary to me and it feels kind of

275
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:49,845
you know,

276
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:54,910
Not necessarily that true to life, even.

277
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:00,034
So, like, to me, I think it's... I just want to lay it out there and say,

278
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:02,816
hey, yeah, these are the things that you can choose.

279
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,778
They won't matter in the long run.

280
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:08,321
And these particular choices that you get throughout most of the game

281
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:11,123
are kind of these flavor choices, you know?

282
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:16,988
You can make Evelyn a little bit more defiant or a little bit more agreeable.

283
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:18,269
And these things are...

284
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:30,768
The reward for picking them is just hearing that, hearing the conversation go in that direction for a little while before it kind of wraps back around to what the conversation was going to be anyway.

285
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:33,569
So...

286
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,750
Yeah, you know, it wasn't like a...

287
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:47,633
It definitely wasn't going to be, ever going to be a story where it was like, you know, there are lots of different routes and like lots of different outcomes and...

288
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:52,280
So and so will remember that and you know things like that because

289
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:53,941
I don't think

290
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:59,706
I don't know. It just wasn't it just wasn't where this story was going, right? You know, it wasn't like a

291
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:07,532
Which person's life should you save or any anything like that? And that that kind of stuff like can be very

292
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:13,356
um gut-wrenching if you build it up properly, which person's life do you save but it's also like

293
00:23:14,557 --> 00:23:17,880
That doesn't come up a lot in in real life and I kind of wanted to like

294
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:20,389
ground this very much in real life.

295
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:27,017
I mean, unless you're like a medical professional or something like that, but it was really

296
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:34,067
about like, yeah, choosing what you do as a tech worker, I guess, in this instance.

297
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:41,154
Man, this is not a question, this is not a question but an observation.

298
00:23:41,174 --> 00:23:43,696
I sort of think it's interesting how in this dialogue with Nora,

299
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,999
she's talking about, you know, giving up the tech life and moving over to the artist and rocker life.

300
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:53,883
But there's, and she talks about the tech business being a business causing as many problems as it solves.

301
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:57,966
And she got tired of trying to get rich, trying to get famous, trying to change the world.

302
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:02,250
But there's still kind of a want to change the world in her personality that comes through.

303
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,232
Right in hand even as she sort of knocks down the job she used to have.

304
00:24:06,673 --> 00:24:11,256
That's such an interesting and good psychoanalysis for a character.

305
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:14,338
To still be fixated on something even while they're tired of it.

306
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,780
Like I said, observation not question.

307
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:22,684
My actual question is, I think it's time to talk about text in games like this.

308
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:29,567
I was watching an interview with one of the lead devs on Disco Elysium,

309
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:35,670
and they talked about how they were using the right side of the screen and the lower right-hand corner in particular to be this place where

310
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,431
to create this kind of Twitter-esque addiction quality to text.

311
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:45,113
This game doesn't have that, although your choices over here do show up in the same corner of the screen that he was referring to.

312
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:49,399
How did you and Zach think about this kind of process?

313
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:55,547
Obviously there's sort of a conventional visual novel style which brings dialogue into the space of where subtitles usually go.

314
00:24:55,567 --> 00:25:01,735
That was something that the Disco Elysium guy brought up too, was that most games put text here because it's where subtitles go.

315
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:08,378
Text can go anywhere. Text couldn't be across the screen. Text can be floating over people's heads.

316
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:14,201
In this scene right now, the dialogue could be popping up in comic bubbles right over their heads if we wanted it to.

317
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,922
Well, if you wanted it to. I have no say in the matter.

318
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:22,444
But did you think about that at all? What was your approach for making interactive dialogue?

319
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:24,705
Interactive text? Excuse me.

320
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:29,508
I definitely just started with the standard visual novel stuff.

321
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:31,268
The way I thought about it was...

322
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:38,531
Here's this story that I want to tell, and here are these themes that I want to explore, and stuff like that.

323
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:49,257
And then, the cool thing is that visual novels actually are a pretty well-developed and storied genre of game, you know?

324
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:55,801
And there's a grammar that visual novels have developed over the past 15, even 20 years of...

325
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:07,159
You have character portraits, you have backgrounds that they exist on, and then you have this

326
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:11,943
sort of text window at the bottom of the screen.

327
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:19,589
So using established visual novel stuff was very useful for us because it was this way

328
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,232
to just say, some of these problems have already been solved.

329
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:32,748
Not necessarily solved like this is absolutely the best way to do them,

330
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:36,889
but solved in terms of like, this is a language that we can use,

331
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:41,330
an established language that we can use to express the ideas in this particular story.

332
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:48,091
So we started there and I think it works out pretty well.

333
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:51,552
The dialogue looks pretty nice.

334
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:56,873
The display of the character's name on the far left there

335
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:57,793
kind of comes from

336
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:06,799
plays. If you've ever read the script to a play, it has that kind of look to it. This

337
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:14,363
was as opposed to putting another small character portrait there, or putting it in another box

338
00:27:14,943 --> 00:27:22,308
on the screen, stuff like that. And then, because this game is pretty much just a series

339
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:25,370
of conversations between Evelyn and one other person.

340
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:33,029
There are some exceptions, but most of the game is a conversation between Evelyn and another person.

341
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:40,931
So it kind of just worked that Evelyn would always be on the right side,

342
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:45,052
and her choices would be represented on the right side,

343
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:49,594
and then whoever she was talking to would be on the left side, which is kind of the...

344
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:55,735
In Western culture, the left side is kind of the stronger side, because you read from left to right.

345
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,314
Sorry, I'm just falling a little bit in love with Meredith M. Mercer,

346
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:05,618
dramaturge and game designer extraordinaire,

347
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:11,083
because that's an excellent title, and his excellent manifesto about...

348
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:15,588
No, her excellent manifesto about how to play Solitaire.

349
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:19,271
Right, yeah. I'm glad you like my bit characters too.

350
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:41,001
Oh man, I just love that even in this, you know, even in, like I said, I genuinely, when I was playing, especially Obismahagnam, was falling in love with the little bits of story that were creeping in there, and I'm just loving the way you guys handle devices, and I love this little phone you built in, I love the little hand buttons things, there's just like, look, this little scroll bar works, oh my god.

351
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:44,543
These, and it looks like she's doing it on the phone.

352
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:47,424
These are little details that, um, every time I pick up when you,

353
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:51,666
one of Zach, a Zach Tronick's game, um, your whole team manages to impress me with these.

354
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:55,547
Um, sorry, now that I'm done, uh, kissing up, kissing up to y'all.

355
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:56,268
Um...

356
00:28:57,688 --> 00:29:03,412
Okay, we're at the bottom of the hour right now, which means we have about 30 minutes left in our chat or so.

357
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,274
Go a little shorter, maybe go a little longer, we'll see.

358
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:13,178
I can see we've got a few folks hanging out. If you've got questions for Matt or you just want to say hi, go ahead and chat. We will grab them.

359
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:23,144
Right on schedule, TFK365 would like to say, as a software engineer in his early 20s, Erland's story really resonated with them.

360
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:26,106
They just wanted to say thanks for making this game.

361
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:30,466
Awesome, thank you for playing it. That's really nice to hear.

362
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:36,491
I'm going to move on with the narrative in that case and also move on with my questions.

363
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:39,494
Matt, thank you so much for putting an auto-advanced text in this game.

364
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:44,118
Text games are so hard to stream for the most part and the auto-advanced is making it so easy.

365
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,281
Again, that's another visual novel thing.

366
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:53,327
That was like, you know, over the decades they've just developed this standard set of features that...

367
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:58,335
are created based on need and stuff like that so it was really nice to use

368
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:00,096
to use things like that.

369
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:04,817
Let's talk about the art direction for a second. I didn't put this in the notes I gave you, but I know

370
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,758
you aren't doing the visual art for this game,

371
00:30:08,198 --> 00:30:12,999
but I'd love to know more about what your thoughts were as someone who had this idea for the story.

372
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,881
You could have gone really wild with the setting, you brought it in more to a more familiar setting.

373
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:22,522
I'm curious how you then worked with an artist to go,

374
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:24,702
okay, we still want things to look eye-catching

375
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,723
and appealing and to let the visuals tell a story too,

376
00:30:28,103 --> 00:30:30,024
which thankfully they have been in the background here,

377
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:32,225
the coffee shop, the room that's behind

378
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:33,145
this text message stuff.

379
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:35,185
Oh my God, there's so many cookie options.

380
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:36,146
Give me a second here, but yeah,

381
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,066
would you mind talking about the art

382
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,467
and how your process interacted with your art team?

383
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:43,168
Yeah, well, you think about what your favorite

384
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:43,908
type of cookie is.

385
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:47,389
I can say that it was,

386
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:48,649
we did take a.

387
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:54,892
a bit of time at the beginning to really think about the best way to approach the style of

388
00:30:54,932 --> 00:30:55,132
this.

389
00:30:56,393 --> 00:31:01,496
Because we knew we didn't want to do super anime art or anything like that for the story.

390
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:05,459
It wasn't supposed to be super stylized or anything.

391
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:13,325
This is a story that takes place in Seattle in modern day, so it's a pretty grounded story.

392
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:14,445
At the same time...

393
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:23,611
We didn't necessarily want this photorealistic treatment either, whatever that even means.

394
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:30,117
So we kind of settled, it took a little while, but we kind of settled on this sort of painterly,

395
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:40,826
mostly realistic but also somewhat stylized approach to both the characters and the backgrounds.

396
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:51,308
Taking reality and then painting it with a little bit of a stylized eye.

397
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:58,735
But other than that, going for a naturalist look.

398
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:05,100
I think it ended up working out pretty well.

399
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:13,246
I think you can get where this game is coming from by looking at the art and character portraits, which is a testament to the...

400
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,403
to the artists who did a fantastic, fantastic job.

401
00:32:20,284 --> 00:32:29,831
Moving over to my question pile, what I will ask next is, oh yeah, here's one of my favorite questions to talk to writers and narrative designers about.

402
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:41,420
I have a weird, big, stump speech about how the incredible stories we get to experience in video games, and elsewhere, outside of video games, in movies and books,

403
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:52,663
How the narratives and the themes and the characters that we get to encounter are often shaped and informed by the medium and not just by the medium but by the tools that are used to make the medium.

404
00:32:53,003 --> 00:33:00,666
So there's a lot of things that the average player sort of doesn't get to see about the process, if you will, that totally shapes the kind of story that comes out.

405
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:08,668
You mentioned using Twine at the top. I don't know quite how you translate Twine into whatever tools you guys use at Zachtronics.

406
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,669
Excuse me, y'all use at Zachtronics.

407
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:14,932
Have you thought about that at all?

408
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:15,292
Oh, definitely.

409
00:33:15,312 --> 00:33:18,935
Do you have anything you want to contribute to that thought?

410
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:19,896
For sure.

411
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:21,076
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:25,540
Well, so Twine, when I was using Twine, it was definitely, it was super, super early

413
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,241
in what this was.

414
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:30,624
So it didn't go directly from Twine into this.

415
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:31,564
Yeah.

416
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:36,888
When I decided, like, okay, this is going to be a visual novel, then I, like,

417
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:42,354
wrote it for real, basically keeping that in mind that it was going to be a visual novel.

418
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:50,081
I think that having that set form again really does inform a lot of things.

419
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:58,348
For example, most of the conversations are one-on-one. That's not necessarily a limitation

420
00:33:58,368 --> 00:34:03,012
of visual novels. Some of them have three people, some of them have scenes of up to

421
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:06,895
four or five people sometimes. I don't...

422
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:10,593
think that it always works as well.

423
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:15,414
The basic visual novel conversation style is usually between two people.

424
00:34:17,114 --> 00:34:22,456
And so that form informs what I wrote, right?

425
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:30,638
And how I take advantage of the strengths and weaknesses of the medium in some way.

426
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,099
The idea of like...

427
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:39,736
Having your phone, for example. Not all games give you a little in-game phone.

428
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:50,722
But because you have an in-game phone, I wanted to play around with having some of the conversations happening over IM versus happening in so-called real life.

429
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:55,325
And then also just all these emails that you get. You're looking at one right now.

430
00:34:57,526 --> 00:35:03,369
Someone forwards you an article that they saw in the newspaper and that kind of adds another dimension to the story.

431
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:12,819
So thinking about the technology that you use...

432
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:18,920
It absolutely affects how the story is told and then from there, the content of it.

433
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,242
I just want to say thank you for being one of the...

434
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:26,404
There's a lot of fake newspaper articles that show up in video games.

435
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:32,927
Almost none of them use the inverted pyramid that we have to use in Gala Sutra.

436
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:37,569
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm proud of actually following...

437
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:41,099
Newspaper-y guidelines for writing the newspaper article.

438
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,921
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

439
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,164
My partner works in news too, so I'll let her know that you guys did that, now that I found,

440
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:49,285
that y'all did that, now that I found that here.

441
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:53,528
Yeah, that, that, that's, that's, um, that makes a lot of sense.

442
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:55,730
Okay.

443
00:35:56,203 --> 00:36:01,445
I'm going to, as we advance, oh my god, like, folks, I don't know if you know, we are the

444
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:06,547
Game Developers Conference, so right now we're on the Game Developers Conference Twitch channel

445
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:12,389
watching a keynote at an in-game conference, and I think we're about to say we're a little

446
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:13,890
far down the rabbit hole right now.

447
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,772
There might be a little bit of GDC in this scene.

448
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:21,013
That's fine, that's fine.

449
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,193
It's art.

450
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,654
Art's the point about things.

451
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:24,454
Simon doesn't...

452
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:29,343
doesn't kill me, but there's a little bit of GDC in this.

453
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:35,825
I love it. Yeah, GDC I'll do I'll do a quick plug for if you

454
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:38,446
want to check out our show this year, the dates are up in the

455
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:41,347
top left corner of the screen and we hope to see you there.

456
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,788
The award show that Eliza will be is nominated for is on

457
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:48,109
Wednesday night, Wednesday the 18th. There, there's it. There's

458
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:51,630
my plug. That's how I counter you're putting GDC in the game.

459
00:36:51,972 --> 00:37:07,280
Okay, well this is also kind of a TED Talk as well, so it's not, I mean, you can see the very dramatic presentation here is kind of meant to evoke the feeling of like his sort of TED Talk like pageantry and pompousness.

460
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:14,424
I would goof on... I would keep goofing on that, but I might get in trouble.

461
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:18,126
You called them pompous, I didn't. I don't know if they get mad at us.

462
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:23,452
So, I mean, this character is Pompous, so I'm making a fu- uh, you know.

463
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:23,632
Yeah.

464
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:25,113
Um, this was fun-

465
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:26,073
Pompous people give talks.

466
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:27,053
That's- that's a thing.

467
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:28,133
Yes, it's true.

468
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,874
Um, I'm including myself in that.

469
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:37,815
Um, this was fun because I designed- like, I authored these, like, fake slides for him to have,

470
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:45,657
and then we kind of- the artist did a pass on, like, making them look especially, like, tech- techie and kind of, um-

471
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,857
Look at the triangles, man. Like-

472
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:48,794
Yeah.

473
00:37:48,874 --> 00:37:50,656
Look at all these triangles your artist did.

474
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:52,098
That's what really makes it picky.

475
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:53,299
And like the green glow.

476
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:55,161
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

477
00:37:57,569 --> 00:38:01,072
I can keep riffing on that.

478
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:04,754
Let's talk about planning and producing this kind of game.

479
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:09,398
Obviously you're the lead, you're the writer, you get to say like, you get to have a lot

480
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:12,841
of creative control over this thing and you sort of get to say what's possible and what's

481
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:13,101
not.

482
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:18,385
Obviously with a script that you were working from, that sort of makes it different than

483
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:19,806
how other narrative games get written.

484
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:22,188
But there is still a factor when you're making a game like this.

485
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:24,829
Okay, we're producing this much content, it takes this much time,

486
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:28,511
we can budget for this much, we have to scale for it going over by game much,

487
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:30,752
if something's not working, if we get stuck somewhere.

488
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:35,554
How do producing challenges sort of intersect with your creative vision?

489
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:36,415
That's what I'd like to know.

490
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:42,217
I think for this it was just a matter of like really keeping a lid on

491
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:46,560
on the number of assets that we made.

492
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:52,287
And I tried to be really careful of that and keep that in mind when I was writing the script.

493
00:38:54,668 --> 00:39:01,091
Characters and locations, everything is pretty stripped down to what absolutely has to be there,

494
00:39:01,771 --> 00:39:07,193
because the only way we would have made this is as frugally as possible.

495
00:39:08,574 --> 00:39:16,037
So when I introduced a background or a character, it was always with

496
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:21,369
There's always a very specific purpose that that exists for.

497
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:30,657
And the stuff that we did that was a little bit bonus or extra was the Solitaire game,

498
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:37,522
the little meditation app that you have with the pixel art on your phone.

499
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:44,568
Those were little bonus things that we might have cut if we had run overboard on some of this other stuff.

500
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:52,567
But luckily, we went in, the script was basically done, the entire script for the game was kind

501
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:58,389
of at a rough draft point when we started bringing on the artists and actually putting

502
00:39:58,409 --> 00:39:59,329
the game into production.

503
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:04,410
So when we started, it was like, okay, we know we'll need exactly this amount of stuff.

504
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:09,672
Because the script was not open-ended, like, I don't know how I'm going to end this.

505
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:12,973
And oh, wait, I need new assets in order to do this.

506
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:13,353
So...

507
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:21,620
It was actually, from a production standpoint, it was actually quite under control the whole

508
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:21,940
time.

509
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,441
But that's not always possible.

510
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:33,086
I think we really benefited from having basically a finished script and having this saying right

511
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:36,628
off the bat that it's going to be a visual novel and not necessarily...

512
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:40,607
mechanically innovating in any particular way.

513
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:41,128
Right.

514
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,789
Like I wouldn't say that this game is mechanically innovative.

515
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:50,852
It's not really doing any like things that any other given game hasn't done before.

516
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:54,334
If it innovates in any way, it's in its content.

517
00:40:55,866 --> 00:40:58,047
Yeah, that's so interesting. That's such a tough...

518
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:02,848
I feel for game developers because part of the push for any game is

519
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:07,549
you're trying to make something that can find appeal, that can find an audience.

520
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:10,830
One very quick way is to say we're innovating your gameplay,

521
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,611
you're going to play something you haven't played before.

522
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:16,912
And that's still true. And when you say you're going to play something you haven't played before with Eliza,

523
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,132
that's still true in that...

524
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:24,976
This unique story hasn't existed before, especially not in mainstream games.

525
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:32,801
But sometimes it's a harder sell for an audience, especially when unfortunately discourse or dialogue about narrative in games can sometimes go,

526
00:41:32,901 --> 00:41:35,942
Oh, well this could have just been a book. I don't think it lies it could have been a book.

527
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:45,548
I don't think so either, although definitely some people have criticized it for not being mechanically innovative.

528
00:41:45,988 --> 00:41:47,429
It's it doesn't.

529
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:52,277
It doesn't give you any fancy new reverbs to play with.

530
00:41:53,217 --> 00:42:04,520
And so I can see that if your interest is in narrative games for the purpose of creating this cool new way of interacting and stuff like that,

531
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,660
then this Eliza might not seem very impressive.

532
00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:14,762
But my hope is that people can focus on the content and think about the themes of the story and think about the characters.

533
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:17,628
and enjoy it on that level.

534
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,523
Mouse over the text or mouse over things in the scene, interesting things will happen.

535
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:41,866
That may, that one may even go back to the classic adventure game format where, like,

536
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:45,148
if this scene was sort of presented without the text scrolling by, you could mouse over

537
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:48,309
and then maybe one of these, like, heads would pop up and do a weird thing or something.

538
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,290
Right, right.

539
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,632
But that's like, man, an educational game in the day, in the day you see that.

540
00:42:52,852 --> 00:42:53,112
Right.

541
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:54,513
The, but, um...

542
00:42:55,273 --> 00:43:03,716
You've got the folks who were working on Tyranny, you've got Disco Elysium, like making it so that when you mouse over things, other interesting things happen.

543
00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:11,378
And the thing is, I know you know how to do that, because I played The Writer Will Do Something, which was you and Tom Bissell.

544
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:14,358
And that was such a cool, like...

545
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:19,180
Interactive experiment that is also the kind of work that has been done by a lot of great works authors entwined

546
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,662
Shout out to friends of the show like Chris Legman who get to do stuff like that in their work. Totally

547
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:30,284
So what was your thought process about like it's weird to say why is this feature not in the game when we just talked about

548
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:31,505
not innovating on features

549
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:33,145
right, but

550
00:43:33,706 --> 00:43:38,427
I might as well ask like what are your thoughts about like that kind of those kind of mechanics? Sure

551
00:43:38,928 --> 00:43:43,069
I think you know, I mean, I love those kinds of mechanics and I would say that like

552
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:48,241
If it's not in Eliza, it just didn't feel right for the type of story that it is.

553
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:54,946
The limited amount of looking around an environment that you can do in Eliza, every so often you

554
00:43:54,966 --> 00:44:01,550
get the scene where you can look at your apartment or you can look at the office and Evelyn has

555
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,752
a little line about the coffee maker in the office and things like that.

556
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:07,273
Those are these little...

557
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,703
very, you know, extremely light exploration moments with no stakes and completely optional.

558
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:21,569
I think my answer is just that, like, that's just, it's just not the type of game that I think

559
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:28,515
really supports that. I think the delight of, like, those edutainment games, you remember the

560
00:44:28,555 --> 00:44:32,678
word edutainment that people used back then? That was my first book for Gama Sutra was about

561
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:35,901
edutainment. Oh my god. So, you know, like that.

562
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:41,486
like when you click on something and a fun little animation plays or something like that

563
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,348
it's just not that, it's not really that type of game

564
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:49,631
it's not going to reward you just clicking around on stuff

565
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:52,713
because it's, you know, when you're

566
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:57,776
when you are attending a conference about mental health

567
00:44:57,856 --> 00:45:01,758
applications and watching someone's keynote speech and then running into your old boss

568
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:04,940
in the lobby as you are now

569
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:09,337
That kind of fun exploration stuff isn't really on your mind, right?

570
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,672
So I would say it just comes from the story and being embodied in that place.

571
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:25,966
um, let me see here, just clicking around my email, my work email, man this contractor parking is so...

572
00:45:26,987 --> 00:45:31,450
I worked, the job I worked at before I worked at this job we didn't, I didn't get parking when I first got there

573
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:37,595
so it's like, yeah, you're just gonna need to find street parking and in Los Angeles it's like, you know it's a challenge

574
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:38,695
It's a challenge

575
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:40,357
It's all, it's not the worst

576
00:45:40,817 --> 00:45:41,197
Not New York

577
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:42,918
No, but you know, it's all, a lot of that like

578
00:45:43,906 --> 00:45:51,008
It's funny because, as you have learned in the story by now, Avalyn used to be a full-time employee of Skanda.

579
00:45:51,488 --> 00:45:59,890
And so coming back as a contractor, she's like, kind of encountering all of this stuff that contractors actually face.

580
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,011
And it's a contrast from her previous, you know, experience at Skanda.

581
00:46:05,571 --> 00:46:10,912
And I kind of wanted to do that whole, like, blue badge versus orange badge thing.

582
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:16,428
Which is a thing, I mean that's not even just a tech industry thing, that's a game industry thing too.

583
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,509
It is, yeah.

584
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:23,012
I hope I don't get you in trouble right now because I stumbled on, geez it,

585
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:26,714
I stumbled on something when I was looking at screenshots for this game that made me pause and ask.

586
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:33,878
So our friend here is wearing the logo of a popular football team, American football.

587
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:36,860
I assume you had to get clearances for that or is this artistic interpretation?

588
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:39,005
This is an artistic interpretation.

589
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:41,587
Artistic interpretation, there we go. I was curious if that was a...

590
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:48,330
Like, making things real life in games is sometimes hard because it's so hard to recreate the branded worlds we live in.

591
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:55,234
This is... I'll just say it, that is absolutely a calculated risk that we decided to take.

592
00:46:57,015 --> 00:47:00,896
We thought about it, and usually game makers are very, very skittish about this.

593
00:47:02,377 --> 00:47:07,240
They don't want anything at all in any kind of capacity to possibly show up.

594
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:15,785
But, you know, I thought that by setting things in Seattle and making it realistic, you know,

595
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:18,746
why not have some real stuff in there?

596
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:23,689
And we thought, we were just like, you know, it makes sense.

597
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:31,492
And I think that there is a case to be made that this is allowable, right?

598
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:35,494
So it's like kind of making a stand a little bit.

599
00:47:36,672 --> 00:47:40,234
making a statement and saying we think that games are...

600
00:47:40,254 --> 00:47:45,096
you know, the defense for artistic interpretation is games are like art, right?

601
00:47:45,136 --> 00:47:47,058
So they should be able to do things like this.

602
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:47,578
Yeah.

603
00:47:48,258 --> 00:47:53,441
And I know, obviously, like a lot of TV show would go ahead and get clearances on this thing.

604
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:58,144
Certainly independent art, a lot of times also skirts the risk of... skirts the lines on this kind of thing.

605
00:47:58,184 --> 00:48:01,306
Often for the same reason, for naturalism, for...

606
00:48:01,606 --> 00:48:03,547
These are the clothes people wear. These are things that people...

607
00:48:03,687 --> 00:48:06,288
This is how people look. You can't just hide that behind legal stuff.

608
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:18,151
Right, right. So yeah, this is kind of like our small, you know, our small flag that we're planting and saying that we think that this should be allowable.

609
00:48:19,211 --> 00:48:19,872
Yeah, I admire it.

610
00:48:19,892 --> 00:48:25,173
We have come to the end of our time here with Matthew. If you folks have questions, feel free to toss them in chat.

611
00:48:25,373 --> 00:48:32,056
It's been a little quieter today, but I don't mind. I've really enjoyed just getting to talk and I've enjoyed having you folks listen.

612
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:39,679
For my part, I will go ahead and ask Matthew...

613
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,641
Oh yeah, here's one. Visual novels are...

614
00:48:43,441 --> 00:48:46,222
The visual novel style is actually a little more familiar than folks may know.

615
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:48,944
If they play games like Fire Emblem, if you play other Zachtronics games,

616
00:48:49,924 --> 00:48:52,786
its elements pop up there, you know, the talking head and the scrolling text.

617
00:48:53,726 --> 00:49:00,411
And depending on how high the budget for the game is, you may have different animations that accompany those,

618
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:04,614
like either fully animated or just jumping from pose to pose.

619
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:10,879
Obviously, having now played more of Eliza, I realize this is sort of one face per conversation,

620
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,161
which seems quite economical.

621
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:14,942
What were your thoughts about that?

622
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:18,484
What were your thoughts on making the most of a limited asset palette,

623
00:49:19,105 --> 00:49:20,586
which is something that visual novels do so well?

624
00:49:21,398 --> 00:49:29,163
Yeah, so I was hoping that it would work this way. I think it does work. I think that the

625
00:49:29,223 --> 00:49:36,968
actual still expressions that the artists drew and painted are actually very, very expressive,

626
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:41,791
like Gabriel's face right here that you're looking at right now. I think it's actually a

627
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:47,955
very expressive face and has a lot of emotion to it already. And if he was switching between faces

628
00:49:47,995 --> 00:49:50,857
a lot as you spoke to him, I think...

629
00:49:51,678 --> 00:49:57,642
Combined with this semi-realistic art style, it would bring more attention to the fact

630
00:49:57,682 --> 00:50:02,645
that it's not animated, and then he's switching faces and things like that.

631
00:50:04,386 --> 00:50:10,710
This was another aesthetic decision, as well as a production decision, that went hand-in-hand,

632
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:14,353
which is that I think that these very nice, expressive...

633
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,004
Portraits are enough on their own, you know, and combined with the amazing voice acting

634
00:50:21,024 --> 00:50:27,808
that the actors provided, I think makes these characters very rich without needing to give

635
00:50:27,848 --> 00:50:31,050
them facial expressions that actually change.

636
00:50:32,648 --> 00:50:35,429
That's a nice transition for us to talk about the voice acting.

637
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:45,953
I'm really curious what kind of approach you brought as the person in charge of the story to go into the recording booth and hear your dialogue.

638
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:48,053
What was your process for working with the actors here?

639
00:50:49,534 --> 00:50:57,757
So the biggest thing that I told every actor was that naturalism was the most important thing.

640
00:50:58,637 --> 00:51:01,978
That all of these people that we're speaking to are real people.

641
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:10,795
And that it's just important for, like, if they read something and it doesn't feel right,

642
00:51:11,555 --> 00:51:15,797
that they can try to, like, say what comes to mind.

643
00:51:15,857 --> 00:51:21,699
Like, you know, contract things or run two sentences together that are listed as separate

644
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:22,639
lines in the script.

645
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:31,162
Or throw in pauses, throw in you knows, things like that, to try to make the dialogue just

646
00:51:31,202 --> 00:51:32,602
feel like people actually talking.

647
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:41,572
It turns out video game voice actors don't get to do that as much as maybe other types

648
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:46,275
of actors because a lot of video game voice acting is you must say the exact line and

649
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:49,857
you have to stop between each line.

650
00:51:49,897 --> 00:51:53,320
There's a lot of parameters and that's not to say that that's bad, it's just because

651
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,520
of the way the game works.

652
00:51:54,961 --> 00:52:00,605
They have to stick to a very regimented way of saying things.

653
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:10,451
Being given the freedom to open up a little bit, I think they really responded to it and gave some

654
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:14,812
really amazing performances. And if they said something that was different from the script,

655
00:52:15,012 --> 00:52:20,315
or if they ad-libbed a little bit, or added things, or whatever, it was fine. I could just

656
00:52:20,355 --> 00:52:28,738
go back and change what the text says to match that. So it was a great process because you feel

657
00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:30,879
like you're creating the character with the actor.

658
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:35,112
and not just having an actor come in and say words and then leave.

659
00:52:35,932 --> 00:52:41,917
And that, I think, if the voice acting ended up working well, I think it's partially because

660
00:52:41,937 --> 00:52:42,258
of that.

661
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:47,882
It's like including them in the process of creating that character and giving them, you

662
00:52:47,902 --> 00:52:52,706
know, making them feel like they have the space to really go places and really explore

663
00:52:52,746 --> 00:52:53,007
things.

664
00:52:55,338 --> 00:53:00,319
Okay, with that, we're coming to the end of our hour here, and I think Matthew's got to go back to...

665
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:04,020
You know, Eliza's done. There's other games that got to get made out there in the world.

666
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:10,582
We're gonna quietly wind things down here on the GDC Twitch channel.

667
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:14,303
Thank you all for watching today, thank you for playing Eliza with us.

668
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:18,065
This game is nominated for the 2020 IGF Awards.

669
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:22,686
You will be able to watch the awards ceremony here on the GDC Twitch channel.

670
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,346
Again, that is on Wednesday the 18th.

671
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,671
Next month, which is coming up real soon.

672
00:53:27,711 --> 00:53:30,732
You keep saying next month in February and suddenly it's a few days away.

673
00:53:31,032 --> 00:53:33,552
Because even though it's leap year, it's still, you know, like,

674
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:36,133
there's a couple of less days you get to work with.

675
00:53:36,953 --> 00:53:41,894
If you are attending GDC, you will be able to watch the awards yourself.

676
00:53:41,974 --> 00:53:46,555
If you just drop by West Hall Lower Level, you will see all the signage to get in there.

677
00:53:46,615 --> 00:53:49,376
Just sit there and watch and hopefully Eliza wins something.

678
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:52,336
But if it doesn't, another great game is going to win because all the nominees are great.

679
00:53:54,057 --> 00:54:02,320
And on top of that, I would like to recommend that if you're going to the show, you can check out Eliza at the IGF Pavilion.

680
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,642
I don't remember exactly where that will be on the show floor this year because things move around a little.

681
00:54:07,082 --> 00:54:11,404
But if you wander the show floor, you will find it. You'll be able to check out the game for yourself.

682
00:54:11,884 --> 00:54:14,245
And hey, maybe you'll decide to pick it up and play it.

683
00:54:15,526 --> 00:54:21,370
With that, Matthew, I think we ask this question every time we wrap up, but just in case, where

684
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,392
can they find you if they have more questions about Eliza?

685
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:32,839
You can find me on Twitter at Matthew Seiji, Matthew S-E-I-J-I, and my website is also

686
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:38,163
MatthewSeiji.com, and you can go there and see my other work, my short stories, and you

687
00:54:38,203 --> 00:54:39,704
can contact me either way.

688
00:54:40,084 --> 00:54:42,206
His profile picture is of a wonderful cat.

689
00:54:42,606 --> 00:54:43,206
It's your cat, right?

690
00:54:43,795 --> 00:54:47,078
Yes, yeah. My Twitter profile is a picture of my cat.

691
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:50,382
You get really nervous when you're live, like saying things that are definitive,

692
00:54:50,422 --> 00:54:52,665
because you feel like you're going to be held accountable for that later,

693
00:54:52,705 --> 00:54:54,527
and that must be really onerous as a guest.

694
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:56,389
But let me tell you, as I'm trying to host these things,

695
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,612
making definitive statements just feels like,

696
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:00,814
oh, is someone going to come back and sue me?

697
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:02,496
I don't know why I'm Scottish all of a sudden.

698
00:55:03,398 --> 00:55:04,118
I don't know why.

699
00:55:04,178 --> 00:55:08,001
They're going to sue you for saying that their profile was their cat?

700
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:11,683
They're going to go, excuse me, that was not my cat, it was my friend's cat.

701
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:12,744
Oh, I see.

702
00:55:12,804 --> 00:55:15,205
He got a little bit of a last year.

703
00:55:15,265 --> 00:55:16,026
Oh, I see, I see.

704
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:16,486
It's my cat.

705
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:19,848
I don't know if that's just a normal hosting problem or if that's just my own anxiety,

706
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:21,709
but you know what I won't do if I have anxiety?

707
00:55:21,769 --> 00:55:24,311
I'm not going to use the therapy app for myself.

708
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,092
Alright, that's wandering into territory I should say for Off's channel.

709
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:28,834
But, have a good day everyone.

710
00:55:28,854 --> 00:55:29,154
Bye!

711
00:55:29,214 --> 00:55:29,574
Bye.
