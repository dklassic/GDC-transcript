1
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:05,736
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:07,057
Hey, everybody.

3
00:00:07,317 --> 00:00:10,500
My name is Ethan Levy, and I'm here to present Legendary Game

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,042
of Heroes, five lessons from 12 months of LiveOps growth.

5
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:17,285
And actually, between the time I put this presentation

6
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:20,387
together and now, we've had an additional four

7
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:21,528
months being live.

8
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:23,910
So it's actually the top five lessons from 16 months.

9
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,760
A little bit about me. I've spent 14 years working game development, worked on over 50

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,762
shit titles across console, PC, mobile, mostly in the free-to-play space, mostly some interaction

11
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:43,423
of design and monetization. For the past two years, I've had the pleasure of working on

12
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:48,324
this game as part of Network, a legendary game of heroes. If you haven't played Legendary,

13
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:53,905
I think it could be quickly summed up as Puzzle & Dragons westernized.

14
00:00:56,017 --> 00:01:03,003
So today I'm going to talk about, over the past 16 months as we've been in players' hands,

15
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:07,487
I think I personally and the team have learned a lot, and we've grown a lot, and I want to

16
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:11,311
kind of summarize some of the top things I've learned over this period of time.

17
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:17,737
Just to give you a feeling for what we're talking about, this chart shows ARPDAU growth

18
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:18,698
over the course of 2016.

19
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,720
This is, each data point is a 30 day proceeding average.

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,322
So I didn't just want to talk about peaks and valleys,

21
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:29,743
but actually numbers that represent really sustained

22
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:33,185
ARPDAU or player engagement metrics.

23
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:35,866
So this is our growth over the course of 2016

24
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:37,707
in terms of ARPDAU.

25
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:38,668
And you can see in the middle,

26
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:40,889
a big kind of baseline resetting

27
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,090
as we hit a worldwide launch.

28
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:48,351
And similarly, it's not just about how much each player spends,

29
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:51,655
but it's about how much time each player spends in the game,

30
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:58,302
and our engagement time per day for your average player has also grown.

31
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:06,566
Looking just at that 2016 period, we have increased 652% in terms of our ARPDAU and

32
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:12,729
136% in terms of minutes per day spent, and that's if you're looking at a 30-day average.

33
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:19,032
So that's, I'm not just giving you like our worst technical issues to our peak sale day.

34
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,793
That's a 30-day average for each one of those.

35
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:27,456
This growth has really enabled remarkable results on the iOS.

36
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:34,390
store. We've been top 100 in 63 countries, 49 countries on Android. We've gone top 10

37
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:40,779
in 18 countries on iOS. And we've done this all with a team of 15 people.

38
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:50,837
Today, I'm going to be talking primarily about feature development and the lessons learned

39
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:51,738
from feature development.

40
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:56,581
And the reason I'm focusing on that is because that's where I spend the vast majority of

41
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:57,101
my time.

42
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:02,605
But it's really important to note that features alone don't produce results like these, right?

43
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:08,830
As I said, we've got about 15 or 16 full-time people on the team,

44
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,652
a bunch of shared studio resources,

45
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,494
and just world-class people in every one of these pillars.

46
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:17,558
And it's taken a blend of live operations, UA and business intelligence,

47
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:19,139
feature development, player support.

48
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,222
All held up by a strong studio operations staff,

49
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:25,923
and all held up by a world-class studio culture.

50
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:29,105
And so I'm here talking about features

51
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,646
and the impact of features on growth,

52
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:33,888
but this game is a complex ecosystem,

53
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:36,309
and all mobile games like this are a complex ecosystem.

54
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,130
And it's not just one thing.

55
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,052
It's the full team and the full studio's effort

56
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:40,972
that I'm talking about today.

57
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,332
So as I said, it's really world class execution

58
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:46,636
across all these pillars that have empowered our LiveOps

59
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:46,916
growth.

60
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:51,403
So with that, let's talk about the top five lessons

61
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,486
I've taken away when reflecting on this period.

62
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:56,430
Number one, focus on inflection.

63
00:03:57,647 --> 00:04:03,049
So if you look at this, this is a list of all of our major updates over the course of

64
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:03,489
the year.

65
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,731
I left out some small point releases that are just bug fixes.

66
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:15,013
And they range from, you know, you can see our soft launch in early November of 2015,

67
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:18,395
up to Commander Skill, which we're actually releasing this week.

68
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:23,477
And by about 6 or 7 on Tuesday, we'll be able to know how well players are receiving our

69
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,097
new Commander Skill with the Crusade event.

70
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:34,595
So, I've taken the ARPDAU chart and I've broken it up, each color, by kind of the period of

71
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,015
the major feature release.

72
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:42,196
And so this is why I used those 30-day preceding averages so that you could see on each day

73
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,277
for the next 30 days what the average are.

74
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:50,218
Because I was really interested in the trends and in spotting where things change.

75
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,601
And as you can see, there's a giant baseline reset

76
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:55,922
when we go worldwide.

77
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,044
And that's because we're looking at per player metrics.

78
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:03,126
And when we went worldwide, we got an influx of feature player

79
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:06,748
thanks to features from our friends at Apple and Google.

80
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:08,189
We were very lucky to have that.

81
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,011
And we also started scaling our user acquisition.

82
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:12,832
And so once we started scaling up our players,

83
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,293
there was a baseline reset.

84
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,771
So for right now, I'm going to zoom in on that soft launch

85
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:19,252
period.

86
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:25,715
And that first month in January is pulling in a lot of days

87
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,877
where there was not a lot of people.

88
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:30,979
So really starting on February through worldwide launches

89
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,479
where I feel like these numbers are really

90
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,280
valuable to look at.

91
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:37,783
So I said my number one, my top lesson was to focus on inflection.

92
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:38,683
What am I talking about?

93
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:43,926
So you can see with our 1.2 release, we built the support for events.

94
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,988
But we didn't yet have leaderboards on those events.

95
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,509
And so we were missing the competition angle of it.

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,591
And we didn't actually start running events.

97
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,692
We kind of laid the baseline with our 1.2.

98
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:54,893
And you can see.

99
00:05:57,886 --> 00:06:01,507
That first trend line is showing where ARPDAU was heading on 1.2.

100
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:05,429
And then as soon as we turned on leaderboards, turned on competition,

101
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,470
and started running events on a weekly basis,

102
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:12,033
you can see the inflection in our ARPDAU that that caused.

103
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:17,712
So when I look at this 16 months worth of updates,

104
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:19,453
I look at four releases.

105
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,113
And I think these really had immediate, measurable

106
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:24,694
inflections.

107
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:28,475
Leaderboards and turning on weekly events,

108
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,955
our Raid Boss event harness, which

109
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:34,756
was a new type of event we released in May of last year,

110
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,197
optimization on the Android platform.

111
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:37,877
and

112
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,138
each one had a positive impact, but it wasn't that really satisfying level up.

113
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:02,571
So, you know, why am I making the differentiation?

114
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:06,595
Well, obviously, if I focus on feature development,

115
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:08,618
I feel like each time you release a new update,

116
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,660
it's kind of your turn at the bat,

117
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,663
and really, I'd love to hit a home run every time I'm up there.

118
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,906
And where our home runs came from was adapting and innovating

119
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:18,808
on best practices from the marketplace.

120
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,101
But we hit plenty of base hits along the way.

121
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,122
And those base hits, I would say,

122
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:26,443
were either bundles of smaller features

123
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:31,545
that didn't tie together into a cohesive whole immediately,

124
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:33,726
or something I've started calling bank shots.

125
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:35,847
So what do I mean by a bank shot?

126
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:41,170
I mean, when you're trying to inflect a specific metric,

127
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,731
or you're trying to motivate a specific behavior,

128
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,892
but the way your feature gets there isn't a direct line.

129
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,593
It's more like, oh, if I hit off this wall and off this wall,

130
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,734
then this is what the player will do.

131
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:56,776
So to give you a really tangible example, late last year we released a Guild Wars feature

132
00:07:57,396 --> 00:08:01,557
and it had a couple different motivations and one of the motivations was to increase

133
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:02,858
the appetite for heroes.

134
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:08,740
In our game, you bring five heroes with you into each round of combat.

135
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,364
And you really, during the course of the week, probably only need five great heroes for that event

136
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:18,586
until you go to the next event when you need another five heroes.

137
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:22,829
And most of those heroes might be the same, or now that we're running different event types,

138
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:24,270
the same as you did two weeks ago.

139
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:25,191
And so...

140
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:34,074
We released this Guild War feature where it was the first chance that one player has to attack another in the game.

141
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,895
And we released skills and counter skills.

142
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:40,657
So there was interplay between one player's attacking deck and one player's defending deck.

143
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:43,078
And that was five attackers and five defenders.

144
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:47,861
And part of the idea was that we would increase the appetite for rare...

145
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:48,681
a

146
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:52,282
wish that if we had won to increase our appetite for heroes we had done it by delivering a game

147
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:53,682
mode that required more heroes.

148
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:15,673
If we want to make it that you need more than five six-star heroes,

149
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:19,499
then we should make a game mode that requires 36 star heroes at the highest

150
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,921
levels of competition, something like that.

151
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:24,487
That, to me, is a much more direct attempt at it.

152
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:30,680
Anyways, so the lesson here, as I said, is before committing to an update, ask yourself,

153
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,803
is this going to directly inflect our business?

154
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:36,527
And I think it's kind of a tough question to ask.

155
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:42,313
We had what I think was a very successful moment late last year when we started going

156
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:46,637
down the path for a feature that was called World Boss.

157
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:49,838
And in the room, when we decided to pursue World Boss,

158
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:52,799
part of its appeal was it seemed like a low-effort feature

159
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,320
that we could get out fairly quickly that

160
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,000
would have a nice inflection.

161
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,180
And so we started designing this feature.

162
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,001
We got it to what I would call about 60% resolution.

163
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:02,882
We started reviewing it.

164
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:05,922
And it seemed like, in order to really make

165
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:08,503
it a feature that was up to our standards of greatness,

166
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:10,403
it would be much better.

167
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:14,085
More meaningfully effortful than we initially anticipated.

168
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:17,587
And when we looked at the amount of effort it would take to get World Boss out,

169
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:21,650
and the amount of effort some of the other things we thought would be more impactful out, we said,

170
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,752
well, let's stop developing World Boss and choose one of those things and work on that instead.

171
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:30,134
And even though that meant throwing out a significant amount of design work

172
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:35,217
and potentially even causing some inefficiencies in the development and release of new features,

173
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:36,178
I think it was worth it.

174
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:37,338
I think we made the right...

175
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:43,469
choice by choosing to focus on something that we believed in could be inflective relative

176
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:44,790
to the amount of effort we were putting in.

177
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,973
Second lesson, build for your bandwidth.

178
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:52,757
So all teams have bottlenecks, and when I look at kind of the middle period of 2016,

179
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:56,199
one of ours was building game data.

180
00:10:57,943 --> 00:11:05,869
As I said, there are a couple features that I look at, and I feel like we made immediate measurable inflections in our software.

181
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,714
And then there are a lot of things that I look at and I say, well, we put great tools in the toolbox.

182
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:13,916
And some of those we're still pulling out and using today, right?

183
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:20,820
Nothing, everything that we have done has been useful over a period of time and helped us

184
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,363
increase how much fun events are for players, make the software better, make more revenue

185
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:26,903
per player.

186
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:34,927
But, I think there's a period where it felt like we were building more tools than we could

187
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,108
use at their full potential.

188
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:40,130
And that was because we had a really turbo-charged, world-class engineering team.

189
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:47,015
Not enough manpower on the PM front for the amount of tools that we were building to use them effectively.

190
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:53,259
Let me give you two examples. One example is an early feature that was ally missions.

191
00:11:53,340 --> 00:12:01,106
The design intention was it was a really low effort feature where we wanted to increase session frequency by giving a snackable timer-based mission.

192
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:06,189
The inspiration point was missions that you'd be familiar with from Mobile Strike or Game of War.

193
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:11,934
At the time, this failing I can take ownership of.

194
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:12,935
This is my failing.

195
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,317
When I set it up, I set it up with no loss aversion.

196
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,959
And when I look at what works well in those missions

197
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,621
in Mobile Strike is if you don't come back every six hours

198
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,323
and collect all your timers, you've lost resources.

199
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:26,585
But the way I set these up was that there

200
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:27,646
was no loss aversion.

201
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:29,467
Once you get past a certain rank,

202
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,269
there are always four ally missions available for you.

203
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,811
And so there's no part of you that says,

204
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:36,632
I have to come back to the game.

205
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:41,459
to set one of my allies on this ally mission and when that 15 minute timer's up I better

206
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:42,620
come back to set the next one.

207
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:48,008
Instead, they're always available, the rewards are fairly consistent and not that great and

208
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:52,013
you can look at it and go, once you're a high level player and just sort of forget about

209
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,215
this whole section of the game.

210
00:12:54,188 --> 00:13:00,952
And so this feature hasn't had a retune, I think, since it's launched.

211
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:05,894
We use allies and other ally missions as part of our weekly events, so as I said, they're

212
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:07,335
a valuable tool in the toolbox.

213
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:14,239
But at no point have we put the effort towards going back and raising up the level of what

214
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:19,762
these do, and it's not really clear to me that that effort would be paid off relative

215
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:22,504
to putting that same amount of effort in another area of the game.

216
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:29,912
Another example would be the enemy skill system that we first released, I think, in 1.2 or 1.3, kind of early on.

217
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:36,059
Our design intention was to increase intention by adding progression novelty to the campaign.

218
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,046
And, you know, our game is like a Candy Crush match game below with an RPG mechanic on top.

219
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:44,227
with a bunch of heroes with stats and skills.

220
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:50,972
And part of the intention here was that your enemies would drop gems on the board below

221
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:55,496
that would add a little bit of skill play in and change things up and make levels more exciting.

222
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:59,138
We could use it to make the campaign more exciting, events more exciting, etc.

223
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,202
When we first implemented enemy skills, we put it in one section of the game,

224
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:05,483
which was the daily dungeons.

225
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,145
And it really took a long time until...

226
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:15,188
Those enemy skills and the skill system in general start to bubble up and play a meaningful

227
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,869
role outside of that initial use.

228
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:24,371
And again, I look at that as our bottleneck on design and data creation, right?

229
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:30,332
We had to be very tactical every day about what the PMs are doing to level up the software.

230
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:31,153
And so...

231
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,254
We have things where I feel like we just didn't use the tools to the full potential.

232
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:42,897
But now, I mean, we made those investments

233
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:47,539
and in the past two weeks, one of our new and very talented team members

234
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:52,661
has been pumping out unique battle skills and enemy skills for our event characters

235
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,261
that I think like finally...

236
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm going to make this part of the game shine and where I've had some of the most fun in

237
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,138
our events recently with our characters because they're starting to feel unique.

238
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:04,022
So over time that investment has paid off.

239
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:09,771
But when I look at that period of time, what I think the

240
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,572
lesson is, is to adjust your output to

241
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:12,653
match your capabilities.

242
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,036
Given the mismatch we had in terms of how much could be

243
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:19,437
accomplished between this world-class engineering team

244
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:24,100
and not quite enough PMs, I wish we had done more better.

245
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,403
I think we could have made even more inflection than we

246
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:31,225
made by investing in fewer features and bringing them out

247
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:33,667
either at higher quality or bringing them out at a faster

248
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:34,067
cadence.

249
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:40,973
And again, that's one of those great lessons you can see with a lot of clarity in hindsight.

250
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:47,789
Lesson number three, live ops events are the heart of your game.

251
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,512
I joined the legendary team, I think it would be kind of on the tail end of pre-production,

252
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,053
at the beginning of production.

253
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,795
We didn't have clearly defined milestones,

254
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:02,938
but I think getting to version 0.9 was like, we're building the base game,

255
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:08,061
and then that year of growth was like, we're building the events on top of the base game.

256
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,142
We're building the event structure on top of it.

257
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:15,265
And I think that the key lesson I've really taken away

258
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,827
is that live ops, live op events,

259
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,968
are the core of your game when you're

260
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:22,129
focused on this sort of game.

261
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,751
And there is no separate other base game.

262
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:26,392
And I wish we had just started there.

263
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:31,015
So this is a slide I already showed.

264
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:33,478
This is showing the inflection point

265
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:37,524
when we just started releasing, started and released

266
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:40,328
our first event that was driven by leaderboards.

267
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,291
We saw an immediate inflection.

268
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,431
And ever since that point, we've run one event every week

269
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:52,833
up till we have an event ending tomorrow at 5.

270
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:58,035
Our weekly events pull on a core LiveOps suite.

271
00:16:58,155 --> 00:17:00,236
As I said, everything contributes to our events.

272
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:03,257
But kind of the core of it are our two harnesses,

273
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:06,079
which are our special dungeon and our raid boss harness.

274
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,501
And actually next week, we're leaning into an older part of the software,

275
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:13,483
the activity map, and combining it with the raid boss harness

276
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:14,763
to make even a new event type.

277
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,285
But you've got your event harnesses,

278
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,446
the leaderboards that drive competition.

279
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,187
Initially it was just solo competition.

280
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:23,808
Now it's solo competition,

281
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:26,050
an additional global leaderboard for top players,

282
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,130
and a guild leaderboard.

283
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:28,945
all within an event.

284
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,426
We've got a pop-up system that plays a critical role

285
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:33,167
in the game.

286
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,768
And we've got guilds and localization.

287
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:39,410
Every event, we time it, the execution of it,

288
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,692
so that all the text is localized in the key countries

289
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:46,014
that we localize in, which was a fun moment of LiveOps growth,

290
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:48,235
getting things together early enough

291
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,236
to get everything localized.

292
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,217
But that's kind of the core of our LiveOps suite.

293
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:54,299
So what does that mean when I say we run an event each week?

294
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:54,459
Well.

295
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,760
We have some form of limited time content, which

296
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,321
is a special dungeon, an area where you fight special raid

297
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:04,022
bosses, which have unique rules relative to the base campaign

298
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:04,262
game.

299
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:06,383
And now with these Crusader events,

300
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:08,283
we're experimenting with using the campaign map

301
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:11,625
to be part of that limited time content.

302
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:14,345
So those levels are there, those bosses are there,

303
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,766
and when the event turns off, they're gone.

304
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:19,267
Every week, there's at least one new event boss.

305
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:23,308
I snapped screenshots from our Phantom of the Opera event,

306
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:24,269
because I think it was.

307
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:31,494
One of my favorite examples of giving the art team something that's not immediately obvious in a puzzle RPG,

308
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:36,037
and I think they really executed it at an amazing level. I really enjoy these characters.

309
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:42,026
Limited time content, brand new boss, competition on a leaderboard.

310
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:48,788
As I said, we've grown over time from having, you know, even out of the gate we had segmented

311
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:55,271
league-based leaderboards, but now we have a solo leaderboard, a separate global leaderboard

312
00:18:55,331 --> 00:19:00,913
that if you're in one of the top positions in the game you get both solo and global leaderboard

313
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,674
results, and guild leaderboards.

314
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:10,843
Each leaderboard gives rewards and that boss character is the exclusive, exciting reward

315
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,544
that you can get only from that event.

316
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:21,887
We also sell at least one new hero in a new card pack with each event and we use our pop-up

317
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:26,808
system, our event-driven pop-up system to run in-game marketing and in-game messaging

318
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:30,490
about what's new, what's exciting, what's valuable, decks you should build, etc.

319
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,495
That's kind of the core suite.

320
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:40,842
A slight addendum to rule three is that left unchanged, event performance will decay over

321
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:41,143
time.

322
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:42,444
Now what do I mean by that?

323
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:47,369
When we launched out of the gate, we just had dungeon events, and as I said, we were

324
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:49,151
in the road to soft launch.

325
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:51,172
We had a lot we needed to do.

326
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:53,933
From soft launch to worldwide launch, we had a lot we needed to do.

327
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:59,616
And so for a period of time, we were pretty much running the same dungeon event week after week after week.

328
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,356
That's all we had.

329
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:04,258
And over time, we saw players' interest naturally leveling off.

330
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:09,649
Until we released our second event harness,

331
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:12,070
our Raid Boss Harness, which really turned around the trend

332
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,792
there and allowed us to run two different events,

333
00:20:15,393 --> 00:20:18,956
Dungeon Raid Boss, Dungeon Raid Boss, back to back,

334
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,497
and so to keep things fresh.

335
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:24,079
On top of it, not only do we have two major categories

336
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,721
of events, but as I've been saying,

337
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,482
all these tools we put in the toolbox

338
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:31,625
we use to change up events, to improve their performance,

339
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:33,647
to make it clear for the player what's important.

340
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:34,407
So.

341
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,029
You know, in my first point I hit on immediate inflection

342
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,191
and trying to hit a home run every time.

343
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:43,793
If I look in that 1.2 and I look at pop-ups,

344
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:48,655
pop-ups at the time, just driving in-game marketing,

345
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:52,698
on its own might not have seemed like one of the most inflective things we've done in the game,

346
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,440
but over the time as we've leaned into that

347
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,822
and learned to use it better and really focused on our marketing messaging,

348
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:03,724
that has probably become one of the most impactful features we've added to the game.

349
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:07,705
And it was easy to look at it and go like, oh, we added

350
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:08,745
marketing pop-ups.

351
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:11,406
We can put images in front of players and text, hooray.

352
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:16,087
But it's actually like, over time, learning to use all of

353
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:18,968
those tools in the toolbox has driven this incredible growth

354
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,669
in terms of ARPDAU, or has been one of the main things

355
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:26,410
driving growth in terms of ARPDAU and player

356
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,250
engagement over time.

357
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:31,914
What I put up there, and this kind of hits to the point that,

358
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:35,817
you know, I'm focusing mainly on the impact of features,

359
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:39,581
but these changes in ARPDAU and player engagement

360
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:40,922
are not just about features.

361
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:42,363
It's a complex ecosystem.

362
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:44,085
And so you're getting a combination

363
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:46,847
of feature inflections, population, veterancy,

364
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:48,428
and event optimization.

365
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:51,831
So new things that change the way players behave in the game.

366
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:58,914
The metrics naturally changing as your player population grows over time, right?

367
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:05,955
If you have a successful free-to-play game, that means your veteran players are sticking around for a long period of time.

368
00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:10,936
And so as the mix of new players or early game players to veteran players changes,

369
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:16,838
your ARPDAU and daily engagement are naturally going to grow over time because your veteran players

370
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,358
are naturally the most engaged and tend to spend the most.

371
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,928
And so part of that's just the shift between those that's natural over the growth of the

372
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:28,836
game and part of it's intentional through feature growth and part of it is through event

373
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:29,458
optimization.

374
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:36,106
But as I said at the beginning, events with leaderboard competition and exclusive content

375
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:41,107
to buy and win are really at the heart of what I think a modern free-to-play mobile

376
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:41,507
game is.

377
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:48,288
And really, if this was day one of a new mobile game, a new free-to-play mobile game, this

378
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:51,749
would be one of the primary design considerations.

379
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,210
Lesson number four was to believe in the power of guilds.

380
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,610
I think if you look at the top 150 grossing games...

381
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:06,168
And you look in the mid-course section, you can see that there are a lot of games with

382
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,669
guilds where it's been really successful.

383
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:13,392
There are games with guilds where maybe it hasn't paid off, but I think going into this

384
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:18,934
game I had never operated a game with true guilds, and releasing it has, I think, been

385
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:22,876
one of the major inflections that the team has made during the course of this game's

386
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:23,796
live operations.

387
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:30,328
At its heart, guilds are a player can join a group of people.

388
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,949
They have a shared chat room where they can strategize.

389
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:35,290
They have a guild emblem now, which they didn't have it

390
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,630
launched, but they have a guild emblem

391
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,710
to symbolize who they are.

392
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:41,792
The leadership has some tools around setting

393
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:44,872
different ranks of players in the software in their guild.

394
00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:47,973
So you can promote some people to the council

395
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,854
or give them the title of dukes and duchesses to just.

396
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,756
show how they're doing in the guild.

397
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:55,657
So it's a chat room.

398
00:23:56,097 --> 00:23:58,579
The ability for the guild to compete as a unit

399
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,360
on a guild leaderboard during each event

400
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:05,043
and the ability for players in the guild to earn special gifts.

401
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:08,545
We made this item gifts that when you earn it,

402
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,306
you can only send it to a guild member.

403
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,707
So for instance, I may earn a gift

404
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:19,013
Due to my placement on the solo leaderboard at the end of an event, I may purchase a $100

405
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:24,840
IAP pack and get 10 gem gifts to spread the wealth with other players in my guild.

406
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,803
And I can't use them in myself, I can only send them around.

407
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:31,907
Now, Guild did not have an incredibly long period in soft launch.

408
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:34,229
It was the last thing we launched right before Worldwide.

409
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:34,790
So...

410
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:41,540
The reason you're looking at inflection downward is because this graph ends at the point where

411
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,421
it crosses over and the inflection happens.

412
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,344
So this is just the soft launch graph.

413
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:48,727
So let's zoom out to the worldwide launch graph.

414
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:54,032
And as you can see, there's that, as I said, that natural resetting when we went from soft

415
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:56,594
launch to worldwide launch and we scaled up meaningfully.

416
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:07,104
But when you look here on this ARPDAU chart, you can see that inflection that the guild system was a part of.

417
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:11,146
When I look at it, I think introducing guilds was a major inflection point for the game.

418
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:18,471
So let's go back to that previous chart I was showing, where I'm showing ARPDAU on top and player engagement on bottom.

419
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:22,354
And as I said, this growth isn't feature-centric.

420
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:23,415
It's an ecosystem.

421
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:27,358
So part of that growth was due to our user acquisition

422
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:27,919
strategy.

423
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,320
Part of it was feature inflection

424
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,122
from the guilds and subsequent features we launched.

425
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:34,044
Part of it was event optimization.

426
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:36,606
And part of it is that population veterancy.

427
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:39,068
So what do I think that Guild's major contributor

428
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:39,989
to the software was?

429
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:41,991
People who are in social groups and are

430
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:43,912
in an engaged social group are going

431
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:44,973
to stick around for longer.

432
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:49,378
And so guilds, by creating more veterans,

433
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:53,703
helps improve the stacking of veteran players in our software

434
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:57,447
and increase the portion of our player base that are veterans.

435
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,551
And that lifts all of our metrics on a per-player basis

436
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:03,454
and has a meaningful change in our absolute numbers.

437
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:07,753
Let me go back to my lesson.

438
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:11,078
Guilds belong at the heart of a modern free-to-play game.

439
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:14,182
So if I take those two and combine it, and if today was

440
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:16,685
day one on a new mobile free-to-play product, the

441
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:19,509
first question is, how is this game built for guild events?

442
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:22,754
That's the primary design consideration in my mind.

443
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:26,199
Number five, this one's a real short one.

444
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,662
Complexity of feature design increases over time.

445
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:32,123
So I'm just going to talk about two features.

446
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:33,864
One we launched early on, leaderboards.

447
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:35,886
One we're building right now, relics and scrolls.

448
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:39,688
And if I just, at a high level, segmented league-based

449
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:44,391
leaderboards that drive competition and a set of

450
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,954
relics that you can equip to a team to boost their stats are

451
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:51,056
not wildly different in a vacuum in terms of effort.

452
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:55,180
But at the point where we released Leaderboards, the

453
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,642
game was much less complicated.

454
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:59,966
So this is the overview page from Leaderboards.

455
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:03,530
These are the six main screens that Leaderboards had to touch

456
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,853
from a user-facing perspective.

457
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:09,837
This is the overview page of our currently in development

458
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,817
Relics and Scrolls PDF.

459
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:14,318
And I think it's like 32 or 33 screens.

460
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:17,639
And as I said, in a vacuum, these two features aren't

461
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:18,639
crazily different.

462
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:22,840
What's different is that the size of the game has increased

463
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,741
and the number of points each one of these new features has

464
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:27,021
to integrate with increases.

465
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:31,303
So as feature richness increases, so does the complexity of adding new features to the core loop.

466
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:35,004
And I think if you've heard any of my previous talks, I've hit on this a lot,

467
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:39,505
that building features into the core loop in a way where they market themselves

468
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:43,406
is critical to players discovering them and them having the impact that you want on the game.

469
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:49,496
So my counterpart, Hide, who I think was really the architect of the game economy,

470
00:27:49,857 --> 00:27:55,506
he came to this game with an incredible view on the needs of growing the game economy over time,

471
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:58,650
and he knew and planned for that growth.

472
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:04,473
On the UX side, I don't think we did enough to plan for the growth and anticipate years

473
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:08,674
of growth of features being added to our game and needing to add them to the core loop.

474
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:13,396
And each feature we just have to do more like UX refactoring to make sure it really works

475
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,096
and that it's surfaced to the player.

476
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:16,457
And I think this is natural.

477
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:18,818
There's just like, you know...

478
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:24,621
There was no way to not have stat inflation in our game over time and power creep over time,

479
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:28,323
and it's a challenge just to plan for it and make sure to provide a great user experience.

480
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:33,206
I don't think it's possible to grow your game's feature depth over three years

481
00:28:33,366 --> 00:28:35,928
and not need this sort of refactoring over time,

482
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,329
but I think better planning for it at the outset

483
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:42,512
would have made our lives easier in presenting great features to players over time.

484
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,092
So, wrapping up real quick, these are my top five lessons.

485
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:53,496
Focus on inflection, build for your bandwidth, live ops and guilds, and live ops events that

486
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:55,217
guilds compete in are at the heart of your game.

487
00:28:55,657 --> 00:29:01,540
Build tools that allow you to combat the natural decay of events, and plan for the fact that

488
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,741
your feature design complexity will increase over time.

489
00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:14,389
And really, the most important thing to take away from this presentation is great results are possible over time.

490
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:21,914
You can do incredible things during the LiveOps period of your game, during the soft launch and worldwide launch, to change how players interact with your game.

491
00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:25,537
But it's not just one of these pillars, it's all of them.

492
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:30,701
It's world-class people working together across LiveOps, UA, feature development, player support.

493
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:33,762
Supported by a great studio, built on a great culture.

494
00:29:33,782 --> 00:29:34,662
This is what it takes.

495
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:37,143
It takes all of these things to achieve greatness

496
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:38,844
with a modern mobile free-to-play game.

497
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:40,145
So thank you very much.

498
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:47,788
When a little bit long, I probably

499
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:49,569
have time for one, maybe two questions.

500
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:52,070
Then I can take questions for anybody

501
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,390
who has them who'd like to stick around.

502
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:58,352
All right.

503
00:29:58,813 --> 00:29:59,773
Well, thank you all very much.

504
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:00,613
We've got one.

505
00:30:01,735 --> 00:30:03,676
Hi, very good speech, thanks.

506
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:11,060
And what's about impact on revenue of sales, of pop-ups,

507
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,041
like Game of World, Mobile Strike?

508
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:19,064
So the question was, what is the impact on revenue of sales?

509
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:21,786
And I think there are two types of sales, and it's very

510
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:24,307
important to think about them differently.

511
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:26,988
One is a sale where you're selling currency.

512
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:32,451
So I used to go into, I used to play Mobile Strike six times a day every day for months.

513
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:33,611
Now I pop in once a month.

514
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:37,994
And each month that sale, the amount of bonus gold is inflated, right?

515
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:39,474
They've inflated that over time.

516
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:42,636
And so what that means is that they're selling currency.

517
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:47,138
And a key lesson I've learned is that selling currency

518
00:30:47,218 --> 00:30:50,379
can be a really effective way to boost

519
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:51,839
your revenue in the short term.

520
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,121
But generally, the more currency you sell,

521
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:59,602
there's a hangover on new currency purchases

522
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:03,024
after that happens, unless you've designed the game so

523
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:05,025
that there are new things to always be soaking up

524
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:05,645
that currency.

525
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:09,426
So selling currency is really effective,

526
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,387
but you have to plan for the after effects.

527
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:18,632
The other thing, you know, a thing I think we focus on selling a lot more is new things that are really limited time.

528
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:24,136
And that's worked really well for us, and there you're just dealing with a different sort of inflation.

529
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,157
You're dealing with the power inflation over time.

530
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:31,403
Another part of your question was about the pop-ups and how important are the pop-ups.

531
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:37,570
Pop-ups are key to promoting and explaining the value of new things that we're putting on sale in our game.

532
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:43,336
Neil's in the back row, and I think within at least the last week, if not the last two,

533
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:44,617
there have been times where he goes,

534
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:46,359
What's wrong with the pop-ups?

535
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,841
And it's because he looks at the hourly revenue,

536
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,782
and he can tell instantly that something's wrong with how

537
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:52,943
we're messaging to our players.

538
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,445
So as I said before, the power of messaging to your players,

539
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:59,767
what you're selling to them, and what the value of those things

540
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:02,748
are to their play experience, it can't be overstated.

541
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:04,769
Thanks.

542
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,470
I'll just take one more.

543
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:13,826
Hello, this is Victor from Gameloft. You said that you had kind of problem with kind of content fatigue with weekly events.

544
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:20,534
What is for you the best way to counteract that? So with through gameplay or through the metagame, let's say?

545
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:25,934
Ah, so the question was early on I said we had a problem with fatigue during events and

546
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:28,015
it's just kind of a natural part of the game.

547
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:35,536
I really think, I think that the best way to combat that, you know, you're not going

548
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:39,257
to be able to release a completely new event harness every week.

549
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:41,758
It takes a long time to build each one of those.

550
00:32:42,198 --> 00:32:47,819
And so really focusing as a LiveOps team on novelty.

551
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:51,543
having the tools to introduce new things

552
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,746
and releasing new client updates that make minor improvements,

553
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:57,309
such as, as I mentioned, the global leaderboards

554
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,471
or launching this week commander skills,

555
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,575
like just introducing new things over time

556
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:04,557
and using the tools you have to make things

557
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:05,738
feel as new as possible.

558
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:10,663
Because you're going to need new skills, this is pure gameplay, you're going to need a new

559
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,163
leaderboard system, this is a meta game.

560
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:13,144
So what do you think?

561
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:14,464
It's both things at the same time?

562
00:33:14,504 --> 00:33:16,745
You can change just one, change the other, it's one that works better?

563
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:17,505
I think it's both.

564
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:22,447
I mean, I think it's you have to each week basically look at the tools you have and say

565
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:28,209
like what's the best thing we can deliver, or do we need to deliver absolutely new things?

566
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:29,029
No easy answer.

567
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:29,509
Sorry.

568
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:30,609
No magical formula there.

569
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:31,270
No.

570
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,450
Okay.

571
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:36,036
Alright, thank you all very much for listening and please fill out your review, let me know

572
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:39,501
how I can improve, and hopefully I'll be back next year to tell you about another 12 months

573
00:33:39,521 --> 00:33:39,681
ago.
