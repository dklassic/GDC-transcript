1
00:00:03,284 --> 00:00:04,525
All right, so to kind of dig into it,

2
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:06,846
this talk is about the character balance

3
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:08,647
that we did in Skylanders Swamp Force.

4
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:10,748
A little bit more about me.

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:13,770
I actually originally had an animation background,

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,251
it was about 15 years ago,

7
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:17,452
but that's kind of how I started in the industry.

8
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:20,754
Skylanders was my 26th ship title,

9
00:00:21,794 --> 00:00:24,556
and included in those were all kinds of crazy genres

10
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:26,897
from Tony Hawk's to Guitar Heroes,

11
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:29,198
you know, sandbox style games of Spider-Man,

12
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:31,019
2D, 3D platformers.

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,972
But really my focus for at least half of that and up to now has been on combat design.

14
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:43,554
So for those of you who don't know what Skylanders is, I just wanted to do a little bit.

15
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:46,935
Hopefully a lot of you know what it is, but it was released in 2011

16
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:49,476
as a reinvention of the Spyro franchise.

17
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,237
It was a dungeon crawler for kids pretty much

18
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:57,539
and it really started the whole toys to life kind of genre of which we have lots of nowadays.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,560
Over the course of the titles...

20
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:09,925
They added a bunch of characters. So the first one had 32 characters, Giants added 16, and then Swapforce we had 32 characters on top of that.

21
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:16,611
That brings it to 80 wholly unique characters, and when I mean unique I mean very unique characters.

22
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:26,780
On top of that, in Swapforce, we, you know, didn't want to do anything easy, so we said 16 of those new characters could be broken in half.

23
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:31,447
reassembled and made into 256 possible combinations.

24
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:34,669
So we kind of had to say, well, how are we going to attempt

25
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,891
to balance all of these things into one game?

26
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,234
So I just want to tell you guys a little bit

27
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:41,675
of what we're going to cover today.

28
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:44,417
This way, if you're, you know, getting hungry,

29
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:45,998
you can know how close you are to the end,

30
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,901
but also just a way to track how we're moving along.

31
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:52,263
So starting with kind of balance priorities.

32
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:58,185
different players have different balance priorities with Skylanders they have a

33
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:58,825
certain set

34
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:02,086
for example League of Legends is a pretty different set

35
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:05,308
uh... if you take a look at who a Skylander fan is

36
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:08,109
it's usually boys to girls ages six to ten

37
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,210
as well as some of their parents

38
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:10,930
now

39
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,073
Skylanders is a game for everybody, but when you try to start balancing something for everybody,

40
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:20,274
you're going to have a whole lot of, oh well what about this individual.

41
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:23,816
So we really had to target. So we targeted the 6 to 10 age range.

42
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:30,859
The types of balance that I'm going to talk about today, because there is lots of types of balance,

43
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:35,941
all of which is relevant to most games, but in the case of today I'm going to talk about

44
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:40,003
player versus player. Now player versus player is the actual human being

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,481
I'm sure a really talented Pat

46
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:48,324
versus another human being and so this is me playing against you and we would

47
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:52,125
kinda like a fair fight so games like checkers chess where they're completely

48
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,206
symmetrical those games are obviously very balanced

49
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:55,867
with the exception of who goes first

50
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:58,448
so that's what I'm talking about with player versus player

51
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,551
Character versus character, even though characters are typically used in a PvP situation,

52
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:07,492
it is why would I choose this character over another character.

53
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:12,034
Now in the case of Team Fortress, there are roles in the game,

54
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:15,375
and so you have more reasons to pick one particular character over another.

55
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:19,996
Even in League of Legends you have certain characters that will take certain paths based on their role.

56
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:25,478
Skylanders doesn't have roles, but there is a very strong reason why we want you to play multiple characters.

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,180
The next one is player versus environment.

58
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,902
So this is PVE, as many people call it.

59
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:34,443
It's just any of the monsters, hazards, traps,

60
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,764
other things that the computer is doing

61
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:40,506
to try to make the levels more interesting, difficult,

62
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:41,447
and other things like that.

63
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:44,708
So anything that's not another player, that's what this is.

64
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,530
And then the last one is the character within itself.

65
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,311
Now this is why would I use one ability

66
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:51,532
instead of another ability.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,106
A character who has one ability that is the best ability and no reason to ever use any other ability again

68
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,528
is a character that has very poor balance within itself.

69
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:04,753
A character that has lots of reasons to kind of mix and match and play all of its moves has good balance.

70
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:12,561
So if we kind of look at whose priorities fall where, we'll start with League of Legends.

71
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,973
Now League of Legends in a very small nutshell is a game that

72
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,317
you play, there's lots of characters, you try to kill the

73
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:24,101
other team with your players. There are many more rules and

74
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:25,042
I'm sure many of you know them.

75
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:30,007
But in this case, PVE is the least important factor in this

76
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:30,367
game.

77
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:31,768
Doesn't mean it's not there.

78
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:34,809
There are little minions and there are enemies that hide in

79
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:35,810
the map that aren't players.

80
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,711
But it's not important.

81
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:39,532
It's not what needs to be gotten right.

82
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,393
For example, if one of the monsters on one of the maps

83
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:44,734
just had way too many hit points, it's not really going

84
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:47,696
to break that match because what matters is the fairness

85
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:50,757
or balance between players, which is why the PVP section

86
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:52,218
is the really big wedge.

87
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:56,601
Character versus character and character within itself are also very important.

88
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,183
League of Legends makes a lot of its money by selling more characters.

89
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:00,964
It's very similar to Skylanders.

90
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:03,406
So, that's a big deal for them.

91
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,289
And then the character within itself, because there's some depth in it that you don't,

92
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:12,214
you want interesting characters using one ability at the right time versus another ability is important to it.

93
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:17,253
Now to contrast, if you look at Skylanders, PVP is the least

94
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:18,974
important thing to our audience.

95
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:22,017
I am going to spend a little bit of time on a little bit

96
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,219
more as to why it is.

97
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,741
But the big purple wedge is the PVE.

98
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:26,742
This is story mode.

99
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:29,104
This is the kid sits down and wants to play through the game

100
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,407
and get to the end and beat Chaos at his.

101
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:38,450
new scheme. Very important to them. Character versus character is almost exactly as important.

102
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,911
We want kids to want to buy more toys. And we want them to enjoy it. We don't want to

103
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:46,252
feel like they're ripped off or they got a toy and it was kind of lame and it didn't

104
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:51,234
really meet their expectations. We also want kids to argue on the playground which Skylander

105
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:56,456
is cooler than another Skylander. And then the character within itself is actually pretty

106
00:05:56,496 --> 00:06:00,057
much the same importance as League of Legends is why would I pick this ability instead of

107
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:00,538
this ability.

108
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,941
characters start to get boring when they're not.

109
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:06,283
So that's really what I'm talking about with balance,

110
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,505
the priorities of what is important to your player base.

111
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:11,386
So start with what your players like,

112
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:14,487
and kind of scope and balance accordingly there.

113
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,889
So to get into the meat, so much meat

114
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,710
that I had to break it up into four smaller sections,

115
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,751
these are the types of balance.

116
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,633
Now player versus player is kind of the first one

117
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:25,493
I'm going to talk about.

118
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:28,115
I'm going to talk about it for a very short period of time.

119
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,392
This was the lowest priority for our demographic because they

120
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:37,814
just didn't play it as much. We did have to make some special

121
00:06:37,854 --> 00:06:40,156
changes to it and there was some really big things that we

122
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:42,457
learned that even made us prioritize it less.

123
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:51,053
So one of the big things that we changed was anything that would remove player control from another player was actually removed from that mode.

124
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:55,794
So we have lots of abilities where you can put people in bubbles, or you can freeze them, or you can make them dance.

125
00:06:57,374 --> 00:07:01,656
Those victim events, or victim states as we called them, didn't happen.

126
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:06,177
to another player. Now they would still do all the damage and you could still hurt the other person

127
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:11,738
but you could never be put in a bubble, you could never be frozen in a block of ice because that was very frustrating

128
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,138
especially to a kid. You don't want to lose control of your character.

129
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:20,379
Some of the other under the hood balancing stuff we did was kind of health

130
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:29,281
for example if you were playing a character that's very low level and it has very very low health we would kind of up the health a little bit for you just kind of under the hood as a handicap, make it a little bit more fair.

131
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:35,694
But all of this paled in comparison to the living room balancing that occurred naturally with kids

132
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:41,135
we would put kids down on the same couch or chair or whatever I would set up that day and

133
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:47,637
We would have them play and what we would see is that they would make up their own rules a kid would put down a giant

134
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:50,638
No, you can't put down a giant. We're not playing with giants in this match. All right fine

135
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:54,258
We're both gonna play as Giants or oh you're playing as a swap first character. I want to play as a swap first character

136
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,079
We're only gonna play as girl characters today like that

137
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:03,284
overshadowed any amount of balancing that we would do on top of it because they had their own

138
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:06,965
priorities. They had already ranked these characters and they were doing self-balancing.

139
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:12,246
And so that made our jobs a little bit easier. We still had to do a lot of work to once again

140
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:16,408
remove certain things. But that's really all I need to talk about with that one.

141
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:22,269
We made this decision pretty early on because of the balance priorities. So to go again back to my

142
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:27,091
first point, we obviously couldn't do this amount of work on many of the other points.

143
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,946
So the next thing is PVE or player versus environment.

144
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,773
So there's gonna be a little bit of boring math

145
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,497
at the beginning, I'll try to tear through it

146
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:36,820
and then we'll get to some of the more.

147
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:43,946
interesting and or controversial topics. So the simple ones, these I'm just going to run through.

148
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:51,250
Hazard damage versus players. We pretty much had kind of a optimal level for a Skylander to be at

149
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,892
when they were on that particular story level. Now in Skylanders, as you know, your lives are

150
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:00,934
your toys. And so if a character dies, you have to put a new toy on the portal.

151
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:05,452
So we have no idea what toy is going to be put down at what level.

152
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:11,154
And in fact, later on in the game, you are more likely to replace a toy with a very low level toy

153
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:14,815
because you've been playing the game with your favorite character, he's awesome, and then suddenly it dies.

154
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,215
And you're like, oh, well, dig around.

155
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:19,516
Oh, I haven't played as this character in a while and I'll stick it down.

156
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:21,556
And now you really kind of have to learn that character again.

157
00:09:22,056 --> 00:09:25,577
So we kind of couldn't account for it fully, but we had to make some assumptions that,

158
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:27,918
oh, well, you're at the end of the game, you probably have a high level character.

159
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:31,816
and we would just balance the damage accordingly so at the end of the level

160
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:33,196
it was flat damage

161
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:35,617
same exact amount of damage to every single character

162
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:37,677
pretty simple

163
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,599
health pickups was a percentage of total health it wasn't a flat amount

164
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,779
this is because when it

165
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,940
kids were playing in co-op

166
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,921
one of them would get pizza we made it so one pickup goes to both players

167
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:55,403
if I had a max hit point level of ten thousand say and my friend has a max

168
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:56,303
hit point of

169
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:57,303
two thousand

170
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:06,790
and he gets 2000 life back and his bar goes to full and my bar goes up a fifth. It feels like I got screwed.

171
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:12,053
And so we just made it a percentage, which means characters with more health got more health.

172
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:17,936
It was just kind of part of the character and even though it was contrary to a lot of the kind of balanced things that we thought,

173
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:20,838
that's what kids wanted, that's what kids expected.

174
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,152
XP games and gold pickup, once again more math.

175
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:27,356
We try pretty hard to make it such that you can

176
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:29,378
beat the game completely.

177
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:33,570
from start to finish without doing any extra content with

178
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,711
what was given to you in the starter pack.

179
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:39,132
So Swap Horse came with three characters, two swappers, and

180
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,453
the repose Stealth Elf.

181
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:43,554
We figured out, oh, it takes this much money to max them

182
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,955
all out, and it takes this much XP to max them all out.

183
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:49,836
We then just took the levels we had on the main path,

184
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:52,377
divided how many levels, and divided how many enemies were

185
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,298
in it, and that's what we got.

186
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,939
So if you played through the whole main story, you would

187
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,079
have enough money and enough XP to max out all those

188
00:10:58,099 --> 00:10:58,480
characters.

189
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:01,279
Those are the kind of the boring ones.

190
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,843
Now, some of the trickier ones is where we started getting

191
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:06,685
into things like, what about the AI?

192
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,088
Now, once again, we wanted all characters to be balanced.

193
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,831
But we said, what's the purpose of AI?

194
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,813
Well, AI are there as a challenge.

195
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:16,557
Really want to make that player feel powerful.

196
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:18,960
We also want a player to feel like they're advancing

197
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,561
and they're getting stronger as they move along.

198
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:24,827
We want every character to feel viable. Even though there are

199
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:28,127
kind of types of attacks that are stronger in certain areas,

200
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,327
which we're going to get to more later, you never want to feel

201
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:32,348
like you put a character down that was just utterly useless.

202
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:37,889
And then lastly, winning can't be boring. Kids have no patience

203
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,909
and they will tell you if they are bored and they will walk

204
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,890
away from a controller no matter how many chips or soda you give

205
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,030
them. So winning can't be boring. So there was kind of

206
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,231
this interesting thing that caused more problems than we

207
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,191
thought it would originally.

208
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,301
and that was damage numbers. Now damage numbers was something that was kind of established

209
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:59,483
with the franchise already, and they weren't really going away, but I feel it's pretty

210
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:03,465
important to talk about the problems that they caused. So what are the good things of

211
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:07,487
damage numbers? Well, it's a literal reference point. You say I just punched that guy or

212
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:12,770
I blew up that barrel or I sunk that ship, I did 50 points of damage because see, look,

213
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,130
it says 50.

214
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:16,968
It's also really good for incremental progress.

215
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:19,989
If I put on a hat that gives me 0.3% strength

216
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,949
and I see my damage number go up by one,

217
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,150
yay, I can see the change.

218
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,290
And once again, it was established for the genre.

219
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,211
The cons, however,

220
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,071
were that nobody read them.

221
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:33,592
Now, you could ask someone,

222
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:34,612
hey, how much damage do you do?

223
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:35,832
Or what does that damage number say?

224
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:36,732
And they will then read it.

225
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:38,953
But subconsciously, while playing the game,

226
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:40,273
they didn't actually read.

227
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:46,338
If we took the number 10 and made it really big and red with an exclamation point,

228
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:52,005
it actually was perceived as more damage than the number 88 that was written small.

229
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:56,049
Because when you're just churning through it, you're seeing big things flash up.

230
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,513
And we even were like, well, can't we just do big hit reacts and hit effects?

231
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,659
Once again, there are a lot of pros to having them, and they weren't going anywhere.

232
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,819
But it was important to note.

233
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,360
Once again, we're not like World of Warcraft.

234
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,701
We don't have people running Omen or Recount or other things to maximize their damage per character.

235
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:16,202
There were also a very distracting reference point, as you'll see in a little bit.

236
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:20,283
When a player would try to figure out how powerful a character was,

237
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,023
they would look at the damage number.

238
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,764
Which sounds like, oh yeah, of course that makes sense.

239
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:29,385
But let's say you have a character that can kill everything on screen in one attack.

240
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:32,286
and when I say kill everything it just does a lot of damage. So

241
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:35,070
we would balance that move to say do 40 points of damage to

242
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,074
everything on screen. Well let's say you put that character down

243
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:43,502
and you execute that attack and there was one guy on screen. It

244
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:45,585
does 40 points of damage to the kid.

245
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:50,539
and you might put another character down that has a pretty strong single target attack

246
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:53,141
and that single target attack does 60 points of damage

247
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:54,802
to one thing

248
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:58,645
the kids like well the 60 is bigger than 40 of course that character is more powerful so it's not very

249
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:03,209
reflective of the actual value of a move so it was distracting

250
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,430
and once again it wasn't reflective, well not once again

251
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:09,373
it wasn't reflective of the players action count. Now what do I mean by the players action count?

252
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:15,059
With action counts, it's how many buttons you're pressing and things like that.

253
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,302
So let's say an enemy has 100 hit points,

254
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:20,585
and you have an attack that does 25 points of damage.

255
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,827
Okay, math whizzes out there.

256
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:23,948
Four attacks.

257
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,432
That's how many times it's going to take for me to hit that guy to kill it.

258
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:36,896
Now let's say you get an ability boost or a hat or you upgrade your character and now you're doing 20% more damage.

259
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:42,839
20% is a pretty big jump. There's a lot of raids that I would grind to get a sword that gave me 20% more damage output.

260
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:46,421
However, it still takes me four buttons to kill the same thing.

261
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:51,904
So even though the numbers are a little bit bigger, I don't feel any stronger. I don't feel any powerful.

262
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:54,125
It's just as much work to kill the same darn thing.

263
00:14:55,969 --> 00:15:00,193
this concept of wasted damage is just not really received at

264
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:02,615
least for our target demographic. Once again if you

265
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,659
hit an area and the strength of that move is it can kill ten

266
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,522
things at once or attack ten things at once and they're not

267
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:14,126
using it right, it's just problematic. So how do we kind

268
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,909
of balance for this? Well, we actually started with our

269
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,430
enemies. So we actually started with our enemies. So we actually

270
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:24,962
Our basic melee guys were 6 hits. 2 combos. Our average combo was like a 3 hit combo.

271
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:31,407
Our basic ranged was half of this. This is because the challenge of a ranged enemy is closing the gap.

272
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:33,729
Popcorn is always 1 hit.

273
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:37,240
If you find a chompy who is super chompy at the end of the level,

274
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,022
he will still take one hit to kill.

275
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:42,465
It's a couple special things in some of our arenas, but for the most part that was the popcorn.

276
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:46,068
The heavies were the same as the melee guys,

277
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,811
however they would usually have a little rule or a little special thing.

278
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:53,192
For example, you have to get behind them or you have to wait for them to sneeze

279
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,733
other things like that.

280
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:58,674
One very important thing when you do this, do not do chance.

281
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:02,094
Do not do an enemy that has a 30% chance to block what you're doing.

282
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:04,575
Or, oh, maybe it'll do that or 50% on hit.

283
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,496
Doesn't go over well.

284
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:10,076
That just means that you have to button mash 50% more of the time.

285
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:12,317
A rule is a rule

286
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:15,258
and when a kid learns it, you want to reward them for figuring it out

287
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,438
and they will do it over and over again and they're going to feel great.

288
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:19,198
But if it's like, well, I have a chance to learn.

289
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,140
chance to kill them it just kind of gets lost it gets confusing

290
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,062
and usually they just end up button mashing it. The super

291
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:28,463
heavy the last one really these were just give them as many hit

292
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:32,205
points as is not boring. Traditionally we would mix in

293
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:33,986
super heavies with a lot of other things that were going

294
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:36,567
around them so you didn't just run up to a wall and beat on it

295
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,129
for forever. Usually they would kind of stay around while other

296
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:43,591
waves of enemies would kind of jump in. The big thing with all

297
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:46,753
of this AI hit point is that the difference in health from the

298
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,773
very first level.

299
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:54,079
to the very last level or the easiest difficulty to the very hardest difficulty was only two hundred percent

300
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:57,460
we did this because once again if you go to the last level

301
00:16:58,061 --> 00:17:00,602
and you put down a fresh Skylander who's level one

302
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:08,005
we didn't want you to feel useless we didn't want you to feel like you had to hit that enemy five hundred times just to whittle away at it

303
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:15,608
so then it's like well how did you make the harder levels harder well that's where we were we really leaned into how much damage these enemies output

304
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:19,826
So we ramped the damage enemies output very significantly.

305
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,789
So much so that if you play the game on Nightmare, most

306
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,613
enemies in the first half of the game had the ability to

307
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:28,334
one shot you.

308
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,555
However, they couldn't actually.

309
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:32,277
We put a rule in that says, if you take enough damage to kill

310
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:35,180
you in one blow, we give you 20% of your health back and

311
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,541
make you immune for about a second.

312
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,583
It prevented people from being completely ganged up upon.

313
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:42,166
You can still totally get beat if you stand still for that

314
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:42,686
one second.

315
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,288
But what it meant was that.

316
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:48,633
to be good at the game you had to get out of the way. Dodging

317
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:54,937
and blocking is a technique that is very, very tactical for a 6

318
00:17:55,197 --> 00:18:00,620
to 10 year old. The best offense is the only way to play. And so

319
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,482
what we found was that once kids started getting good at getting

320
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:05,203
out of the way, getting out of the way, then they were like,

321
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:07,624
okay. And they could take on nightmare. But it meant that if

322
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:09,785
you could play the game on easy and never get hit, you could

323
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:10,546
beat the game on nightmare.

324
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:14,664
So we're done with PVE.

325
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,147
So moving on to character versus character, this is why

326
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:18,808
I would choose one character over another.

327
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,351
Now this one, we got a lot of awesome data.

328
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,312
We did tons and tons of kit testing.

329
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:26,936
If you are even more interested in how we did our

330
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:30,600
kit testing, Gareth is giving a talk about how we did all

331
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,801
that Friday, I think.

332
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:32,602
You can look it up.

333
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:40,209
So the character versus character. We found that there was some pretty core reasons why people would pick

334
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,390
and that these things would change over time.

335
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,352
Aesthetics, what the character looked like was huge.

336
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:50,614
The surprise or fun. I'll tell a little bit more about that in a little bit.

337
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:54,356
Ease of use, pretty self-explanatory.

338
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:58,438
The utility, how actually useful the character was in given situations.

339
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,280
And the actual power. Actual power was the least important to everyone.

340
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,212
which made it even more difficult, but I'll get more on that later.

341
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:10,194
So over time, so if you look at the first red line,

342
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:13,336
it's the only thing that matters on that first site,

343
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:15,537
because they're looking at the character on a shelf,

344
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:16,758
they're looking at it on a commercial.

345
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:20,220
So they're instantly making expectations of what that character's going to do,

346
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,062
and how awesome that character is going to be when they get them home.

347
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,883
So none of those other things matter.

348
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:28,245
They can't play the character yet, they're just seeing it.

349
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,206
And so that's why all those other things are at zero.

350
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:37,549
The aesthetics kind of continues to be important, but once they've kind of built a rapport with the character and they know what they look like, it kind of fades off a little bit.

351
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:45,974
If we ever make the character start to be ugly, or we change them so much during an upgrade, it does have a negative impact, but it does slowly taper off.

352
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:51,694
The blue line, now the blue line, next one is ease of use.

353
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:53,895
You'll see it spike and then taper off.

354
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:55,975
This one's pretty self-explanatory.

355
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,236
They don't know how to use the character.

356
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,817
They put it down right on the portal.

357
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:03,598
And the first time, if they're frustrated, it's a really big

358
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:04,058
deal for them.

359
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,999
However, very quickly they'll learn how the character works

360
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,160
and it kind of tapers off down.

361
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:14,040
Now, that yellow line, my favorite line, the fun, this is something that keeps being important

362
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,643
to them and actually continues to grow.

363
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,886
You can't have a character get boring.

364
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,643
A kid has no tolerance for that and will walk away.

365
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:24,366
And so fun spikes up and continues to be,

366
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:26,688
in the end, is really the most important thing

367
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:27,329
at the end of the day.

368
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,451
The green one, now this is one where those

369
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,693
annoying little damage numbers pop up

370
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,455
because you'll see that it spikes,

371
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:36,536
goes down, and comes back up again.

372
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:38,498
The reason for that is, once again,

373
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,660
the first time they put that character down the portal,

374
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,061
they run up to a thing, they hit it,

375
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,062
how much damage did it do?

376
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,164
Oh, that's how powerful it is.

377
00:20:45,764 --> 00:20:49,126
It's usually fairly inaccurate, and so they kind of forget

378
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:49,486
about it.

379
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:51,788
And then once they really start playing the character a lot

380
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:53,329
more and understand the depth of the character,

381
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:54,930
it kind of slowly goes back up.

382
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:59,613
The brown one, it has a slow grow.

383
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,333
This is utility.

384
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,754
This is because the character needs to,

385
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,196
or player needs to kind of take in all

386
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:06,857
the different encounters we're going to throw at them

387
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:08,678
over the course of the game and find out,

388
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:09,879
oh, this character is good here.

389
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:10,980
This character is good here.

390
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,081
So you really can't appreciate the utility character

391
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,922
played a pretty large amount of the game.

392
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:17,814
So let's dig into this a little bit with some examples.

393
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:19,534
So aesthetics.

394
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:20,755
What does a character look like?

395
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:24,995
Skylanders go through an awful lot of iteration to get where

396
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:26,296
we really want them to be.

397
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,536
For example, this is Trap Shadow.

398
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,037
He was awful scary when he first came out.

399
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:35,278
He lost his Bowie knife and a couple other things.

400
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,598
And we actually ended up making his little trap all ghost and

401
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:41,019
shadow, because bear traps are pretty nasty things.

402
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,760
And so we go through a lot of these changes.

403
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:50,203
The moment a kid, actually the moment anyone sees this character, they make an assumption of what that thing is going to do.

404
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:53,985
Once again, most important, slowly tapering off.

405
00:21:54,305 --> 00:22:01,029
Now you'll notice that the line stays flat from first to thirty seconds of play.

406
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:05,352
And that's the moment where the design team was really put to the test.

407
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:08,654
We had to cash the check that the concept artist wrote.

408
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:18,091
So I'll show you an example. Stink Bomb, who is a little kung fu skunk, he's very ninja-esque.

409
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:22,235
Now in his toy he has these throwing stars. They're in his hand, he's getting ready to throw

410
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:29,462
them, he looks really cool. So what happened was we made him a ranged character. Now,

411
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:34,661
Arranged character having kung fu moves kind of starts to mix

412
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:39,947
up his kit. He's now pretty good at too many situations. So

413
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,730
what we ended up doing is we gave him a little one inch

414
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,975
punch, little Bruce Lee stink palm. And it worked great

415
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:47,637
because it delivered on the

416
00:22:48,398 --> 00:22:51,400
kind of kung fu fantasy the kids wanted, but it kept him very

417
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,422
safely in the type of character we wanted him to be because the

418
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,764
one inch punch doesn't really do that much damage and it knocks

419
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:01,166
enemies away making them more susceptible to using your

420
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:04,909
ranged attack. Originally he had a little blow dart and would

421
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:07,911
shoot these little poison darts on one attack and then he would

422
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:09,071
throw the stars on the other attack.

423
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:13,479
We kept the little poison acorn he throws as kind of a Hadouken fireball as an upgrade, but

424
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:18,870
they, kids didn't see the value of having two very quick ranged attacks, even though one was

425
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,776
a damage over time. We kept the damage over time, we just put it on the punch.

426
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,481
Now the fun and surprise, this is not about a talk of what is fun.

427
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:30,642
There's probably a billion books you could go buy,

428
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:33,003
and I hope that most of you have read at least one of them.

429
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:38,484
This is really more about that one memorable, fun thing about the character.

430
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:39,824
When you ask a kid,

431
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:43,365
hey, what was it about that character you really liked?

432
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:44,985
This is that thing.

433
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:46,846
So once again.

434
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,073
Very important and continues to stay important.

435
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,261
Frieno's bike is a really good example of this.

436
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:54,704
So Frieno is a fire character.

437
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,268
He hasn't come out yet.

438
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,701
and we didn't want to do just another character that breathed

439
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:04,163
fire. We used flame attacks and a lot of things. So the whole

440
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:06,464
thing with him is what he actually does is he heats up

441
00:24:06,524 --> 00:24:09,006
metal, kind of like a blacksmith does. So you'll see he gets a

442
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:11,847
little tantrum, he starts to get angry, but instead of charging

443
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:15,870
when he's hot, he summons a molten motorcycle. And this was

444
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,652
just meant to kind of be a fun one off. Hey, wouldn't it be

445
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:21,353
cool? Yeah, we'll change the charge of a rhino. So what we

446
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:24,195
actually ended up doing, because it was so well received,

447
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:31,138
is we cut a pretty substantial number of his other moves and we made one of his base abilities that motorcycle.

448
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:36,861
And even after that, if you look towards the end, he's got an entire path devoted to the motorcycle.

449
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:44,424
If you look on his model very carefully in the ship game, you'll actually notice that where his fist meets his wrist,

450
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,225
there's a little chain inside of it.

451
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:50,467
He used to be able to punch his fists off and grab things and pull them to him.

452
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:55,910
an awful lot of time spent doing that, but it wasn't really relevant to his kit and it

453
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:01,575
was not what he was remembered for. So we cut it and just put in a motorcycle. Now easy

454
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:06,059
use, this is how learnable the character is. With our game, since you could put down any

455
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:10,863
character at any time, we can expect you to go through a tutorial.

456
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,758
But we still have to teach you these characters and these characters have lots of moves.

457
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:21,605
So we actually hide our tutorials within the way that you buy the abilities.

458
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:24,789
Because we know that once you get some money you're going to want to buy an ability.

459
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:28,734
And while you're in the ability shop we can at least have your attention for maybe four

460
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:31,437
seconds before you push the buy button and go back to playing.

461
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,222
So this is something we have to be very mindful of the persona and how the character gets played and who it's being played by.

462
00:25:39,742 --> 00:25:42,042
So once again, spikes up, then kind of peters off.

463
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:46,624
So Popthorn, he's this little teeny puffer dragon.

464
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:49,445
He can inflate himself and he can deflate himself.

465
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:51,425
He's awful adorable.

466
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:56,327
He would have been more adorable if we got the sneakers on him that we wanted to, but we never got that to work.

467
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:05,959
But we found that because he has such big goofy eyes and was really awful cute, he was very, very well received by our younger demographic.

468
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:07,200
So even out of the 6-10 on the 5 scale.

469
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:13,150
What he is, is he's what we call a modal character.

470
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,851
Meaning he can go from one mode to another.

471
00:26:15,552 --> 00:26:17,434
Pop Fizz is another character, if you know the franchise,

472
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:19,676
he can drink his soda and turn into a little monster.

473
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:22,299
So what Popcorn does is he's little,

474
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:23,760
and then he poofs, and then he's big.

475
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,384
So what we did was we made it such that

476
00:26:27,564 --> 00:26:30,808
you could actually play this character as a button masher.

477
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:34,671
He has one button that inflates him and he has one button that deflates him.

478
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:37,933
If you're already inflated when you try to inflate, he shoots little spikes.

479
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:42,197
If you're already deflated when you press the deflap button, he breathes little air.

480
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:46,621
Now what this means is you could just blindly button mash back and forth

481
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:51,424
or any one button and you'll actually be having fun. You'll be doing stuff.

482
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:55,606
He's not very effective though when he's played that way.

483
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:57,666
He's actually balanced such that if you

484
00:26:58,246 --> 00:27:01,027
go back and forth frequently and at the right time,

485
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:03,688
that's where he starts putting a lot of his damage out.

486
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:06,709
So what it did was it meant that if you were a very young player

487
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:09,529
and you really didn't have the skill to know that you were going between modes,

488
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,230
he looked fun, he was doing cool things, and you were actually being effective.

489
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:16,353
However, if you kind of wanted to get into the depth of him,

490
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,935
you would really focus on how he upgraded,

491
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:20,176
know when you would expand.

492
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:22,218
For example, if you run into a crowd of guys as you're small,

493
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:23,840
and then you inflate, you'll knock them all away.

494
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,382
There are upgrades where he gets like fresh breath.

495
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,184
So when he goes small immediately,

496
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:29,985
his breath is minty fresh and does more damage.

497
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:32,328
Or when he just inflates, his spikes are spikier.

498
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:35,611
So this was a time where we kind of balanced the whole character

499
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:38,553
for how easy he needed to be to use.

500
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:45,485
Now utility is the next one. Now if you're familiar with Skylanders, there are little gates around the game that say,

501
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:49,628
oh you need an earth character to go in here or in Swap Force you need someone with the rocket legs.

502
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:52,449
This is not the type of utility I'm talking about.

503
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:59,233
What I'm talking about is, this is a melee character, this is a lobbying character, this is a crowd controlling ability.

504
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:00,954
So we call these archetypes.

505
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:04,625
this is something that once again you have a very slow

506
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:07,086
appreciation for and you really can't because you're going to

507
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:09,188
have to experience multiple encounters and be like oh this

508
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:10,529
is one of those encounters where I need one of those

509
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:15,692
characters. So the type of utilities was kind of big. I'm

510
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:18,674
not expecting you to read this eye chart. In fact I'll go away

511
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:18,934
right now.

512
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:29,936
But the first category is melee or close. Now melee is common, we have characters with weapons that swing them or they punch things, but we have lots of things that just do close attacks.

513
00:28:29,956 --> 00:28:38,221
So this is really, I hit something in front of me or right immediately next to me. This is one of the most common ability archetypes that we have.

514
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:41,023
And that's what melee close is.

515
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:45,907
The next one is kind of this straight ahead category.

516
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:47,768
Now you'll notice that I'm using a ranged character here.

517
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:50,650
Our ranged characters actually tend to fall in the straight ahead.

518
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:54,273
Most of our straight ahead characters are ranged characters.

519
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,735
However, really anything that attacks in a hall,

520
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:58,557
if you could imagine a hallway in front of you,

521
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,358
is a straight ahead character.

522
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:02,480
So in this case we have characters that shoot snakes,

523
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,762
or characters that shoot throwing stars, other things like that.

524
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,018
The next category we have is the lobber.

525
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:11,339
And the lobber does just that.

526
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:12,179
It's kind of an arc.

527
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:16,460
Now, this is the lowest archetype

528
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,400
represented in the game.

529
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,701
But it's the one that has the most kind of odd ability in

530
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:23,121
that it can hit enemies that other abilities can't.

531
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:27,942
And so you'll notice in here, Countdown's throwing his head.

532
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:30,802
Another character would have to jump up onto that ledge.

533
00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:32,603
Or even it could be on a ledge that you can't get to with

534
00:29:32,623 --> 00:29:35,543
another character, at least by going the long way.

535
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:40,575
The next one is kind of the miscellaneous category.

536
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:44,917
If I was making a harder core game, I would call this crowd control.

537
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:48,719
So in the case of Stink Bomb, he can go invisible, no one knows where he is,

538
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,582
or he can kind of stink them. In the case of Magna Charge, he can pick people up,

539
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:55,963
carry them around, throw them. Doesn't really do that much damage.

540
00:29:56,124 --> 00:29:58,205
It's all about kind of controlling the battlefield.

541
00:29:58,345 --> 00:30:01,206
Special is something we try to have most of our characters have something in,

542
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:03,588
because it allows us to do a lot more wacky things.

543
00:30:05,457 --> 00:30:09,561
The new category we added for Swapforce was the movement category.

544
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:12,003
The video will load. There we go.

545
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:16,066
Now movement is an ability that does just that.

546
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:18,388
Moves the character in some form.

547
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:21,751
So in the case of Hootloop, he has a portal ring that he throws down.

548
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:24,013
He can fall down it and he kind of comes up the other side.

549
00:30:24,593 --> 00:30:26,655
That moves him forward. It kind of teleports him.

550
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:29,717
Firecracker will turn into a giant parade, move him forward.

551
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:32,380
I love that move. It's so cool.

552
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,789
This was very important to us because swappers,

553
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,972
we wanted to have the top half be how you fight and the bottom half be how you move.

554
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:44,396
So we tried to kind of keep that. As you can see here, Freeze Blade has a skate attack where he'll kind of skate forward.

555
00:30:44,817 --> 00:30:49,641
He's actually the fastest character in the game, by the way, but we make you work for it because you've got to keep pumping your ice skates.

556
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:53,003
So this is a little bit easier to read.

557
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:53,864
So the global spread...

558
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,710
kind of felt like that with the new categories.

559
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:00,836
You'll notice that the numbers are not the same,

560
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,339
and that's totally fine.

561
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,184
What was important was that if you look at the lobber

562
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:08,329
and you see, okay, well 12 out of all the characters use.

563
00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:10,205
that type of archetype.

564
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:12,865
We go and we work with the level designers and say,

565
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,686
hey, this is about how many characters are going to utilize this.

566
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:20,028
You should probably make this many encounters have that as kind of a cool thing to be able to do.

567
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:22,249
You don't have to make it even across the board,

568
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:24,709
because some people like certain types of categories more.

569
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,870
You just have to be aware of it of how much you're going to use it.

570
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,851
For example, if every encounter in the game had lobbers,

571
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:34,052
it would actually create a really high demand for a character that we don't have a whole lot of.

572
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,713
So you kind of want to gel, talk with your level designers.

573
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,383
Now swappers of course were special, they had some extra rules.

574
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:47,068
Most of which are not as complicated as we thought they were going to have to be.

575
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:50,130
So the first one is synergy with the matching half.

576
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,814
Now you may not always play the stink part of stink bomb.

577
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,294
when you buy a stink bomb, but you bought one of them and they come together in the same box.

578
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:02,155
So we at least know that you're putting them together.

579
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:06,859
We also know that there was two type of kids. Kids that loved to mix up everything

580
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,483
and then the slightly more OCD crowd that was like, no, everything must match perfectly.

581
00:32:11,903 --> 00:32:16,427
So we had pretty good chance that there was a large group of people playing the swappers as a normal character.

582
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:18,109
So we tried to keep synergy.

583
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:23,413
We also limited each parts archetype to two, almost always.

584
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:26,855
This means that because there was five archetypes total in the game

585
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:31,117
and each swapped half could only be in two, you could never have a swapped

586
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:33,298
combination that filled all archetypes.

587
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,439
We had about two characters that could do it.

588
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:36,960
I think Trap Browser is one of them.

589
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:42,383
But it ended up being okay because he's not strong in all of them. He's kind of a jack-of-all-trades, pretty good at everything.

590
00:32:43,603 --> 00:32:48,126
Once again, the legs were themed with the swap abilities, so characters with the rocket boots probably needed to have a rocket dash.

591
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,847
That was just kind of more of a design theme thing.

592
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:56,119
But we balance the characters like you were just playing 2 weaker characters at the same time.

593
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:58,359
I know that sounds really easy,

594
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,500
but it was just kind of a nice little mantra we had and it ended up working out really well.

595
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:07,001
The last one, and the most important one, and the biggest revelation for us,

596
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:09,182
because we had some fear,

597
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:13,983
was if anyone played Marvel Ultimate Alliance, we had a concept called Fusion,

598
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:15,203
where if you had...

599
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:18,578
Spider-Man and Wolverine and you put them together you get a

600
00:33:18,618 --> 00:33:22,940
brand new Spider-Man Wolverine combo move. We did not want to

601
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,662
do that at all because it creates a ridiculous amount of

602
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:29,164
work. It's exponential work in fact. And exponential is a

603
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:32,887
terrifying word. And so what we had instead was move synergy.

604
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:36,569
Meaning if I had a character that had a fire top and an ice

605
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:38,630
bottom he did not get a new water attack.

606
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:44,867
We would have the things that get created and placed in the world have rules with how they interact with each other.

607
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:50,028
For example, Punkshock shoots electric bolts and she throws water balloons.

608
00:33:50,048 --> 00:33:54,870
So you throw the water balloon, you shoot electricity at it, the electricity electrifies the water.

609
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,991
But we also had Zap, and Zap would leave a trail of water down.

610
00:33:58,211 --> 00:34:01,933
So if you play as Punkshock and you shoot the electric at his trail, it electrocutes it.

611
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:09,695
They would just have a lot more kind of these happy, more emergent gameplay modes that we did not go and make that move.

612
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:11,356
We just had these rules of things in the world.

613
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:18,118
We even did this with characters. For example, Night Shift has an upgrade where every time he uppercuts someone, money comes out of them.

614
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,020
And Scratch has an upgrade where every time she collects money, she gets healed.

615
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,802
And so it actually made a very interesting vampire-cat-cleric-warrior combo.

616
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:31,078
that we totally did not account for and it just worked and we

617
00:34:31,098 --> 00:34:34,960
didn't have to do any extra work. So to talk a little bit

618
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,342
about the utility, one example I'm going to use is Gorilla

619
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:39,623
Drilla. Gorilla Drilla has the straight ahead archetype, he

620
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,745
punches and he uses these little drills. He becomes stationary

621
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:44,867
when he does so, you hold it down and the drill stays out

622
00:34:44,907 --> 00:34:48,669
there. Because he becomes stationary when he punches we

623
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,690
wanted to give him a kind of attack that could go much

624
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,552
further out ahead. So when I was designing him I was like, oh

625
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,814
hey, what's kind of a jungle-y thing? Oh I know, Jumanji,

626
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:58,095
wasn't that an awesome movie?

627
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:05,958
kind of was. But either way, the idea was that I was going to have these little, like

628
00:35:06,118 --> 00:35:11,000
a bunch of animals kind of stampede forward in a straight line. Well, when I was just

629
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,682
kind of proxying it up, we had this monkey statue on one of the levels and I swiped the

630
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:17,003
monkey statue and I was just like, oh, we'll just make the monkeys run out.

631
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:22,951
And monkeys running around with just a canned monkey chimp sound playing was so hysterical

632
00:35:23,712 --> 00:35:26,275
that I was like, screw it, I'm just going to have a bunch of crazy monkeys running around.

633
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:29,439
And so at first we started doing just crazy monkeys everywhere

634
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,183
and it started breaking him out of this archetype he was supposed to be in.

635
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:37,551
So we kept the aesthetic, but if you notice, when enemies are a

636
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:40,496
little bit closer, they'll all run to the same target and then

637
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,497
they kind of scatter around.

638
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,961
And that means that they still fall into that hallway

639
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,845
archetype, but it kind of gives you this sense of, oh, a bunch

640
00:35:46,886 --> 00:35:48,248
of crazy freaking monkeys running around.

641
00:35:50,057 --> 00:35:54,559
Actual power. This is probably the hardest one to communicate

642
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,901
to people. But this was how much damage is an enemy or a hero

643
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:02,602
actually outputting. Once again, we don't have recount. We don't

644
00:36:02,622 --> 00:36:06,744
have some damage numbers running in the background. But we had a

645
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,365
very large perception problem. And not in the bad way. We had

646
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:14,187
characters being perceived as too powerful. This is where you

647
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:15,927
got that weird little spike from the damage numbers.

648
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,751
I talked enough about that.

649
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:20,412
So here's an example.

650
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:23,034
So here is FreeRanger.

651
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,715
Sorry, I use dev terms.

652
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:25,455
He's FreeRanger.

653
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:26,896
And we had a kid.

654
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,497
The kid played through the whole level.

655
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:29,818
He was actually in for level testing.

656
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,620
And he said, MagnaCharge is so OP.

657
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,680
He's totally OP.

658
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,421
I think he said that he was beast.

659
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:36,002
I guess beast is a thing kids say now.

660
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:42,264
But he had gotten to this encounter and now if you'll notice that little icon that's kind of flashing at the bottom.

661
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:45,445
In Skylanders if you have a certain element sometimes you're stronger in that area.

662
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:47,986
So this is Free Ranger. He's a melee character.

663
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:50,546
And he was very strong in this area.

664
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:53,607
He's an air character. He was of the right element.

665
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,448
It took the kid 20 seconds to beat this encounter.

666
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,948
We then said, okay, you think you can do it better with Magna Charge?

667
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,909
He's like, yeah, Magna Charge. It's OP. He's OP.

668
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:05,540
He did it with MagnaCharge in 36 seconds.

669
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:07,323
We didn't tell him how long it took,

670
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:09,367
we just asked him how awesome MagnaCharge was.

671
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:11,310
And even after doing this,

672
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,476
he still felt MagnaCharge was more powerful.

673
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:20,288
Managers took a lot longer. He even had to go and pick a guy up and run off the counter or find a cliff.

674
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:24,210
And I know that these things aren't totally controlled experiments.

675
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,351
He did one after he had done the other one.

676
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,273
He had already played this encounter though beforehand.

677
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:32,115
But it just showed that the perception of how powerful a move could be.

678
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:36,358
And in fact, the case of managers, the kid thought they were breaking the game with this ability.

679
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,439
it was a really hard challenge, because now I have a whole bunch of people saying,

680
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,840
you gotta totally get rid of Magneturge's ability,

681
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,261
and it's like, dude, he's not really breaking the game at all,

682
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:45,642
it's all in perception.

683
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,404
So that proved to be very difficult,

684
00:37:49,524 --> 00:37:52,645
and I'm gonna go into a little bit more of that when I get to the communication section.

685
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,547
So that, once again, be mindful of why people are choosing

686
00:37:57,587 --> 00:38:00,609
to play a certain character, because those reasons will change over time.

687
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:03,935
Moving on to the last one, the character within itself.

688
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,920
This is why you want to choose one ability over another ability.

689
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:14,430
So I just want to talk a little bit about how Skylanders upgrade, if you guys don't know already.

690
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:19,034
So with a Skylander, they start with two basic attacks, a primary and a secondary,

691
00:38:19,374 --> 00:38:22,556
and then they can purchase up to four abilities in any order they want usually.

692
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:26,439
After they've bought all four of those, they then get to choose a path.

693
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:28,861
They either go, you know, path A or path B,

694
00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:31,563
and then the soul gem is something that's kind of upgraded.

695
00:38:33,735 --> 00:38:35,597
tangentially because they collected in the level.

696
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:39,961
So, Swapper's a little bit different, a little bit the same,

697
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:42,643
basically a slightly shorter list, but they have it twice,

698
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:44,485
one for the top and one for the bottom.

699
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:48,508
So, what we found that was really important is when we started

700
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:50,590
prototyping these characters, we would go crazy.

701
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,851
We'd be like, oh, we could have this upgraded,

702
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,693
you know, this upgraded, and we'd start prototyping

703
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,034
all the way up the upgrade path.

704
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:59,612
And it created kind of a lot of tangential moves that nobody

705
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:00,513
ever really played.

706
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:03,054
This is Starstrike.

707
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,056
Starstrike is one of my favorite characters.

708
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:07,617
She has two basic moves.

709
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,879
She shoots these little stars, and then she has a spin attack.

710
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:12,500
Now the spin attack will reflect projectiles.

711
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,062
And just as a whim, the designer said, oh, wouldn't it

712
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:18,664
be cool if she could project her own projectile back?

713
00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:21,786
And it kind of created this whole final boss of every

714
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:23,527
Zelda game you've ever played type mechanic.

715
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:24,388
And

716
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:25,629
uh...

717
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:29,770
we just started making a whole new game out of it like hey can could you keep

718
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,591
that ball bouncing the entire level how how well can you do it

719
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:33,431
and it was

720
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:35,151
ridiculously fun

721
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,692
uh... so much fun in fact that we said we're just gonna make the whole darn

722
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:39,833
character all about this

723
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:44,494
uh... and so the first ability is to shoot the stars the second ability is to

724
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:44,954
spin

725
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:46,235
now the third ability

726
00:39:46,715 --> 00:39:48,035
uh... the starfall one right here

727
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:52,296
uh... used to just kind of be a screen attack

728
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:57,539
it would just she'd she'd throw her her fan up in the air and you'd see all these stars kind of fall around her

729
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:03,742
um which had really nothing to do with her core kit and so what ended up happening was we changed

730
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:08,224
it so that when you do it it just creates a little turret and that turret basically provides even more

731
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:12,086
things that you can bounce she actually gets an upgrade where she makes like kind of the you know

732
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:16,248
the fourth uh not fourth of july new year's eve ball drop and that's a giant one that kind of

733
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:17,628
slowly comes down you can spike it away

734
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:23,452
And we found that the more and more we could make all the upgrades kind of keep reinforcing that base mechanic,

735
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:27,976
it made tutorials less important because every time you go into the store,

736
00:40:28,196 --> 00:40:30,537
you're being reminded of how that character kind of plays,

737
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:33,920
and it makes every move useful because you're learning how their basic moves work.

738
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,101
So now when we design characters, we say,

739
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:38,803
get that core set right, I don't care about any upgrades,

740
00:40:39,044 --> 00:40:40,625
make it fun just to do that first thing.

741
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:42,126
And then we move on from there.

742
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:46,827
So that brings me to the next big bullet, the validation and communication.

743
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:48,808
So we learned a lot of these things, we make a lot of changes,

744
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:51,889
but there's a lot of stakeholders in Skylanders,

745
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,970
and you all probably have a lot of stakeholders in your game,

746
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:57,372
and so you have to communicate how and why you're making these changes.

747
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,831
Kid testing, surveys and data is huge.

748
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:06,872
We collected as much data as we possibly can.

749
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:10,034
I actually ended up tricking the team to play the game

750
00:41:10,674 --> 00:41:13,175
because we are in the toy business, we have a 3D printer

751
00:41:13,675 --> 00:41:15,376
and we print a lot of bad toys

752
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:17,117
because we're trying to figure out something.

753
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,718
What I do is I also kind of paint Warhammer minis.

754
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:23,539
And so I was like, I'll just take these junk toys

755
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,139
and I'll paint them up.

756
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:26,720
And I said, hey, if you fill out a survey,

757
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,040
your name gets entered into a raffle.

758
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,422
And so in the end, we ended up getting almost 1,000 surveys

759
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:35,983
with a total of a little over 10,000 lines of actual feedback

760
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:37,163
from the team alone.

761
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:39,064
We sorted it all.

762
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:39,964
We prioritized it all.

763
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:40,745
We went through it all.

764
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:43,466
On top of that, we also had all the feedback from kids,

765
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:45,467
as well as all of our executive meetings.

766
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:48,209
And that gave us a really clear picture

767
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,091
of what types of people liked what types of characters.

768
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:52,892
Once again, we didn't want to make any character

769
00:41:53,212 --> 00:41:54,753
that people were kind of okay with.

770
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:56,914
We would rather make a character that people loved or hated

771
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,115
because we wanted those kids arguing on the playground.

772
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:04,078
The big thing was we wanted to follow up with those stakeholders.

773
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:06,440
Even if we said, hey, we took your feedback

774
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,541
and it was absolute crap and we threw it away,

775
00:42:09,823 --> 00:42:12,985
If you can say why you did that and here's the thing, getting

776
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:15,487
back to someone when they give you feedback makes them feel

777
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:16,928
like you actually listened to them.

778
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:19,790
It was tremendously helpful.

779
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,572
It's a little bit of work, but it actually ended up saving us

780
00:42:22,632 --> 00:42:23,532
a bunch of work in the end.

781
00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:26,834
When you're sitting in these meetings with a lot of people,

782
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:28,456
you really want to rely on those facts.

783
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:29,276
Remove yourself.

784
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:31,478
Because even myself, I am biased.

785
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:32,979
There's some characters I really like to play because

786
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:34,500
they match my style, and some characters I don't.

787
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,672
But when I know that, OK, we just got 50 kids in there,

788
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:39,793
and 45 of them all love this character,

789
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:42,454
that's pretty good in my book.

790
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:43,934
Avoid anecdotal stuff.

791
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:45,155
Use good data.

792
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:46,935
And create as many opportunities to get the

793
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:47,775
feedback as possible.

794
00:42:47,795 --> 00:42:50,536
The more and more you ask feedback from someone, the

795
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:52,537
less they're going to feel like they need to swing by

796
00:42:52,577 --> 00:42:55,298
your desk at 6 o'clock on a Friday to tell you about it.

797
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:56,918
Because they know that you're listening.

798
00:42:56,938 --> 00:42:58,979
They know that you're going to come back to them.

799
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:00,959
And really track that character's history.

800
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,320
So Rollerball is a really good example of this.

801
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,641
We love her because we love roller derby.

802
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:10,302
But originally she was very badly received because when we first showed her

803
00:43:10,342 --> 00:43:12,063
she didn't really have a whole bunch of VFX on her.

804
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,644
And there was a particular control scheme that she used to follow.

805
00:43:15,704 --> 00:43:17,865
So once again she was kind of like a modal character.

806
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:21,046
You would tap a button to put her into this dash move.

807
00:43:21,546 --> 00:43:23,927
Well the only way to get out of the dash move was to tap the button again.

808
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,168
The reason why we made you enter the mode in the first place was because

809
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:31,070
a younger kid has smaller hands and trying to hold multiple buttons at the same time.

810
00:43:31,924 --> 00:43:33,985
it's kind of tricky, especially for a character's core move.

811
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,926
And so what would happen is they would push this mode, and they'd be like,

812
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:39,788
ah, I'm dashing forward, I want to get out of it, and they would let go of the stick.

813
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:41,749
And they've now let go of the controller,

814
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:44,670
and the character is still moving around without their control,

815
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,271
and they felt like they were completely disconnected from the character,

816
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,052
and it was just so uncontrollable.

817
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:52,613
The fix was ridiculously elegant and easy.

818
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:53,654
The designer just said,

819
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,515
oh, well if you let go of the stick you stop 2.

820
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:57,375
Fixed it.

821
00:43:57,795 --> 00:43:59,356
The very next round of kid testing loved it.

822
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:02,637
Problem is that the damage had already been done on the executive level.

823
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:05,678
And so she had a huge amount of negative baggage

824
00:44:05,698 --> 00:44:06,819
when we would go into these meetings.

825
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:11,042
What helped it was I went back, gathered all the feedback and said,

826
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,103
look, here's how the kids received it here.

827
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,165
We made this change and see how now all the kids are receiving it.

828
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:19,087
And even just starting the meeting with that and saying not,

829
00:44:19,147 --> 00:44:21,769
hey, we fixed it, but saying this is what kids think now.

830
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:27,493
It immediately cleared a lot of people's expectations and the meeting moved much, much, much better.

831
00:44:28,654 --> 00:44:32,116
And so it helped us a lot. It helped me stress out a lot less.

832
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:39,669
So that kind of ends this last part. I just have a little bit of a wrap up and then we can do some questions.

833
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:44,214
So the first thing is prioritize the balance for your audience.

834
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:50,121
You want to balance the priorities of your target audience. If you're making a PvP game, please make the PvP most important.

835
00:44:51,883 --> 00:45:03,188
When it comes to balancing, start with your data, even the boring ones, and then use that feedback, and iterate, and iterate, and look at how, if you're seeing trends in your feedback, and make that to fun.

836
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:08,490
You really can't be all numbers like the title of the talk says, you really just gotta get it to where it feels right.

837
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:15,633
Especially when it comes to taking into consideration perception. If a move is perceived as being very powerful, it is powerful.

838
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:21,938
If a move is being perceived as very unpowerful, go add some big VFX and maybe an awesome sound

839
00:45:21,978 --> 00:45:23,320
effect or even a screen shake.

840
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,561
It goes a long way.

841
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:28,885
And then lastly, communicate that feedback.

842
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:34,938
in a very non-biased removing yourself method.

843
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:36,219
Say, hey, look it, here's all the data,

844
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:37,400
here's how we got here.

845
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:39,981
If you understand why all those changes are made

846
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:41,542
and record them, it's gonna be so much easier.

847
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:43,804
And it makes making the next character even easier

848
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,105
because you're like, oh, we've seen this problem before.

849
00:45:46,685 --> 00:45:47,446
Let's not do it again.

850
00:45:47,466 --> 00:45:49,547
And that's gonna help you a lot.

851
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,449
So I think that wraps it up.

852
00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:53,409
Does anyone have any questions?

853
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:54,970
Thank you.

854
00:46:01,223 --> 00:46:02,604
Oh yeah, if you have questions, go to the mic.

855
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:06,124
If you ask a good question, you can just keep walking from the mic and grab a toy.

856
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:09,585
Hi there.

857
00:46:10,345 --> 00:46:13,706
You went into a great detail about how you developed the player characters.

858
00:46:13,826 --> 00:46:17,487
I'm actually curious, did you use a similar process when developing

859
00:46:18,027 --> 00:46:19,307
the enemies for encounters?

860
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:22,248
Like, you only really touched on how much health they had at the start.

861
00:46:23,068 --> 00:46:25,108
So, with the enemies,

862
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:27,969
we actually went through a lot of changes with the AI.

863
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:33,425
The big thing was we kept trying to make more and more variety.

864
00:46:34,046 --> 00:46:38,428
Originally we had very few AI types and we just kind of copied them all over.

865
00:46:38,468 --> 00:46:41,169
We also, all of our enemies had way too many hit points.

866
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:46,311
When we first started doing this we wanted a lot more tactical style combat system

867
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:50,113
where it's like, oh well I'm going to stun this guy and then I'm going to stun this guy

868
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:52,735
and while those two guys are stunned I'm going to go run over and punch this guy.

869
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:58,700
And that just wasn't, it wasn't being played that way, and it made everything seem very boring.

870
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,963
And so we ended up giving the enemies far less health,

871
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:06,869
and when you shorten the lifespan of your enemies, it changes your combat significantly.

872
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:09,471
And so we had to move all of the choices,

873
00:47:10,272 --> 00:47:12,855
not to be, how am I going to kind of juggle all these things,

874
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:15,197
but when it came to AI placement and where they were at.

875
00:47:16,258 --> 00:47:18,539
We originally started our AI being like,

876
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,140
oh, well they could all have victim events

877
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,660
and you need to use this AI and everything.

878
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:26,022
But because we literally make characters up to the last minute,

879
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:29,484
we very quickly realized that we need to set a benchmark for what the AI are

880
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,465
and then balance all the characters to it.

881
00:47:31,925 --> 00:47:33,966
So the AI actually got nailed down pretty quickly.

882
00:47:33,986 --> 00:47:35,727
So yeah.

883
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:36,907
Did that answer the question?

884
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:40,421
Are there any archetypes in particular that you had to drop because they just

885
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:42,364
they were too hard or they didn't work with it?

886
00:47:42,925 --> 00:47:45,769
Or was it more that you just made the enemies too hard to begin with?

887
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:46,971
Um...

888
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:51,838
We definitely ended up cutting... Oh, the question... I'm supposed to repeat these questions.

889
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:55,078
The question was did we end up cutting any AI because they

890
00:47:55,098 --> 00:48:00,082
just ended up being too hard. And the answer is not the AI

891
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:04,186
entirely. We ended up cutting particular functionality to

892
00:48:04,246 --> 00:48:08,050
them. Blocking AI was a huge thing that we fought with for a

893
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,493
very long time. We also had lots of AI that kind of

894
00:48:12,077 --> 00:48:15,080
uh... would summon minions or they would just be too hard and when we made them

895
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:19,024
simpler it kinda they lost the uniqueness in the first place so we're

896
00:48:19,044 --> 00:48:21,226
like okay we're just gonna scrap that functionality

897
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:24,369
we ended up reusing the assets and repurposed but yeah

898
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:26,271
awesome thanks

899
00:48:27,944 --> 00:48:33,126
So now that there's multiple Skyliner games and you have your large backlog of characters,

900
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:37,608
how do you go about ensuring that those older characters are still relevant, especially

901
00:48:37,688 --> 00:48:40,789
with the introduction of swap force and the ability to change your characters?

902
00:48:41,749 --> 00:48:45,690
So the question was how are the old characters still relevant?

903
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:50,052
In Swamp Horse, we did want to make the swappers a little bit

904
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:52,172
more important because, hey, their name is on the box.

905
00:48:53,032 --> 00:48:57,593
But one thing that we did was any new functionality that all

906
00:48:57,633 --> 00:49:00,314
the characters got, we had to go and add back to all of them.

907
00:49:01,034 --> 00:49:01,954
For example, jump.

908
00:49:02,174 --> 00:49:03,375
None of the characters could jump before.

909
00:49:03,415 --> 00:49:04,895
We had to go back and make them all jump.

910
00:49:05,135 --> 00:49:07,295
They all need to know how to rail slide, other

911
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:07,976
things like that.

912
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:11,296
We changed some of how their attack windows worked.

913
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:14,457
We used jump in our game as an escape.

914
00:49:15,177 --> 00:49:16,818
We didn't want to make a hardcore platformer.

915
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:19,438
We put a couple little platforming puzzles off to the side.

916
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,679
But the big thing with Jump was

917
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,080
it would cancel whatever you were doing.

918
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,780
Because if I'm in mid-punch

919
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,441
and a bullet's coming at me,

920
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,462
the fact that the kid even decided to get out of the way

921
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:32,442
is a huge win for them.

922
00:49:32,482 --> 00:49:34,082
And so we actually make them invulnerable

923
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:35,743
for a very couple frames.

924
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:37,583
And kids are like, oh, I narrowly missed that.

925
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:38,403
It's like, actually you didn't.

926
00:49:38,423 --> 00:49:39,644
We made you invincible for a second.

927
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,463
But we had to go and do that for all the old characters to make them feel as responsive and everything like that.

928
00:49:45,503 --> 00:49:51,207
And so whatever the new things will be in the future of Skylanders, it's very important that we...

929
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:55,469
We would, I think, as a parent who also has kids that play Skylanders,

930
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:59,052
I think that kids would feel really betrayed if the old ones just started becoming useless.

931
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:00,373
Thank you.

932
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:07,237
Could you go into a little bit of detail about the fair fight toggle that's in the PvP menu and...

933
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:16,181
given the weight that you guys had placed on balancing for PvP, why you even chose to expose that to the players?

934
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:23,445
The question was, there's a fair fight toggle in the PvP mode and why we even let people choose to do that.

935
00:50:24,785 --> 00:50:30,828
Originally it wasn't exposed and what happened was, we did see some of our, you know...

936
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:36,084
vocal minority, I guess you could call them, who started to notice that we were tweaking

937
00:50:36,104 --> 00:50:42,406
the dials underneath the hood. And so, because that was starting to be perceived as us cheating

938
00:50:42,446 --> 00:50:46,448
to them or lying to them, we wanted to kind of expose it to them and say, all right, look,

939
00:50:46,488 --> 00:50:50,150
if you really want to turn it off, you can go ahead and play with these settings. So,

940
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:54,232
it was one of those things where we observed that kids felt that they were getting a worse

941
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:56,493
experience because we were doing something for them.

942
00:50:58,716 --> 00:51:02,739
Could you go into a little bit of detail about what was modified by the Fair Fight?

943
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:06,361
Uh, the question is what's modified? It's the health.

944
00:51:06,641 --> 00:51:10,924
It's the health and damage resistance, so we actually kind of play with your health and your armor.

945
00:51:11,224 --> 00:51:14,126
So if you're a character that is lower level and has less hit points,

946
00:51:14,746 --> 00:51:17,848
we kind of give you a little bit more. It's like a golf handicap of like,

947
00:51:17,948 --> 00:51:20,890
okay, well you're starting with really low health, you could be two-shot by this guy.

948
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:27,613
And once again, it's like that whole talk about we balance a super heavy such that they don't become super boring.

949
00:51:28,093 --> 00:51:33,215
And it became kind of not fun when a character has just really stacked their health stat

950
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:35,916
and they have a huge amount of health and they go against a character who's very young.

951
00:51:37,716 --> 00:51:42,818
Once again, the kids kind of took care of it themselves, but that was our effort under the hood to make it a little bit more fair.

952
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:45,319
Could I get a Skylander?

953
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:57,310
All right. How are we doing on time? Oh, we still got like, how much time we got?

954
00:51:58,570 --> 00:51:59,630
Seven minutes. All right, we got time.

955
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:08,972
So, say you have a character that you're working on, and you have really opposite opinions from your feedback.

956
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:13,373
What do you usually do to try to satisfy as much as you can?

957
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:16,734
So the question was, what happens when two different...

958
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:21,306
points of feedback come against each other. One is we try to

959
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,990
get more feedback. It's very rare that if you ask ten people,

960
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,792
five of them are going to say one thing and five of them are

961
00:52:26,812 --> 00:52:29,655
going to say the other. The other thing is it really

962
00:52:29,675 --> 00:52:33,560
depends on the issue. So for example, Gorilla Drilla, he has

963
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,562
this ability to call down monkeys. Now the monkeys are

964
00:52:35,622 --> 00:52:37,884
not very useful. They're a little bit chaotic.

965
00:52:38,665 --> 00:52:42,966
And if you play tactically, you really want to go his other upgrade.

966
00:52:42,986 --> 00:52:46,807
His other upgrade gives him a bigger range and it does more damage to his drills.

967
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:50,208
So if you're playing him, quote-unquote, the way that his base level is played,

968
00:52:50,248 --> 00:52:51,828
it's more useful to go the drill route.

969
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:54,529
So we would have people who were kind of the number crunchers,

970
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:58,250
who would be like, why in the hell would you ever buy the monkeys?

971
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,750
They're just so unreliable and everything.

972
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,391
And the counter was always, because they're goddamn monkeys.

973
00:53:03,991 --> 00:53:04,411
And so...

974
00:53:05,752 --> 00:53:08,192
It was one of those things where it wasn't really a problem.

975
00:53:09,012 --> 00:53:11,713
But then in other cases, we would have stuff where, for

976
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:13,374
example, RollerBall has the Soul Gem.

977
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,194
The Soul Gem allows her to headbutt a target, and it

978
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,955
draws a beam between her and her target.

979
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:21,115
And it works like a maypole.

980
00:53:21,295 --> 00:53:25,957
If you skate around and you have the beam, it then does

981
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:27,477
damage to anything that touches the beam.

982
00:53:28,557 --> 00:53:30,938
Now, the fact that it already took me almost a minute to

983
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:32,118
explain how that rule worked.

984
00:53:33,787 --> 00:53:35,327
kind of created a lot of red flags for people.

985
00:53:35,347 --> 00:53:36,448
And people were like, it's gonna be too hard,

986
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:37,548
it's gonna be too complicated.

987
00:53:39,629 --> 00:53:40,789
And so we were like, okay.

988
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:41,970
And so that was starting to get negative.

989
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,270
And in that case, we just focus tested that.

990
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:46,271
And every kid just was like, oh, it's like a maypole.

991
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:48,892
And I'm like, oh, I guess that's common knowledge for kids.

992
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:50,853
I thought maypole was like knitting.

993
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:53,794
Like no one got it, but every kid got it.

994
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,595
And we were like, okay, I guess the kids decided it.

995
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:58,596
So in that case, once again, we went to more data,

996
00:53:58,816 --> 00:54:01,717
more people, or people closer to the thing

997
00:54:01,777 --> 00:54:02,757
and it ended up working.

998
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:05,239
You can get a toy if you want.

999
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,680
I'm not trying to hoard them. If you ask a question, you can take a toy.

1000
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,440
Alright, we'll take two more questions. I think that'll be good, right?

1001
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,421
Two, one.

1002
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:17,221
It sounds like kids can be a bit more irrational and predictable, and then

1003
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:21,002
older players can be a bit more elegant and complex in, I guess, their play styles.

1004
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:21,942
Could you go into some

1005
00:54:22,462 --> 00:54:26,383
pros and cons for testing with children and testing with adults, and uh...

1006
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:31,104
do you think that any game could be useful by having children test it?

1007
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:36,786
So the question was the pros and cons of kid testing and their usefulness in any game.

1008
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:41,769
So absolutely any game can be benefit from kids.

1009
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:47,013
So with kids, the pros are that they're brutally honest,

1010
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:52,437
they have no qualms about your feelings at all.

1011
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:53,858
And additionally...

1012
00:54:54,446 --> 00:55:01,329
A kid is not afraid to fail like an adult is. Amazingly we've had kids who, there was

1013
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:06,472
a bug, a free ranger had a lightning attack. Now the lightning attack was meant to stun

1014
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:10,274
enemies and it would put them in this kind of electrocuted state, you can see their skeleton,

1015
00:55:10,654 --> 00:55:14,756
and it would arc to targets and the more enemies that it arced to, the more damage it would

1016
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:14,916
do.

1017
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:20,615
Well, what it meant is if you just hit an enemy, like a giant golem who couldn't be electrocuted,

1018
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:25,742
it did one point of damage. Now, a golem has 350 hit points. Sorry, spoiler everyone.

1019
00:55:26,402 --> 00:55:29,226
This kid beat the golem using the lightning bolt.

1020
00:55:31,213 --> 00:55:35,716
He played for 15 minutes using the lightning attack over and over and over again.

1021
00:55:35,736 --> 00:55:38,057
And we're like, oh my god, I can't even watch this kid.

1022
00:55:39,038 --> 00:55:40,799
But he saw a number popping up.

1023
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:41,639
He knew he was making things.

1024
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:44,481
And he was not afraid to just do it the hard way.

1025
00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:47,062
Same thing with people who kept missing a jump.

1026
00:55:47,202 --> 00:55:48,823
They would die and die and die and die and die.

1027
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:50,384
And they were like, oh yeah, it's fine.

1028
00:55:50,404 --> 00:55:51,645
We would ask them, was the game too hard?

1029
00:55:51,665 --> 00:55:52,625
And they're like, no, it was just fine.

1030
00:55:54,649 --> 00:56:01,352
Because the whole concept of dying or failure hadn't been ingrained in them by society that you're a stupid idiot if you fail all time

1031
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:07,755
Whereas parents are even a even an even even worse than parents. God forbid you test a teenager

1032
00:56:09,887 --> 00:56:15,051
they feel that they're playing a kids game and if they're seen not being able to completely

1033
00:56:15,191 --> 00:56:20,256
trounce the kids game, that they are horrible. And so they are less likely to even try things.

1034
00:56:20,936 --> 00:56:26,161
And so it was pretty terrifying how afraid of failure some adults are when they wouldn't

1035
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:29,904
want to try something or something like that. So yeah, I mean really kids are almost all

1036
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:30,785
pros other than

1037
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:37,548
A lot of sugar is kind of difficult to maintain when it comes to kids.

1038
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:42,289
We do a lot of testing and you got to get good people to run your kid testing sessions.

1039
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:47,891
And also you can't always listen to what they're saying.

1040
00:56:47,911 --> 00:56:49,631
You have to watch what they're doing.

1041
00:56:50,252 --> 00:56:53,252
So, when we do our kid testing, we have three cameras, one on their face,

1042
00:56:53,592 --> 00:56:55,013
one on the portal and one on the game.

1043
00:56:55,793 --> 00:56:57,514
And we watch what they're doing.

1044
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:58,434
And so, if a kid is...

1045
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,411
his face is getting frustrated or he's not ever pushing a

1046
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:07,914
button, it tells us a million things that they may not come

1047
00:57:07,954 --> 00:57:08,614
out and openly say.

1048
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:12,416
We'll take one more.

1049
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:17,963
First of all, thanks a lot for the presentation.

1050
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:20,445
I thought it was great in terms of content flow,

1051
00:57:20,806 --> 00:57:22,467
the little examples and illustrations.

1052
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:26,050
My question was related to the five play reasons

1053
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:27,432
which change over time.

1054
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:30,355
How did you measure them and compare them?

1055
00:57:32,196 --> 00:57:38,022
OK, so the first thing he said was I was awesome.

1056
00:57:38,242 --> 00:57:39,483
What was the next part again?

1057
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:48,898
The question was about how do we balance the difficulty as it progressed throughout the game?

1058
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:52,265
No, how were the five play reasons measured or compared?

1059
00:57:53,372 --> 00:57:56,413
which change over time? The five reasons you showed?

1060
00:57:56,433 --> 00:58:00,475
Oh, oh, how we measure that. So that was done by a lot of the

1061
00:58:00,555 --> 00:58:03,436
survey data that we got from kids. We would also have a lot

1062
00:58:03,476 --> 00:58:06,358
of kids be repeats. And so we would start to see that kids

1063
00:58:06,418 --> 00:58:09,659
would start to get really good with particular characters. And

1064
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,320
so we would be like, oh, we want to put this character into

1065
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,122
testing again. Make sure that we bring this one person back

1066
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:15,742
because they're

1067
00:58:16,102 --> 00:58:19,063
they're the slobber-toothed player, they're going to give us different feedback than something else.

1068
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,723
So we could then use it as a data point to be like,

1069
00:58:20,803 --> 00:58:24,644
okay, here's what a kid who's played this character for several hours

1070
00:58:24,704 --> 00:58:26,245
and is at the end of the game thinks of it

1071
00:58:26,605 --> 00:58:28,785
versus someone who's never played this character before.

1072
00:58:28,865 --> 00:58:30,405
So it was lots and lots of kids.

1073
00:58:30,425 --> 00:58:33,386
We actually didn't really include our adult data

1074
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,967
because most of our adult data we couldn't track the overtime.

1075
00:58:36,007 --> 00:58:37,867
It was all kid testing that we got that from.

1076
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:41,772
So how could you compare that?

1077
00:58:42,412 --> 00:58:44,735
Let's say appearance mattered the most in the first 30

1078
00:58:45,095 --> 00:58:48,599
seconds, how could you come up with that metric, or that

1079
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,861
number, or that data point?

1080
00:58:50,642 --> 00:58:51,943
So the number for the very first one.

1081
00:58:53,885 --> 00:58:59,670
The number was really just done by a lot of us and our gut of how important it was to them.

1082
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:06,115
For example, if something got them to walk away or put the controller down or they were clearly disengaged

1083
00:59:06,135 --> 00:59:08,597
and they were like, hey can I, like they would literally come out and be like, can I play another game?

1084
00:59:09,098 --> 00:59:11,780
Or they'd be like, I already played this game for a couple minutes, can I have my 70 bucks or whatever?

1085
00:59:13,441 --> 00:59:16,082
that was like, okay, this is ridiculously important to them.

1086
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:19,284
If they would then say, oh, okay, well, no, I'm kind of,

1087
00:59:19,484 --> 00:59:21,965
like, I'm liking this, and they'll tell you they're liking it,

1088
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:24,206
but you could see on their face that was kind of,

1089
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:27,087
and then if, once again, you know when a kid is excited,

1090
00:59:27,127 --> 00:59:28,548
you know when they're engrossed, when they're like,

1091
00:59:28,948 --> 00:59:30,469
I just want to keep playing, you know,

1092
00:59:30,489 --> 00:59:31,549
when it's like, hey, do you want more soda?

1093
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:32,430
And they don't even hear you,

1094
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,390
because they're just engrossed.

1095
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:36,011
We use that as kind of a way to do the ratings.

1096
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:36,972
Thanks.

1097
00:59:36,992 --> 00:59:39,233
All right, I think we're good.

1098
00:59:39,553 --> 00:59:40,373
So thank you guys very much.
