Hi, this is game designer and eSports personality Chris Tang.

00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:07,978
A decade ago, we began the Classic Tetris World Championship to answer the question,

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,981
who is the best Tetris player in the world?

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:18,786
It's since become a surprisingly well-loved eSport, even though we still use old hardware like this to play a 30-year-old 8-bit Nintendo cartridge to get the job done.

5
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:20,588
So, how did we get here?

6
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:25,311
Our format has evolved, making the most of the game's mechanics, quirks, and simplicity,

7
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:29,474
while emphasizing the human element and embracing our explosive memes.

8
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:35,117
Building an inviting, positive community has grown the scene for a game version that may otherwise have been forgotten.

9
00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:39,894
So, maybe something can be learned from our journey and be applied to other games to make

10
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,515
them even more viable for esports.

11
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:46,976
I'm hoping to inspire you to bring out the competitive heart in your game, esport, or

12
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:47,476
community.

13
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:52,058
Come check it out Thursday, March 21st at 5.30pm in Rome 2016.

14
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,759
I'll see you all there to make it BOOM Tetris for GDC!
