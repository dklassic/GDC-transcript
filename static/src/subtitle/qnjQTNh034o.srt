1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,586
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:14,197
Thanks for coming down. I'm Patrick Redding. Before I launch into this, I'm supposed to inform all of you

3
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:19,481
at five o'clock on day three that you're supposed to turn your mobile devices off at this point.

4
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,343
I assume most of you have already done that.

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:28,929
No videotaping or recording of this. That's a prerogative reserved for the folks at GDC who are going to be doing that.

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,193
And I think other than that, if you have questions at the end, there are microphones that are set up in the aisles,

7
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,135
so you're encouraged to use those.

8
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:37,195
Okay.

9
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:43,800
So I want to talk about a problem we have with lost time.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,522
And to be clear, I'm not talking about this kind of lost time.

11
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:49,804
It's only Wednesday.

12
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,365
Maybe by Friday, this will be kind of more relevant.

13
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:54,627
I'm actually talking about the player's time.

14
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:58,089
And in the spirit of this, I'm going to back up a bit.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,283
When a developer has put on a few years and has maybe shipped a few mass market games,

16
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:09,345
they will at some point invariably have some version of this conversation.

17
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:13,267
Why do we have the genres that we have?

18
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:17,609
Why have mass market games kind of settled into this particular landscape?

19
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:20,471
And the answer to that is some variation on this.

20
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,573
It's to maximize the production values and constrain the design space.

21
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:27,835
So AAA games.

22
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:31,363
which also need to be legitimately interactive,

23
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:35,311
are expected to meet kind of steadily escalating expectations

24
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:38,638
in terms of sensory immersion, in terms of accessibility,

25
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,020
in terms of visual quality, and the like.

26
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:47,462
designers also need to be able to limit the range of the game's outputs and minimize the

27
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:52,725
amount of energy they spend dealing with edge cases, you know, dealing with the player colliding

28
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:57,289
with the edges of the simulation. And so there are only really kind of a few sort of games

29
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:02,392
that meet both those criteria. But to be fair, there are also plenty of games and quite a

30
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:05,734
few developers, including I imagine a few in this room, who are

31
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:10,872
who have managed to challenge that point, challenge the first point, kind of say that

32
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,255
the AAA emperor is wearing no clothes, etc.

33
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:14,757
But what about that second point?

34
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:23,086
So if you haven't seen it in the sort of critical path segment of many kinds of combat, Alex

35
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:26,389
Hutchinson talks about the fact that, you know, one of the reasons why...

36
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:31,101
game franchises, genres have settled into the kind of preoccupation that they have with

37
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:35,646
combat and life and death struggles, is because we can't underestimate the value in taking

38
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:38,008
people out of play and taking people off the board.

39
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:43,653
When you let the losing guy stick around, it generates this kind of cascading series

40
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:46,556
of problems that you then have to manage, like, well then what happens after that?

41
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:47,297
What happens next?

42
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:50,881
Whereas when we go with kind of existential conflicts,

43
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:55,085
we're able to really limit and constrain the scale of that problem

44
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:58,989
and give us, the designers, but also the player, kind of a reset button.

45
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:01,845
There's another facet to it.

46
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:04,966
This is Jesper Juul, who wrote a book called The Art of Failure

47
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:06,587
and has spoken extensively about this.

48
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:08,528
And he points out that over the years,

49
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:11,330
we've also kind of trained up a generation of players

50
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,571
for whom this is fun, right?

51
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:17,413
Like dashing yourself at the kind of groundhog day

52
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:22,336
cycle of trial and error is a kind of fun,

53
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,777
as long as the refractory period is short enough, right?

54
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:31,344
And so we're at the stage now where we're even starting to make games that are offering a commentary about the fact that people find that sort of thing fun.

55
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:40,453
So, this is the prevailing model of failure that we have right now.

56
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:45,719
I'd like to tell you that this is some kind of elegant step function, but actually this is just a cliff.

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,441
You fall off the failure cliff.

58
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:56,454
right? And it's a frictionless, unclimbable cliff, and the game state collapses into something

59
00:03:56,474 --> 00:04:02,218
that the player isn't capable of reversing. Alright, so let's say that this weird shape

60
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,860
represents the kind of sum total of the possible states supported by the game simulation, right?

61
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:11,365
This isn't really a very rigorous or scientific model, but it's simple.

62
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:16,667
Every time, enough time passes and the player will eventually cross the magic threshold

63
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:18,887
that tells the game that it should return a failed state.

64
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:24,509
So there's an interrupt, the game resets itself, and the player respawns.

65
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:29,450
Now what's interesting about that is that big orange dot

66
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:33,749
that you see over there on the far left, sits outside of that state space.

67
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,391
Why is that interesting?

68
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:40,774
Well, because what it means is that ultimately the cost of failure is external to the game.

69
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:41,955
Think about that.

70
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:48,273
I'm going to be willing to bet that most of the people in this room put some kind of premium on the consistency of the player experience.

71
00:04:48,993 --> 00:04:54,617
But what we're saying is that this one very critical recurring aspect of the player experience, namely failure,

72
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:57,920
incurs a cost that can't possibly be measured.

73
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,363
Because the value of a person's time is completely dependent on who they are and the kind of life that they live.

74
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,385
It depends on...

75
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:10,681
a number of things but it's safe to say that even if they're playing the same game

76
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:13,246
that the cost for this guy is going to be different from the cost

77
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:14,128
for this guy.

78
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:17,969
But that's what we have right now.

79
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,411
And implicit in that is a kind of bargain

80
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,712
that exists between the player and the game, right?

81
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:25,234
Which says that in return for submitting themselves

82
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,895
to this binary failure model,

83
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:31,198
players have an expectation that they can evaluate

84
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:33,679
the risks associated with the actions

85
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:34,560
that they're about to take.

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,322
And also that they have enough of an understanding

87
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:39,743
of the game state that they can kind of manage

88
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:41,244
its complexity, they can plan for it.

89
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:42,745
In other words, the player says to,

90
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,066
the game says to the player, I'm winnable.

91
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,860
Now, we also have to acknowledge, and this is great, right, that in recent years there's

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,360
been a shift.

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,962
You know, we've seen new games all the time that are challenging the established assumption

94
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,502
about what happens when a player fails.

95
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:05,284
But we can think of these as approaches that are trying to kind of sweeten the deal for

96
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:05,684
the player.

97
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:06,604
Right?

98
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:11,806
They're still dealing with the currency of player time, but doing it in a way of, that's

99
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:13,687
kind of, it's because it's a way of offloading the problem.

100
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:19,849
So trying to apply some multiplier to the failures effects on the game and make sure

101
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:24,773
that it's worth more than just lost time and also at the same time start to bring back

102
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,555
some of those consequences into the game state.

103
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:28,136
So what are some examples of that?

104
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:34,507
So we see in kind of persistent world games and in MMOs this kind of commitment to the

105
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,729
idea that your resources are recoverable.

106
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,954
Your stuff has a persistence in the game and that generates its own kind of tension.

107
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:45,557
You respawn and it immediately turns into a race to try to recover what you may have

108
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,618
dropped before it slips into the lava, as it were.

109
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,261
Some games...

110
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,834
give the player a mechanic for managing the cost of their own potential failure

111
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:58,576
while still staying within the kind of narrative logic of the game, or the metaphor of the game,

112
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,937
and then tweak it to make sure it doesn't become an exploit.

113
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:03,938
You know, and we've seen an interesting evolution of that. You saw that between

114
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:04,878
Bioshock 1

115
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:05,919
and Bioshock 2,

116
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,760
uh, something happens with the Vita Chambers,

117
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:10,501
you know, so when you use them,

118
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:12,422
there's this kind of reset factor

119
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:15,003
to what's going on with the rest of the world, and it becomes a way of

120
00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:19,485
preventing the kind of grind of going up against big daddies in these sort of boss-like moments.

121
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:26,363
In sports games where you have an ongoing dynasty mode, or in any squad game where the

122
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:32,965
player is managing and investing in a rotating roster of player characters, there's this

123
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,207
interesting effect where as a particular character gets better and better and becomes more of

124
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:42,229
an asset to the larger goal, the player's own sense of investment causes them to second

125
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:42,869
guess their use.

126
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:49,015
So it's that problem of you start to become overly protective of the one guy that can make a difference in the battle.

127
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:52,537
You don't want them to get killed, you don't want them to end up on the injured list or dead.

128
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:55,398
It's a very strange phenomenon with that.

129
00:07:55,418 --> 00:08:09,405
I think it's also interesting we have games which are very transparent about the fact that when the player fails, it's kicking off a completely new mode of play.

130
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:13,277
It's basically, you know, if you're playing Max Payne 3 or you're playing Borderlands,

131
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:17,739
for example, and you get killed under certain circumstances, the game simply stops everything

132
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,221
and presents you with a mini-game of trying to track down the person responsible for your

133
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:25,263
death and take them out in order to kind of recover the right to continue with the game.

134
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:30,806
In a game like SSX or Forza, there's a rewind feature which, you know, becomes increasingly

135
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:34,908
valuable the further into the session you are and potentially allows you to recover

136
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,989
that loss without having to completely restart everything.

137
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:42,725
And then still other games establish an entire resource, practically, around failure.

138
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:47,915
The idea that as you're grinding your way through things, you experience this kind of specific loss.

139
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,999
Loss of humanity in Dark Souls, for example.

140
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:55,640
And of course we're seeing games like Rogue Legacy which kind of bring combinations of these

141
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,462
strategies together, right?

142
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:58,223
This sort of

143
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:01,167
recoverable resources linked with the

144
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:03,530
uh... the kind of upgrade loss

145
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,312
uh... in the form of your heirs

146
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,816
who inherit some combination of these things in a modified way

147
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:11,299
uh... is kind of the very essence of that game.

148
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:18,321
But these are all strategies ultimately for keeping the player from running away with the game.

149
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,862
Keeping them from colliding with the limits of the simulation.

150
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:24,463
But hard failure conditions, no matter how you slice it, are kind of inelegant.

151
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:28,744
I mean, there's specific circumstances in which they just flat out don't feel that great.

152
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:31,725
Like, for example, in multiplayer games, the session must go on.

153
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:33,926
It's not going to stop just because one person dies.

154
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,787
So guess what? You're going to have to deal with that.

155
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:45,346
That's why we would like to look at how to bring that player mitigation back into the

156
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:47,727
fold of the core game experience.

157
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:54,370
We want to expose the player to survivable changes in their immediate situation from

158
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,511
which they can then find their way back to something stronger, something more sustainable.

159
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:04,774
So think about why a player spins out in the middle of a race.

160
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:08,480
it's because they're doing the thing they're supposed to be doing

161
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,223
they're driving fast, they're driving as fast as they possibly can, they're driving

162
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:12,844
too fast

163
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,665
which is really what they should be doing

164
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:18,689
and what they're doing is they're going so fast that they're exceeding the

165
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:22,093
performance envelope of the vehicle that they're driving or their own skills

166
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,414
you know and so

167
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:27,958
depending on some other related driving skills that might be fine that might be

168
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:28,739
the opportunity

169
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,960
for them to kind of

170
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:35,643
rest control back of the vehicle and get things back on track with a minimal loss of momentum.

171
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,886
Sure, some players, depending on what their motivations are, trying to beat their best

172
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:42,567
time, they're going to stop and reload and go back to the beginning of that.

173
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:46,969
But for a certain core group of players, the important thing is that they've maintained

174
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,250
the continuity of that experience.

175
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,251
This is the function of a setback.

176
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:56,014
So when we talk about setbacks, just to be clear...

177
00:10:57,002 --> 00:11:00,563
You know, these are arising out of the game's low-level mechanics.

178
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:03,644
It's not something we design into the map.

179
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:11,446
We're talking about something that is not a forced mode change, it's not an exotic gameplay

180
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:15,047
sequence, it's not a scripted moment where Nathan Drake is tossed out of the back of

181
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:19,068
a cargo plane in mid-air, even though that obviously fits the narrative definition of

182
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:19,548
a setback.

183
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:20,328
That's not what we mean.

184
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,845
We're talking about a prolonged period of gameplay.

185
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:30,529
And it arises from the same systems that the player's using the rest of the time.

186
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,254
It's preventing runaway behavior, but it's still allowing play to continue,

187
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:36,075
survivably.

188
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:42,060
And it's perceptibly altering the state of the game in some meaningful way.

189
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:43,302
It's interesting.

190
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:51,703
So this experience, if we want to think of it aesthetically, is directly analogous actually

191
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:55,067
to going through a reversal in the kind of traditional narrative sense.

192
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:59,813
It yields that water cooler anecdote moment that's completely the player's own.

193
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:00,894
So there I was.

194
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:08,705
But dynamically what it means is that the system defined by the player and the game

195
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:14,548
interacting at runtime is able to absorb serious shocks and recover without interruption.

196
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,870
It's resilient in the way that economists typically use the term.

197
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,652
So what we want to do is we want to replace the failure cliff with something a little

198
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,413
softer and a little more reversible.

199
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,815
Something that follows a bit more of the kind of stimulus response curve.

200
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:34,799
And that kind of behavior emerges from having a feedback system that prevents the player

201
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:40,122
from progressing unimpeded into meaningless degenerate end state, while at the same time

202
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:45,625
plucking them out of that, kicking them back into a more volatile game condition in which

203
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:50,068
success is by no means ensured, but without driving them to the point where they rage

204
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:50,308
quit.

205
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:59,114
my idea, this isn't new, it was established by a lot of different people including notably

206
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:04,337
Clint Hawking in his 2009 talk on improvisational play which was entitled appropriately enough

207
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:08,879
fault tolerance. And in describing the player's experience on Far Cry 2 for example which

208
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:15,602
was this kind of friction generated by systems like malaria, Max is laughing at me, weapons

209
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:21,084
jamming, fire, propagating fire, all these various other functions, the player is really

210
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,866
getting hit with these kind of small inputs.

211
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,468
And they rarely die from these events,

212
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:28,830
but it's unpredictable, right?

213
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,111
It forces them to adapt.

214
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,173
And it's exactly because they are small and unpredictable

215
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:35,014
that the player doesn't feel this kind of compulsion

216
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:36,375
to quit and reload.

217
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,398
So, just to quickly illustrate the difference

218
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:42,059
between what a failure is and a setback is,

219
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,440
if you're flying in a helicopter

220
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,442
and your main rotor goes out, that's a fail.

221
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:48,384
If you're flying in a helicopter

222
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,425
and your tail rotor goes out, that's a setback.

223
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:53,658
So basically, you now need to look for a place to land as

224
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:54,338
soon as possible.

225
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,481
You need to modify the way you're using the helicopter to

226
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,042
sort of rely on auto rotation.

227
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,144
And you need to somehow get the thing down without loss of

228
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:02,765
craft or crew.

229
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,346
OK, well, that's cute.

230
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,488
But we need a more formal definition than that.

231
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:12,472
So a setback needs to disrupt the player's focus on their

232
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:13,673
current low-level activity.

233
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:17,796
It also needs to revise the player's awareness of the

234
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,757
game's state or context.

235
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:26,738
In other words, a setback can be defined as that moment when the player's immediate goal

236
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,360
changes unexpectedly.

237
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:38,590
That says that setbacks are built out of the switching off between what the player thought

238
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,471
they were going to be doing...

239
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:43,986
and a new priority that's absolutely critical to the continuation of play.

240
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:48,229
So if we can work with that definition right away, we can start to understand the scope

241
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,172
of potential setbacks in terms of a broader system of player goals.

242
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:59,117
So, luckily, there's a lot of work out there that establishes general taxonomies of player goals,

243
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,938
and the good news is they're mostly pretty finite.

244
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:05,661
Lots of people are already familiar with Bjork and Halperin's patterns in game design,

245
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:07,863
so I've kind of adapted the list that they use.

246
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:09,344
There's 13 goals that they talk about.

247
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:10,005
This is them.

248
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:11,364
Yeah, there they come.

249
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:15,304
I've re-termed them a little bit to put them in verb form.

250
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:18,165
But out of these 13, what's interesting

251
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,826
is, if you just start with the transitions that

252
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,946
go from a single goal A to a single goal B

253
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:25,587
and from that same goal B back to goal A,

254
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,327
because for our purposes, those are distinct,

255
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:28,927
out of those 13 goals, you're going

256
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:31,468
to get about 650 unique transitions.

257
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:32,768
A little more, a little less, I don't know.

258
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:34,149
That's not too many.

259
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,349
And out of those, we only really care

260
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:38,550
about the subset that's systemic, recoverable,

261
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:38,990
and interesting.

262
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:44,154
but also the ones that keep the player in the sweet spot

263
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:46,215
between wanting to quit the game and trade it in

264
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:49,897
or being so inconsequential as to get lost

265
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:54,060
in the noise of moment-to-moment challenge.

266
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,821
So that's an interesting model, but it's still too abstract.

267
00:15:57,882 --> 00:16:00,703
I want to try applying it to the types of games I'm the most familiar with.

268
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,945
So I want to look at the stealth genre. I want to look at

269
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:06,006
failure in stealth games, which typically looks like this.

270
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,154
So classically, stealth games have relied on four key pillars.

271
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:17,479
You've got the fragility of the game state, the fact that the game starts the player out

272
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,062
undetected by the game's ecosystems,

273
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:23,906
and the player's challenge is to try to preserve that state moving forward.

274
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,997
there's the fact that that ecosystem is a simulation, right?

275
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:32,240
It exists independently of the player.

276
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:34,283
It's analog for the most part.

277
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:36,766
So the player needs to use their intuition,

278
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:39,350
their observational skills, in order to read the AI,

279
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,471
in order to read the environment

280
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,334
and understand the gameplay potential there.

281
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,442
And the player is really incentivized to do that by the fact that they're not very powerful,

282
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:49,264
typically, in the kind of classical model.

283
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:55,209
The game imposes, often, survival horror levels of scarcity in terms of resources, in terms

284
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:59,152
of ammunition and health and all of the other resources at the player's disposal.

285
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:03,075
And if they do get into a fight, they're better off running away, typically.

286
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:06,898
Now the flip side to that...

287
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,923
is that if these games are richly systemic as they often are,

288
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:13,064
they're typically pretty high agency.

289
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,388
Players are afforded a lot of tools and opportunities for playing with the AI

290
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,410
and finding creative solutions to get through a problem.

291
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:28,037
Now, the classical hardship of stealth, though, was always that almost anything the player

292
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:29,598
does disturbs the system.

293
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:35,239
And once the player falls off that, what's called the detection cliff, it's hard to support

294
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,019
many ways for them to continue moving forward.

295
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,481
It forces the player, ultimately, to be a perfectionist, sometimes literally by returning

296
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:48,262
the game over if an alarm is tripped, or, at best, forcing the player to make a run

297
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:48,522
for it.

298
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:50,263
So...

299
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:56,070
The early solution to that has been to go through some kind of strange contortions to

300
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:57,692
limit the player's exposure.

301
00:17:58,373 --> 00:18:02,597
That leads to some sort of arbitrary level design solutions like resetting the AI after

302
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:03,899
each section.

303
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,082
And that doesn't really encourage experimentation.

304
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:13,371
So that model of stealth maps to these kinds of goal transitions.

305
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:17,255
So this is classical stealth in terms of goal transitions the way I was describing it.

306
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:22,741
So from this initial state, the player either needs to explore the world in order to reveal

307
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:26,905
the various objectives available to them, or maybe because it's on some kind of formal

308
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:28,847
mission structure, they just need to get from A to B.

309
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:30,429
They just need to get into the mission space.

310
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:35,586
And then from there, they need to align themselves to be able to go through a collection of objectives,

311
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:39,187
some of which are probably mandatory, some of which may be optional.

312
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:45,269
And the main disruption occurs when they come into first contact with the enemy and have

313
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:46,589
to get past them undetected.

314
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:50,470
They need to paint some kind of picture of the state of the game and understand where

315
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,731
the enemy is at and what they're doing.

316
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:58,312
Which leads to, usually, some fairly trivial goal shifting, either to realign or to maybe

317
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,413
get to some kind of safe haven.

318
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:08,894
And this is notable because for much of play in this kind of game, doing nothing is actually

319
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:09,855
a really good strategy.

320
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,939
And the player has these kind of extended periods of stimulated planning.

321
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,241
Not exactly action-packed.

322
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,825
And when there is a major setback, frankly, it almost collapses the game entirely, and

323
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:24,188
assuming that it's not a straight-up game over, the player's probably booking it.

324
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:32,368
Okay, so what we'd like to do is let the player recover from those kinds of situations and

325
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:36,091
restore the game to a condition where they're hidden, where they're back to being stealthy

326
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,292
and they're doing what they like to do.

327
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:39,873
And we want them to be able to do that systemically.

328
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:46,998
Jamming open the detection window by preventing a single instance of the AI from wrecking

329
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,461
everything and from propagating that detection to the rest of the world.

330
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:57,296
We want to assume that if you're some kind of elite spy or thief or assassin or hitman,

331
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:01,897
that you have it in your ability to take out that one stupid guy that's going to sound

332
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:06,158
the alarm and kind of climb your way back up the detection cliff in order to get into

333
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:06,798
a state of stealth.

334
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:08,839
Alright.

335
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:13,540
So for the rest of the talk, what we're going to do is we're going to kind of...

336
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:19,237
go through and look at kinds of gameplay models that are doing what I'm talking about.

337
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:20,958
We're going to look at recovery dynamics.

338
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,839
And there are a lot of different ways

339
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:24,900
that players try to modulate

340
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,162
their ability, sort of the games try to modulate the player's ability

341
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:29,003
to recover.

342
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,725
And when we look at them in terms of goal transitions, it starts to become clear

343
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,947
which strategies do a good job of exposing the player

344
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:37,087
to good setbacks.

345
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:39,309
And which ones don't.

346
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:45,813
The Save Anywhere model is going to be familiar to anybody who's been playing a lot of Skyrim

347
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,313
on PC.

348
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:47,093
Right?

349
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:50,334
You've been writing the quick save, quick load buttons, you know.

350
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:54,815
This can be satisfying, I mean, it's in its own way, but make no mistake, it degenerates

351
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:55,175
the game.

352
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:55,756
Right?

353
00:20:56,116 --> 00:21:01,437
In terms of our model, it effectively reduces any situation in the game to incremental experimentation.

354
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:04,078
And that is a valid way to play that game.

355
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,528
But it does quickly hollow out whatever sense of context

356
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,689
the player has over time.

357
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,550
And it renders it mostly inconsequential

358
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,691
in the context of the game.

359
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:20,314
Unfortunately, the console-friendly flip side

360
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:22,015
of that doesn't fare a whole lot better.

361
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:25,857
In this case, the player in a corridor shooter

362
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:28,459
simply has to endure the designer's intentions

363
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,460
and reach the next trigger volume.

364
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,882
In fact, they might not actually have to do anything else.

365
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,623
They might not have to fire a shot.

366
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:44,024
Again, that act of traversal to get from point A to point B effectively collapses the game

367
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:49,506
into a challenge that totally undermines the mechanical tension.

368
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:58,509
So another solution is for games to deliver what's really kind of a thousand foot view

369
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:02,010
on the game world, accompanied by kind of a rich information layer.

370
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,482
If you compare Clay's Mark of the Ninja with, for example, Dishonored,

371
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:09,445
two games that share several core mechanics,

372
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,669
the side-scrolling format means that players can see

373
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:16,432
exactly what part of the world they can disturb.

374
00:22:17,053 --> 00:22:19,836
And they have a lot of UI tools for monitoring the state of the AI,

375
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:23,019
even when they're obscured, when they're hidden behind a wall or a door.

376
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:29,805
And when something does happen that disrupts the player's intentions, it slips the game

377
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,666
back into a goal of alignment.

378
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:34,729
And so this has a kind of interesting effect.

379
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:39,393
It sort of, having such a complete tactical picture of the world around you effectively

380
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:43,817
turns the game into kind of a strategy game, even though it's, you know, it's this 2D side-scrolling

381
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:44,898
platforming stealth experience.

382
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:48,482
And you know, Mark of the Ninja is a hugely satisfying game.

383
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:52,625
It just, it happens to rely on a different mechanism in order to deliver.

384
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,443
that sense of setback. It's not coming from

385
00:22:56,104 --> 00:22:59,528
necessarily a lack of information the way it would in a more immersive style

386
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:00,950
of stealth game.

387
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:01,871
And plus which,

388
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:05,836
because of the format that it uses, there is a more rapid turnaround when you fail

389
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:06,517
and need to reload.

390
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,000
So it isn't punishing in that respect.

391
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:16,066
You know we talked earlier about how we put a premium on the consistency of the player experience

392
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:23,330
but some games will change the rules on the fly as a hedge against players selling short when the chips are down

393
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,813
and so they basically stated that that consistency is not as important as trying to keep the player in the game

394
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,013
and that's a valid choice.

395
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:33,874
You can sort of see the carrot version of this with fighting games that feature damage

396
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:35,996
scaling or some kind of desperation mode.

397
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:43,341
And ultimately, what happens is the player learns over time that the trick is to absorb

398
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:47,144
punishment until the game delivers them the means of recovery.

399
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:53,509
And the effect of that is, again, to reduce the sense of consequence to the game.

400
00:23:56,125 --> 00:24:00,286
The stick version of that can be seen in games that use some kind of token-based damage system

401
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:05,088
so that players that are in an otherwise skill-based game can end up suffering certain kinds of

402
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:06,308
setbacks deterministically.

403
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:11,670
So to use a stealth example, AI enemies in the Batman Arkham games who will start targeting

404
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,391
destructible gargoyles in challenge rooms as a way of interfering with the player's

405
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:18,492
ability to maneuver and use the kind of Batman swinging around.

406
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:24,448
Well, the mechanism is the same, but actually the player's perception of it is the polar

407
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:27,949
opposite because in their view the game has taken something away from them and now it

408
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,170
takes them time to get it back.

409
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:35,852
So in that case, the perception is that it's pushing against them, it's frustrating or

410
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,972
foiling their attempts to do the thing that they want to do.

411
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,114
So those kinds of tweaks need to be applied conservatively.

412
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:46,255
So I want to talk for a second about the example of Dungeons of the Endless.

413
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,732
This is interesting, right? We have this sort of roguelike experience

414
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:54,456
where the players need to manage limited resources in order to get to the exit, if you will,

415
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:55,837
of the current section that they're in.

416
00:24:56,657 --> 00:24:57,538
That's pretty straightforward.

417
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:01,101
What spices it up is the fact that then we have these additional rooms

418
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:02,662
that are kind of these mystery boxes.

419
00:25:03,383 --> 00:25:07,306
And the risk-reward trade-off is by opening some of them up,

420
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,388
you can potentially add to your resource pool, but

421
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:12,170
you can also unleash additional horrors

422
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,452
on top of the ones that are already standing in your path.

423
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,647
And so this generates a fair amount of tension in a very simple way.

424
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:23,350
Now what's interesting is the simplest kind of tension economy is really just in a sports

425
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:23,550
game.

426
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,532
It's when you have two teams that are both scoring points at the same time.

427
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:29,613
So

428
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:35,696
this type of approach applies to a number of different games. It's very interesting to see that it crosses a lot of genre boundaries.

429
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:40,860
That kind of simple Red Queen scenario, with the kind of moving goalposts,

430
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,704
forces or pressures the player to switch goals when the point deficit between them and the other side gets too big.

431
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:50,427
So that would be what we'd call a single-axis tension economy.

432
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:55,810
The points can go up, the point spread can go down, but whether I have four points or twelve points...

433
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:59,312
matters only in terms of how many points the other side has.

434
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,593
Right, and so that sets the context for the game.

435
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,454
What that means in terms of goal transitions is that

436
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:09,035
it forces the player to abandon the kind of luxury objectives,

437
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:12,056
you know, the collection of objectives you kind of see on the far left over there,

438
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:14,117
in favor of the most expedient goals,

439
00:26:14,477 --> 00:26:16,498
such as taking the opposing force out of play,

440
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:18,598
or going all-in on the main prize.

441
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:20,519
Now...

442
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:25,300
you get a more nuanced output in tension economies when you add a second economy

443
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,883
that just consists of time that's slowly chipping away.

444
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,625
So you can take a game like Rim Capsule, which is real time,

445
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:37,368
the player has to watch the clock, they're frantically completing all of these critical tasks.

446
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:40,712
you know, building their bases, scanning their monoliths, all the stuff that they gotta get

447
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:41,853
done within 45 minutes.

448
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,320
And then just waiting for that exact moment to like pull back into defensive positions

449
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,205
because the next big wave, increasingly large wave of enemies is gonna come in and try to

450
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:52,126
mitigate the effects of that.

451
00:26:54,508 --> 00:26:58,571
It works in a turn-based game as well. So you can take Invisible Inc., the game formerly

452
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:05,116
known as Incognita, and every time the player's little team of spies makes a move, it's depleting

453
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:09,359
one little tick from this kind of finite pool of time that's available to them to complete

454
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:14,123
the mission. And so when it hits zero, the whole map goes into alert, and suddenly the

455
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:18,786
reinforcements show up hot on your heels. And so this puts an interesting counter-pressure

456
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:21,628
on the player, where they have to decide how greedy they want to be.

457
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,271
They have to decide how many of these juicy optional objectives that are available to them

458
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,431
they want to try to go after.

459
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:31,334
And of course they're willing to overextend themselves a little bit each time

460
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:34,335
when they know that the SWAT guys are coming in through the main doors

461
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:35,656
and are going to chase them down to the exit.

462
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:43,824
And so, with the addition of that second economy, it kind of brings the dynamics of the game more fully into view.

463
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:48,151
And what you're seeing is that it adds this layer of suspense to the player's decision-making,

464
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:52,718
because it's no longer feasible for the player to succeed just through simple attrition.

465
00:27:55,966 --> 00:28:01,929
That's interesting. So let's look at games that offer a kind of level playing field and symmetry between opposing sides.

466
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:06,471
This applies to everything from head-to-head fighting games, to sports games, to some MOBAs.

467
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:13,015
And what we can say is that table turning, as we're going to call it here, becomes enabled when the sort of mid-level,

468
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:21,779
kind of minute-to-minute play between the two sides consists of them being engaged in a symmetric, back-and-forth contest of control over territory.

469
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,864
And then that's driven or enabled by this low level or second-to-second gameplay

470
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:31,009
that's basically kind of like rock-paper-scissors contests between individual units,

471
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:34,393
but it's perturbed or spiked by short-term power-ups.

472
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,775
So that's what's kind of driving this.

473
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:40,519
And what comes out of that is that the player's immediate focus,

474
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,203
both the player and also his opposition, which is kind of a mirror image of him,

475
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:48,628
is shifting back and forth between goals and counter-goals.

476
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:51,210
Goals and the goals that are designed to block those goals.

477
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,733
And the opposition is doing the same thing.

478
00:28:54,814 --> 00:28:57,116
And this is relevant in talking about stealth games

479
00:28:57,677 --> 00:29:00,480
because it powers this kind of ongoing role reversal

480
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,722
that you get between the hunter and the hunted,

481
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:05,345
particularly in games where the AI is operating

482
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:07,948
with a fairly strong enough perception model.

483
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:15,398
And the same conditions that allow the player to break line of sight with the AI and remain

484
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:19,700
hidden are also depriving the player of a full picture of the game state, of the game

485
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:19,960
world.

486
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,002
And it's making it risky for them to move out of hiding because the wrong move could

487
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:29,244
bring them into immediate close quarters contact with an enemy and alert the entire space and

488
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:30,524
cause the situation to flip itself.

489
00:29:34,593 --> 00:29:36,877
you get interesting setbacks emerging

490
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:39,340
when the game dynamically plays

491
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:43,387
with the amount of space that's actually available to the player on the fly.

492
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:49,058
So in GTA, this happens because the verbs available to the player, when they're driving

493
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:55,883
anyway, are all really designed to increase the localized amount of chaos in the world,

494
00:29:55,903 --> 00:29:57,644
the amount of destruction that they're putting into the world.

495
00:29:58,184 --> 00:30:01,727
And that becomes a magnet for this sort of aggressive law enforcement response.

496
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:04,429
And we all know how that ends up, right?

497
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:10,873
You get this cop car dog pile that results in clogged roads, and the roads are already

498
00:30:10,913 --> 00:30:11,774
hard enough to drive through.

499
00:30:12,074 --> 00:30:26,750
It triggers this immediate goal transition where the player has to switch from paying attention to all of the various mission objectives they may have had active at that point to realigning themselves around just stealth and hiding in a car and eliminating enemies and trying to overcome.

500
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,411
the kind of amassing numbers of vehicles that are getting in their way.

501
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:33,052
And it's forcing all these snap decisions and maneuvers

502
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:40,294
until things are getting progressively more claustrophobic and clogged and clogged and clogged, at which point the player of their own volition entirely

503
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:46,756
elects usually to make a mode switch. They abandon their car and they take off on foot, just like in real life.

504
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,777
By leaning heavily on the destructibility of cover,

505
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:55,519
Battlefield 4, for example, can set up conditions

506
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,122
where the players who are taking the smartest tactical

507
00:30:59,342 --> 00:31:03,345
decisions, they're moving into buildings that afford them

508
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:05,646
a good line of sight on their enemies

509
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:08,048
and creating excellent fire positions for them.

510
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:12,251
So doing are, of course, becoming huge magnets then

511
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:15,373
for return fire, which necessarily creates

512
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:18,595
this disproportionate effect when the entire building comes

513
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:19,176
crashing down.

514
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:23,380
So through that small action, that seemingly intelligent move from a tactical point of view,

515
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:31,389
that player has set off a chain of events that results in this kind of massive reformatting or restructuring the battlefield space.

516
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:39,999
When we look at stealth games, we can see that this approach approves these interesting setbacks just by flipping the dynamic lighting state of the game.

517
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:40,860
So in other words...

518
00:31:41,797 --> 00:31:44,957
you leave a dead body lying around, the AI gets disturbed, the next thing you know the

519
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:45,577
lights come on.

520
00:31:45,797 --> 00:31:49,918
So what's interesting about that is that area denial does not have to rely on literally

521
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:54,539
physically blocking the player, it can just simply be taking an area that was dark and

522
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,360
now making it light and now it's not opportune for the player to move through that space

523
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,680
anymore.

524
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:07,742
So with Civilization V and the transition to Civ V, there were four key rule changes.

525
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:12,801
that helped to power some very specific kinds of setback situations.

526
00:32:14,362 --> 00:32:20,748
One, unit production became limited, became curtailed to the point where individual units

527
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,089
became rather precious.

528
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,355
The second was that it became possible for an individual unit to lose a skirmish, to

529
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:33,339
kind of suffer a defeat without actually being eliminated, you know, and need to kind of

530
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:36,102
retreat and rest up and recover and remain in play.

531
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:43,918
There was also the introduction of the new hex grid, which increased the number of adjacent

532
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:49,823
playable spaces in the map, and also the restriction of a single unit per hex.

533
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:56,530
So what those four rule changes ultimately did is combine to put a powerful increase

534
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:01,174
in emphasis on laying siege as the primary mechanism of eliminating enemies on the map.

535
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:08,325
As in real life, laying siege is dependent on all of the elements of the siege holding

536
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:13,648
the line, and that is jeopardized when a single unit is damaged and the player finds themselves

537
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,871
tempted to withdraw that unit, because it's so precious, to a safe distance in order to

538
00:33:17,891 --> 00:33:18,511
be able to recover.

539
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:23,793
So the player needs to decide, they need to go through this goal transition choice

540
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:27,014
as to whether they are going to focus on a collection of goals

541
00:33:27,554 --> 00:33:32,156
that are guaranteed to try to increase the survivability of the individual unit

542
00:33:32,656 --> 00:33:37,718
or a collection of goals that are focused on the success of the larger strategic action.

543
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:42,080
Very much consistent with the fantasy of playing strategically.

544
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:48,296
And it's worth noting that those kinds of sacrifices at a granular level are also matched

545
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:52,777
in some games by supporting the player having to take much larger sacrifices.

546
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:57,658
In other words, being willing to lose large swaths of territory ultimately in order to

547
00:33:57,698 --> 00:33:58,599
win the larger war.

548
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:08,641
Now, I mentioned before in Clint's fault tolerance talk how exposure to potential setbacks was

549
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,462
a characteristic of improvisational games.

550
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:18,996
The player is constantly moving back and forth between cooking up plans for their next action

551
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,737
and then executing those plans.

552
00:34:21,617 --> 00:34:26,658
And the game features lots of small sources of friction that combine in order to kick

553
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:31,079
the player out of that execution phase and quickly back into planning and response.

554
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,260
Far Cry 2 provides an interesting case study on how that unfolds in a stealth game, but

555
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,100
it was also an explicit part of the design challenges on Splinter Cell Conviction.

556
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,031
The creator director of that game, Max Bland, who's actually sitting in the front row if

557
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:52,392
you guys want to wave at him, one of his stated goals was to equip the player with multiple

558
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:57,913
ways out of situations, and that led to the establishing of kind of these three gameplay

559
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:02,454
axes with the intention that players can be impeded on one or maybe even two of these

560
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:06,515
axes and still have at least one avenue left for pulling off a clever escape.

561
00:35:07,135 --> 00:35:10,276
So those axes are 3D navigation, infiltration, and combat.

562
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:20,364
And so when we look at the outcome of adding that focus on having ways out and offering

563
00:35:20,504 --> 00:35:24,665
multiple axes of both input and output for the player, what that does is it kicks the

564
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:29,306
player into goal transitions more frequently, and some of those goal transitions exist on

565
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:33,547
top of what we would consider to be the classical stealth loop.

566
00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:38,028
So that extended loop is when the player gets into trouble with the AI.

567
00:35:40,777 --> 00:35:43,359
The new loop was termed Prepare, Execute, and Vanish.

568
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:46,442
And you can see that at each of these stages, Prepare, Execute,

569
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:48,684
and Vanish, we're talking about a specific set of goal

570
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:51,706
transitions that allow the player to first move

571
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:54,749
from an act of reconnaissance, keeping eyes on where

572
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:56,170
the targets are, where the enemies are,

573
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,432
being able to then take action to deal with them,

574
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:01,414
either in an aggressive way or in a more stealth-oriented way,

575
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:04,236
and then ultimately regaining the state

576
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:05,858
of being stealthy or hidden.

577
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:12,527
And the team introduced new mechanics specifically aligned with the PEV game loop.

578
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:16,890
So they let the player mark enemies in order to keep tabs on them as they moved around

579
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,331
the environment, even if they were obscured.

580
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:23,675
It gave them the ability to eliminate those marks if they earned that token through taking

581
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,396
stealth takedowns.

582
00:36:25,136 --> 00:36:29,520
And it also let them see their last known position, giving them insight into the AI's

583
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,643
thinking and planning, and creating opportunities for them to lay ambushes or set traps.

584
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:38,527
It's important to note, and I'll talk about this a bit later on as an important feature

585
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:43,491
of setback generating, that those mechanics were not simply added wholesale, but they

586
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:47,914
were kind of nuanced expansions of existing features of the game that retained that kind

587
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:51,877
of deep, rich interconnectedness with the other mechanics of the game, so that it wasn't

588
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:56,241
going to undermine the player's ability to use all the various tools of stealth, but

589
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:57,742
was designed really to be added onto that.

590
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,955
The general lesson from improvisation is that games where setbacks emerge along multiple

591
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:13,301
axes can also provide players with an opportunity to adapt or adjust their approach along those

592
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:13,942
same axes.

593
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:17,686
And we talk about ways to challenge or impede the player along specific axes, and that gets

594
00:37:17,706 --> 00:37:20,488
into the idea of having orthogonalized ingredients in the game.

595
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:24,132
And in this case, I'm going to talk specifically about orthogonalized enemies.

596
00:37:25,013 --> 00:37:29,715
So Left 4 Dead, for example, uses specific versions of the infected that are designed

597
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:35,337
to exploit the routine moments of vulnerability that bubble up for individual players, often

598
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:39,299
creating moments of jeopardy that can then drive cooperative support.

599
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:42,140
Very much part of the co-op dynamic of that game.

600
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,542
But also Left 4 Dead's AI director creates the right level of unpredictability to the

601
00:37:47,562 --> 00:37:50,683
infected hordes and the appearance of specialized infected.

602
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:54,772
You know, in Gears of War's horde mode,

603
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:57,954
you can kind of imagine the ideal playthrough for this.

604
00:37:58,374 --> 00:38:02,016
It's like the players spend just the right amount of time setting up fortifications.

605
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:06,159
They spend just the right amount of time running around collecting ammo

606
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,700
and picking up guns they think are going to be good.

607
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,802
And they get back into their defensive positions in just the right amount of time

608
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:14,184
to sort of plan their strategy and just before the next wave of enemies attack.

609
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:21,184
And the reality is that the surprise appearance of kind of heavily orthogonalized enemies

610
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:25,948
into that mix typically has the effect of tipping that apple cart over, right?

611
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:30,192
You know, suddenly, okay, our plan didn't account for that particular enemy showing up

612
00:38:30,232 --> 00:38:31,814
and burrowing his way up through our ranks.

613
00:38:32,194 --> 00:38:33,295
And so now we have to deal with that.

614
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,058
And then the aftermath of that creates a bunch of knock-on effects

615
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:39,141
that players will then spend the next several waves trying to recover from.

616
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:48,053
So to go back to our stealth example, on the follow-up to Conviction, Splinter Cell Blacklist,

617
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:52,859
the team continued to build on gameplay axes that were established on Conviction, and the

618
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:57,785
design lead, Laurent Malville, hit on this idea of using specialized archetypes in order

619
00:38:57,805 --> 00:39:01,290
to inhibit the player's freedom of action on specific combinations of axes.

620
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:07,133
And it's interesting, it's uniquely challenging to use this kind of solution on a realistic

621
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:11,856
game like Splinter Cell because unlike Gears or Left 4 Dead, the differentiation can't

622
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,817
be exaggerated to the point of fantasy.

623
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:18,179
The variations on the gameplay abilities of the AI and even their appearance and their

624
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,341
silhouette has to remain credible within a real world context.

625
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:30,568
So the specific archetypes that they came up with were, you know, a very armor-centric heavy that would challenge the player on navigation and combat.

626
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:34,731
A couple of different units, actually, that would inhibit the player on infiltration and combat.

627
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:38,074
One of which was a dog, which had some limitations, because he was a dog.

628
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:44,779
He couldn't really communicate tactically with the humans and had this kind of imprecise smell mechanic for fighting the player.

629
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,163
But that was coupled with a corresponding human, an enemy to commando, that...

630
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:52,723
had a little more on the ball in terms of being able to see in the dark and move quickly.

631
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:58,645
A drone operator that would interfere actively with the player's technology and with their

632
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:02,425
goggles and their ability to move around in the dark, as well as delivering autonomous

633
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:05,486
drones that could challenge the player along 3D navigational paths.

634
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:09,867
And then ultimately kind of the super archetype, the sniper, which only appears about halfway

635
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,887
through the game, that can actually challenge the player on all three axes.

636
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,071
With that in mind, what's interesting then is to go back and revisit that extended

637
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:21,592
progression of goal transitions that we associate with

638
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:23,572
classical stealth plus prepare,

639
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:24,653
execute, and vanish.

640
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:28,394
And you can kind of see where each of these archetypes motivates the player

641
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:29,735
to switch their focus.

642
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:36,369
So with the Heavy, you can see where the Heavy is, the Heavy's focus on navigation and combat

643
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:41,056
is forcing goal switches there between the kind of exploration and traversal stages and

644
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:47,284
realignment and then later on between, within the execution phase of the prepare-execute-vanish

645
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:47,445
loop.

646
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:53,356
You can look at the dog and see where the dog's still blocking the player on combat,

647
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:56,496
in addition also blocking the player on the infiltration level.

648
00:40:56,536 --> 00:41:00,957
So this is pushing the player to have to move into a recon phase, trying to understand a

649
00:41:01,077 --> 00:41:04,978
bit better the lay of the land and their situational awareness to understand where the dog's coming

650
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:06,819
from and what they're going to be able to do to get away from them.

651
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,600
And then ultimately the sniper hitting them on all three, so you can see where the problem

652
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,420
potentially lies with that particular archetype.

653
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,061
Alright, so that's them on paper.

654
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:20,765
You don't typically deal with them in a vacuum.

655
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,567
They're almost always presented in combination

656
00:41:23,627 --> 00:41:25,448
with kind of the generic grunt AI.

657
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:28,090
So it's interesting to look at what happens

658
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,791
in the kind of more typical scenario,

659
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:31,272
representative scenario.

660
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:33,273
You know, the player enters the sort of

661
00:41:33,754 --> 00:41:36,435
kind of sniff radius, the olfactory radius of the dog.

662
00:41:37,136 --> 00:41:39,097
The dog raises a bit of a fuss.

663
00:41:39,778 --> 00:41:41,799
The human AI treat that as a bit of a disturbance,

664
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:43,100
same as like a broken light bulb

665
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,541
or a door that shouldn't have been left open.

666
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:49,149
And eventually the dog begins undertaking a kind of random walk that will

667
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:52,631
deterministically lead him to the player if the player doesn't do something about it.

668
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:57,632
And so the kind of robust move in this case is to take advantage of the fact that the dog isn't really

669
00:41:57,672 --> 00:42:02,334
challenging the player on 3D navigation and use that as the tool for staging an escape.

670
00:42:03,114 --> 00:42:06,516
But sometimes it doesn't work out and the dog pulls the player out from cover

671
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:10,337
and the entire map gets alerted and they find themselves exposed.

672
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:12,458
Now...

673
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:20,100
In the case of the sniper, you have an archetype that can engage the player at about 150% the

674
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,083
distance of the other AI and is able to see in the dark using the laser on their rifle.

675
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:27,666
And so that can create immediate problems for the player if they're relying solely on

676
00:42:27,706 --> 00:42:29,548
darkness as a way of staying hidden.

677
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:35,473
It can also create problems if the player is relying on using their 3D navigation in

678
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:39,036
order to try to stay away from the usual prying eyes of the AI because the sniper is usually

679
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:39,876
in a position to see them.

680
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:45,887
And often if the player just simply gets involved in a normal run-of-the-mill altercation with one of the other AI,

681
00:42:45,907 --> 00:42:49,469
then the sniper is in a position to put fire on them very effectively right away.

682
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:54,710
Okay, so that's, you can start to see right away where that becomes a pretty substantial force multiplier.

683
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,151
So, here's the really scary prospect.

684
00:42:59,652 --> 00:43:01,072
Dog x Sniper.

685
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:05,074
And so in this scenario,

686
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:10,615
the worst case scenario is that the dog pulls the player out from cover and the player gets shot in the head.

687
00:43:13,115 --> 00:43:15,218
But just as likely to happen is that the player,

688
00:43:15,378 --> 00:43:16,980
aware of the fact that there's a dog around

689
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,702
and knowing that they need to move quickly

690
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:19,903
in order to avoid that scenario,

691
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:22,546
simply runs around the corner and gets shot in the head.

692
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:26,550
So, just an important lesson there.

693
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:29,654
And so I'm gonna try to wrap things up

694
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,296
by talking about the insights that come out of that.

695
00:43:32,274 --> 00:43:33,734
out of all of the things that we've just talked about.

696
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:36,275
The first is that when we use

697
00:43:36,955 --> 00:43:40,936
orthogonalization and these kind of defined game axes as a tool

698
00:43:41,276 --> 00:43:41,716
for both

699
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:45,097
putting friction on the player but also providing the player

700
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,077
with channels

701
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,858
for surviving and recovering from the setback,

702
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:51,138
it's very important that those axes

703
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,459
be agnostic

704
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:56,820
to all of the various scenarios and specialization forces that we normally

705
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,620
inflict on the player.

706
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,080
It doesn't do you any good

707
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:01,541
to have three axes.

708
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:06,344
if the player is only ever interested in using one of them at any given time,

709
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:11,887
or if the level design of the game blocks the player from using all but one of them at any given time,

710
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,969
that's not going to yield a setback, that's just going to yield frustration.

711
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,491
So it was important that, you know, it's important that in a stealth game,

712
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:22,774
3D navigation, infiltration, combat, however you want to define those axes,

713
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:27,397
are of interest to a player regardless of whether they're a hyper-traditional stealth player

714
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:30,299
or somebody who's a little more action-oriented.

715
00:44:32,643 --> 00:44:36,947
The other lesson, which should have been fairly evident from the example that I used, admittedly

716
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:41,230
it's a data point of one, but I think it's fairly compelling, is that second order combinations

717
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:46,333
of setback ingredients can often generate frustration very, very quickly.

718
00:44:46,673 --> 00:44:48,935
And so they have to be used with a great deal of care.

719
00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:58,999
observation that we made was that ultimately if you take a classical stealth model and

720
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:05,602
then give the player tools for surviving altercations and continuing play and being able to extend

721
00:45:05,642 --> 00:45:11,504
that experience into other areas, there is a general tendency for the game to push very

722
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:16,606
very quickly into kind of arranged encounters with the AI. And if that's not what you want,

723
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:20,956
if you don't want the game to be telling the player,

724
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:22,778
great, you're playing a shooter now,

725
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,121
then there needs to be some specific design

726
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:26,022
around how to prevent that.

727
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:27,204
And I have some thoughts on it,

728
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,005
which I'll get to in a second.

729
00:45:29,495 --> 00:45:31,858
And then ultimately there's the danger of additional breadth.

730
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:37,244
We talked about the idea that you need to have mechanics that will help support these

731
00:45:37,304 --> 00:45:42,329
extended loops of play, so that players feel like they have tools in order to help take

732
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:45,753
advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by these setbacks and be able to feel

733
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:48,936
clever and use those opportunities to come up with a more successful outcome.

734
00:45:50,571 --> 00:45:53,713
all of those features still need to be richly interconnected

735
00:45:54,214 --> 00:45:56,816
with all of the other mechanics the player is using the rest of the time.

736
00:45:57,456 --> 00:46:00,779
Otherwise you end up with a shallow mess that the player somehow has to learn and

737
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,460
then interpret and decide how to use

738
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,762
instead of a real opportunity

739
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:07,144
to develop ongoing mastery in the game.

740
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:13,349
So it's important that those features be applied judiciously

741
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,710
and not in a giant mess of new

742
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:16,631
new gack.

743
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:25,270
I haven't had a visual for a while. My favorite moment in Far Cry 3 was when I'd get harassed

744
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:33,715
by cassowaries. Cassowaries suck. And actually it doesn't matter if it was a cassowary or

745
00:46:33,735 --> 00:46:37,977
a cow. Actually getting attacked by a tiger isn't the most exciting thing that happens

746
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:41,799
to you in Far Cry 3. It's when you're in the middle of lining up a target through your

747
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:45,301
sniper scope. You're about to take out an outpost and all of a sudden you get head butted

748
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:46,841
by a cow until you fall off a cliff.

749
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:52,979
cliffs again. It's the theme, I guess. So, but there's a very important lesson to be

750
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:57,363
learned there, right? Like, for most of the rest of the game, you're getting into long-range

751
00:46:57,443 --> 00:47:03,009
altercations with enemies that fall back behind cover, take out a gun, and shoot at you. I

752
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:08,415
have never been shot at in my entire life, knock on wood, right? I have, however, been

753
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:09,055
chased by a dog.

754
00:47:10,224 --> 00:47:11,506
menaced by a schoolyard bully,

755
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:15,229
had a drunk take a swing at me in a bar. I know what it feels like

756
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,534
to be menaced by somebody who's coming after me at close quarters with

757
00:47:19,594 --> 00:47:20,855
intent to do bodily harm.

758
00:47:22,076 --> 00:47:24,439
Most of us know that feeling, unfortunately.

759
00:47:25,582 --> 00:47:29,104
And the reality is that it's super visceral. It's hardwired into our system.

760
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:34,507
We respond in a really emphatic, atavistic kind of way when we're menaced in that fashion,

761
00:47:34,747 --> 00:47:35,988
because it's part of our wiring.

762
00:47:36,628 --> 00:47:38,609
And I think what's interesting, and it's an interesting challenge,

763
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:42,492
and it's something that I have not seen executed especially well in games,

764
00:47:42,852 --> 00:47:46,514
but I think it's a clue that points the way forward,

765
00:47:46,814 --> 00:47:51,157
particularly with stealth games, if we want to try to support greater setbacks and richer setbacks.

766
00:47:51,837 --> 00:47:55,719
is to try to encourage encounters that are like that.

767
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:58,541
Try to encourage, you know, try to invest in AI

768
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:01,142
and invest in enemies that want to move in

769
00:48:01,162 --> 00:48:02,743
for close quarter encounters with a player

770
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:03,963
and menace us in that fashion.

771
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,685
You know, but that means being willing to step away

772
00:48:06,765 --> 00:48:08,185
from the model that we use all the time

773
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:10,006
when we're making kind of like modern day

774
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:12,668
sort of geopolitical military style games,

775
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:14,389
which is the guy pulls out a gun and shoots at you

776
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:16,069
because you know, everybody's got a gun.

777
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:20,132
So I think that's an interesting, it raises an interesting question and it's an interesting

778
00:48:20,173 --> 00:48:22,434
opportunity that I'd like to see more people take advantage of.

779
00:48:23,976 --> 00:48:25,497
So as a quick recap, I only have two points.

780
00:48:26,538 --> 00:48:31,582
The first is, you want setbacks in your game, you need to figure out how to describe your

781
00:48:31,602 --> 00:48:33,063
game in terms of goal transitions.

782
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:37,667
It doesn't matter what taxonomy of goals you like or choose to use, what flavor you want

783
00:48:37,687 --> 00:48:41,830
to go with, you just need to have a set, and you need to be able to look at your game and

784
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,173
kind of objectively evaluate what's going on in the game that way.

785
00:48:46,514 --> 00:48:49,036
and the other part of it is once you started doing that

786
00:48:49,577 --> 00:48:53,060
you're looking for specific setbacks that are going to keep the player in the sweet spot

787
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,282
they can't just be little bumps in the road that they're not going to even notice

788
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,444
and they're also not going to make them want to rage quit

789
00:48:58,965 --> 00:48:59,385
and that's it

790
00:49:00,026 --> 00:49:00,626
that's how it works

791
00:49:11,976 --> 00:49:14,158
we have a lot of time for questions if anybody wants to ask any

792
00:49:17,473 --> 00:49:21,837
Yo. Hi. Very interesting talk and it's great. A lot of it

793
00:49:21,997 --> 00:49:26,180
seems to relate very strongly to strategy games which I work on

794
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,181
as well which is very interesting to see the

795
00:49:28,221 --> 00:49:33,125
correlations. I think strategy games probably have been

796
00:49:33,165 --> 00:49:36,067
supporting and dealing with setbacks as a thing, as a

797
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:41,171
dynamic longer than anybody else has. So it's not surprising. I

798
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:43,513
think there's still lessons to be learned from looking at a lot

799
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:46,355
of strategy games. So one thing I'm curious about though is

800
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:53,805
You started out describing sort of the danger or the fall, the

801
00:49:53,845 --> 00:49:57,249
bad part about having binary fail conditions in that you're

802
00:49:57,269 --> 00:50:01,133
basically costing your player's time, which isn't intrinsic to

803
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:03,075
the game, so it's kind of a frustration point.

804
00:50:04,763 --> 00:50:06,645
The setbacks you described are all super interesting,

805
00:50:07,325 --> 00:50:09,707
but they seem to all just be steps along the way

806
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:12,068
to a still binary fail condition.

807
00:50:12,128 --> 00:50:13,709
So you're still gonna, yeah.

808
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:16,551
So I'm curious as to whether you have any insight

809
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:20,114
into how you can get those setbacks to expand beyond that

810
00:50:20,154 --> 00:50:22,155
into maybe player motivations that exist

811
00:50:22,275 --> 00:50:23,816
outside of just straight up failure

812
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:26,138
so that you can set your player back

813
00:50:26,638 --> 00:50:28,820
without the setback just being a step towards

814
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,321
fail and then reset.

815
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:30,701
Right.

816
00:50:31,081 --> 00:50:35,323
So, I think it's a super good question, and to be honest, I mean, one of the things I'm

817
00:50:35,363 --> 00:50:40,725
acutely aware of, and I became aware of it as soon as I started looking at the fact that

818
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:46,607
there was this spectrum between, or dynamic range between rage quit and I didn't even

819
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:51,029
notice anything happened, and the problem is as soon as those are the things that are

820
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:57,511
bracketing the output of the game, the reality is that you are probably, at the end of the

821
00:50:57,531 --> 00:50:59,312
day, going to have to fall back on some kind.

822
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:02,917
of binary failure state in order to have any kind of stakes.

823
00:51:03,498 --> 00:51:07,644
Now, that's looking at it through the lens of someone who's been working on probably

824
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,568
triple A games that are like, you know, you shoot at people and they shoot back at you

825
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:11,409
and you die, etc.

826
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:13,993
So I fully acknowledge that, you know.

827
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:22,935
probably a more five-dimensional thinking about that would yield something that can stay completely within the game state and preserve the game state forever and allow you to continue, you know,

828
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:27,976
on infinitum without ever having to get popped out of it. And I think there's lots of examples of games out there that do it.

829
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:31,396
I'm just not summoning them in the middle of this talk very well.

830
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:42,978
But yeah, you're absolutely correct. At the end of the day, this is a—it's a buffer. It's a kind of a—a kind of a firewall against the ultimate reality, which is at some point the player's gonna—

831
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,942
Interrupt what they're doing and have to reload and lose some time

832
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:52,027
We're just trying to make make that happen less often and less easily and not as early I guess

833
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:53,909
Cool. Awesome. Thanks. Thanks

834
00:51:55,875 --> 00:52:00,016
You mentioned a couple consequences for failure,

835
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:04,337
such as you just go to a loading screen, come back,

836
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:09,558
and then all the enemies are the same, or you kind of go,

837
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,338
it makes you do like a mini game or something.

838
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:14,839
That just reminded me of Prey.

839
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:15,979
I don't know if you ever played that.

840
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,380
That game was actually quite an inspiration for me,

841
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,461
because I firmly believe that going into a loading screen

842
00:52:23,561 --> 00:52:25,602
is very destructive to the player's immersion.

843
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:26,202
Yeah.

844
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:34,508
And so I was, but I know some people complain about Prey in particular that it didn't provide

845
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:36,289
enough of a consequence for failure.

846
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:40,512
That it didn't feel like they were failing and therefore wasn't satisfying.

847
00:52:41,473 --> 00:52:42,274
What are your thoughts on that?

848
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:43,635
Yeah, I mean it's funny.

849
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:49,319
Prey was actually one of the examples that I had when I was originally working on this

850
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,723
talk for looking at the kind of...

851
00:52:56,233 --> 00:53:01,716
sort of Max Payne 3, Borderlands, SSX, Forza style model, where you're kind of

852
00:53:01,796 --> 00:53:07,198
introducing a mode change, or kind of an alternate reality mode to the game that

853
00:53:07,238 --> 00:53:10,879
kicks in. I mean, Prey literally does that. I mean, it says literally, you're going

854
00:53:10,919 --> 00:53:13,720
into another universe as a result of failure, and you get through that and

855
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,061
come out the other side of it. I mean, I think it's interesting, but I think, I

856
00:53:17,101 --> 00:53:20,963
think maybe that also provides a little bit of a hint to why some people

857
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:22,483
grappled with it. It's like...

858
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:26,318
modifying the context of the game so radically

859
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,782
that it changes the fundamental reality of the fundamental metaphor of what you're going

860
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:30,083
through

861
00:53:30,764 --> 00:53:32,265
is sometimes a risky thing to do

862
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:34,808
you know and it's not like it's not like praise

863
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:40,882
initial premise was particularly accessible in the first place.

864
00:53:40,982 --> 00:53:45,123
I mean, you were abducted by aliens in the first five minutes of the game, right?

865
00:53:45,363 --> 00:53:48,724
And you're occupying a spacecraft that has portals that let you jump through.

866
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,845
So there's a lot of strange things going on in the normal reality of that game,

867
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:56,086
and then kind of layering on this additional sort of spirit world on top of that,

868
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:58,566
I think was just a hard thing for some people to wrap their heads around.

869
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:00,847
But I don't think the concept is intrinsically flawed.

870
00:54:01,187 --> 00:54:03,907
I just think that there's ways of establishing context for it

871
00:54:03,927 --> 00:54:05,628
that probably would have made it easier for people to...

872
00:54:05,728 --> 00:54:06,389
read and understand.
